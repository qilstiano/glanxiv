    "abstract": "Helioseismic signatures of dynamo waves have recently been discovered in\nvariations of the solar differential rotation, offering valuable insights into\nthe type of dynamo mechanism operating in the solar convection zone. To\ncharacterize these variations, we analyze p-mode frequency-splitting data\nestimated using time intervals of various lengths to enhance the\nsignal-to-noise ratio in inversions of zonal flows. We introduce a novel\ntime-dependent inversion method that inherently smooths the solution over time,\neliminating the need for separate post-processing smoothing. By applying this\napproach to observational data from the SOHO Michelson Doppler Imager, SDO\nHelioseismic Magnetic Imager, and Global Oscillation Network Group, we identify\nsimilar dynamo wave patterns in both the zonal acceleration and the zonal flow\nthroughout the entire convection zone. Our analysis shows that while using\nlonger time series smooths out temporal variations, the fundamental features\nobserved in the short time series (i.e. 72-day long) persist when inverting\ndatasets covering different time periods. These findings reinforce earlier\ndetections and offer further validation of solar dynamo models. We additionally\ninvestigate the dimensionless radial gradient of rotation. Its value is close\nto -1 and increases in the deeper layers, remaining nearly constant from the\nequator to mid-latitudes within the depth range of 13 to 35 Mm below the\nsurface; the results at high latitudes remain somewhat inconclusive. The\nvariation of this quantity displays a torsional oscillation-like pattern,\nalbeit with certain differences.",

The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such\nas holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent\ndevelopments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on\nconstitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation\nand evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use\ndata from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train\noperator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets),\nwhich learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional\nvectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for\npredicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying\ngeometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height\nwithout active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and\nhole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The\nmodels are trained using geometric inputs in the branch network and\nspatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion\nDeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate\npredictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven scenarios\ninvolving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging.

Then, we selectively insert the\npersonalized subject through a segmentation-driven image-to-image (Img2Img)\npipeline that uses the trained LoRA weights.This framework isolates the subject\nencoding from the overall composition, thus preserving SDXL's broader\ngenerative capabilities while integrating the new subject in a high-fidelity\nmanner. Our method achieves a DINO similarity score of 0.789 on SDXL,\noutperforming existing personalized text-to-image approaches.",

This work focuses on temporal networks, a central paradigm\nwithin DNA, as an effective approach for modelling time-resolved changes in\nbiological systems. While DNA has gained traction in domains like social and\ncommunication sciences, its integration in biology has been more gradual,\nhindered by data limitations and the need for domain-specific adaptations.\nAimed at supporting researchers, particularly those new to the field, the\nreview offers an integrative overview of the diverse and multidisciplinary\nlandscape of DNA, with a focus on temporal networks in systems biology.

It is shown that the\nconvex hull of these matrices forms the intersection of two special generalized\npolymatroids. This implies $\\unicode{x2013}$ in a more general form\n$\\unicode{x2013}$ that the linear inequality system given by Behrend and Knight\n(2007) and by Striker (2007, 2009) for describing the polytope of alternating\nsign matrices is totally dual integral (TDI), confirming a recent conjecture of\nEdmonds (2024, 2025). By relying on the polymatroidal approach, we derive a\ncharacterization for the existence of prefix-bounded matrices meeting lower and\nupper bounds on their entries. Furthermore, we point out that the constraint\nmatrix of the linear system describing the convex hull of PBMs, in particular\nASMs, is a network matrix. This implies that (a) standard network-flow\ntechniques can be used to manage algorithmically optimization and structural\nresults on PBMs obtained via g-polymatroids, (b) the linear system is actually\nbox-TDI, and (c) the convex hull of PBMs admits a sharpened form of the integer\nCarath\\'eodory property, in particular, the integer decomposition property.\nThis latter feature makes it possible to confirm an extended form of an elegant\nconjecture of Brualdi and Dahl (2023) on the decomposability of a so-called\n$k$-regular alternating sign matrix as the sum of $k$ pattern-disjoint ASMs.",

To mitigate these challenges, in C2-STi, we design 1) a\ndistance-aware local structural modulation module to adaptively capture\ncross-slice deformations and enhance positional correlations between ST slices,\n2) a pyramid gene co-expression correlation module to capture multi-scale\nbiological associations among genes, and 3) a cross-modal alignment module that\nintegrates the ST-paired hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images to filter\nand align the essential cellular features across ST and H\\&E images. Extensive\nexperiments on the public dataset demonstrate our superiority over\nstate-of-the-art approaches on both single-slice and multi-slice ST\ninterpolation.

    "abstract": "The 1408 CE \"guest star\" recorded in Chinese historical texts presents a\ncompelling case for identifying a historical stellar transient. While previous\nstudies debated its nature as a meteor, comet, or nova, we re-evaluate the\nevent using original Ming Dynasty records, including a newly found memorial\nfrom the imperial court. The object, described as stationary for over ten days,\nyellow, and luminous (resembling a \"Zhou Bo virtue star\"), is inconsistent with\ncometary behavior. Positional analysis locates it near the Niandao asterism\n(modern Cygnus-Vulpecula region) within the Milky Way, with a derived\nbrightness of -4 to 0 mag. Light-curve stability over ten days and color\ndescriptions align with a slow nova or a supernova. We cross-correlated the\nhistorical coordinates with modern catalogs and found a few possible\ncounterparts. Among them, CK Vul - a luminous red nova remnant from 1670 to\n1672 - is the most interesting candidate. Could its progenitor system have\nexperienced a precursor classical nova eruption circa 1408 prior to the merger\n~200 years later? We also examine cataclysmic variables and planetary nebulae\nwithin the 100 square-degree search field, though most lack sufficient\nbrightness or age characteristics. This study emphasizes the value of\nintegrating detailed historical records with contemporary astrophysical data to\nresolve long-standing controversies over ancient transients. The 1408 event\nlikely represents a rare, well-documented nova, offering insights into\npre-modern stellar phenomena and their modern counterparts.",

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce Graph Repetition Invariance (GRIN), a novel method to learn polymer\nrepresentations that are invariant to the number of repeating units in their\ngraph representations. GRIN integrates a graph-based maximum spanning tree\nalignment with repeat-unit augmentation to ensure structural consistency. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees for repetition-invariance from both model and\ndata perspectives, demonstrating that three repeating units are the minimal\naugmentation required for optimal invariant representation learning.

We first provide a\ncentralized linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based control and topology co-design\noptimization of the rigid body networks with a formal mesh stability guarantee.\nThen, these centralized mesh stability constraints are made decentralized by a\nproposed alternative set of sufficient conditions. Using these decentralized\nmesh stability constraints and Sylvester's criterion-based decentralization\ntechniques, the said centralized LMI problem is equivalently broken down into a\nset of smaller decentralized LMI problems that can be solved at each rigid\nbody, enabling flexible merging/splitting of rigid bodies.

Discretizing the associated partial\ndifferential equations with Galerkin methods can result in spurious\nnonpositivity of solutions. We observe that these methods amount to performing\nstatistical inference using the method of moments (MoM) and that the loss of\npositivity arises from MoM's susceptibility to producing estimates inconsistent\nwith the observed data. We overcome this problem by replacing MoM with maximum\nlikelihood estimation, introducing $\\textit{maximum likelihood discretization}\n$(MLD). In the continuous limit, MLD simplifies to the Fisher-Rao Galerkin\n(FRG) semidiscretization, which replaces the $L^2$ inner product in Galerkin\nprojection with the Fisher-Rao metric of probability distributions.

Another novel aspect of our work is the evaluation\nof the security implications of the transpilation process, i.e., whether\npotential vulnerabilities in the original C code have been properly addressed\nin the translated Rust code. We experimentally evaluated SafeTrans with six\nleading LLMs and a set of 2,653 C programs accompanied by comprehensive unit\ntests, which were used for validating the correctness of the translated code.\nOur results show that our iterative repair strategy improves the rate of\nsuccessful translations from 54% to 80% for the best-performing LLM (GPT-4o),\nand that all types of identified vulnerabilities in the original C code are\neffectively mitigated in the translated Rust code.",

This study investigates the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in\nshaping cosmic radiation backgrounds--the cosmic X-ray background (CXB), the\nLyman-Werner background (LWB), and the cosmic radio background (CRB)--and\nevaluates their viability as dark matter (DM) candidates based on observational\nconstraints and theoretical limits. Methods. PBH accretion is modelled using\nanalytical frameworks that include electron advection-dominated accretion flows\n(eADAF), standard advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAF), luminous hot\naccretion flows (LHAF), and thin disks. Emission from PBHs in both dark matter\nhalos and the intergalactic medium (IGM) is computed. We assess the impact of\nvariations in model assumptions, such as halo gas density profiles, gas\nvelocities, and emission models. The results are compared with observational\nlimits and theoretical thresholds to constrain the PBH fraction as DM for\nmasses between 1 and 100 solar masses Results. PBHs may contribute up to 99,\n93, 80, and 91 per cent of the unresolved soft X-ray background for masses of\n1, 10, 33, and 100 solar masses, respectively, and about 33-39 per cent of the\nhard X-ray background. These contributions limit the PBH DM fraction to 7e-3,\n6e-4, 6e-4, and 7e-4, respectively, in our baseline model. These constraints\nare consistent with those from the LWB, ensuring molecular cooling and early\nstar formation are preserved. However, explaining the radio background excess\nand the EDGES signal would require PBH fractions well above these limits. For 1\nsolar mass, excluding ADAF subregimes relaxes the constraint to 3e-2,\nhighlighting the sensitivity to accretion physics. Variations in model\nassumptions introduce only minor differences in the predicted backgrounds.",

How is this possible?\nBiological evidence indicates that motor control of biological systems is\nachieved by a modular organization of motor primitives, which are fundamental\nbuilding blocks of motor behavior. Inspired by neuro-motor control research,\nthe idea of using simpler building blocks has been successfully used in\nrobotics. Nevertheless, a comprehensive formulation of modularity for robot\ncontrol remains to be established. In this paper, we introduce a modular\nframework for robot control using motor primitives. We present two essential\nrequirements to achieve modular robot control: independence of modules and\nclosure of stability. We describe key control modules and demonstrate that a\nwide range of complex robotic behaviors can be generated from this small set of\nmodules and their combinations. The presented modular control framework\ndemonstrates several beneficial properties for robot control, including\ntask-space control without solving Inverse Kinematics, addressing the problems\nof kinematic singularity and kinematic redundancy, and preserving passivity for\ncontact and physical interactions. Further advantages include exploiting\nkinematic singularity to maintain high external load with low torque\ncompensation, as well as controlling the robot beyond its end-effector,\nextending even to external objects. Both simulation and actual robot\nexperiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of our modular\nframework.

To account for noisy interconnects, we model the qubits in the\ncolor code as being subject to a bit-flip noise channel, where the qubits on\nthe boundary (seam) between patches experience elevated noise compared to those\nin the bulk. We investigate the error threshold of the distributed color code\nunder such asymmetric noise conditions by employing two decoders: a\ntensor-network-based decoder and a recently introduced concatenated Minimum\nWeight Perfect Matching (MWPM) algorithm. Our simulations demonstrate that\nelevated noise on seam qubits leads to a slight reduction in threshold for the\ntensor-network decoder, whereas the concatenated MWPM decoder shows no\nsignificant change in the error threshold, underscoring its effectiveness under\nasymmetric noise conditions.

We conducted extensive experiments on both on-road and\noff-road datasets, demonstrating that our GaussianFormer3D achieves high\nprediction accuracy that is comparable to state-of-the-art multi-modal\nfusion-based methods with reduced memory consumption and improved efficiency.",

As shown in\nthis Letter, entanglement is also a valuable resource for the coherent control\nof the large class of bimolecular chemical reactions. We introduce an\nentanglement-enhanced coherent control scheme, in which the initial preparation\nof the superposition state is divided into two steps: the first entangles the\nreactants, and the second is responsible for coherent control. This approach\ncan overcome the limitations of traditional coherent control of scattering\ncaused by non-interfering pathways, known as satellite terms. By tuning the\namount of entanglement between reactants, the visibility of coherent control in\nchemical reactions can be modulated and optimized. Significantly, there exists\nan optimal amount of entanglement, which ensures complete indistinguishability\nof the reaction pathways, maximizing the extent of control. This\nentanglement-enhanced coherent control scheme is computationally illustrated\nusing the ultracold KRb + KRb reaction, where a perfect control over the parity\nof the product rotational states is achieved.",

Our\nunderstanding of these issues has been significantly improved by the\nintroduction of the notion of string attractor [Kempa and Prezza, STOC 2018]\nand by the results showing the relationship between attractors and other\nmeasures of compressibility.\n  When the input data are structured in a non-linear way, as in two-dimensional\nstrings, inherent redundancy often offers an even richer source for\ncompression. However, systematic studies on repetitiveness measures for\ntwo-dimensional strings are still scarce. In this paper we extend to two or\nmore dimensions the main measures of complexity introduced for one-dimensional\nstrings. We distinguish between the measures $\\delta$ and $\\gamma$, defined in\nterms of the substrings of the input, and the measures $g$, $g_{rl}$, and $b$,\nwhich are based on copy-paste mechanisms. We study the properties and mutual\nrelationships between these two classes and we show that the two classes become\nincomparable for $d$-dimensional inputs as soon as $d\\geq 2$. Moreover, we show\nthat our grammar-based representation of a $d$-dimensional string of size $N$\nenables direct access to any symbol in $O(\\log N)$ time.\n  We also compare our measures for two-dimensional strings with the 2D Block\nTree data structure [Brisaboa et al., Computer J., 2024] and provide some\ninsights for the design of future effective two-dimensional compressors.",

This task becomes particularly challenging with increasing user\nmobility. In this paper, we focus on an uplink scenario in which a massive MIMO\nbase station serves multiple high-mobility users. We leverage variational\nBayesian(VB) inference for joint channel estimation and data detection(JED),\ntailored for time-varying channels. In particular, we use the VB framework to\nprovide approximations of the true posterior distributions. To cover more\nreal-world scenarios, we assume the time correlation coefficients associated\nwith the channels are unknown. Our simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our\nproposed VB-based approach in tracking these unknown time correlation\ncoefficients. We present two processing strategies within the VB framework:\nonline and block processing strategies. The online strategy offers a\nlow-complexity solution for a given time slot, requiring only the knowledge of\nthe parameters/statistics within that time slot.

    "abstract": "Efficient and accurate multi-organ segmentation from abdominal CT volumes is\na fundamental challenge in medical image analysis. Existing 3D segmentation\napproaches are computationally and memory intensive, often processing entire\nvolumes that contain many anatomically irrelevant slices. Meanwhile, 2D methods\nsuffer from class imbalance and lack cross-view contextual awareness. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel, anatomically-aware slice\nselector pipeline that reduces input volume prior to segmentation. Our unified\nframework introduces a vision-language model (VLM) for cross-view organ\npresence detection using fused tri-slice (2.5D) representations from axial,\nsagittal, and coronal planes. Our proposed model acts as an \"expert\" in\nanatomical localization, reasoning over multi-view representations to\nselectively retain slices with high structural relevance. This enables\nspatially consistent filtering across orientations while preserving contextual\ncues. More importantly, since standard segmentation metrics such as Dice or IoU\nfail to measure the spatial precision of such slice selection, we introduce a\nnovel metric, Slice Localization Concordance (SLC), which jointly captures\nanatomical coverage and spatial alignment with organ-centric reference slices.\nUnlike segmentation-specific metrics, SLC provides a model-agnostic evaluation\nof localization fidelity. Our model offers substantial improvement gains\nagainst several baselines across all organs, demonstrating both accurate and\nreliable organ-focused slice filtering. These results show that our method\nenables efficient and spatially consistent organ filtering, thereby\nsignificantly reducing downstream segmentation cost while maintaining high\nanatomical fidelity.",

Our method targets unconstrained settings, including cases where\nclose-up views of the subject's eyes are unavailable, such as when the subject\nis distant or facing away. Previous approaches typically rely on either 2D\nappearance alone or incorporate limited spatial cues using depth maps in the\nnon-learnable post-processing step. Estimating 3D gaze direction from 2D\nobservations in these scenarios is challenging; variations in subject pose,\nscene layout, and gaze direction, combined with differing camera poses, yield\ndiverse 2D appearances and 3D gaze directions even when targeting the same 3D\nscene. To address this issue, we propose GA3CE: Gaze-Aware 3D Context Encoding.\nOur method represents subject and scene using 3D poses and object positions,\ntreating them as 3D context to learn spatial relationships in 3D space.\nInspired by human vision, we align this context in an egocentric space,\nsignificantly reducing spatial complexity. Furthermore, we propose D$^3$\n(direction-distance-decomposed) positional encoding to better capture the\nspatial relationship between 3D context and gaze direction in direction and\ndistance space.

Yet, no\ntheory-grounded benchmark exists to systematically evaluate such failures. In\nthis paper, we introduce the Hidden Profile paradigm from social psychology as\na diagnostic testbed for multi-agent LLM systems. By distributing critical\ninformation asymmetrically across agents, the paradigm reveals how inter-agent\ndynamics support or hinder collective reasoning. We first formalize the\nparadigm for multi-agent decision-making under distributed knowledge and\ninstantiate it as a benchmark with nine tasks spanning diverse scenarios,\nincluding adaptations from prior human studies. We then conduct experiments\nwith GPT-4.1 and five other leading LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced\nvariants, showing that multi-agent systems across all models fail to match the\naccuracy of single agents given complete information. While agents' collective\nperformance is broadly comparable to that of human groups, nuanced behavioral\ndifferences emerge, such as increased sensitivity to social desirability.\nFinally, we demonstrate the paradigm's diagnostic utility by exploring a\ncooperation-contradiction trade-off in multi-agent LLM systems. We find that\nwhile cooperative agents are prone to over-coordination in collective settings,\nincreased contradiction impairs group convergence. This work contributes a\nreproducible framework for evaluating multi-agent LLM systems and motivates\nfuture research on artificial collective intelligence and human-AI interaction.",

These fields transversely confine electron motion\nand induce betatron oscillations. The net energy gain is strongly influenced by\nthe interplay between two frequencies: the betatron frequency and the frequency\nof laser field oscillations experienced by the electron. Prior work has shown\nthat energy gain is enabled by a resonance between the betatron oscillations\nand the oscillations of the laser field. In particular, higher-order resonances\noccur when the laser field completes multiple cycles during one betatron\noscillation, allowing additional regimes of energy transfer beyond the\nfundamental (betatron) resonance. In this work, we demonstrate that such\nresonances become particularly effective when the laser's phase velocity is\nsuperluminal. Although the two frequencies generally evolve differently with\nincreasing electron energy, which leads to detuning, a superluminal phase\nvelocity introduces a non-monotonic frequency ratio with a global minimum. This\nminimum allows sustained frequency matching over a broad energy range, thereby\nenabling enhanced energy gain. As the phase velocity increases, the betatron\nresonance becomes ineffective due to premature frequency detuning. At the same\ntime, higher-order resonances become increasingly effective, emerging as the\ndominant mechanisms for enhanced energy gain in this regime of direct laser\nacceleration.",

Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally\nunexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and\nmuch-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in\nprinciple, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold\ncompared to existing results.

It is well known that the dual of the OTP are\nadvantageous as it has much less variables than the primary problem.

A first batch of seven 'EIC HRPPDs' was manufactured\nin early 2024. These HRPPDs are DC-coupled photosensors based on Micro-Channel\nPlates (MCPs) that have an active area of 104 mm by 104 mm, 32 x 32 direct\nreadout pixel array at a pitch of 3.25 mm, peak quantum efficiency in excess of\n30%, exceptionally low dark count rates and timing resolution of 15-20 ps for a\nsingle photon detection. As such, these photosensors are very well suited for\nRing Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) detectors that can also provide high resolution\ntiming capability, especially in a configuration where a detected charged\nparticle passes through the sensor window, which produces a localized flash\ncontaining a few dozens of Cherenkov photons in it.",

This\nmodel retains the usual disorder-to-order transition common in flocking models,\nbut we show that it also possesses a second transition, deep in the polar\nflocking phase, to a state with spatially patterned transverse velocities. We\ncharacterize this transition and its sensitivity to finite-size effects using\nthe Binder cumulant, and demonstrate -- via direct measurements and by\nmeasuring a susceptibility of the phase to particle index permutations -- that\nthe stability of this phase is directly tied to a subtle spatial organization\nof a slow-relaxing index-order field.

Due to their inherent\nnonreciprocal properties and their direct physical interaction with magnetic\ndata storage, spin waves are ideal candidates to realize such platforms. In the\npresent study, we show how spin-wave nonreciprocity induced by dipolar\ninteractions of nanowaveguides with antiparallel, out-of-plane magnetization\norientations can be used to create a spin-wave circulator allowing for\nunidirectional information transport and complex signal routing.

These properties are demonstrated for a spin-wave\ndirectional coupler through a combination of micromagnetic simulations and\nanalytical modeling also showing that it functions as a waveguide crossing\nelement, tunable power splitter, isolator, and frequency multiplexer.

We exclude software engineering for a tractable scoping\nof eAGI and expect dedicated software engineering AI agents to address the\nsoftware implementation challenges.

Given this broad\nmandate, evaluating and qualifying the performance of eAGI agents is a\nchallenge in itself and, arguably, a critical enabler to developing eAGI\nagents. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing an extensible\nevaluation framework that specializes and grounds Bloom's taxonomy - a\nframework for evaluating human learning that has also been recently used for\nevaluating LLMs - in an engineering design context. Our proposed framework\nadvances the state of the art in benchmarking and evaluation of AI agents in\nterms of the following: (a) developing a rich taxonomy of evaluation questions\nspanning from methodological knowledge to real-world design problems; (b)\nmotivating a pluggable evaluation framework that can evaluate not only textual\nresponses but also evaluate structured design artifacts such as CAD models and\nSysML models; and (c) outlining an automatable procedure to customize the\nevaluation benchmark to different engineering contexts.",

The\nfact that one has to perform one integration less to construct self-dual\nsolitons, as compared to the usual topological solitons, is not linked to the\nuse of any dynamically conserved quantity. It is important that the topological\ncharge admits an integral representation, and so there exists a density of\ntopological charge.

The magic is that such\nidentities become the Euler-Lagrange equations of the theory when the\nself-duality equations are imposed.

The temporal coherence of emitted photons (i.e.\ntheir capacity to interfere and distribute photonic entanglement) is essential\nfor many of these applications. Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the\ntemporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In\nthis work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN\ndefect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson\ninterferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal\ndelay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds,\nhighlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are four orders of magnitude\nfaster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter. We also analyze the\nsingle photon characteristics of the emission via correlation measurements,\ndefect blinking dynamics, and its Debye-Waller factor. Our room temperature\nresults highlight the presence of a strong phonon-electron coupling, suggesting\nthe need to work at cryogenic temperatures to enable quantum photonic\napplications based on photon interference.",

    "abstract": "Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to enhance the generalization of deep\nlearning models when faced with test data that exhibits distribution shifts\nfrom the training data. In this context, only a pre-trained model and unlabeled\ntest data are available, making it particularly relevant for privacy-sensitive\napplications. In practice, we observe that feature redundancy in embeddings\ntends to increase as domain shifts intensify in TTA. However, existing TTA\nmethods often overlook this redundancy, which can hinder the model's\nadaptability to new data. To address this issue, we introduce Feature\nRedundancy Elimination for Test-time Adaptation (FRET), a novel perspective for\nTTA. A straightforward approach (S-FRET) is to directly minimize the feature\nredundancy score as an optimization objective to improve adaptation. Despite\nits simplicity and effectiveness, S-FRET struggles with label shifts, limiting\nits robustness in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, we further\npropose Graph-based FRET (G-FRET), which integrates a Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) with contrastive learning. This design not only reduces feature\nredundancy but also enhances feature discriminability in both the\nrepresentation and prediction layers. Extensive experiments across multiple\nmodel architectures, tasks, and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nS-FRET and show that G-FRET achieves state-of-the-art performance. Further\nanalysis reveals that G-FRET enables the model to extract non-redundant and\nhighly discriminative features during inference, thereby facilitating more\nrobust test-time adaptation.",

This demonstrates the\nadvantage of explicitly incorporating multi-scale context into the network. Our\nresults highlight the importance of input scale and network design in\nreconstruction tasks.

Motivated by\nthe observation that language priors tend to remain consistent across different\nimages, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet\neffective training-free method that uses unrelated images as contrastive visual\ninputs. To address the issue of over-suppressing language priors, which can\nnegatively affect the quality of generated responses, we further introduce a\ndynamic selection mechanism based on the cross-image differences in model\nbehavior.

We\nconsider posterior sampling according to an approximate prior $\\mathcal{P}$,\nand establish sufficient conditions for stable and accurate recovery with high\nprobability. Our main result is a non-asymptotic bound that shows that the\nsample complexity depends on (i) the intrinsic complexity of $\\mathcal{P}$,\nquantified by its so-called approximate covering number, and (ii) concentration\nbounds for the forward operator and noise distributions. As a key application,\nwe specialize to generative priors, where $\\mathcal{P}$ is the pushforward of a\nlatent distribution via a Deep Neural Network (DNN). We show that the sample\ncomplexity scales log-linearly with the latent dimension $k$, thus establishing\nthe efficacy of DNN-based priors. Generalizing existing results on\ndeterministic (i.e., non-Bayesian) recovery for the important problem of random\nsampling with an orthogonal matrix $U$, we show how the sample complexity is\ndetermined by the coherence of $U$ with respect to the support of\n$\\mathcal{P}$. Hence, we establish that coherence plays a fundamental role in\nBayesian recovery as well. Overall, our framework unifies and extends prior\nwork, providing rigorous guarantees for the sample complexity of solving\nBayesian inverse problems with arbitrary distributions.",

    "abstract": "For robust statistical inference it is crucial to obtain a good estimator of\nthe variance of the proposed estimator of the statistical estimand. A commonly\nused estimator of the variance for an asymptotically linear estimator is the\nsample variance of the estimated influence function. This estimator has been\nshown to be anti-conservative in limited samples or in the presence of\nnear-positivity violations, leading to elevated Type-I error rates and poor\ncoverage. In this paper, capitalizing on earlier attempts at targeted variance\nestimators, we propose a one-step targeted variance estimator for the causal\nrisk ratio (CRR) in scenarios involving treatment, outcome, and baseline\ncovariates. While our primary focus is on the variance of log(CRR), our\nmethodology can be extended to other causal effect parameters. Specifically, we\nfocus on the variance of the IF for the log relative risk (log(CRR)) estimator,\nwhich requires deriving the efficient influence function for the variance of\nthe IF as the basis for constructing the estimator. Several methods are\navailable to develop efficient estimators of asymptotically linear parameters.\nIn this paper, we concentrate on the so-called one-step targeted maximum\nlikelihood estimator, which is a substitution estimator that utilizes a\none-dimensional universal least favorable parametric submodel when updating the\ndistribution. We conduct simulations with different effect sizes, sample sizes\nand levels of positivity to compare the estimator with existing methods in\nterms of coverage and Type-I error. Simulation results demonstrate that,\nespecially with small samples and near-positivity violations, the proposed\nvariance estimator offers improved performance, achieving coverage closer to\nthe nominal level of 0.95 and a lower Type-I error rate.",

In modeling MT hydrodynamics, it is usually assumed that the critical\npoint of the flow, where the velocity exceeds the local sound speed, coincides\nwith the inner Lagrange point (L1). However, in massive donors, radiative\npressure dominates over gas pressure and the Eddington factor\n$\\Gamma_\\text{Edd}$ can reach or exceed unity. If there is significant momentum\nand/or energy exchange between gas and radiation, the critical point of the\nflow can shift away from L1, affecting the MT rate ($\\dot{M}_\\text{d}$). Here,\nwe investigate the effects of radiation on MT using time-steady radiative\nhydrodynamic equations and the assumption of the von Zeipel theorem. We provide\nanalytical expressions that closely approximate $\\dot{M}_\\text{d}$ and\nnumerical solutions using a realistic equation of state. We find two main\ndifferences with respect to the traditional expressions for $\\dot{M}_\\text{d}$.\nFirst, for Roche-lobe-underfilling donors with $\\Gamma_\\text{Edd} \\lesssim 1$,\nradiative momentum exchange leads to an exponential increase of\n$\\dot{M}_\\text{d}$ as a function of $1-\\Gamma_\\text{Edd}$. We provide a simple\nmodification of existing prescriptions that takes this effect into account.\nSecond, we find that the photon tiring limit for super-Eddington outflows is\nmuch less restrictive near L1 than in spherical stars. We suggest that donors\nwith super-Eddington convectively inefficient subsurface layers are able to\ndrive MT with $-\\dot{M}_\\text{d} \\gtrsim\n10^{-2}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot\\,\\text{yr}^{-1}$ even before overfilling their Roche\nlobes.

The\nresulting stable mass transfer rate is sensitive to the tidal heating model but\nis plausibly $\\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-5} M_\\odot {\\, \\rm yr^{-1}}$ (and perhaps\nlarger), sufficient to produce low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in many\ngalaxies. The stability of mass transfer is sensitive to where in the stellar\ninterior the tidal energy is dissipated. MESA models confirm the expected\nresult that mass transfer is unstable (stable) if tidal heating increases\n(decreases) the fraction of the star that is convective. More detailed\nconclusions about the stability of mass-transfer will require self-consistently\ncalculating how the tidal heating of stars changes in response to internal\nstructural changes produced by the tidal heating itself. Stars with tidal\nheating-induced mass transfer can produce a large population of low-luminosity\nactive galactic nuclei; they may also be the progenitors of some partial tidal\ndisruption candidates (e.g., ASASSN-14ko) as well as short period\nquasi-periodic eruptions (e.g., eRO-QPE2 and GSN 069). However, many repeating\nnuclear transients produced by tidal heating-induced mass loss are likely\nfainter than those detected thus far, and remain to be discovered.",

To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a\nnew framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework\nsupports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D\nrotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses\nthe generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes\nreal-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training\ndata pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a\nsingle trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames,\nwe incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this\nchallenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We\ndesign a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout\ntraining. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup\neffectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving\nhigh-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in\nrealistic image manipulation.

For\nexample, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when\nrecognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end\nvision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision\ntokenization and target autoregressive tasks.

Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate,\nwithout the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the\nemployed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nproposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance\ngains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks\ncompared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original\nreconstruction capability.

Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset\nwith model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model,\nFigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date.\nFurthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures\nand then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math\ninstruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with\nImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on\nMM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a\nnew open-source SOTA across all six metrics.

    "abstract": "Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their\nresolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing\ntext-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they\noften overlook an important need in practical applications: style\ncustomization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics\nwith consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing\nT2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges.\nOptimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I)\nmodels for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity.\nOn the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity,\nyet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to\nlimited SVG training data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization\npipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward\nT2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion\nmodel with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of\nSVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we\ncustomize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized\nT2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate\nhigh-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an\nefficient feed-forward manner.

    "abstract": "With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in\npart or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However,\ndiffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in\nreality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture\nartifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a\nsynthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic\nimages containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered\ninfeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered\nout-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a\nmodel's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be\nexcluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility\nreally matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is\nnecessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers,\nfocusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We\nintroduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to\ninclude feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated\nby a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally\naffects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference\nin top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute\nmatters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the\nclassification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in\ntraining datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using\npurely feasible or infeasible datasets.",

    "abstract": "Large language models excel on static benchmarks, but their ability as\nself-learning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. We evaluate three\nprompting strategies: self-reflection, heuristic mutation, and planning across\ndynamic tasks with open-source models. We find that larger models generally\noutperform smaller ones, but that strategic prompting can close this\nperformance gap. Second, an overly long prompt can negatively impact smaller\nmodels on basic reactive tasks, while larger models show more robust behaviour.\nThird, advanced prompting techniques primarily benefit smaller models on\ncomplex games, but offer less improvement for already high-performing large\nlanguage models. Yet, we find that advanced reasoning methods yield highly\nvariable outcomes: while capable of significantly improving performance when\nreasoning and decision-making align, they also introduce instability and can\nlead to big performance drops. Compared to human performance, our findings\nreveal little evidence of true emergent reasoning. Instead, large language\nmodel performance exhibits persistent limitations in areas like planning and\nspatial coordination, suggesting that large language models still suffer\nfundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through self-reflective\nprompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while methods like\nChain-of-thought improve multi-step reasoning on math word problems, our\nfindings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important shortcomings in general\nreasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move beyond static benchmarks to\ncapture the complexity of reasoning.",

In this paper, we collect preference data\nfrom public forums covering diverse user communities, and conduct extensive\ntraining using 15M-scale data across models ranging from 1.5B to 72B\nparameters. We observe distinct patterns across different evaluation metrics:\n(1) Adversarial metrics (ability to identify deceptive features) consistently\nscale up with increased training data and base model size; (2) Objective\nmetrics (objective knowledge with well-defined answers) show emergent behavior\nin larger language models, highlighting WorldPM's scalability potential; (3)\nSubjective metrics (subjective preferences from a limited number of humans or\nAI) do not demonstrate scaling trends. Further experiments validate the\neffectiveness of WorldPM as a foundation for preference fine-tuning. Through\nevaluations on 7 benchmarks with 20 subtasks, we find that WorldPM broadly\nimproves the generalization performance across human preference datasets of\nvarying sizes (7K, 100K and 800K samples), with performance gains exceeding 5%\non many key subtasks.

Two\ntypes of stellar wind are considered: isotropic winds and axisymmetric jets,\nalong with variations in the radial pressure gradient profile. The results show\nthat anti-friction enables AGN stars to acquire angular momentum from the\nambient gas, resulting in outward migration away from the disk center. The\nformation and stability of the head-wind structure, which is crucial for\nmaintaining anti-friction, are sensitive to both the strength of the stellar\noutflow and the radial pressure gradient of the disk gas. Once the head-wind\nstructure is disrupted, the anti-friction effect ceases to operate effectively.\nA case study is also presented, focusing on a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) in\nan AGN disk. It is shown that jet material launched along the z-axis is\nconfined to the trailing side of the object's motion by high gas inflow\nvelocities, thereby activating anti-friction and inducing outward migration.

Unlike traditional methods reliant on log parsing, strict\nsequence dependencies, or labeled data, ADALog operates on individual\nunstructured logs, extracts intra-log contextual relationships, and performs\nadaptive thresholding on normal data. The proposed approach utilizes a\ntransformer-based, pretrained bidirectional encoder with a masked language\nmodeling task, fine-tuned on normal logs to capture domain-specific syntactic\nand semantic patterns essential for accurate anomaly detection. Anomalies are\nidentified via token-level reconstruction probabilities, aggregated into\nlog-level scores, with adaptive percentile-based thresholding calibrated only\non normal data. This allows the model to dynamically adapt to evolving system\nbehaviors while avoiding rigid, heuristic-based thresholds common in\ntraditional systems. We evaluate ADALog on benchmark datasets BGL, Thunderbird,\nand Spirit, showing strong generalization and competitive performance compared\nto state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic\nmanipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of\ninterpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling\nthe agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse\nworking scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key\nfactor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation,\nand Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer\ninto RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two\nblock stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic\nmanipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to\nsolve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In\nthis work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid\nconstraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards\nconcurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two\nself-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to\nfacilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40\npercent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10\npercent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we\nidentify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing,\nand learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual\nguidance for curriculum based RL frameworks.

    "abstract": "We investigate the optimal pricing strategy in a service-providing framework,\nwhere customers can become impatient and leave the system prior to service\ncompletion. In this setting, a price is quoted to an incoming customer based on\nthe current number of customers in the system. When the quoted price is lower\nthan the price the incoming customer is willing to pay (which follows a fixed\nprobability distribution), then the customer joins the system and a reward\nequal to the quoted price is earned. A cost is incurred upon abandonment and a\nholding cost is incurred for customers waiting to be served. Our goal is to\ndetermine the pricing policy that maximizes the long-run average profit. Unlike\ntraditional queueing systems without abandonments, we show that the optimal\nquoted prices do not always increase with the queue length in this setting. In\nparticular, we prove that the optimal pricing policy is always uni-modal and\nprovide conditions guaranteeing that the optimal policy is increasing in the\nnumber of customers in the system. Moreover, we introduce two heuristics that\nsimplify the optimal dynamic pricing policy. Both heuristics admit customers\nuntil the number of customers in the system reaches a certain threshold. The\ncutoff static policy charges all admitted customers a fixed price while the two\nprice policy charges one price when the arriving customer can enter service\nimmediately and another price if the customer needs to wait. By selecting the\nprice(s) and threshold that maximize the long-run average profit, both\nheuristics achieve near optimality and the two price policy provides more\nrobustness compared to the cutoff static policy.",

It is therefore essential to develop efficient\nmethods for implementing non-Clifford operations, such as small-angle\nrotations, to maximise the computational capabilities of devices within these\nconstraints. In this work, we introduce mitigated magic dilution (MMD) as an\napproach to synthesise small-angle rotations by employing quantum error\nmitigation techniques to sample logical Clifford circuits given noisy encoded\nmagic states. We explore the utility of our approach for the simulation of the\n2D Fermi-Hubbard model.

If inference is performed in two steps, uncertainty propagation\nplays a crucial role in accounting for all sources of uncertainty and\nvariability. This becomes particularly important when both aleatoric\nuncertainty, caused by data variability, and epistemic uncertainty, arising\nfrom incomplete knowledge or missing data, are present. Examples include\nsurrogate models and missing data problems. In surrogate modeling, the\nsurrogate is used as a simplified approximation of a resource-heavy and costly\nsimulation. The uncertainty from the surrogate-fitting process can be\npropagated using a two-step procedure. For modeling with missing data, methods\nlike Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) generate multiple\ndatasets to account for imputation uncertainty. These approaches, however, are\ncomputationally expensive, as multiple models must be fitted separately to\nsurrogate parameters respectively imputed datasets.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an efficient two-step approach that\nreduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. By selecting a\nrepresentative subset of draws or imputations, we construct a mixture\ndistribution to approximate the desired posteriors using Pareto smoothed\nimportance sampling.

Although word\naligners (WAs) are commonly used for label projection, the low-level design\ndecisions for applying them to translation-based XLT have not been\nsystematically investigated. Moreover, recent marker-based methods, which\nproject labeled spans by inserting tags around them before (or after)\ntranslation, claim to outperform WAs in label projection for XLT. In this work,\nwe revisit WAs for label projection, systematically investigating the effects\nof low-level design decisions on token-level XLT: (i) the algorithm for\nprojecting labels between (multi-)token spans, (ii) filtering strategies to\nreduce the number of noisily mapped labels, and (iii) the pre-tokenization of\nthe translated sentences. We find that all of these substantially impact\ntranslation-based XLT performance and show that, with optimized choices, XLT\nwith WA offers performance at least comparable to that of marker-based methods.\nWe then introduce a new projection strategy that ensembles translate-train and\ntranslate-test predictions and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms\nthe marker-based projection.

Developing automated\nsystems also faces significant obstacles, primarily the lack of node-level\nannotations. Previous methods treat lymph nodes as isolated entities rather\nthan as an interconnected system, overlooking valuable spatial and contextual\ninformation. To solve this problem, we present WeGA, a novel weakly-supervised\nglobal-local affinity learning framework that addresses these challenges\nthrough three key innovations: 1) a dual-branch architecture with DINOv2\nbackbone for global context and residual encoder for local node details; 2) a\nglobal-local affinity extractor that aligns features across scales through\ncross-attention fusion; and 3) a regional affinity loss that enforces\nstructural coherence between classification maps and anatomical regions.\nExperiments across one internal and two external test centers demonstrate that\nWeGA outperforms existing methods, achieving AUCs of 0.750, 0.822, and 0.802\nrespectively. By effectively modeling the relationships between individual\nlymph nodes and their collective context, WeGA provides a more accurate and\ngeneralizable approach for lymph node metastasis prediction, potentially\nenhancing diagnostic precision and treatment selection for rectal cancer\npatients.",

However, the passive collection of this data by audio listening\ndevices raises significant privacy concerns. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)\noffers a promising solution by enabling computations on encrypted data and\npreserving user privacy. Despite its potential, prior attempts to apply FHE to\naudio processing have faced challenges, particularly in securely computing time\nfrequency representations, a critical step in many audio tasks.\n  Here, we addressed this gap by introducing a fully secure pipeline that\ncomputes, with FHE and quantized neural network operations, four fundamental\ntime-frequency representations: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Mel\nfilterbanks, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and gammatone\nfilters. Our methods also support the private computation of audio descriptors\nand convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers. Besides, we proposed\napproximate STFT algorithms that lighten computation and bit use for\nstatistical and machine learning analyses.\n  We ran experiments on the VocalSet and OxVoc datasets demonstrating the fully\nprivate computation of our approach. We showed significant performance\nimprovements with STFT approximation in private statistical analysis of audio\nmarkers, and for vocal exercise classification with CNNs. Our results reveal\nthat our approximations substantially reduce error rates compared to\nconventional STFT implementations in FHE. We also demonstrated a fully private\nclassification based on the raw audio for gender and vocal exercise\nclassification. Finally, we provided a practical heuristic for parameter\nselection, making quantized approximate signal processing accessible to\nresearchers and practitioners aiming to protect sensitive audio data.",

Moreover, non-reciprocal elements such as optical diodes and\ncirculators are difficult to implement in photonics, as they typically require\ntime-dependent perturbations, nonlinear effects, or external magnetic fields.\nThis presents a significant barrier to the development of efficient, compact\nphotonic technologies. We introduce the concept of optical spin current,\nwherein spin angular momentum is transferred by an electromagnetic field\nwithout accompanying energy transfer. This phenomenon is analogous to electron\nspin currents, where spin is decoupled from charge flow. Building on this\nprinciple, we propose optical spin diode and circulator -- devices that enable\nunidirectional propagation of spin currents while maintaining bidirectional\nenergy flow, thus preserving reciprocity. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nasymmetric spin transfer between quantum dots mediated by the optical spin\ndiode, highlighting the potential for novel optical spintronic functionalities.\nThese findings lay the foundation for devices that leverage optical spin\ntransfer, opening new avenues for advancements in optical spintronics.",

Our analysis shows that\nX-ray observations are most effective at orbital frequencies up to roughly 1\nmHz, whereas LISA is sensitive chiefly above about 1 mHz. Because the optimal\nsensitivity windows overlap only marginally, we predict at most one joint\ndetection during LISA's nominal mission lifetime.

Combined with\npartitioned scheduling, these methods require careful co-allocation of tasks\nand resources to cores, as task execution times strongly depend on available\nallocated resources. To address this challenge, this paper presents a 0-1\nlinear program for task-resource co-allocation, along with a multi-objective\nheuristic designed to minimize resource usage while guaranteeing schedulability\nunder a preemptive EDF scheduling policy. Our heuristic employs a multi-layer\nframework, where an outer layer explores resource allocations using\nPareto-pruned search, and an inner layer optimizes task allocation by solving a\nknapsack problem using dynamic programming. To evaluate the performance of the\nproposed optimization algorithm, we profile real-world benchmarks on an\nembedded AMD UltraScale+ ZCU102 platform, with fine-grained resource\npartitioning enabled by the Jailhouse hypervisor, leveraging cache set\npartitioning and MemGuard for memory bandwidth regulation. Experiments based on\nthe benchmarking results show that the proposed 0-1 linear program outperforms\nexisting mixed-integer programs by finding more optimal solutions within the\nsame time limit. Moreover, the proposed multi-objective multi-layer heuristic\nperforms consistently better than the state-of-the-art multi-resource-task\nco-allocation algorithm in terms of schedulability, resource usage, number of\nnon-dominated solutions, and computational efficiency.",

It is therefore useful to study\nphysical processes which generate entanglement within a large system, as they\nmaybe replicated for applications involving the said requirements in quantum\ninformation processing. A possible avenue to maximize entanglement generation\nis to rely on the phenomena of information scrambling, i.e. transport of\ninitially localized information throughout the system. Here the rationale is\nthat the spread of information carries with it an inherent capacity of\nentanglement generation. Scrambling greatly depends upon the dynamical nature\nof the system Hamiltonian, and the interplay between entanglement generation\nand information scrambling maybe investigated taking a chain of interacting\nspins on a one dimensional lattice.

In many real-world applications,\nthe observed variables are vector-valued, such as in climate science where\nvariables are defined over a spatial grid and the task is called\nspatio-temporal causal discovery. We motivate CD in vector-valued variable\nsetting while considering different possibilities for the underlying model, and\nhighlight the pitfalls of commonly-used approaches when compared to a fully\nvectorized approach. Furthermore, often the vector-valued variables are\nhigh-dimensional, and aggregations of the variables, such as averages, are\nconsidered in interest of efficiency and robustness. In the absence of\ninterventional data, testing for the soundness of aggregate variables as\nconsistent abstractions that map a low-level to a high-level structural causal\nmodel (SCM) is hard, and recent works have illustrated the stringency of\nconditions required for testing consistency. In this work, we take a careful\nlook at the task of vector-valued CD via constraint-based methods, focusing on\nthe problem of consistency of aggregation for this task. We derive three\naggregation consistency scores, based on compatibility of independence models\nand (partial) aggregation, that quantify different aspects of the soundness of\nan aggregation map for the CD problem. We present the argument that the\nconsistency of causal abstractions must be separated from the task-dependent\nconsistency of aggregation maps. As an actionable conclusion of our findings,\nwe propose a wrapper Adag to optimize a chosen aggregation consistency score\nfor aggregate-CD, to make the output of CD over aggregate variables more\nreliable. We supplement all our findings with experimental evaluations on\nsynthetic non-time series and spatio-temporal data.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly believed that scaling language models should commit a\nsignificant space or time cost, by increasing the parameters (parameter\nscaling) or output tokens (inference-time scaling). We introduce the third and\nmore inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel\ncomputation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and\nlearnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in\nparallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely\nparallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing\nparameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,\ndata, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it\nthrough large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel\nstreams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\\log P)$ while showing\nsuperior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\\times$\nless memory increase and 6$\\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter\nscaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an\noff-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training\non a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget. The new\nscaling law we discovered potentially facilitates the deployment of more\npowerful models in low-resource scenarios, and provides an alternative\nperspective for the role of computation in machine learning.",

However, the origin of this\nneural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model\nsize -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also\nagree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an\nimportant mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws.

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious millisecond-duration radio transients\nfrom the distant universe. Some of them repeat, while others do not. In order\nto explore their origin, periodic examinations have been conducted on repeating\nFRBs. Most of them show irregular properties, including burst rate, dispersion\nmeasure (DM), and rotation measure (RM). A notable exception is FRB~20180916B,\nwhich shows a significant 16-day periodic burst rate. Possible periodic\nactivities have also been reported in FRB~20121102A and FRB~20240209A. However,\nperiodic studies of other properties are sparse. FRB~20220529 was monitored by\nthe Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) for nearly\nthree years, enabling periodic examinations of its properties. Here we report a\npossible period of $\\sim 200$ days in the RM evolution, with a significance of\n4.2 $\\sigma$ estimated via the Lomb-Scargle algorithm and 3.5 $\\sigma$ with a\nphase-folding method. The burst rate was also examined for periodicity. This is\nconsistent with the binary origin indicated by the significant RM increase and\nits prompt recovery.",

However, conventional QST requires an\nexponentially growing number of measurements as the system dimension increases,\nposing a significant challenge for high-dimensional systems. To mitigate this\nissue, compressed sensing quantum state tomography (CS-QST) has been proposed,\nsignificantly reducing the required number of measurements. In this study, we\ninvestigate the impact of basis selection in CS-QST for qudit systems, which\nare fundamental to high-dimensional quantum information processing.\nSpecifically, we compare the efficiency of the generalized Gell-Mann (GGM) and\nHeisenberg-Weyl observable (HWO) bases by numerically reconstructing density\nmatrices and evaluating reconstruction accuracy using fidelity and trace\ndistance metrics. Our results demonstrate that, while both bases allow for\nsuccessful density matrix reconstruction, the HWO basis becomes more efficient\nas the qudit dimension increases. Furthermore, we find the best fitting curves\nthat estimate the number of measurement operators required to achieve a\nfidelity of at least 95%.

By self\nconsistently computing the components of the radiation flux and their curl, we\nshow that the rotational nature of the radiation field induces charge\nseparation, leading to magnetic field generation in the plasma above the disc.\nSolving the magnetohydrodynamic equations, we derive the time evolution of\nthese fields and demonstrate that they grow over astrophysically relevant\ntimescales. For a standard Keplerian accretion disc, the produced magnetic\nfields remain weak, on the order of a few Gauss, consistent with previous\npredictions. However, when a luminous corona is present in the inner disc\nregion ($r_d < 3-10 r_g$), the generated fields reach dynamically significant\nstrengths of up to $10^5$ Gauss where the magnetic energy density approaching\nfew percentage of equipartition with the gas pressure. These fields develop\nwithin realistic growth timescales (such as viscous timescale) and can be\ndynamically significant in governing disc and jet evolution. Our findings\nsuggest that radiation-driven magnetic fields play a crucial role in accretion\nflow magnetization, influencing both disc dynamics and observational\nsignatures.

    "abstract": "Interpreting the data from radio detectors for extensive air showers\ntypically relies on Monte-Carlo based simulation codes, which, despite their\naccuracy are computationally expensive and present bottlenecks for analyses. To\naddress this issue we developed a novel method called template synthesis, which\nsynthesises the radio emission from cosmic ray air showers in seconds. This\nhybrid approach uses a microscopically simulated, sliced shower (the origin) as\nan input. It rescales the emission from each slice individually to synthesise\nthe emission from a shower with different properties (the target). In order to\nbe able to change the arrival direction during synthesis, we adjust the phases\nbased on the expected geometrical delays. We benchmark the method by comparing\nsynthesised traces to CoREAS simulations over a wide frequency range of [30,\n500] MHz . The synthesis quality is primarily influenced by the difference in\n$X_{max}$ between the origin and target shower. When $\\Delta X_{max} \\leq 100\ng/cm^2$ , the scatter on the maximum amplitudes of the geomagnetic traces is at\nmost 4%. For the traces from the charge-excess component this scatter is\nsmaller than 6%. We also observe a bias with $\\Delta X_{max}$ up to 5% for both\ncomponents, which appears to depend on the antenna position. Since the bias is\nsymmetrical around $\\Delta X_{max} = 0 g/cm^2$, we can use an interpolation\napproach to correct for it. We have implemented the template synthesis\nalgorithm in a Python package called \\texttt{SMIET}, which includes all the\nnecessary parameters. This package has been successfully tested with air\nshowers with zenith angles up to $50^{\\circ}$ and can be used with any\natmosphere, observation level and magnetic field. We demonstrate that the\nsynthesis quality remains comparable to our main benchmarks across various\nscenarios and discuss use cases, including machine-learning-based analyses.",

It is well known that higher smoothness\nof the map over smooth space plays important role in the study of invariant\nmeasures of maximal entropy. A famous theorem of Newhouse states that smooth\ndiffeomorphisms on compact manifolds without boundary have invariant measures\nof maximal entropy. However, we show that the situation becomes completely\ndifferent when we study measures of maximal entropy for analytic subsets.\nNamely, we construct a smooth surface system which contains a smooth curve\nhaving no Borel probability measure of maximal entropy. Another evidence to\nshow this difference is that, once an analytic set has one measure of maximal\nentropy, then the set has many measures of maximal entropy (no matter if we\nconsider packing or Bowen entropy). For a general dynamical system with\npositive entropy $h_\\mathrm{top}(T)$, we shall show that the system contains\nnot only a Borel subset which has Borel probability measures of maximal entropy\nand has entropy sufficiently close to $h_\\mathrm{top}(T)$, but also a Borel\nsubset which has no Borel probability measures of maximal entropy and has\nentropy equal to the arbitrarily given positive real number which is at most\n$h_\\mathrm{top}(T)$. We also provide in all $h$-expansive systems a full\ncharacterization for analytic subsets which have Borel probability measures of\nmaximal entropy. Consequently, if let $Z\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ be any analytic\nsubset with positive Hausdorff dimension in Euclidean space, then the set $Z$\neither has a measure of full lower Hausdorff dimension, or it can be\npartitioned into a union of countably many analytic sets $\\{Z_i\\}_{i\\in\n\\mathbb{N}}$ with $\\dim_{\\mathcal{H}}(Z_i) < \\dim_{\\mathcal{H}}(Z)$ for each\n$i$.",

We compare numerical simulations of different moment\nclosures: Grad's closure, the hyperbolic quadrature method of moments (HyQMOM),\nthe extended quadrature method of moments, and a method based on entropy\nmaximization. We assess the different closures for plasma applications and\npropose efficient numerical discretizations.

Classical fluid closures such as the Fourier law for the heat flux is\nshown to be not suitable to capture the sheath or the low pressure regime.

The electron-PCP correlation dominates in the\natom-like regime, significantly influencing physical observables, while its\nrole diminishes in the particle-in-trap-like limit. Between these two extremes\nlies a complex intermediate regime that challenges qualitative interpretation.\nOverall, the exotic Harmonium model offers a powerful framework to unravel the\nelectron-PCP correlations across diverse systems, spanning particles of varying\nmasses and conditions, from ambient to high-pressure environments.",

Changes in these properties due to parameter\nand symmetry variations can be understood by computing the corresponding\ntopological invariant. Since topological invariants are typically defined for a\nfixed spatial dimension, there is no existing framework to understand the\neffects of changing spatial dimensions via invariants. Here, we introduce a\nframework to study topological phase transitions as a system's dimensionality\nis altered using real-space topological markers. Specifically, we consider\nShiba lattices, which are class D materials formed by magnetic atoms on the\nsurface of a conventional superconductor, and characterize the evolution of\ntheir topology when an initial circular adatom island is deformed into a chain.\nWe also provide a measure of the corresponding protection against disorder. Our\nframework is generalizable to any symmetry class and spatial dimension,\npotentially guiding the design of materials by identifying, for example, the\nminimum thickness of a slab required to maintain three-dimensional topological\nproperties.",

DCoLT treats each intermediate step in\nthe reverse diffusion process as a latent \"thinking\" action and optimizes the\nentire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on the correctness of the\nfinal answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal, linear thinking process,\nDCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with no strict rule on\ngrammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of thought. We implement\nDCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models (DLMs). First, we choose\nSEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete diffusion model, where its\nconcrete score derives a probabilistic policy to maximize the RL reward over\nthe entire sequence of intermediate diffusion steps. We further consider the\ndiscrete-time masked diffusion language model -- LLaDA, and find that the order\nto predict and unmask tokens plays an essential role to optimize its RL action\nresulting from the ranking-based Unmasking Policy Module (UPM) defined by the\nPlackett-Luce model. Experiments on both math and code generation tasks show\nthat using only public data and 16 H800 GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform\nother DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even both.

    "abstract": "The simulation of large-scale classical systems in exponentially small space\non quantum computers has gained attention. The prior work demonstrated that a\nquantum algorithm offers an exponential speedup over any classical algorithm in\nsimulating classical dynamics with long-range interactions. However, many\nreal-world classical systems, such as those arising from partial differential\nequations, exhibit only local interactions. The question remains whether\nquantum algorithms can still provide exponential speedup under this condition.\nIn this work, we thoroughly characterize the computational complexity of\nquantum algorithms for simulating such geometrically local systems. First, we\ndequantize the quantum algorithm for simulating short-time (polynomial-time)\ndynamics of such systems. This implies that the problem of simulating this\ndynamics does not yield any exponential quantum advantage. Second, we show that\nquantum algorithms for short-time dynamics have the same computational\ncomplexity as polynomial-time probabilistic classical computation. Third, we\nshow that the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for long-time\n(exponential-time) dynamics is captured by exponential-time and\npolynomial-space quantum computation. This suggests a super-polynomial time\nadvantage when restricting the computation to polynomial-space, or an\nexponential space advantage otherwise. This work offers new insights into the\ncomplexity of classical dynamics governed by partial differential equations,\nproviding a pathway for achieving quantum advantage in practical problems.",

While recent studies have\nassessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the\naccuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them.\nMoreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can\narrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar\nissues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether\nstate-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs\nor are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations:\nrenaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else\nbranches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations\nmaintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and\nperformed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the\ncorrect predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction\nstability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our\nfindings show that LLMs trained for code produce correct predictions based on\nflawed reasoning between 10% and 50% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change\npredictions in response to our code mutations, indicating they do not yet\nexhibit stable, semantically grounded reasoning.",

While\nexisting robot learning approaches using IL-based pre-training followed by\nRL-based fine-tuning are promising, this two-step learning paradigm often\nsuffers from instability and poor sample efficiency during the RL fine-tuning\nphase. In this work, we introduce IN-RIL, INterleaved Reinforcement learning\nand Imitation Learning, for policy fine-tuning, which periodically injects IL\nupdates after multiple RL updates and hence can benefit from the stability of\nIL and the guidance of expert data for more efficient exploration throughout\nthe entire fine-tuning process. Since IL and RL involve different optimization\nobjectives, we develop gradient separation mechanisms to prevent destructive\ninterference during \\ABBR fine-tuning, by separating possibly conflicting\ngradient updates in orthogonal subspaces. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous\nanalysis, and our findings shed light on why interleaving IL with RL stabilizes\nlearning and improves sample-efficiency. Extensive experiments on 14 robot\nmanipulation and locomotion tasks across 3 benchmarks, including\nFurnitureBench, OpenAI Gym, and Robomimic, demonstrate that \\ABBR can\nsignificantly improve sample efficiency and mitigate performance collapse\nduring online finetuning in both long- and short-horizon tasks with either\nsparse or dense rewards.

In this work, we have computed the\ntime-dependent entanglement entropy and complexity of the FLRW universe in the\npresence of different matter sources (radiation, matter and some exotic\nmatter). In contrast to the approach in \\cite{Park:2020jio}, all the\ncalculations in this paper have been carried out in a perturbative manner in\nthe framework of braneworld model of cosmology. According to this model, our\nuniverse is situated on a brane and different matter sources appear on the\nbrane due to the back reaction of different $p$-brane gas configurations in the\nbulk spacetime. By considering the bulk spacetime as a black brane geometry, we\nhave considered different blackening factors corresponding to radiation,\nmatter, and exotic matter and calculated entanglement entropy and complexity\nholographically. In the braneworld model, the universe's expansion is described\nby the brane's time-dependent radial position. This position is determined\nusing the second Israel junction condition for various matter sources. The time\nevolution of entanglement entropy and complexity is then obtained by\nsubstituting this brane position. We have also shown the dependence of\nentanglement entropy and complexity on the cosmological time for all the\ndifferent matter-dominated universes in the early and late time eras.

    "abstract": "Additively manufactured (AM) architected materials have enabled unprecedented\ncontrol over mechanical properties of engineered materials. While lattice\narchitectures have played a key role in these advances, they suffer from stress\nconcentrations at sharp joints and bending-dominated behavior at high relative\ndensities, limiting their mechanical efficiency. Additionally, high-resolution\nAM techniques often result in low-throughput or costly fabrication, restricting\nmanufacturing scalability of these materials. Aperiodic spinodal architected\nmaterials offer a promising alternative by leveraging low-curvature\narchitectures that can be fabricated through techniques beyond AM. Enabled by\nphase separation processes, these architectures exhibit tunable mechanical\nproperties and enhanced defect tolerance by tailoring their curvature\ndistributions. However, the relation between curvature and their anisotropic\nmechanical behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a\ntheoretical framework to quantify the role of curvature in governing the\nanisotropic stiffness and strength of shell-based spinodal architected\nmaterials. We introduce geometric metrics that predict the distribution of\nstretching and bending energies under different loading conditions, bridging\nthe gap between curvature in doubly curved shell-based morphologies and their\nmechanical anisotropy. We validate our framework through finite element\nsimulations and microscale experiments, demonstrating its utility in designing\nmechanically robust spinodal architectures. This study provides fundamental\ninsights into curvature-driven mechanics, guiding the optimization of\nnext-generation architected materials for engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Gas turbine engines are complex and highly nonlinear dynamical systems.\nDeriving their physics-based models can be challenging because it requires\nperformance characteristics that are not always available, often leading to\nmany simplifying assumptions. This paper discusses the limitations of\nconventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally\nlinear parameter-varying models, and addresses these issues by employing\nidentification techniques based on data collected from standard engine\noperation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics are estimated using the\nsparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part\nof the dynamics is mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction\nspace. This process involves eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic\nalgorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction\nidentification. The resulting Koopman model is validated against an in-house\nreference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback\ncontroller and a Kalman estimator are then designed within the eigenfunction\nspace and compared to traditional and gain-scheduled proportional-integral\ncontrollers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The\neigenmode structure enables targeting individual modes during optimization,\nleading to improved performance tuning. Results demonstrate that the\nKoopman-based controller surpasses other benchmark controllers in both\nreference tracking and disturbance rejection under sea-level and varying flight\nconditions, due to its global nature.",

    "abstract": "Space exploration technology continues to expand humanity's reach beyond\nEarth, and even more ambitious efforts are striving to establish long-duration\nhuman settlements on Mars. The dependence of martian settlers on life-support\ninfrastructure and on resupply missions from the host nation could create\nconditions for tyranny or lead to other extreme and uncontrollable situations,\nbut such risks could be reduced by thinking about the possibilities for\neffective decision making on Mars before any settlement efforts actually occur.\nThis paper examines the extent to which referendums could be used on Mars as a\nmeans of political decision-making and sovereignty adjudication. Our approach\ndraws on three terrestrial case studies -- the Great Idaho Movement in the\nUnited States, the Catalan Independence Movement in Spain, and the Quebec\nIndependence Movement in Canada -- as potential analogs for Mars governance. We\nrecommend advance determination of the conditions under which a martian\nreferendum would be recognized as a best practice for any agency seeking to\nestablish a long-duration settlement on Mars. We suggest that referendums can\nreduce the likelihood of multiple authoritative political entities existing on\nMars, which could provide a more procedural approach toward resolving\ngovernance issues between Earth and Mars.

In this\npaper we explore a newer method, named score-based diffusion, to nowcast (zero\nto three hour forecast) clouds and precipitation. We discuss the background and\nintuition of score-based diffusion models - thus providing a starting point for\nthe community - while exploring the methodology's use for nowcasting\ngeostationary infrared imagery. We experiment with three main types of\ndiffusion models: a standard score-based diffusion model (Diff); a residual\ncorrection diffusion model (CorrDiff); and a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our\nresults show that the diffusion models are able to not only advect existing\nclouds, but also generate and decay clouds, including convective initiation.\nThese results are surprising because the forecasts are initiated with only the\npast 20 mins of infrared satellite imagery. A case study qualitatively shows\nthe preservation of high resolution features longer into the forecast than a\nconventional mean-squared error trained U-Net. The best of the three diffusion\nmodels tested was the CorrDiff approach, outperforming all other diffusion\nmodels, the traditional U-Net, and a persistence forecast by one to two kelvin\non root mean squared error.

The observed full width at half maximum of the HeI\nline on day 6.3 (1350 km s$^{-1}$) is consistent with the behaviour of optical\nHeI lines during earlier eruptions of this RN, which show that the nova ejecta\ndecelerate as they interact with the secondary's wind.

    "abstract": "Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative\npatterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass\nfiltering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential\ndynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model\nthat integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph\nconstruction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain.\nGSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of\nsymmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we\ndesign a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract\nmid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global\ntrends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec\nconsistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in\nNDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential\ngraph augmentation and bandpass filtering.",

This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing\nbetween such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between\nthe attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI.\nWe begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to\nformalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human\nmonitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction\nbetween the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one\nreductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL\nfailure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL\nsetup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and\nEU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always\nachieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest\nareas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups\nand assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and\nunproductive human \"scapegoating\". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve\nmany technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often\nout of the humans' control. This opens up a new analytic perspective on the\nchallenges arising in the creation of HITL setups, helping inform AI developers\nand lawmakers on designing HITL to better achieve their desired outcomes.",

To address this, we\npropose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement\nfine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning\nwith fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as\na hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense\nprocess reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in\nparameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We\npropose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and\nthe Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly\nreduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately\nrewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T\noptimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each\nepisode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning\nbenchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different\ntasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.",

We assess the effectiveness of the\nclustering redshifts technique in constraining Euclid tomographic redshift bins\nto meet the target uncertainty of $ \\sigma ( \\langle z \\rangle ) < 0.002 (1 +\nz) $. In this work, these mean redshifts are inferred from the small-scale\nangular clustering of Euclid galaxies, which are distributed into bins with\nspectroscopic samples localised in narrow redshift slices.\n  Methods: We generate spectroscopic mocks from the Flagship2 simulation for\nthe Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and Euclid's Near-Infrared Spectrometer and\nPhotometer (NISP) spectroscopic survey. We evaluate and optimise the clustering\nredshifts pipeline, introducing a new method for measuring photometric galaxy\nbias (clustering), which is the primary limitation of this technique.\n  Results: We have successfully constrained the means and standard deviations\nof the redshift distributions for all of the tomographic bins (with a maximum\nphotometric redshift of 1.6), achieving precision beyond the required\nthresholds. We have identified the main sources of bias, particularly the\nimpact of the 1-halo galaxy distribution, which imposed a minimal separation\nscale of 1.5 Mpc for evaluating cross-correlations. These results demonstrate\nthe potential of clustering redshifts to meet the precision requirements for\nEuclid, and we highlight several avenues for future improvements.",

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating human internal states, such as personality traits or\nbehavioral patterns, is critical for enhancing the effectiveness of human-robot\ninteraction, particularly in group settings. These insights are key in\napplications ranging from social navigation to autism diagnosis. However, prior\nmethods are limited by scalability and passive observation, making real-time\nestimation in complex, multi-human settings difficult. In this work, we propose\na practical method for active human personality estimation in groups, with a\nfocus on applications related to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Our method\ncombines a personality-conditioned behavior model, based on the Eysenck\n3-Factor theory, with an active robot information gathering policy that\ntriggers human behaviors through a receding-horizon planner. The robot's belief\nabout human personality is then updated via Bayesian inference. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach through simulations, user studies with\ntypical adults, and preliminary experiments involving participants with ASD.\nOur results show that our method can scale to tens of humans and reduce\npersonality prediction error by 29.2% and uncertainty by 79.9% in simulation.\nUser studies with typical adults confirm the method's ability to generalize\nacross complex personality distributions. Additionally, we explore its\napplication in autism-related scenarios, demonstrating that the method can\nidentify the difference between neurotypical and autistic behavior,\nhighlighting its potential for diagnosing ASD. The results suggest that our\nframework could serve as a foundation for future ASD-specific interventions.",

The search was conducted by a task-oriented code,\ndesigned to find low-amplitude signals in the presence of high-amplitude\ncomponents and instrumental systematics. We found 7 new modulated stars and\nnegate one earlier claimed star, whereby increasing the number of known Blazhko\nstars from 17 to 24 and yielding an observed occurrence rate of 67% for the\nKepler field. Six of the new stars have the lowest modulation amplitudes found\nso far, with ~250 ppm Fourier side-lobe amplitudes near the fundamental mode\nfrequency. Because of the small sample size in the Kepler field, we extended\nthe survey to 12 campaign fields observed by K2, the ``two-wheeled'' mission of\nKepler. From the 1061 stars we found 514 Blazhko stars. After correcting for\nthe short duration of the time spent on each field, and for the noise\ndependence of the detections, we arrived at an underlying occurrence rate of\n~75% - likely a lower limit for the true rate of Blazhko stars in the K2\nfields.",

Standard quintessence models allow for\na varying $w\\geq-1$, but observations report that a phantom regime, $w<-1$, is\nquickly reached in the past. Often discarded because of uncertainties or\nparametrisation, we rather propose here to embrace the reality of this phantom\nregime. We revisit an elegant mechanism that accounts for it, thanks to a\ncoupling of quintessence field(s) to matter (and possibly radiation). We show\nthat this allows for steep scalar potentials, and illustrate this with\nstring-inspired models, where $V=V_0\\, e^{-\\lambda\\, \\varphi}$ and $\\lambda\n\\geq \\sqrt{2}$. Those provide solutions in very good agreement with\nobservations, including the phantom regime. We then discuss poles that can\nappear in $w$, making it diverge at recent times ($z\\leq 4$), and that could be\ndetected by observations. We finally comment on an Early Dark Energy-like\nfeature, that systematically appears for free from the models considered, and\ncould be of interest for the Hubble tension.",

Large language\nmodels (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating PLS generation, but\ntheir effectiveness in supporting health information comprehension remains\nunclear. Prior evaluations have generally relied on automated scores that do\nnot measure understandability directly, or subjective Likert-scale ratings from\nconvenience samples with limited generalizability. To address these gaps, we\nconducted a large-scale crowdsourced evaluation of LLM-generated PLSs using\nAmazon Mechanical Turk with 150 participants. We assessed PLS quality through\nsubjective Likert-scale ratings focusing on simplicity, informativeness,\ncoherence, and faithfulness; and objective multiple-choice comprehension and\nrecall measures of reader understanding. Additionally, we examined the\nalignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our\nfindings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear\nindistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations,\nhuman-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore,\nautomated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into\nquestion their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to\nsystematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and\ncomprehension outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for evaluation\nframeworks that move beyond surface-level quality and for generation methods\nthat explicitly optimize for layperson comprehension.",

To address these\nissues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information\nembedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical\nfeatures are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic\nfiltering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features\nof images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and\ncritical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a\ndiffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual\ninformation fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the\ngenerated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,\nthe GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted\nfeatures and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we\ndesign a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume\nof features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental\nresults validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating\nwith both the PSNR and critical information volume.

It is shown that the numerical error maintains the\noptimal-order convergence provided that the nonzero Dirichlet boundary datum is\napproximated numerically with sufficient accuracy. Inexact block diagonal and\ntriangular Schur complement preconditioners are considered for the regularized\nsystem. The convergence analysis for MINRES and GMRES with corresponding block\npreconditioners is provided for different choices of the regularization term.\nNumerical experiments in two and three dimensions are presented to verify the\ntheoretical findings and the effectiveness of the preconditioning for solving\nthe regularized system.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation\nhas been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the\ngeneration process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on\ncontent repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition\nproblem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is\nstructural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in\nvarious patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently\nreflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition\nand propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for\nRepetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems\nin code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to\nidentify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically\ndecays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,\nthereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we\nconstruct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches\nfor mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the\nbest-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and\nMBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of\ngenerated code.",

For example, it has been shown that\nmany viruses form condensates within their host cells to compartmentalize\ncapsid assembly and packaging of the viral genome. Yet, the physical principles\ncontrolling condensate-mediated self-assembly remain incompletely understood.\nIn this article we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study\nthe effect of a condensate on the assembly of icosahedral capsids.

Our results show that\ncondensates can significantly enhance assembly rates, yields, and robustness to\nparameter variations, consistent with previous theoretical predictions.\nHowever, extending beyond those predictions, the computational models also show\nthat excluded volume enables control over the number of capsids that assemble\nwithin condensates.

This study presents\nAutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve\nvisualization in RAMIS.

    "abstract": "The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a\ngraph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never\nencounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called\nClassical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are\nconsidered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time\nstep. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking\ninto account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can\nbe safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of\nconflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the\nbody of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying\nstill at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how\nharder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while\nplanning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an\nundirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete\npolynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In\nthis paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard\nand, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be\npresented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of\nreducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem)\nto the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we\nprocedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices\nand show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path\nfinding instance has a solution.",

    "abstract": "Conventional approaches to quantum gravity regard quantum principles, such as\nnonlocality and superposition, as fundamental properties of nature and\ntherefore argue that gravity must also be quantized. In contrast, this work\nintroduces a theory of crystallizing spacetime, which offers an alternative\nperspective: that both gravitational and quantum mechanical observations can be\nexplained within a fundamentally classical framework operating beyond\ntraditional spacetime. The theory proposes a spacetime relaxation mechanism\nwherein a dynamically evolving four-dimensional spacetime, populated by dynamic\nworldlines, relaxes as a function of the parameter $\\tau$ into a standard\nspacetime consistent with general relativity. Simulations in the weak-gravity\nlimit illustrate this process of spacetime and worldline relaxation.\nAdditionally, models are developed showing that two hallmark quantum phenomena\n-- nonlocality in an EPR experiment and double-slit interference of a massive\nparticle -- can be reproduced in this fundamentally classical framework by\nimplementing Costa de Beauregard's concept of zigzag action along worldlines.\nThe resulting crystallizing spacetime framework not only resolves the\nmeasurement problem but also provides a compelling basis for a unified theory\nof matter and gravity. Since this framework is grounded in concepts analogous\nto realism, locality, and determinism at its foundations, it brings Einstein's\nlong-sought intuitive worldview within reach.",

While equilibria in the\none-round voting mechanisms lead to a good decision, they are usually hard to\ncompute and follow. We consider the two-round voting mechanism where the first\nround serves as a polling stage and the winning alternative only depends on the\noutcome of the second round. We show that the two-round voting mechanism is a\npowerful tool for making collective decisions. Firstly, every (approximated)\nequilibrium in the two-round voting mechanisms (asymptotically) leads to the\ndecision preferred by the majority as if the state of the world were revealed\nto the voters. Moreover, there exist natural equilibria in the two-round game\nfollowing intuitive behaviors such as informative voting, sincere voting\n[Austen-Smith and Banks, 1996], and the surprisingly popular strategy [Prelec\net al., 2017]. This sharply contrasts with the one-round voting mechanisms in\nthe previous literature, where no simple equilibrium is known. Finally, we show\nthat every equilibrium in the standard one-round majority vote mechanism gives\nan equilibrium in the two-round mechanisms that is not more complicated than\nthe one-round equilibrium. Therefore, the two-round voting mechanism provides a\nnatural equilibrium in every instance, including those where one-round voting\nfails to have a natural solution, and it can reach an informed majority\ndecision whenever one-round voting can. Our experiments on generative AI voters\nalso imply that two-round voting leads to the correct outcome more often than\none-round voting under some circumstances.",

For stars with surface features like starspots,\ntheir periods can be inferred from brightness variations as these features move\nacross the stellar surface. TESS, with its all-sky coverage, is providing the\nlargest sample of stars for obtaining rotation periods. However, most of the\nperiods have been limited to shorter than the 13.7-day TESS orbital period due\nto strong background signals (e.g., scattered light) on those timescales. In\nthis study, we investigated the viability of measuring longer periods (> 10\ndays) from TESS light curves for stars in the Northern Continuous Viewing Zone\n(NCVZ). We first created a reference set of 272 period measurements longer than\n10 days for K & M dwarfs in the NCVZ using data from the Zwicky Transient\nFacility (ZTF) that we consider as the \"ground truth\" given ZTF's long temporal\nbaseline of 6+ years. We then used the unpopular pipeline to de-trend TESS\nlight curves and implemented a modified Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram that\naccounts for flux offsets between observing sectors. For 179 out of the 272\nsources (66%), the TESS-derived periods match the ZTF-derived periods to within\n10%. The match rate increases to 81% (137 out of 170) when restricting to\nsources with a TESS LS power that exceeds a threshold. Our results confirm the\ncapability of measuring periods longer than 10 days from TESS data,\nhighlighting the dataset's potential for studying slow rotators.",

To address this, we propose a temporal\nInhibitory Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ILIF) neuron model, inspired by biological\ninhibitory mechanisms. This model incorporates interconnected inhibitory units\nfor membrane potential and current, effectively mitigating overactivation while\npreserving gradient propagation.

To\naddress these challenges, this article explores the recent resurgence of analog\ncomputers, proposing a novel paradigm of arbitrarily small\nexecution-time-certified analog optimization (solving optimization problems via\nanalog computers). To achieve ultra-low energy consumption, this paradigm\ntransforms optimization problems into ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\nand leverages the ability of analog computers to naturally solve ODEs (no need\nfor time-discretization) in physically real time. However, this transformation\ncan fail if the optimization problem, such as the general convex nonlinear\nprograms (NLPs) considered in this article, has no feasible solution. To avoid\ntransformation failure and enable infeasibility detection, this paradigm\nintroduces the homogeneous monotone complementarity problem formulation for\nconvex NLPs. To achieve scalability and execution time certificate, this\nparadigm introduces the Newton-based fixed-time-stable scheme for the\ntransformed ODE, whose equilibrium time $T_p$ can be prescribed by choosing the\nODE's time coefficient as $k=\\frac{\\pi}{2T_p}$. This equation certifies that\nthe equilibrium time (execution time) is independent of the dimension of\noptimization problems and can be arbitrarily small if the analog computer\nallows.",

We identify a novel reciprocal\nFloquet thermalization mechanism, which is triggered when combination of laser\ndetuning and the Rydberg atom interaction and Floquet period are reciprocal\npairs.

However, due to the visual artifacts in generated images and\ninefficient integration of multi-modal features in policy learning, this\ndirection remains an open challenge. We introduce NVSPolicy, a generalizable\nlanguage-conditioned policy learning method that couples an adaptive novel-view\nsynthesis module with a hierarchical policy network. Given an input image,\nNVSPolicy dynamically selects an informative viewpoint and synthesizes an\nadaptive novel-view image to enrich the visual context. To mitigate the impact\nof the imperfect synthesized images, we adopt a cycle-consistent VAE mechanism\nthat disentangles the visual features into the semantic feature and the\nremaining feature. The two features are then fed into the hierarchical policy\nnetwork respectively: the semantic feature informs the high-level meta-skill\nselection, and the remaining feature guides low-level action estimation.\nMoreover, we propose several practical mechanisms to make the proposed method\nefficient. Extensive experiments on CALVIN demonstrate the state-of-the-art\nperformance of our method.

Remarkably, despite general\nsuppression of \\( f_n \\)-wave pairing by increasing next-nearest neighbor\nhopping \\( t' \\) and \\( t'' \\), a critical \\( t'' = 0.15 \\) triggers anomalous\nenhancement via higher-order Van Hove singularities renormalization at a fix\n$t'$.

    "abstract": "The rotational evolution of stars is still an open question of stellar\nphysics because of the numerous phenomena that can contribute to the\ndistribution of angular momentum. This paper aims at determining the time scale\nover which a rotating early-type star relaxes to a steady baroclinic state or,\nequivalently, in which case its nuclear evolution is slow enough to let the\nevolution of the star be modelled by a series of quasi-steady states. We\ninvestigate the damping time scale of baroclinic and viscous eigenmodes that\nare potentially excited by the continuous forcing of nuclear evolution. We\nfirst investigate this problem with a spherical Boussinesq model. Since much of\nthe dynamics is concentrated in the radiative envelope of the star, we then\nimprove the realism of the modelling by using a polytropic model of the\nenvelope that takes into account a realistic density profile. The polytropic\nmodel of the envelope underlines the key role of the region at the\ncore-envelope interface. The results of evolutionary models recently obtained\nwith two-dimensional axisymmetric ESTER models turn out to be a consequence of\nthe slow damping of viscous modes. Using a vanishing Prandtl number appears to\nbe too strong an approximation to explain the dynamics of the models.\nBaroclinic modes previously thought as good candidates of this relaxation\nprocess turn out to be too quickly damped. The dynamical response of rotating\nstars to the slow forcing of its nuclear evolution appears as a complex\ncombination of non-oscillating eigenmodes. Simple Boussinesq approach are not\nrealistic enough to explain this reality. The present work underlines the key\nrole of layers near the core-envelope interface in an early-type star and also\nthe key role of any angular momentum transport mechanism, here played by\nviscosity, for early-type stars to reach critical rotation, presumably\nassociated with the Be phenomenon.",

In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be\ntrained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image\nmodeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a\nunified membership inference method called PartCrop.

Of particular interest is the transition from an\nindirect to a direct band gap with increasing Sn content, which enhances\noptical properties, electron transport and we find also affects spin transport\nbehaviour, which is critical for spintronics applications. We use\nfirst-principles electronic-structure theory to determine the spin-flip\nelectron-alloy scattering parameters in n-type GeSn alloys. We also calculate\nthe previously undetermined intervalley electron spin-phonon scattering\nparameters between the $L$ and $\\Gamma$ valleys. These parameters are used to\ndetermine the electron-alloy and electron-phonon scattering contributions to\nthe n-type spin-relaxation of GeSn, as a function of alloy content and\ntemperature. As in the case of phonon scattering, alloy scattering reduces the\nspin-relaxation time. However, switching the spin transport from the typical\n$L$ valley of Ge to the $\\Gamma$ valley by sufficient addition of Sn, the\nrelaxation time can be substantially increased. For unstrained, room\ntemperature GeSn, we find a Sn concentration of at least $10\\%$ is required to\nachieve a spin-relaxation time greater than Ge, with $17\\%$ Sn needed to\nincrease the spin-relaxation time from the nanosecond range to the microsecond\nrange. At low temperatures (30K), adding $10\\%$ Sn can increase the\nspin-relaxation time from $10^{-7}$s to 0.1s.

    ],
    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the well-posedness (or lack thereof) of\nthree-dimensional time-harmonic wave propagation problems modeled by the\nHelmholtz equation. It is well-known that if the problem is set in bounded\ndomain with Dirichlet boundary conditions, then the Helmholtz problem is\nwell-posed for all (real-valued) frequencies except for a sequence of countably\nmany resonant frequencies that accumulate at infinity. In fact, if the domain\nis sufficiently smooth, this can be quantified further and Weyl's law states\nthat the number of resonant frequencies less than a given $\\omega > 0$ scales\nas $\\omega^3$. On the other hand, scattering problems set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$\nwith a radiation condition at infinity and a bounded obstacle modeled by\nvariations in the PDE coefficients are well-posed for all frequencies under\nmild regularity assumption on such coefficients. In 2001, Filinov provided a\ncounter example of a rough coefficient such that the scattering problem is not\nwell-posed for (at least) a single frequency $\\omega$. In this contribution, we\nuse this result to show that for all $\\varepsilon > 0$ we can design a rough\ncoefficient corresponding to a compactly supported obstacle such that the\nscattering problem is ill-posed for a countable sequence of frequencies\naccumulating at infinity, and such that the number of such frequencies less\nthan any given $\\omega > 0$ scales as $\\omega^{3-\\varepsilon}$.",

Here, we studied\nhow aerosolisation impacts the size and morphology of different CNCs\nsuspensions with different surface functionalities. By building a new\nexperimental setup, we observed that colloidally-metastable aqueous CNC\nsuspensions, achieved by carboxylation of the surface hydroxy groups or by\nexposure to high intensity ultrasonication, yield large particulates upon\naerosolisation under ambient temperatures. In contrast, aqueous suspensions of\nunfunctionalised CNCs tend to produce, upon aerosolisation, smaller\nparticulates, despite suffering from poor colloidal stability in liquid\nsuspension. Our results demonstrate that both the aerosolisation process itself\nand the properties of the CNC suspension play a crucial role in determining the\nfinal particle size and morphology of CNC-based particles, highlighting the\nneed to consider colloidal stability and surface functionality when designing\nCNC-based materials for applications involving aerosol delivery or spray\ndrying.",

We\nderive the analytical expressions for the probability amplitudes of the driven\nthree-level giant atom and obtain two independent conditions. We find two\ndifferent types of bound states (including the static bound states and the\nperiodic equal-amplitude oscillating bound states) and discuss the physical\norigins of the bound states formation. Moreover, we discuss the case of the\ndriven three-level giant atom interacting with the infinite photonic waveguide,\nwhere there is only one purely imaginary solution (i.e., only one bound state\ncondition exists) for its complex frequency (coming from the absence of mirror\nat one end of the waveguide) compared to that of a driven three-level giant\natom coupling with a semi-infinite photonic waveguide. With this, we also find\ntwo different types of bound states, including the static bound state and the\nperiodic equal-amplitude oscillating bound states. Finally, the above results\nare generalized to a more general model involving a semi-infinite photonic\nwaveguide coupling with an arbitrary number of noninteracting three-level giant\natoms driven by the driving fields.

We develop two tight-binding models: one based on a strong\ntopological insulator with antiferromagnetic order, and another built from\nstacked Chern insulators with alternating Chern numbers. Both systems are dual\ntopological insulators, i.e. they are at the same time antiferromagnetic and\ncrystalline topological insulators, but differ by the type of mirror symmetry\nprotecting the crystalline phase: spinful versus spinless. We show that in the\nspinful case the mirror Chern number is invariant under time reversal and that\nit changes sign in the spinless case. This influences the properties of the two\nsystems in the presence of a magnetic domain wall, which is created in the\nsystem when the magnetization is flipped via a time-reversal transformation. In\nthe first type, the bulk of the domain wall is gapped but the defect will host\nchiral edge states when it ends on an external ferromagnetic surface. In the\nsecond, due to the flip in the mirror Chern number, the domain wall is a\ntwo-dimensional embedded semimetal with 2D gapless states protected by mirror\nsymmetry. Our results show that domain walls can be a source of non-trivial\ntopology, allowing to generate and manipulate gapless states within the bulk\nand the ferromagnetic surfaces of antiferromagnetic topological insulators.",

To interpret this measurement, we compare against\nGeneral Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations spanning a wide\nrange of physical parameters including thermal or non-thermal electron\ndistribution function, spins, and ion-to-electron temperature ratios in both\nlow and high-density regions. We find no statistically significant correlation\nbetween spin and ellipticity in GRMHD images. Instead, we identify a\ncorrelation between ellipticity and the fraction of non-ring emission,\nparticularly in non-thermal models and models with higher jet emission. These\nresults indicate that the ellipticity measured from the \\m87 emission structure\nis consistent with that expected from simulations of turbulent accretion flows\naround black holes, where it is dominated by astrophysical effects rather than\ngravitational ones. Future high-resolution imaging, including space very long\nbaseline interferometry and long-term monitoring, will be essential to isolate\ngravitational signatures from astrophysical effects.",

Remarkably, systems composed of random components often display\nemergent global behaviors that appear deterministic, manifesting a transition\nfrom microscopic disorder to macroscopic organization. In this work, we\nintroduce a theoretical model for studying the emergence of collective\nbehaviors in ensembles of random classifiers. We argue that, if the ensemble is\nweighted through the Gibbs measure defined by adopting the classification loss\nas an energy, then there exists a finite temperature parameter for the\ndistribution such that the classification is optimal, with respect to the loss\n(or the energy). Interestingly, for the case in which samples are generated by\na Gaussian distribution and labels are constructed by employing a teacher\nperceptron, we analytically prove and numerically confirm that such optimal\ntemperature does not depend neither on the teacher classifier (which is, by\nconstruction of the learning problem, unknown), nor on the number of random\nclassifiers, highlighting the universal nature of the observed behavior.\nExperiments on the MNIST dataset underline the relevance of this phenomenon in\nhigh-quality, noiseless, datasets. Finally, a physical analogy allows us to\nshed light on the self-organizing nature of the studied phenomenon.",

While deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) has shown an impressive ability to learn optimal\npolicies in stationary environments, most methods are data intensive and assume\na world that does not change between training and test time. As a result,\nconventional RL methods struggle to adapt when conditions change. This poses a\nfundamental challenge: how can RL agents efficiently adapt their behavior when\nencountering novel environmental changes during deployment without\ncatastrophically forgetting useful prior knowledge? This dissertation\ndemonstrates that efficient online adaptation requires two key capabilities:\n(1) prioritized exploration and sampling strategies that help identify and\nlearn from relevant experiences, and (2) selective preservation of prior\nknowledge through structured representations that can be updated without\ndisruption to reusable components.",

This paper aims at reconciling the aforementioned measurements\nby utilizing the widely employed color-flavor locked (CFL) MIT bag model. The\nmain objective is related to the examination of the acceptable values for the\ncolor superconducting gap $\\Delta$ and the bag parameter $B$. Furthermore, our\nanalysis involves two distinct hypotheses for the nature of compact stars.\nFirstly, we considered the case of absolute stability for strange quark matter\nand we found that it is possible to explain both measurements, while also\nrespecting the latest astronomical constraints on the masses and radii of\ncompact stars. Secondly, we studied the case of hybrid stellar matter\n(transition from hadrons to quarks), and concluded that, when early phase\ntransitions are considered, the simultaneous reconciliation of both\nmeasurements leads to results that are inconsistent to the existence of massive\ncompact stars. However, we showed that all current constraints may be satisfied\nunder the consideration that the HESS J1731-347 remnant contains a slow stable\nhybrid star.",

However,\nthe ever-present demand and large variation of constraints make healthcare\nscheduling particularly challenging. This problem has been studied for decades,\nwith limited research aimed at applying Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT).\nSMT has gained momentum within the formal verification community in the last\ndecades, leading to the advancement of SMT solvers that have been shown to\noutperform standard mathematical programming techniques. In this work, we\npropose generic constraint formulations that can model a wide range of\nreal-world scheduling constraints. Then, the generic constraints are formulated\nas SMT and MILP problems and used to compare the respective state-of-the-art\nsolvers, Z3 and Gurobi, on academic and real-world inspired rostering problems.\nExperimental results show how each solver excels for certain types of problems;\nthe MILP solver generally performs better when the problem is highly\nconstrained or infeasible, while the SMT solver performs better otherwise. On\nreal-world inspired problems containing a more varied set of shifts and\npersonnel, the SMT solver excels. Additionally, it was noted during\nexperimentation that the SMT solver was more sensitive to the way the generic\nconstraints were formulated, requiring careful consideration and\nexperimentation to achieve better performance.

In this\nwork, we provide a systematic, comparative study of static and dynamical\nindicators of chaos for the closed and open Dicke model. In the closed Dicke\nmodel, we find that indicators of chaos sensitive to long-range correlations in\nthe energy spectrum such as the the spectral form factor can deviate from the\nPoissonian random matrix theory (RMT) predictions and show a dip-ramp-plateau\nfeature even in the normal region of the Dicke model unless very large values\nof the spin size are chosen. Thus, care is needed in using such indicators of\nchaos. In the open Dicke model with cavity damping, we find that the\ndissipative spectral form factor emerges as a robust diagnostic displaying a\nquadratic dip-ramp-plateau behavior in agreement with the Ginebre Unitary\nEnsemble (GinUE) RMT in the superradiant regime. Moreover, by examining the\nspectral properties of the Liouvillian, we provide indirect evidence for the\nconcurrence of the dissipative superradiant quantum phase transition and the\nchange in Liouvillian eigenvalue statistics from 2-D Poissonian to GinUE RMT\nbehavior.",

This feature, called the Neptune desert or\nthe evaporation desert, is believed to be primarily shaped by planetary\nmigration and photoevaporation. However, this region is not completely devoid\nof planets--a small number of very hot Neptunes reside within the desert. These\nplanets provide an opportunity to directly probe the effects of migration and\nphotoevaporation.

We use radial velocity measurements from the Carnegie Planet\nFinder Spectrograph (PFS) to constrain TOI-5800 b's mass and eccentricity. We\nfind that it has an unusually high eccentricity (0.39$\\pm$0.07) for its short\norbit. TOI-5800 is therefore currently experiencing high levels of tidal\nheating as it moves into the desert. Ranked as a top candidate for transmission\nand emission spectroscopy within its temperature and radius regime, TOI-5800 b\nis a prime target for atmospheric characterization with JWST.

The high\nquality of the images made it possible to construct the star density profile\nfrom resolved star counts, and to fit the observed profile with an appropriate\nKing model to obtain the structural parameters (e.g. core, half-mass, and tidal\nradii). Our findings confirm that NGC 1754 is a very compact globular cluster\nwith a core radius of only 0.84 pc. The analysis of the same dataset allowed us\nto confirm a very old age ($t=12.8\\pm0.4$ Gyr) for this system, thus further\nconsolidating the indication that the process of globular cluster formation\nstarted at the same cosmic time both in the LMC and in the Milky Way,\nindependently of the characteristics of the host environment. We have also used\nthe empirical method called ``dynamical clock'' to estimate the dynamical age\nof the system. This consists of quantifying the degree of central segregation\nof blue straggler stars (BSSs) using the $A^+_{rh}$ parameter, which is defined\nas the area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and\nthat of a reference (lighter) population. This method yielded a value of\n$A^+_{rh}=0.31\\pm0.07$, which is the highest measured so far for LMC clusters,\npointing to an advanced dynamical age for the cluster, possibly on the verge of\ncore collapse. The results presented here for NGC 1754 confirm that the natural\ndynamical evolution of globular clusters plays a role in shaping the age-core\nradius distributions observed in the LMC.",

Specifically, one assumes the subgroup-specific\ntoxicity and efficacy treatment effects, as a parameter vector, can be\nexchangeable or non-exchangeable; the other allows either the toxicity or\nefficacy parameters specific to the subgroups, to be exchangeable or\nnon-exchangeable. The bivariate exchangeability and non-exchangeability\ndistributions introduce a correlation parameter between treatment effects,\nwhile we stipulate a zero correlation when only toxicity or efficacy parameters\nare exchangeable. Simulation results show that our models perform robustly\nunder different scenarios compared to the standard Bayesian hierarchical model\nand the stand-alone analyses, especially in producing higher power when the\nsubgroup-specific effects are exchangeable in toxicity or efficacy only.

    "abstract": "Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks\nthat compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An\nimportant, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately\ncapture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as\nhomogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary\nenormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident\nto one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel\nmethod for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI),\nspecifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically\nobserved heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a\nmodel's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when\ntreated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human\nmedian in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as\nsimulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only\nmodestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In\nboth cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than\nlarger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties\ncommonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call\nfor adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often\nincompatible, social stocks of knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Ray antenna array (RAA) is a novel multi-antenna architecture comprising\nmassive low-cost antenna elements and a few radio-frequency (RF) chains. The\nantenna elements are arranged in a novel ray-like structure, where each ray\ncorresponds to a simple uniform linear array (sULA) with deliberately designed\norientation and all its antenna elements are directly connected. By further\ndesigning a ray selection network (RSN), appropriate sULAs are selected to\nconnect to the RF chains for further baseband processing. RAA has three\nappealing advantages: (i) dramatically reduced hardware cost since no phase\nshifters are needed; (ii) enhanced beamforming gain as antenna elements with\nhigher directivity can be used; (iii) uniform angular resolution across all\nsignal directions. Such benefits make RAA especially appealing for integrated\nsensing and communication (ISAC), particularly for low-altitude unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) swarm ISAC, where high-mobility aerial targets may easily move\naway from the boresight of conventional antenna arrays, causing severe\ncommunication and sensing performance degradation. Therefore, this paper\nstudies RAA-based ISAC for low-altitude UAV swarm systems. First, we establish\nan input-output mathematical model for RAA-based UAV ISAC and rigorously show\nthat RAA achieves uniform angular resolution for all directions. Besides, we\ndesign the RAA orientation and RSN. Furthermore, RAA-based ISAC with orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for UAV swarm is studied, and efficient\nalgorithm is proposed for sensing target parameter estimation. Extensive\nsimulation results demonstrate the significant performance improvement by RAA\nsystem over the conventional antenna arrays, in terms of sensing angular\nresolution and communication spectral efficiency, highlighting the great\npotential of the novel RAA system to meet the growing demands of low-altitude\nUAV ISAC.",

In this work, we investigate how new observational constraints,\nsuch as the Love number and atmospheric metallicity, improve our ability to\ncharacterize the interiors of hot Jupiters, planets for which Love number\nmeasurements are most feasible. We assess the precision required in Love number\nmeasurements to derive interior properties using both a simple two-layer\nhomogeneous model and a more complex dilute core model. To account for\nobservational uncertainties, we implement a retrieval framework. Our results\nshow that accurately constraining core mass and bulk metallicity requires a\nhigh-precision Love number measurement, better than 40% for a homogeneous model\nand 15% for a dilute core model, along with an atmospheric metallicity\nmeasurement. We apply our retrieval framework to five planets with observed\nLove numbers, of which only WASP-19Ab has both an atmospheric metallicity\nconstraint and a highly precise Love number measurement, with a precision of\n12%. For this flagship planet, both models confirm the presence of a core,\nalthough we cannot yet distinguish between a compact core or diluted core.

However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work\nis often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of\ntransferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical\nexperts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm\nidentification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8\npractitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design\nchoices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by\nnon-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to\nsupport mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without\nscaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google\nDocs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint\nharm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to\nalign understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based\nprototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively\nfacilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the\nearly design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft\ndevelopment plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through\nstage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface\npotential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO\nincreased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline\nworksheets.

MIPHEI targets a comprehensive panel of\nmarkers spanning nuclear content, immune lineages (T cells, B cells, myeloid),\nepithelium, stroma, vasculature, and proliferation. We train our model using\nthe publicly available ORION dataset of restained H&E and mIF images from\ncolorectal cancer tissue, and validate it on two independent datasets. MIPHEI\nachieves accurate cell-type classification from H&E alone, with F1 scores of\n0.88 for Pan-CK, 0.57 for CD3e, 0.56 for SMA, 0.36 for CD68, and 0.30 for CD20,\nsubstantially outperforming both a state-of-the-art baseline and a random\nclassifier for most markers. Our results indicate that our model effectively\ncaptures the complex relationships between nuclear morphologies in their tissue\ncontext, as visible in H&E images and molecular markers defining specific cell\ntypes. MIPHEI offers a promising step toward enabling cell-type-aware analysis\nof large-scale H&E datasets, in view of uncovering relationships between\nspatial cellular organization and patient outcomes.",

We applied our approach using data from real\ncustomers whose TV-watching data totalled approximately half a million\nobservations. Our results indicate that combining our framework with the\nselected features provides a means to estimate the number of household TV\nprofiles and their characteristics, including shifts over time and\nquantification of uncertainty.",

To enable\nISAC, specification bodies such as European Telecommunications Standards\nInstitute (ETSI) and Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) have already\nstarted to look into detailed ISAC use cases, their requirements, and the\nchannel models and evaluation methodologies that are necessary to design and\nevaluate ISAC performance.

To\nbridge this gap, 3GPP has been looking into the basic changes that are\nnecessary to make to their TR38.901 channel model with focus on selected use\ncases from the 3GPP SA1 5G-Advanced feasibility study. In parallel, ETSI ISAC\nIndustry Specification Group (ISG) has been studying the more advanced ISAC\nchannel modelling features that are needed to support the variety of ISAC use\ncases envisioned in 6G.

However, it is vulnerable to\nsophisticated falsification attacks by authenticated insiders that can\ndestabilize the formation and potentially cause catastrophic collisions. This\npaper addresses this challenge: misbehavior detection in vehicle platooning\nsystems. We present AttentionGuard, a transformer-based framework for\nmisbehavior detection that leverages the self-attention mechanism to identify\nanomalous patterns in mobility data. Our proposal employs a multi-head\ntransformer-encoder to process sequential kinematic information, enabling\neffective differentiation between normal mobility patterns and falsification\nattacks across diverse platooning scenarios, including steady-state\n(no-maneuver) operation, join, and exit maneuvers. Our evaluation uses an\nextensive simulation dataset featuring various attack vectors (constant,\ngradual, and combined falsifications) and operational parameters (controller\ntypes, vehicle speeds, and attacker positions). Experimental results\ndemonstrate that AttentionGuard achieves up to 0.95 F1-score in attack\ndetection, with robust performance maintained during complex maneuvers.\nNotably, our system performs effectively with minimal latency (100ms decision\nintervals), making it suitable for real-time transportation safety\napplications.

    "abstract": "The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based\non Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is\nconceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating\nperiods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time\nsteps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse\nreward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP\ninto a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical\nDouble Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is\nproposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different\ntemporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective\npolicy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while\nthe low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of\nevery time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the\ncharging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat\npolicy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the\noptimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original\nMDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the\nnon-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the\nlow-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and\nexploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for\nboth levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of\nreal-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.",

Due to limited GPU memory,\nexisting systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O\noverhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1)\nGPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be\nloaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its\ncapacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose\nSpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative\ndecoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for\nstoring and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus\naccelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we\ncarefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in\nspeculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to\nmanage tensor placement and select optimal parameters.

These shifts result in the emergence or absence of\nquantum destructive interference in two-photon excitation processes.\nSpecifically, when destructive quantum interference occurs, photons from one\ninput direction are simultaneously blocked in both resonators, whereas the\nabsence of complete destructive quantum interference causes the blockade effect\nto vanish for inputs from the opposite direction.

On the other hand, such networks are also used as\nan analogy of transport networks such as electrical power grids to answer the\nquestion of how exactly such critical dynamic states can be avoided. However,\nsimulating large network of coupled oscillators is computationally intensive,\nwith specifc regards to electronic ones. We have developed an integrated\ncircuit using integrated Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with modifications, that\nallows to flexibly vary the topology as well as a complexity parameter of the\nnetwork during operation. The proposed architecture, inspired by the brain,\nemploys a clustered architecture, with each cluster containing 7 PLLs featuring\nprogrammable coupling mechanisms. Additionally, the inclusion of a RISC-V\nprocessor enables future algorithmic implementations. Thus, we provide a\npractical alternative for large-scale network simulations both in the field of\nanalog computing and transport network stability research.",

For accurate theoretical predictions, it is essential to develop\nan effective interaction or an energy density functional (EDF) that can\nsystematically reproduce experimental $Q_{\\beta}$ values. The challenge lies in\nidentifying an appropriate EDF for an accurate $Q_{\\beta}$ prediction. To\naddress this, we focus on the bulk properties of nuclei that have correlations\nwith $Q_{\\beta}$. The primary objective of this study is to determine which\nnuclear bulk properties are sensitive to $Q_{\\beta}$, providing information on\nthe key nuclear characteristics that influence $\\beta$-decay calculations. We\nemploy the Skyrme energy-density functionals to find correlations between\n$Q_{\\beta}$ and the nuclear bulk properties, assuming spherical symmetry. Using\n$42$ different Skyrme EDFs, we analyze these correlations by evaluating Pearson\nlinear coefficients, focusing particularly on the relationship between\n$Q_{\\beta}$ and various nuclear properties. We found that the symmetry energy\nat low densities shows a correlation with the $Q_{\\beta}$ value. In particular,\nthis correlation becomes stronger for functionals with an effective mass close\nto $1$. However, as the nuclear density increases, the correlation weakens.\nFrom our analysis, we found that a symmetry energy of $32.8\\pm0.7$~MeV and\neffective mass of $m^{*}/m\\ge0.75$ at the saturation density is the most likely\nto systematically reproduce the experimental data of $Q_{\\beta}$\nsystematically.",

    "abstract": "Type II solar radio bursts are generated by electrons accelerated by coronal\nshock waves. They appear in dynamic spectra as lanes drifting from higher to\nlower frequencies at the plasma frequency and its harmonic. These lanes can\noften be split into two or more sub-bands that have similar drift rates. This\nphenomenon is called band-splitting, and its physical origins are still under\ndebate. Our aim is to investigate the origin of band-splitting using novel\nimaging and spectropolarimetric observations of a type II solar radio burst\nfrom the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). We used LOFAR imaging at multiple\nfrequencies and time steps to track the locations of the radio sources\ncorresponding to the two components of the band-split emission lane. In\naddition, we estimated the degree of circular polarisation (dcp) for both\ncomponents using LOFAR's full Stokes dynamic spectra. From the imaging of the\ntype II burst, we found two close but clearly separated emission regions\nclustered over several frequencies spanning each split band. One emission\nregion corresponds to the lower frequency band and the other to the higher\nfrequency band of the split lane. Using the full Stokes dynamic spectra, we\nalso found the dcp to be very similar for both bands. The two distinct emission\nregions suggest that the split bands originate from two separate regions at the\nshock. The similar values of dcp for both sub-bands correspond to similar\nvalues of magnetic field strength in the two regions and indicate little to no\nchange in the emission region plasma. Thus, our findings are in contradiction\nwith previous theories, which have suggested that split bands originate in the\nsame region but upstream and downstream of the shock. Instead, our results\nsuggest that both bands originate in two separate upstream regions since we\nfind a clear separation in locations and no magnetic compression.",

The lack of\nlarge-scale emotional speech datasets with balanced emotion distributions and\nfine-grained emotion annotations often causes overfitting in synthesis models\nand impedes effective emotion control. To address these issues, we propose\nUDDETTS, a neural codec language model unifying discrete and dimensional\nemotions for controllable emotional TTS. This model introduces the\ninterpretable Arousal-Dominance-Valence (ADV) space for dimensional emotion\ndescription and supports emotion control driven by either discrete emotion\nlabels or nonlinearly quantified ADV values. Furthermore, a semi-supervised\ntraining strategy is designed to comprehensively utilize diverse speech\ndatasets with different types of emotion annotations to train the UDDETTS.\nExperiments show that UDDETTS achieves linear emotion control along the three\ndimensions of ADV space, and exhibits superior end-to-end emotional speech\nsynthesis capabilities.",

However, existing methods rely\nlargely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits\ngeneralization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation.\nTo tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video\nCrafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences\n(i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT\n(4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens.\nCompared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust\nspatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image\nand character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we\nintroduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention\nwith 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as\n4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D\nworld. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new\ndirection for pose-guided human video generation.

Current state-of-the-art QC use a great quantity of cables to\nconnect the physical qubits, situated in the cryogenic temperature, to room\ntemperature electronics. Integrated cryogenic electronics together with\nsemiconductor spin qubits is one way closer for scalability. Such a scalable\nquantum computer can have qubits and the control electronics at 4K stage.

    "abstract": "Improving the fundamental performance trade-off in integrated sensing and\ncommunication (ISAC) systems has been deemed as one of the most significant\nchallenges. To address it, we propose in this letter a novel ISAC system that\nleverages an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting\nsurface (IRS) and the UAV's maneuverability in six-dimensional (6D) space,\ni.e., three-dimensional (3D) location and 3D rotation, thus referred to as\npassive 6D movable antenna (6DMA). We aim to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) for sensing a single target while ensuring a minimum SNR at a\ncommunication user equipment (UE), by jointly optimizing the transmit\nbeamforming at the ISAC base station (BS), the 3D location and orientation as\nwell as the reflection coefficients of the IRS. To solve this challenging\nnon-convex optimization problem, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first\nstage, we aim to optimize the IRS's 3D location, 3D orientation, and reflection\ncoefficients to enhance both the channel correlations and power gains for\nsensing and communication. Given their optimized parameters, the optimal\ntransmit beamforming at the ISAC BS is derived in closed form. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed passive 6DMA-enabled ISAC system\nsignificantly improves the sensing and communication trade-off by\nsimultaneously enhancing channel correlations and power gains, and outperforms\nother baseline schemes.",

Unfortunately, while current robot foundation models show promising\ngeneralization capabilities across a wide variety of tasks, they fail to\naddress safety, an important aspect for ensuring long-term operation. Current\nrobot foundation models assume that safe behavior should emerge by learning\nfrom a sufficiently large dataset of demonstrations. However, this approach has\ntwo clear major drawbacks. Firstly, there are no formal safety guarantees for a\nbehavior cloning policy trained using supervised learning. Secondly, without\nexplicit knowledge of any safety constraints, the policy may require an\nunreasonable number of additional demonstrations to even approximate the\ndesired constrained behavior. To solve these key issues, we show how we can\ninstead combine robot foundation models with geometric inductive biases using\nATACOM, a safety layer placed after the foundation policy that ensures safe\nstate transitions by enforcing action constraints. With this approach, we can\nensure formal safety guarantees for generalist policies without providing\nextensive demonstrations of safe behavior, and without requiring any specific\nfine-tuning for safety. Our experiments show that our approach can be\nbeneficial both for classical manipulation tasks, where we avoid unwanted\ncollisions with irrelevant objects, and for dynamic tasks, such as the robot\nair hockey environment, where we can generate fast trajectories respecting\ncomplex tasks and joint space constraints.",

Therefore, within the framework of the consistent\n$\\delta^{+}$-SPH, we introduce the following enhancements: firstly, new\nstrategy for handling $\\delta \\boldmath{u}$-terms given by the particle\nshifting technique at multiphase interfaces are proposed to maintain stability\nand conservation. Secondly, for modeling of incompressible phases, like water,\nan acoustic damper term is introduced to alleviate acoustic waves resulting\nfrom the weakly-compressible assumption, which is expected to achieve smooth\npressure field comparable to truly-incompressible hypothesis, thereby reducing\nthe nonphysical pressure wave during the violent impact state; for modeling\ncompressible phases like air, a physical sound speed is adopted in the equation\nof state to accurately model real gas phase compressibility.

This is undesirable because memorization reduces the\ngeneralizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets\ndoes not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization\ncan amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more\nfrequently than others.\n  In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public\nrecommendation datasets.

Lastly, we examine whether\nmemorization varies across model families and model sizes.

We then dive into some specific classes\nof graphs such as trees, graphs with bounded degree or bounded degeneracy.\nFinally, we consider temporal graphs where grow pace is one, that is, a single\nedge can be added and a single other one can be removed between two time steps.\nIn that case, we consider bipartite and bounded degree graphs.\n  Even though the problem is defined with full knowledge of the temporal graph,\nour results also work in the case where future snapshots are given online: we\nneed to choose the coloring of the next snapshot after having computed the\ncurrent one, not knowing what",

    "abstract": "Very massive stars (VMS) play a fundamental role in astrophysics due to their\nwinds and supernovae (SN), and their role as massive black hole (BH)\nprogenitors. However, their origin and evolution remain a significant\nchallenge. Recent theoretical work and observations suggest that VMS\napproaching the Eddington limit may experience mass loss above the standard\nwind predictions. This study investigates how enhanced winds influence single\nand binary VMS evolution, observable properties, and resulting BH populations.\nNew stellar wind prescriptions, sensitive to the Eddington parameter\n($\\Gamma_e$) and the luminosity-to-mass ratio, were implemented into the\nstellar evolution code PARSEC v2.0. These updated single-star tracks (100 - 600\nM$_{\\odot}$ at Z=0.006) were used to model the VMS population in the Tarantula\nNebula and integrated into the SEVN binary evolution code. The\n$\\Gamma_e$-enhanced single-star tracks match observed VMS properties better\nthan standard models. Explaining the most massive star, R136a1, through a\nsingle-star origin suggests a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass limit of $<$\n400 M$_{\\odot}$ regardless of the wind recipe used. However, binary stellar\nmergers also offer a suitable origin for R136a1 and other observed VMS,\npotentially lowering the upper ZAMS mass limit by ~100 M$_{\\odot}$. In\nbinaries, enhanced winds inhibit main-sequence stellar mergers and limit BH\nproduction above the pair-instability mass gap's lower edge (~50 M$_{\\odot}$).\nBinary BHs merging in a Hubble time with enhanced winds yield more primary BHs\nabove 30 M$_{\\odot}$ and enable secondary BHs between 30-40 solar masses, a\nrange not found with standard stellar winds at LMC metallicity. This study\nhighlights the crucial role that stellar winds and binary interactions play in\nVMS evolution and offers predictions relevant for interpreting VMS observations\nand gravitational wave source origins.",

Therefore a flow cell was used to enhance\nsignal detection in the effluent region. To validate the measurements and\nimprove understanding of reaction mechanisms, results were compared with two\nsimulation models: a pseudo-1D plug flow simulation and a 2D fluid simulation.\nThe plug flow simulation provided an effective means for estimating species\ndensities, with a fast computation time. The 2D simulation offered a more\nrealistic description of the flow dynamics, which proved critical to correctly\ndescribe the experimental trends. However, it requires long computation times\nto reach an equilibrium state in the flow cell. Otherwise, it leads to\ndiscrepancies to the experimental data.

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that the Milky Way (MW) underwent a major collision with\nthe Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy around cosmic noon. While GSE has\nsince been fully disrupted, it brought in ex situ stars and dynamically heated\nin situ stars into the halo. In addition, the gas-rich merger may have\ntriggered a burst of in situ star formation, potentially giving rise to a\nchemically distinct stellar component. We investigated the region of phase\nspace where stars formed during the GSE merger likely reside, and retain\ndistinct chemical and dynamical signatures. Building on our previous\ninvestigation of metallicity ([Fe/H]) and vertical angular momentum ($L_Z$)\ndistributions, we analysed spectroscopic samples from GALAH, APOGEE, SDSS, and\nLAMOST, combined with Gaia kinematics. We focused on high proper-motion stars\nas effective tracers of the phase-space volume likely influenced by the GSE\nmerger. To correct for selection effects, we incorporated metallicity estimates\nderived from SDSS and SMSS photometry. Our analysis reveals that low-$\\alpha$\nstars with GSE-like kinematics exhibit bimodality in [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] at\n$-1.0 \\lesssim {\\rm [Fe/H]} \\lesssim -0.4$. One group follows the low\nlight-element abundances of GSE stars, while another exhibits enhanced values.\nThese low-$\\alpha$, high-Na stars have eccentric orbits but are more confined\nto the inner MW. Eos overlaps with a high-eccentricity subset of these stars,\nimplying that it constitutes a smaller structure nested within the broader\npopulation. After correcting for sampling biases, we estimated a population\nratio of approximately 1:10 between the low-$\\alpha$, high-Na stars and the GSE\ndebris. These results suggest that the low-$\\alpha$, high-Na stars formed in a\ncompact region, likely fuelled by gas from the GSE progenitor, analogous to\nclumpy star-forming clouds seen in high-redshift galaxies.",

The final linear projection layer, mapping\nhidden states to vocabulary-sized logits, often constitutes a substantial\nportion of the model's parameters and computational cost during inference.\nExisting methods like adaptive softmax or hierarchical softmax introduce\nstructural complexities. In this paper, we propose VQ-Logits, a novel approach\nthat leverages Vector Quantization (VQ) to drastically reduce the parameter\ncount and computational load of the LLM output layer. VQ-Logits replaces the\nlarge V * dmodel output embedding matrix with a small, shared codebook of K\nembedding vectors (K << V ). Each token in the vocabulary is mapped to one of\nthese K codebook vectors. The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook,\nwhich are then efficiently \"scattered\" to the full vocabulary space using the\nlearned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on\nstandard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits\ncan achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in\nlogit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to\nfull softmax baselines.

To endow such bundles with\na compatible differential structure, one requires the coaction to extend as a\nmorphism of differential graded algebras. This leads to an exact noncommutative\nAtiyah sequence, a graded Hopf--Galois extension of differential forms and a\ncanonical braiding on total space forms such that the latter are graded-braided\ncommutative. We recall this approach to noncommutative differential geometry\nand further discuss the extension of quantum gauge transformations, in the\nsense of Brzezi\\'nski, to differential forms.

We then discuss how this challenges the security of the McEliece\ncryptosystem instantiated with this family of codes. The central object of our\nwork is the quadratic hull related to a linear code, defined as the\nintersection of all quadrics passing through the columns of a given generator\nor parity-check matrix, where the columns are considered as points in the\naffine or projective space. The geometric properties of this object reveal\nimportant information about the internal algebraic structure of the code. This\nis particularly evident in the case of generalized Reed-Solomon codes, whose\nquadratic hull is deeply linked to a well-known algebraic variety called the\nrational normal curve. By utilizing the concept of Weil restriction of affine\nvarieties, we demonstrate that the quadratic hull of a generic dual alternant\ncode inherits many interesting features from the rational normal curve, on\naccount of the fact that alternant codes are subfield-subcodes of generalized\nReed-Solomon codes. If the rate of the generic alternant code is sufficiently\nhigh, this allows us to construct a polynomial-time algorithm for retrieving\nthe underlying generalized Reed-Solomon code from which the alternant code is\ndefined, which leads to an efficient key-recovery attack against the McEliece\ncryptosystem when instantiated with this class of codes.

Awodey, Frey, and Speight (2018) used an extension of {\\lambda}C\nwith sigma-types, equality-types, and functional extensionality to provide\nSystem F style inductive types with an induction principle by encoding them as\na well-chosen subtype, making them initial algebras. In this thesis, we extend\ntheir results. We create a list and quotient type that have the desired\ninduction principles. We show that we can use the technique for general\ninductive types by defining W-types with an induction principle. We also take\nthe dual notion of their technique and create a coinductive stream type with\nthe desired coinduction principle (also called bisimulation). We finish by\nshowing that this dual approach can be extended to M-types, the generic notion\nof coinductive types, and the dual of W-types.",

This paper introduces a\nsignal-subspace-based framework that estimates decoupled angles, delays, and\ncomplex gain sequences (CGS)-- the target-reflected signals -- for multiple\ndynamic target paths. The proposed framework begins with a novel TO alignment\nalgorithm, leveraging signal subspace or covariance, to mitigate TO variations\nacross temporal snapshots, enabling coherent delay-domain analysis.\nSubsequently, subspace-based methods are developed to compensate for TO\nresiduals and to perform joint angle-delay estimation. Finally, leveraging the\nhigh resolution in the joint angle-delay domain, the framework compensates for\nthe PO and estimates the CGS for each target. The framework can be applied to\nboth single-antenna and multi-antenna systems. Extensive simulations and\nexperiments using commercial Wi-Fi devices demonstrate that the proposed\nframework significantly surpasses existing solutions in parameter estimation\naccuracy and delay resolution.

To question the applicability of the scaling law\nin time series forecasting, we propose Alinear, an ultra-lightweight\nforecasting model that achieves competitive performance using only k-level\nparameters.

Extensive experiments on seven benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that Alinear consistently outperforms large-scale models\nwhile using less than 1% of their parameters, maintaining strong accuracy\nacross both short and ultra-long forecasting horizons. Moreover, to more fairly\nevaluate model efficiency, we propose a new parameter-aware evaluation metric\nthat highlights the superiority of ALinear under constrained model budgets. Our\nanalysis reveals that the relative importance of trend and seasonal components\nvaries depending on data characteristics rather than following a fixed pattern,\nvalidating the necessity of our adaptive design.

Our analysis reveals\nthat noisy preferences are difficult for RMs to fit, as they cause sharp\ntraining fluctuations and irregular gradient updates.

Empirical studies demonstrate that policy LLM optimized with a\nreward model trained on the full preference dataset, which includes substantial\nnoise, performs worse than the one trained on a subset of exclusively high\nquality preferences.

For problems with high contrast in the diffusivity, it was found that\nit is beneficial to define a coarsening strategy based on the geometric mean of\nthe minimum and maximum diffusivity. However, other coarsening strategies may\nbe better for other smoothers. Several methods of discretising the coarse\nlevels were tested. Of these, it was best to use a method which averages the\nthermal resistivities on the finer levels. However, this was likely a\nconsequence of the fact that only one spatial dimension was considered for the\ntest problems. A second coarsening strategy was proposed which ensures spatial\nresolution on the coarse grids. Mixed results were found for this strategy. The\nproposed STMG methods were used as a solver for a one-dimensional topology\noptimisation problem. In this context, the adjoint problem was also solved\nusing the STMG methods.

    "abstract": "The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models\nopens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental\ncomplexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency\nand reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in\nits infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local\nexplainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ\nquantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus\nof this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an\nexplainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model\nentails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use\nof Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum\ntransformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result\nshows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as\nwell as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI\ntechniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more\nsignificantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY.\nThe implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route\nto improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting\ngreater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use\nof quantum-enhanced AI technology.\n  Our code and experiments are open-sourced at:\nhttps://github.com/GitsSaikat/QuXAI",

Accurate simulations of electrons in materials interacting\nwith quantum photon fluctuations of a cavity are crucial for understanding and\npredicting cavity-induced phenomena. In this article, we develop a\nnon-perturbative quantum electrodynamical approach based on a photon-free\nself-consistent Hartree-Fock framework to model the coupling between electrons\nand cavity photons in crystalline materials. We apply this theoretical approach\nto investigate graphene coupled to the vacuum field fluctuations of cavity\nphoton modes with different types of polarizations. The cavity photons\nintroduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, originating from the quantum\nnature of light, that lead to significant renormalization of the Dirac bands.\nIn contrast to the case of graphene coupled to a classical circularly polarized\nlight field, where a topological Dirac gap emerges, the nonlocal interactions\ninduced by a quantum linearly polarized photon mode give rise to the formation\nof flat bands and the opening of a topologically trivial Dirac gap. When two\nsymmetric cavity photon modes are introduced, Dirac cones remain gapless, but a\nFermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the relevant role of nonlocal\ninteractions. These effects disappear in the classical limit for coherent\nphoton modes. This new self-consistent theoretical framework paves the way for\nthe simulation of non-perturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled\nlight-matter systems, and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of novel\ncavity-induced quantum phenomena.",

These\nmerger-driven LGRBs may represent a distinct GRB population. Since traditional\nGRB classification methods often struggle to distinguish merger-driven LGRBs\nfrom traditional merger-driven short-duration GRBs resulting from compact\nobject mergers and collapse-driven LGRBs produced by massive stars, this work\naims to explore the shared properties in terms of hardness, energy, and\nduration among currently observed merger-driven LGRB events, thereby\nidentifying their observed differences from the traditional GRB population. We\ncollect a sample of merger-driven LGRBs with known redshifts, including\nobserved information on their main emission (ME) and whole emission (WE)\nphases. Treating ME and WE properties as two independent sets of information,\nwe apply several GRB classification methodologies to explore their potential\nshared properties. Using the phenomenologically defined Energy-Hardness (EH)\nparameter, we identify a probable universal linear correlation across\nmerger-driven LGRBs, regardless of whether their ME or WE phases are\nconsidered. We propose that such shared properties of merger-driven LGRBs are\nunlikely to arise from the low-redshift selection effect and they become\nparticularly intriguing when compared with the relatively weak correlations or\nlack of correlation observed in traditional merger-driven short-duration GRBs\n(with or without extended emissions) and collapse-driven LGRBs. Our newly\nproposed correlation highlights the necessity for further investigation into\nthe observations of merger-driven LGRBs and the physical mechanisms underlying\nthe empirical correlation.",

Previous\nstudies have shown that trade-offs among different resource utilization\nfunctions that cells cannot utilize broad types of substrates at near-maximum\nspeed are crucial for the emergence of diverse strategies. However, in natural\nsettings, nutrient availability often fluctuates over time, imposing additional\ntrade-offs on cells.

Simplifying the energy dependence of key resonant\nquantities allows for an analytical treatment of this KBM using the\nphysics-based ordering from the more general equations of Tang, Connor, and\nHastie [3]. Results are then compared with high-fidelity gyrokinetic\nsimulations for the (st)KBM in W7-X and the conventional KBM in a circular\ntokamak at both high and low magnetic shear, where good agreement is obtained\nin all cases. This reduced KBM model provides deeper insight into\n(sub-threshold) KBMs and their relationship with geometry, and shows promise\nfor aiding in transport model development and geometry-based turbulence\noptimization efforts going forward.",

    "abstract": "Federated domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model from\nmultiple decentralized source domains for deploying on the unseen target\ndomain. The style augmentation methods have achieved great progress on domain\ngeneralization. However, the existing style augmentation methods either explore\nthe data styles within isolated source domain or interpolate the style\ninformation across existing source domains under the data decentralization\nscenario, which leads to limited style space. To address this issue, we propose\na Multi-source Collaborative Style Augmentation and Domain-invariant learning\nmethod (MCSAD) for federated domain generalization. Specifically, we propose a\nmulti-source collaborative style augmentation module to generate data in the\nbroader style space. Furthermore, we conduct domain-invariant learning between\nthe original data and augmented data by cross-domain feature alignment within\nthe same class and classes relation ensemble distillation between different\nclasses to learn a domain-invariant model. By alternatively conducting\ncollaborative style augmentation and domain-invariant learning, the model can\ngeneralize well on unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple\ndomain generalization datasets indicate that our method significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art federated domain generalization methods.",

We consider $N$ agents grouped into $M$ clusters, where\neach cluster solves a stochastic bandit problem. The mapping between agents and\nbandits is a priori unknown. Each bandit is associated with $K$ arms, and the\ngoal is to identify the best arm for each agent under a $\\delta$-probably\ncorrect ($\\delta$-PC) framework, while minimizing sample complexity and\ncommunication overhead.\n  We propose two novel algorithms: Clustering then Best Arm Identification\n(Cl-BAI) and Best Arm Identification then Clustering (BAI-Cl). Cl-BAI uses a\ntwo-phase approach that first clusters agents based on the bandit problems they\nare learning, followed by identifying the best arm for each cluster. BAI-Cl\nreverses the sequence by identifying the best arms first and then clustering\nagents accordingly. Both algorithms leverage the successive elimination\nframework to ensure computational efficiency and high accuracy.\n  We establish $\\delta$-PC guarantees for both methods, derive bounds on their\nsample complexity, and provide a lower bound for this problem class. Moreover,\nwhen $M$ is small (a constant), we show that the sample complexity of a variant\nof BAI-Cl is minimax optimal in an order-wise sense.

Its versatility enables real-time\napplications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS\nfaces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as\npopping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in\ndisturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when\nrendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for\nVR.

In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine\nand extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR\nholistically.

    "abstract": "The mixing of scalar substances in fluid flows by stirring and diffusion is\nubiquitous in natural flows, chemical engineering, and microfluidic drug\ndelivery. Here, we present a spectral quantum algorithm for scalar mixing by\nsolving the advection-diffusion equation in a quantum computational fluid\ndynamics framework. We derive exact gate decompositions of the advection and\ndiffusion operators in spectral space. For all but the simplest one-dimensional\nflows, these operators do not commute. Therefore, we use operator splitting and\nconstruct quantum circuits capable of simulating arbitrary polynomial velocity\nprofiles, such as the Blasius profile of a laminar boundary layer. Periodic,\nNeumann, and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be imposed with the appropriate\nquantum spectral transform plus additional constraints on the Fourier\nexpansion. We evaluate our approach in statevector simulations of a Couette\nflow, plane Poiseuille flow, and a polynomial Blasius profile approximation to\ndemonstrate its potential and versatility for scalar mixing in shear flows. The\nnumber of gates grows with, at most, the cubed logarithm of the number of grid\npoints. This evaluation shows that spectral accuracy allows comparably large\ntime steps even though the operator splitting limits the temporal order.",

Detecting more\nexoplanets experiencing such interactions, with orbits evolving on short\ntimescales, is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of the underlying\nphysical mechanisms. For this purpose, we performed a new search for close-in\nnon-transiting substellar companions in the Kepler data, focusing on orbital\nperiods below 2.3 days. We focused on main-sequence solar-type stars and\nsubgiant stars for which a surface rotation period was measured. For each star,\nwe looked for an excess in the power spectral density of the light curve, which\ncould correspond to the signature of a close-in non-transiting companion. We\ncompared our candidates with existing catalogues to eliminate potential\ncontaminants in our sample, and we visually inspected the phase-folded light\ncurve and its wavelet decomposition. We identify 88 stars exhibiting a\nsignature consistent with the presence of a close non-transiting substellar\ncompanion. We show that the objects in our sample are located mostly within the\ndearth zone, emphasising the importance of performing follow-up of such systems\nin order to gather observational evidence of star-planet interactions.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G\napplications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart\nmanufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing\nmodels require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across\ndeployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless\nlocalization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL)\ntasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on\ninformation bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a\npretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model\n(LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three\ncomplementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling\n(SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii)\nposition-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly\ncapture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple\nperspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks,\nincluding time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation,\nsingle base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization.\nComprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses\nboth model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization\ntasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer\nmodels without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under\nlabel-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its\npotential as a foundation model for wireless localization.",

    "abstract": "Neptune-sized exoplanets are key targets for atmospheric studies, yet their\nformation and evolution remain poorly understood due to their diverse\ncharacteristics and limited sample size. The so-called \"Neptune desert\", a\nregion of parameter space with a dearth of short-period sub- to super-Neptunes,\nis a critical testbed for theories of atmospheric escape and migration. The\nHONEI program aims to confirm and characterize the best Neptune-sized\ncandidates for composition, atmospheric and population studies. By measuring\nplanetary masses with high precision, we want to provide the community with\noptimal targets whose atmosphere can be effectively explored with the JWST or\nby ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy. For this purpose, we started a\nradial velocity follow-up campaign, using the twin high-precision spectrographs\nHARPS and HARPS-N, to measure the masses of TESS Neptune-sized candidates and\nconfirm their planetary nature. In this first paper of the series, we confirm\nthe planetary nature of two candidates: TOI-5800b and TOI-5817b. TOI-5800b is a\nhot sub-Neptune ($R_p=2.44\\pm0.29$ $R_\\oplus$, $M_p=9.4\\pm1.8$ $M_\\oplus$,\n$T_{eq} = 1108\\pm20$ K) located at the lower edges of the Neptune desert\n($P=2.628$ days) and is the most eccentric planet ($e\\sim0.3$) ever found\nwithin $P<3$ d. TOI-5800b is expected to be still in the tidal migration phase\nwith its parent star, a K3 V dwarf ($V=9.6$ mag), although its eccentricity\ncould arise from interactions with another object in the system. Having a\nhigh-transmission spectroscopy metric ($TSM\\sim103$), it represents a prime\ntarget for future atmospheric characterization.

However, the\nspontaneous response of numerous SNs to the UAV's WuC can lead to significant\npacket loss and collisions, as WuR does not exhibit its superiority for\nhigh-traffic loads. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative\nreceiver-initiated WuR UAV-assisted clustering (RI-WuR-UAC) medium access\ncontrol (MAC) protocol to achieve low latency and high reliability in ultra-low\npower consumption applications. We model the proposed protocol using the\n$M/G/1/2$ queuing framework and derive expressions for key performance metrics,\ni.e., channel busyness probability, probability of successful clustering,\naverage SN energy consumption, and average transmission delay. The RI-WuR-UAC\nprotocol employs three distinct data flow models, tailored to different network\ntraffic conditions, which perform three MAC mechanisms: channel assessment\n(CCA) clustering for light traffic loads, backoff plus CCA clustering for dense\nand heavy traffic, and adaptive clustering for variable traffic loads.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the RI-WuR-UAC protocol significantly\noutperforms the benchmark sub-carrier modulation clustering protocol. By\nvarying the network load, we capture the trade-offs among the performance\nmetrics, showcasing the superior efficiency and reliability of the RI-WuR-UAC\nprotocol.",

Moreover, leveraging $\\epsilon$-covering\ntheory, we reveal an intrinsic trade-off between these objectives and quantify\ntheir optimal attainment levels under a fixed budget. To practically handle\nthis trade-off, we propose Multi-Objective Balanced Covering (MoB), which\nreformulates visual token pruning as a bi-objective covering problem. In this\nframework, the attainment trade-off reduces to budget allocation via greedy\nradius trading.

To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named\nMiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design\nparadigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov\nDecision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling\nthrough a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer.\nOption Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware\nstrategies by interacting with constructed environments.

Extensive experiments on\nreal-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\\%\ncompetitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual\nmachines.

In this work, we explore the ensemble\nof $t$-doped Clifford circuits on $n$ qubits, consisting of Clifford circuits\ninterspersed with $t$ single-qubit non-Clifford gates. We establish rigorous\nconvergence bounds towards unitary $k$-designs, revealing the intrinsic cost in\nterms of non-Clifford resources in various flavors. First, we analyze the\n$k$-th order frame potential, which quantifies how well the ensemble of doped\nClifford circuits is spread within the unitary group. We prove that a quadratic\ndoping level, $t = \\tilde{\\Theta}(k^2)$, is both necessary and sufficient to\napproximate the frame potential of the full unitary group. As a consequence, we\nrefine existing upper bounds on the convergence of the ensemble towards state\n$k$-designs. Second, we derive tight bounds on the convergence of $t$-doped\nClifford circuits towards relative-error $k$-designs, showing that $t =\n\\tilde{\\Theta}(nk)$ is both necessary and sufficient for the ensemble to form a\nrelative $\\varepsilon$-approximate $k$-design. Similarly, $t =\n\\tilde{\\Theta}(n)$ is required to generate pseudo-random unitaries. All these\nresults highlight that generating random unitaries is extremely costly in terms\nof non-Clifford resources, and that such ensembles fundamentally lie beyond the\nclassical simulability barrier.

However, such capabilities are prone to potential misuse,\nsuch as fake news generation, spam email creation, and misuse in academic\nassignments. As a result, accurate detection of AI-generated text and\nidentification of the model that generated it are crucial for maintaining the\nresponsible use of LLMs. In this work, we addressed two sub-tasks put forward\nby the Defactify workshop under AI-Generated Text Detection shared task at the\nAssociation for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025): Task A\ninvolved distinguishing between human-authored or AI-generated text, while Task\nB focused on attributing text to its originating language model. For each task,\nwe proposed two neural architectures: an optimized model and a simpler variant.\nFor Task A, the optimized neural architecture achieved fifth place with $F1$\nscore of 0.994, and for Task B, the simpler neural architecture also ranked\nfifth place with $F1$ score of 0.627.",

In the former case, a\nweak-form implementation pySINDy is used. Time-dependent data for two- (2D) and\nthree-dimensional (3D) DNS simulation of Rayleigh-Benard convection and\nconvective plane Couette flow is generated using the Dedalus PDE framework for\nspectrally solving differential equations. Using pySINDy we are able to recover\nthe governing equations of 2D models of Rayleigh-Benard convection at Rayleigh\nnumbers, R, from laminar, through transitional to moderately turbulent flow\nconditions, albeit with increasing difficulty with larger Rayleigh number,\nespecially in recovery of the diffusive terms (with coefficient magnitude\nproportional to 1/R^0.5). SPIDER requires a much smaller library of terms and\nwe are able to recover more easily the governing equations for a wider range of\nR in 2D and 3D convection and plane flow models and go on to recover\nconstraints (the incompressibility condition) and boundary conditions,\ndemonstrating the benefits and capabilities of SPIDER to go beyond pySINDy for\nthese fluid problems governed by second-order PDEs.

The DHMC was proposed in [Biometrika, 107(2)] for\ndiscontinuous potential where the variable has a fixed dimension. When the\ndimension changes, there is no clear explanation of the volume-preserving\nproperty, and the conservation of energy is also not necessary. We use a random\nsampling for the extra dimensions, which corresponds to a measure transform. We\nshow that when the energy is corrected suitably for the trans-dimensional\nHamiltonian dynamics, the detailed balance condition is then satisfied. For the\ngrand canonical ensemble, such a procedure can be explained very naturally to\nbe the extra free energy change brought by the newly added particles, which\njustifies the rationality of our approach. To sample the grand canonical\nensemble for interacting particle systems, the DHMC is then combined with the\nrandom batch method to yield an efficient sampling method. In experiments, we\nshow that the proposed DHMC combined with the random batch method generates\nsamples with much less correlation when compared with the traditional\nMetropolis-Hastings method.",

The intricate interactions arising between the crossflow and the\ninjected jet induce complex flow phenomena, including shock waves and vortical\nstructures, the characteristics of which are significantly contingent upon the\nthermophysical properties of the injected fuel. While prior investigations have\naddressed the influence of various fuels, a knowledge gap persists concerning\nthe behaviour of alternative and synthetic multicomponent fuels within this\nflow regime. The present work employs high-fidelity large-eddy simulations\n(LES) to examine the impact of ten distinct fuels-hydrogen, methane, ethylene,\nammonia, syngas mixture, and a synthetic blend, alongside several NH3/H2/N2\nmixtures-on the macroscopic flow structures and mixing attributes within a\ntransverse sonic jet immersed in a Mach 2 crossflow. By maintaining a uniform\nmomentum flux ratio across the investigated cases, the study aims to isolate\nthe influence of the unique thermophysical properties of each fuel on the\nwindward mixing layer, a region critically important for initial entrainment\nprocesses. The investigation quantifies the effects of molecular weight, heat\ncapacity ratio, and density on the development and evolution of coherent\nstructures through a detailed examination of instantaneous flow fields, vortex\ndynamics, scalar distributions, and turbulence statistics.

We performed\nvesiculation experiments on rhyolitic glass in a spatially confined,\ncylindrical, conduit-like geometry. The amount of shear experienced by the\nsample is controlled by varying the sample and confining diameters to allow for\nvarious degrees of free (isotropic) followed by confined (anisotropic)\nexpansion. Pore anisotropy develops sub-parallel to the flow direction. We\nmeasure the total and connected porosity and permeability of the vesiculated\nsamples. We observe two regimes of behavior for samples dominated by 1)\nisotropic expansion, in which the onset of percolation corresponds with the\nbeginning of shear deformation and 2) anisotropic expansion which shows low\npercolation thresholds (<20%) with a near-constant permeability even with\nincreasing porosity. We find a good correlation between connected porosity and\npermeability, with distinct trends for sheared and unsheared samples.

The standard approach models this problem as a mixed-integer\nquadratic program and relies on commercial solvers to find the optimal\nsolution.

A mathematical analysis and numerical tests show that\nthe resulting isogeometric approximation achieves optimal convergence rates\nwith suitable grading parameters.\n  Polar parameterizations, however, suffer from a lack of regularity at the\npolar point, making existing standard isogeometric approximation theory\ninapplicable. To address this, a new framework is developed for deriving error\nestimates on polar domains with corners. This involves the construction of\npolar function spaces on the parametric domain and a modified projection\noperator onto the space of $C^0$-smooth polar splines. The theoretical results\nare verified by numerical experiments confirming both the accuracy and\nefficiency of the proposed approach.",

While their impact on their surroundings -\nfrom the interstellar medium to the circumgalactic medium - is well recognized,\nthe specific mechanisms remain uncertain. In this study we analyze deep Keck\nCosmic Web Imager observations of the Lyman-alpha (Lya) halo surrounding the\nradio-loud quasar at the center of the cluster CARLA J1017+6116 at redshift z =\n2.8. As is known from previous observations, the cluster hosts a high fraction\nof early-type galaxies, and the star formation of its spectroscopically\nconfirmed cluster members is typical of or higher than that of galaxies on the\nmain sequence. We find that the Lya halo extends at least 16 arcsec (128 pkpc)\ndown to a surface brightness level of 1e-19 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, with a total\nobserved Lya luminosity of log10(L/Lsun) = 43.35 +- 0.05. The halo has distinct\nkinematic regions with asymmetries suggestive of complex interactions between\nthe quasar and the intracluster medium, possibly driven by a combination of\nbiconical feedback and episodic activity. Despite the quasar classification,\nour reanalysis of very long baseline interferometry data finds no evidence of\nextended jet structures; we instead find compact and variable radio emission\nthat could indicate episodic jet activity or suppression by the dense\ninterstellar medium. Combining these observations with imaging obtained with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope, we identified one Lya-emitting source within the\nquasar halo. While mechanical feedback from a jet appears limited or episodic,\nradiative feedback likely plays a dominant role in shaping the extended Lya\nhalo, highlighting the complex interplay between quasar-driven processes and\nthe surrounding dense environment.",

    "abstract": "The hysteretic snapping under lateral forcing of a compressed, buckled beam\nis fundamental for many devices and mechanical metamaterials. For a single-tip\nlateral pusher, an important limitation is that snapping requires the pusher to\ncross the centerline of the beam. Here, we show that dual-tip pushers allow\naccelerated snapping, where the beam snaps before the pusher reaches the\ncenterline. As a consequence, we show that when a buckled beam under increased\ncompression comes in contact with a dual-tip pusher, it can snap to the\nopposite direction -- this is impossible with a single-tip pusher.\nAdditionally, we reveal a novel two-step snapping regime, in which the beam\nsequentially loses contact with the two tips of the dual-tip pusher. To\ncharacterize this class of snapping instabilities, we employ a systematic modal\nexpansion of the beam shape. This expansion allows us to capture and analyze\nthe transition from one-step to two-step snapping geometrically. Finally we\ndemonstrate how to maximize the distance between the pusher and the beam's\ncenterline at the moment of snapping. Together, our work opens up a new avenue\nfor quantitatively and qualitatively controlling and modifying the snapping of\nbuckled beams, with potential applications in mechanical sensors, actuators,\nand metamaterials.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly\nadvanced transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models\nwith limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their\nability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal\nRepresentation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable,\nmodality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected\ninto both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more\neffective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize\nclass token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder\nlayers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving\ngeneral knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and\nrepresentation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is\napplied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection\nlayer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To\nfurther promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning\nclass and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference,\na decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base\ntasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger\ngeneralization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient\nand interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters\nand enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of\nrepresentation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific\ninformation to propagate more effectively through the network. Extensive\nexperiments on 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL and MMRL++ consistently\noutperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving a strong balance between\ntask-specific adaptation and generalization.",

    "abstract": "We provide a dual fitting technique on a semidefinite program yielding simple\nproofs of tight bounds for the robust price of anarchy of several congestion\nand scheduling games under the sum of weighted completion times objective. The\nsame approach also allows to bound the approximation ratio of local search\nalgorithms for the scheduling problem $R || \\sum w_j C_j$. All of our results\nare obtained through a simple unified dual fitting argument on the same\nsemidefinite programming relaxation, which can essentially be obtained through\nthe first round of the Lasserre/Sum of Squares hierarchy.\n  As our main application, we show that the known coordination ratio bounds of\nrespectively $4, (3 + \\sqrt{5})/2 \\approx 2.618,$ and $32/15 \\approx 2.133$ for\nthe scheduling game $R || \\sum w_j C_j$ under the coordination mechanisms\nSmith's Rule, Proportional Sharing and Rand (STOC 2011) can be extended to\ncongestion games and obtained through this approach. For the natural\nrestriction where the weight of each player is proportional to its processing\ntime on every resource, we show that the last bound can be improved from 2.133\nto 2. This improvement can also be made for general instances when considering\nthe price of anarchy of the game, rather than the coordination ratio. As a\nfurther application of the technique, we show that it recovers the tight bound\nof $(3 + \\sqrt{5})/2$ for the price of anarchy of weighted affine congestion\ngames and the Kawaguchi-Kyan bound of $(1+ \\sqrt{2})/2$ for the pure price of\nanarchy of $P || \\sum w_j C_j$. In addition, this approach recovers the known\ntight approximation ratio of $(3 + \\sqrt{5})/2 \\approx 2.618$ for a natural\nlocal search algorithm for $R || \\sum w_j C_j$, as well as the best currently\nknown combinatorial approximation algorithm for this problem achieving an\napproximation ratio of $(5 + \\sqrt{5})/4 + \\varepsilon \\approx 1.809 +\n\\varepsilon$.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical triple systems play a crucial role in various astrophysical\ncontexts, and therefore the understanding of their stability is important.\nTraditional empirical stability criteria rely on a threshold value of $Q$, the\nratio between the outer orbit's pericenter distance and the inner orbit's\nsemi-major axis. However, determining a single critical value of $Q$ is\nimpossible because there is a range of the value of $Q$ for which both stable\nand unstable systems exist, referred to as the mixed-region. In this study, we\nintroduce a novel method to assess the stability of triple systems within this\nmixed-region. We numerically integrate equal-mass, coplanar hierarchical\ntriples within the mixed-region. By performing Fourier analysis of the time\nevolution of the semi-major axes ratio during the first 1000 inner orbital\nperiods of the systems, we find notable features in stable systems: if the main\npeaks are periodically spaced in the frequency domain and the continuous\ncomponents and irregularly spaced peaks are small, the system tends to be\nstable. This observation indicates that the evolution of stable triples is more\nperiodic than that of unstable ones. We quantified the periodicity of the\ntriples and investigated the correlation between the Fourier power distribution\nand the system's lifetime. Using this correlation, we show that it is possible\nto determine if a triple system in the mixed-region is stable or not with very\nhigh accuracy. These findings suggest that periodicity in orbital evolution can\nserve as a robust indicator of stability for hierarchical triples.",

Evaluation results on LiveCodeBench (20240701-20240901) demonstrate that\nour COT-Coder-7B-StepDPO, derived from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base, with a pass@1\naccuracy of 21.88, exceeds all models with similar or even larger sizes.\nFurthermore, our COT-Coder-32B-StepDPO, based on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Base,\nexhibits superior performance with a pass@1 accuracy of 35.08, outperforming\nGPT4O on the benchmark. Overall, CRPE represents a comprehensive, open-source\nmethod that encompasses the complete pipeline from instruction data acquisition\nthrough expert code reasoning data synthesis, culminating in an autonomous\nreasoning enhancement mechanism.",

Analytical derivations, supported by simulations,\nshow that the MIMO processing improves the maximum near-field sensing range and\nresolution by approximately a factor of 1.4 compared to a single-aperture\nsystem. Using a quadratic approximation of the mainlobe of the array factor, an\nanalytical improvement factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ is derived, validating the\nnumerical results.

    "abstract": "Muon Spin Rotation/Relaxation/Resonance ($\\mu$SR) is a versatile and powerful\nnon-destructive technology for investigating the magnetic properties of\nmaterials at the microscopic level. The $\\mu$SR technique typically utilizes\nfully spin polarized beams of positive muons generated at particle accelerator\nfacilities and measures the evolution of the muon spin polarization inside a\nsample to extract information about the local magnetic environment in\nmaterials. With the development of accelerator technologies, intensities of\nmuon beams are being continuously improved, which will cause a pile-up problem\nto the $\\mu$SR spectrometer. The first muon source in China, named MELODY, is\ncurrently under construction and will be a pulsed source of muons operated at a\nrepetition frequency of only 1 Hz due to limitations of the accelerator system\nat CSNS. Consequently, there is a strong motivation to operate MELODY at\nsignificantly higher muon intensities. This necessitates an upgrade of the\ndetector system inside the spectrometer, which should be smaller and faster to\naccommodate the increased intensity per pulse of muons. The Low Gain Avalanche\nDiode (LGAD), characterized by a typical pulse width of 2 ns and a segmentation\nsize in the centimeters range, has the potential to significantly improve the\ncounting rates of $\\mu$SR spectrometers that utilize a high intensity pulsed\nmuon source. Thus, it is expected that the LGAD detector is a promising\ncandidate to enhance the performance of $\\mu$SR spectrometers at the new MELODY\nmuon source.To validate this, tests on the LGAD were conducted at the ISIS\npulsed muon source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. This paper will\ndescribe the setup of the candidate LGAD devices and the subsequent analysis of\nthe experiment data.",

The IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection\ndataset, which includes more than 590,000 real transaction records, was used to\nevaluate the proposed model. The model achieved a high performance with an\naccuracy of 99% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.99, outperforming several recent\nrelated approaches.

Spectro-interferometry covering the Br$\\gamma$\nline was then used to obtain high-angular-resolution information about the\ndominant magnetospheric cloud in corotation with the magnetic Ab component. The\ncombination of the astrometric orbital solution with the published radial\nvelocities for both components led to a 3-dimensional orbital solution,\ndynamical masses, and a dynamical parallax, revealing a good agreement with\nprevious estimates and confirming the previously inferred alignment of the\norbital axis and the rotation axis of the Ab component, albeit at a much higher\nprecision. Detailed analysis of the Br$\\gamma$ spectrointerferometry then\nrevealed the changing position of the magnetospheric cloud relative to the Ab\ncomponent. Comparison to the location of the cloud predicted from $\\rho$ Oph\nAb's oblique rotator model and H$\\alpha$ emission properties demonstrated\nexcellent agreement. We are additionally able to demonstrate that the magnetic\nstar exhibits prograde rotation. This represents the first time that the motion\nof a centrifugal magnetosphere has been detected in angularly resolved\nobservations.",

In this work, we systematically study the production and detection\nprospects of light ALPs at future lepton colliders, including electron-positron\nand multi-TeV muon colliders. At lepton colliders, light ALPs can be produced\nin association with a photon or a $Z$ boson. For very light ALPs ($m_a < 1$\nMeV), the ALPs are typically long-lived and escape detection, leading to a\nmono-$V$ ($V = \\gamma, Z$) signature. In the long-lived limit, we find that the\nmono-photon channel at the Tera-$Z$ stage of future electron-positron colliders\nprovides the strongest constraints on ALP couplings to SM gauge bosons,\n$g_{aVV}$, thanks to the high luminosity, low background, and resonant\nenhancement from on-shell $Z$ bosons. At higher energies, the mono-photon cross\nsection becomes nearly energy-independent, and the sensitivity is governed by\nluminosity and background. At multi-TeV muon colliders, the mono-$Z$ channel\ncan yield complementary constraints. For heavier ALPs ($m_a > 100$ MeV) that\ndecay promptly, mono-$V$ signatures are no longer valid. In this case, ALPs can\nbe probed via non-resonant vector boson scattering (VBS) processes, where the\nALP is exchanged off-shell, leading to kinematic deviations from SM\nexpectations. We analyze constraints from both light-by-light scattering and\nelectroweak VBS, the latter only accessible at TeV-scale colliders. While\ngenerally weaker, these constraints are robust and model-independent. Our\ncombined analysis shows that mono-$V$ and non-resonant VBS channels provide\npowerful and complementary probes of ALP-gauge boson interactions.",

State-of-the-art imitation learning (IL) approaches typically\nleverage Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP), which, despite their impressive\nresults, suffer from two key limitations. They are prone to mode collapse,\nwhich often leads to overfitting to the simulation environment and thus\nincreased sim-to-real gap, and they struggle to learn diverse behaviors\neffectively. To overcome these limitations, we introduce APEX (Action Priors\nenable Efficient eXploration): a simple yet versatile IL framework that\nintegrates demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL),\nmaintaining high exploration while grounding behavior with expert-informed\npriors. We achieve this through a combination of decaying action priors, which\ninitially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the\npolicy to explore independently. This is complemented by a multi-critic RL\nframework that effectively balances stylistic consistency with task\nperformance. Our approach achieves sample-efficient IL and enables the\nacquisition of diverse skills within a single policy. APEX generalizes to\nvarying velocities and preserves reference-like styles across complex tasks\nsuch as navigating rough terrain and climbing stairs, utilizing only\nflat-terrain kinematic motion data as a prior. We validate our framework\nthrough extensive hardware experiments on the Unitree Go2 quadruped. There,\nAPEX yields diverse and agile locomotion gaits, inherent gait transitions, and\nthe highest reported speed for the platform to the best of our knowledge (peak\nvelocity of ~3.3 m/s on hardware). Our results establish APEX as a compelling\nalternative to existing IL methods, offering better efficiency, adaptability,\nand real-world performance. https://marmotlab.github.io/APEX/",

To achieve this objective, we draw on several non-equilibrium and\nnear-equilibrium databases from the literature, and employ a methodology based\non the selection of PG parameters that capture the local direct impact and the\nlocal disequilibration effect of the PG. The pressure force impact on the inner\nand outer regions is represented by two parameters: the friction-viscous PG\nparameter, $\\beta_i$, and the PG parameter based on Zagarola-Smits velocity,\n$\\beta_{ZS}$. In the non-equilibrium flow cases, both $\\beta_i$ and\n$\\beta_{ZS}$ exhibit similar distributions, initially increasing and then\ndecreasing. However, the rate of change of these parameters along the\nstreamwise direction varies among the flows, indicating differing levels of\npressure force disequilibration. In the outer layer, it is found that both the\nlocal and cumulative disequilibrating effects modify the mean velocity and\nReynolds stress profiles at identical $\\beta_{ZS}$ values. In the inner layer,\nwhich responds much faster to changes in pressure force, the local\ndisequilibrating effect still modifies the mean velocity profile in the viscous\nsublayer. Notably, when the mean velocity defect is significant, the behavior\nof u-structures in the inner layer appears to be governed by how outer\nturbulence responds to pressure force effects. In contrast, the size of\nuv-structures in the inner layer scales with the mixed pressure-friction\nlength.

Method: To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach\nSVA-ICL, which leverages in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM performance.\nOur approach involves the selection of high-quality demonstrations for ICL\nthrough information fusion, incorporating both source code and vulnerability\ndescriptions. For source code, we consider semantic, lexical, and syntactic\nsimilarities, while for vulnerability descriptions, we focus on textual\nsimilarity. Based on the selected demonstrations, we construct context prompts\nand consider DeepSeek-V2 as the LLM for SVA-ICL. Results: We evaluate the\neffectiveness of SVA-ICL using a large-scale dataset comprising 12,071 C/C++\nvulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SVA-ICL outperforms\nstate-of-the-art SVA baselines in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC\nmeasures. Furthermore, ablation studies highlight the significance of component\ncustomization in SVA-ICL, such as the number of demonstrations, the\ndemonstration ordering strategy, and the optimal fusion ratio of different\nmodalities. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that leveraging ICL with\ninformation fusion can effectively improve the effectiveness of LLM-based SVA,\nwarranting further research in this direction.",

A major challenge is that the optimal consensus ranking\nmight be biased against individual candidates or groups, especially those from\nmarginalized communities. This concern has led to recent studies focusing on\nfairness in rank aggregation. The goal is to ensure that candidates from\ndifferent groups are fairly represented in the top-$k$ positions of the\naggregated ranking.\n  We study this fair rank aggregation problem by considering the Kendall tau as\nthe underlying metric. While we know of a polynomial-time approximation scheme\n(PTAS) for the classical rank aggregation problem, the corresponding fair\nvariant only possesses a quite straightforward 3-approximation algorithm due to\nWei et al., SIGMOD'22, and Chakraborty et al., NeurIPS'22, which finds closest\nfair ranking for each input ranking and then simply outputs the best one.\n  In this paper, we first provide a novel algorithm that achieves\n$(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation (for any $\\epsilon > 0$), significantly improving\nover the 3-approximation bound. Next, we provide a $2.881$-approximation fair\nrank aggregation algorithm that works irrespective of the fairness notion,\ngiven one can find a closest fair ranking, beating the 3-approximation bound.\nWe complement our theoretical guarantee by performing extensive experiments on\nvarious real-world datasets to establish the effectiveness of our algorithm\nfurther by comparing it with the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms.",

This advancement has led to the emergence of\ndigital twin as a service (DTaaS), enabling users to interact with DT models\nthat accurately reflect the real-time status of their physical counterparts.\nQuality of DTaaS primarily depends on the freshness of DT data, which can be\nquantified by the age of information (AoI). The reliance on remote cloud\nservers solely for DTaaS provisioning presents significant challenges for\nlatency-sensitive applications with strict AoI demands. Edge computing, as a\npromising paradigm, is expected to enable the AoI-aware provision of real-time\nDTaaS for users. In this paper, we study the joint optimization of DT model\ndeployment and DT model selection for DTaaS provisioning over edge computing,\nwith the objective of maximizing the quality of DTaaS. To address the\nuncertainties of DT interactions imposed on DTaaS provisioning, we propose a\nnovel distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based approach, called\nWasserstein DRO (WDRO), where we first reformulate the original problem to a\nrobust optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the quality of\nDTaaS under the unforeseen extreme request conditions. Then, we leverage\nmulti-level dual transformations based on Wasserstein distance to derive a\nrobust solution.

Here, to the\nbest of our knowledge, we experimentally demonstrate the first intelligent\nconfiguration of IMPF featuring wideband center frequency tunability, flexible\nbandwidth reconfigurability, self-stabilization, and excellent channel\nequalization simultaneously. The configuration is enabled by our proposed\nuniversal hybrid collaboration strategy, which can fully unleash the hardware\npotential of the optical device, thus enabling comprehensive synergy of\nmultiple properties. Results show that the center frequency of IMPF is tuned\nfrom 2 to 48 GHz, covering microwave S- to Ka-bands, and the bandwidth is\nreconfigured from 0.66 to 4.15 GHz, with a rejection ratio of up to 37.67 dB.\nThe roll-off rate and shape factor reach as high as 17.50 dB/GHz and 0.78,\nrespectively. Meanwhile, the maximum center frequency drift of IMPF in 3 hours\nis reduced from 11.950 to 0.051 GHz even without a thermo-electric cooler,\nindicating that the center frequency stability is enhanced by 234 times. The\npassband shape of the IMPF can also be dynamically adjusted to equalize\nfrequency-dependent fading, achieving up to 2.42 dB compensation of\nintra-channel fading.

Most existing approaches have\nadopted sparse binary supervision, indicating whether a pair of images and\nsentences matches or not. However, such sparse supervision covers a limited\nsubset of image-text relationships, neglecting their inherent many-to-many\ncorrespondences; an image can be described in numerous texts at different\ndescriptive levels. Moreover, existing approaches overlook the implicit\nconnections from general to specific descriptions, which form the underlying\nrationale for the many-to-many relationships between vision and language.

We formulate the descriptiveness score of\neach sentence with cumulative term frequency-inverse document frequency\n(TF-IDF) to balance the pairwise similarity according to the keywords in the\nsentence. Our method leverages sentence descriptiveness to learn robust\nimage-text matching in two key ways: (1) to refine the false negative labeling,\ndynamically relaxing the connectivity between positive and negative pairs, and\n(2) to build more precise matching, aligning a set of relevant sentences in a\ngeneric-to-specific order. By moving beyond rigid binary supervision, DITM\nenhances the discovery of both optimal matches and potential positive pairs.\nExtensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, and CxC datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in representing complex image-text relationships\ncompared to state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper, we\nfirstly use different localized shadow circuit VSQC models to achieve the\nbinary classification task on the MNIST dataset, and our design of strongly\nentangled shadow circuits performs the best in terms of classification\naccuracy. The VSQC-WOA model is then used to multi-classify the MNIST dataset\n(three classifications as an example), and the effectiveness of the proposed\nVSQC-WOA model as well as the robustness and generalization ability of the\nmodel are verified through various comparison experiments.",

The resonator system has $in$-$situ$ actuators that allow\nquadrupolar distortions of the resonator shape to be controllably tuned, as\nthese compete with the much smaller perturbations that arise from TRSB. The\nmost reliable way to the detect the TRSB signal is by interrogating the\ntwo-mode resonator system with circularly polarized microwaves, in which case\nthe presence of TRSB shows up unambiguously as a difference between the forward\nand reverse transmission response of the resonator - i.e., as a breaking of\nreciprocity.

While existing\ncar-following models often struggle to consistently provide rigorous safety\nproofs alongside human-like acceleration and deceleration patterns, we\nintroduce a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model. This model\nis designed to balance safety and performance by incorporating bounded\nacceleration and deceleration rates while emulating key human driving\nprinciples. Building upon a foundation of fundamental driving principles and a\nmulti-phase dynamical systems analysis (detailed in Part 1 of this study\n\\citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part1}), we first highlight the limitations of extending\nstandard models like Newell's with simple bounded deceleration.

The proposed parsimonious model combines an extended\nNewell's model for nominal driving with a new control law for scenarios\nrequiring projected braking. Using speed-spacing phase plane analysis, we\nprovide rigorous mathematical proofs of the model's adherence to defined safe\nand human-like driving principles, including collision-free operation, bounded\ndeceleration, and acceptable safe stopping distance, under reasonable initial\nconditions.

This article applies\nmulti-phase dynamical systems analysis to well-known car-following models to\nhighlight the characteristics and limitations of existing approaches. We begin\nby formulating fundamental principles for safe and human-like car-following\nbehaviors, which include zeroth-order principles for comfort and minimum jam\nspacings, first-order principles for speeds and time gaps, and second-order\nprinciples for comfort acceleration/deceleration bounds as well as braking\nprofiles.

We then analyze the performance of the Intelligent Driver Model\nand the Gipps model. Through this analysis, we highlight the limitations of\nthese models with respect to some of the aforementioned principles.

    "abstract": "Achieving animal-like agility is a longstanding goal in quadrupedal robotics.\nWhile recent studies have successfully demonstrated imitation of specific\nbehaviors, enabling robots to replicate a broader range of natural behaviors in\nreal-world environments remains an open challenge. Here we propose an\nintegrated controller comprising a Basic Behavior Controller (BBC) and a\nTask-Specific Controller (TSC) which can effectively learn diverse natural\nquadrupedal behaviors in an enhanced simulator and efficiently transfer them to\nthe real world. Specifically, the BBC is trained using a novel semi-supervised\ngenerative adversarial imitation learning algorithm to extract diverse\nbehavioral styles from raw motion capture data of real dogs, enabling smooth\nbehavior transitions by adjusting discrete and continuous latent variable\ninputs. The TSC, trained via privileged learning with depth images as input,\ncoordinates the BBC to efficiently perform various tasks. Additionally, we\nemploy evolutionary adversarial simulator identification to optimize the\nsimulator, aligning it closely with reality. After training, the robot exhibits\ndiverse natural behaviors, successfully completing the quadrupedal agility\nchallenge at an average speed of 1.1 m/s and achieving a peak speed of 3.2 m/s\nduring hurdling. This work represents a substantial step toward animal-like\nagility in quadrupedal robots, opening avenues for their deployment in\nincreasingly complex real-world environments.",

    "abstract": "To decode a short linear block code, ordered statics decoding (OSD) and/or\nthe $A^*$ decoding are usually considered. Either OSD or the $A^*$ decoding\nutilizes the magnitudes of the received symbols to establish the most reliable\nand independent positions (MRIP) frame. A restricted searched space can be\nemployed to achieve near-optimum decoding with reduced decoding complexity. For\na low-rate code with large minimum distance, the restricted search space is\nstill very huge.\n  We propose to use concatenated coding to further restrict the search space by\nproposing an improved MRIP frame. The improved MRIP frame is founded according\nto magnitudes of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) obtained by the soft-in soft-out\n(SISO) decoder for the inner code.\n  We focus on the construction and decoding of several $(n,k)$ = (128,36)\nbinary linear block codes based on concatenated coding. We use the (128,36)\nextended BCH (eBCH) code as a benchmark for comparison. Simulation shows that\nthere exist constructed concatenated codes which are much more efficient than\nthe (128,36) eBCH code. Some other codes of length 128 or close to 128 are also\nconstructed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the coherent-incoherent correspondence as a framework for\nderiving quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations under continuous\nmeasurement in Lindblad dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence\nestablishes a mapping between the original quantum system that undergoes\n\\textit{ coherent} evolution and its corresponding \\textit{incoherent} system\nwithout coherent dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence relates\nquantities across these two systems, including jump statistics, dynamical\nactivity, and entropy production. Since the classical-like properties of the\nincoherent system allow us to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations within\nit, these relations can be transferred to the coherent system via the\ncoherent-incoherent correspondence. This enables us to derive quantum\nthermodynamic uncertainty relations for the original coherent system. Unlike\nexisting quantum uncertainty relations, which typically require explicit\nquantum correction terms, our approach avoids these additional terms. This\nmeans that we can establish a lower bound for quantum entropy production using\nonly current statistics. This approach opens up new possibilities for inferring\nentropy production in quantum systems. Through numerical calculations for a\nmodel with coherent jump operators, we show that steady-state coherence lowers\nthe bounds on precision (i.e., allows higher precision).",

In real-world applications, models are\ntypically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the\nenvironment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in\nmodel performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by\nadapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains.\nDespite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing\nchallenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of\ncatastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for\nALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer\nselection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select\nlow-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen,\nmitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we\npropose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on\nentropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing\nmodel stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation\nmechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers\nwith those of the source model. This approach helps balance target adaptation\nand source knowledge retention, further alleviating forgetting. Finally, we\nconstruct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA\nbenchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat APCoTTA achieves the best performance on two benchmarks, with mIoU\nimprovements of approximately 9% and 14% over direct inference.

Unlike traditional CL settings, long-term CL involves handling\na significantly larger number of tasks, which exacerbates the issue of\ncatastrophic forgetting. Our work seeks to address two critical questions: 1)\nHow do existing CL methods perform in the context of long-term CL? and 2) How\ncan we mitigate the catastrophic forgetting that arises from prolonged\nsequential updates? To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework\ninspired by human memory mechanisms for long-term continual learning (Long-CL).\nSpecifically, we introduce a task-core memory management strategy to\nefficiently index crucial memories and adaptively update them as learning\nprogresses. Additionally, we develop a long-term memory consolidation mechanism\nthat selectively retains hard and discriminative samples, ensuring robust\nknowledge retention. To facilitate research in this area, we construct and\nrelease two multi-modal and textual benchmarks, MMLongCL-Bench and\nTextLongCL-Bench, providing a valuable resource for evaluating long-term CL\napproaches. Experimental results show that Long-CL outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art by 7.4\\% and 6.5\\% AP on the two benchmarks, respectively,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

Traditional statistical\nmethods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex\ninteractions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each\ncrash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway\ncrash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226\ntraffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset\nencompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was\ncreated. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its\nunderstanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in\nthese studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash\ncausation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing\ncomprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable\nand aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively\nidentify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding,\naggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as\nroad maintenance, offers more profound insights.

Because\nthe two-loop $\\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD,\n$a_{\\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with\nhigher-order $\\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to\nthe inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives\n$R^{\\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\\,\\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.05221 \\pm 0.0007$, in excellent\nagreement with experiment ($R^{\\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\\,\\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \\pm\n0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a\nconventional four-loop $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ approach.

    "abstract": "Designing and evaluating personalized and proactive assistant agents remains\nchallenging due to the time, cost, and ethical concerns associated with\nhuman-in-the-loop experimentation. Existing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)\nmethods often require extensive physical setup and human participation, which\nintroduces privacy concerns and limits scalability. Simulated environments\noffer a partial solution but are typically constrained by rule-based scenarios\nand still depend heavily on human input to guide interactions and interpret\nresults. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the\npossibility of generative agents that can simulate realistic human behavior,\nreasoning, and social dynamics. However, their effectiveness in modeling\nhuman-assistant interactions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap,\nwe present a generative agent-based simulation platform designed to simulate\nhuman-assistant interactions. We identify ten prior studies on assistant agents\nthat span different aspects of interaction design and replicate these studies\nusing our simulation platform. Our results show that fully simulated\nexperiments using generative agents can approximate key aspects of\nhuman-assistant interactions. Based on these simulations, we are able to\nreplicate the core conclusions of the original studies. Our work provides a\nscalable and cost-effective approach for studying assistant agent design\nwithout requiring live human subjects. We will open source both the platform\nand collected results from the experiments on our website:\nhttps://dash-gidea.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "Planets undergoing convergent migration can be captured into mean-motion\nresonance (MMR), in which the planets' periods are related by integer ratios.\nThe dynamics of MMR are typically considered in isolation, including only the\nforces between the planets and with the central star. However, the planets are\noften subjected to external forces that induce apsidal precessions, which may\nsplit the MMR into two sub-resonances and give rise to chaotic motion due to\nresonance overlap. In this study, we investigate how such externally induced\ndifferential apsidal precession affects capture into first-order $j:j+1$ MMRs.\nWe study the restricted three-body problem for a test particle outside of an\neccentric planet, with the planet undergoing outward migration. We find that\ncapture can be sensitive to the differential apsidal precession, even when the\nprecession rate is much smaller than the resonance overlap criterion. We\nidentify two critical precession frequencies -- related to resonance overlap\nand secular apsidal resonance -- around which capture is disrupted even for\nvery small planet eccentricity. Our results may help clarify the capture\nprocess of resonant trans-Neptunian objects by outward-migrating Neptune in\nearly Solar System.",

Previous studies have\neither overlooked the artistic aspects of maps or faced challenges in creating\nboth accurate and informative maps. In this study, we propose CartoAgent, a\nnovel multi-agent cartographic framework powered by multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs). This framework simulates three key stages in cartographic\npractice: preparation, map design, and evaluation. At each stage, different\nMLLMs act as agents with distinct roles to collaborate, discuss, and utilize\ntools for specific purposes. In particular, CartoAgent leverages MLLMs' visual\naesthetic capability and world knowledge to generate maps that are both\nvisually appealing and informative. By separating style from geographic data,\nit can focus on designing stylesheets without modifying the vector-based data,\nthereby ensuring geographic accuracy. We applied CartoAgent to a specific task\ncentered on map restyling-namely, map style transfer and evaluation. The\neffectiveness of this framework was validated through extensive experiments and\na human evaluation study. CartoAgent can be extended to support a variety of\ncartographic design decisions and inform future integrations of GenAI in\ncartography.",

Recent RRL methods use contrastive learning (CL) to capture\nshared information between two modalities but often overlook task-relevant\nunique information specific to each modality. Such modality-specific details\ncan explain region characteristics that shared information alone cannot\ncapture. Bringing information factorization to RRL can address this by\nfactorizing multimodal data into shared and unique information. However,\nexisting factorization approaches focus on two modalities, whereas RRL can\nbenefit from various geospatial data.

In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation,\nlabeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are\nused to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data,\nparticularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As\na result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation\n(SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and\nunlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA\nmethods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and\nself-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target\ndomain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images\nand pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement.\nMoreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under\nlimited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to\naddress these challenges. Specifically, to effectively mitigate the impact of\ndomain gap in the initial training phase, we introduce preadaptation to\ngenerate a preadapted model, which serves as an initialization of target model\nand allows for the generation of high-quality enhanced pseudo-labels without\nintroducing extra parameters. Additionally, we propose a data-dependent\nfrequency prompt to more effectively translate target domain images into a\nsource-like style. To further enhance adaptation, we employ a style-related\nlayer fine-tuning strategy, specifically designed for SFDA, to train the target\nmodel using the prompted target domain images and pseudo-labels.

AdaptCLIP treats CLIP models as a foundational service,\nadding only three simple adapters, visual adapter, textual adapter, and\nprompt-query adapter, at its input or output ends.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an interactive continual learning paradigm where AI\nmodels dynamically learn new skills from real-time human feedback while\nretaining prior knowledge. This paradigm distinctively addresses two major\nlimitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using\nstreaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with\nfixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling\nthe noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems,\nwe propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework\nleveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from\ndynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal\nconsistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in\ndata streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to\nalign model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and\nhuman-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that\ncaptures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus\navoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on\ntwo benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise\npatterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing\ncombinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label\nlearning methods.",

To mitigate this, we integrate\nlogits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths\nto achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic\nwatermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid.

This study introduces a new\nclass of hyper-Yoshimura origami, which exhibits a wide range of kinematically\nadmissible and locally metastable states, including newly discovered symmetric\n\"self-packing\" and asymmetric \"pop-out\" states. This metastability is achieved\nby breaking a design rule of Yoshimura origami that has been in place for many\ndecades.

Finally, this study\nshowcases the potential of hyper-Yoshimura with a meter-scale pop-up cellphone\ncharging station deployed at our university's bus transit station, along with a\n3D-printed, scaled prototype of a space crane that can function as an object\nmanipulator, solar tracking device, or high-load-bearing structure.

One successful approach is to\nseparate the coupling task across multiple waveguides, with a cutoff waveguide\n(a waveguide that does not support guided modes above a certain wavelength)\nbeing judiciously used to prevent unwanted excessive overcoupling at low\nfrequencies. Here, we examine how such a cutoff waveguide can still induce\nparasitic loss in the coupling region of a microring resonator, thereby\nimpacting nonlinear device performance. We verified this parasitic loss channel\nthrough both experiment and simulation, showing that a waveguide optimized for\n532 nm (visible) and 780 nm (near-infrared), while nominally cut off at 1550\nnm, can still introduce significant parasitic loss at telecom wavelengths.

Recently, the rapid development of\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made it possible to generate\nfront-end Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code directly from webpage designs.\nHowever, real-world webpages encompass not only a diverse array of HTML tags\nbut also complex stylesheets, resulting in significantly lengthy code. The\nlengthy code poses challenges for the performance and efficiency of MLLMs,\nespecially in capturing the structural information of UI designs. To address\nthese challenges, this paper proposes UICopilot, a novel approach to automating\nUI synthesis via hierarchical code generation from webpage designs. The core\nidea of UICopilot is to decompose the generation process into two stages:\nfirst, generating the coarse-grained HTML hierarchical structure, followed by\nthe generation of fine-grained code. To validate the effectiveness of\nUICopilot, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, i.e., WebCode2M.\nExperimental results demonstrate that UICopilot significantly outperforms\nexisting baselines in both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluations.\nSpecifically, statistical analysis reveals that the majority of human\nannotators prefer the webpages generated by UICopilot over those produced by\nGPT-4V.",

In both models, we find that the mutual information tends to\nbe overall reduced by increasing the value of $\\mu/T$ at larger values of the\nseparation length $x$ between two disjoint spatial regions of the medium, while\nthe opposite tendency is observed at lower values of $x$. We also observe that\nvery close to the critical point of the 1RCBH model, the mutual information\ntends to increase with increasing $\\mu/T$ in the stable branch of black hole\nsolutions. Moreover, the mutual information between the fields in the two\ndisjoint regions is observed to be enhanced by increasing the characteristic\nsize $\\ell$ of these regions, with such an enhancement asymptotically\nsaturating, thus suggesting the existence of a finite field correlation length\nbetween the disjoint regions of the system.

To address this issue, we\npropose FedGRec, a privacy-preserving federated graph learning method for\ncross-border recommendations. FedGRec captures user preferences from\ndistributed multi-domain data to enhance recommendation performance across all\ndomains without privacy leakage.

Additionally, it employs dynamic spatiotemporal\nmodeling to integrate global and local user preferences in real time based on\nbusiness recommendation states, thereby deriving the final representations of\ntarget users and candidate items. By automatically filtering relevant\nbehaviors, FedGRec effectively mitigates noise interference from unreliable\nneighbors. Furthermore, through a personalized federated aggregation strategy,\nFedGRec adapts global preferences to heterogeneous domain data, enabling\ncollaborative learning of user preferences across multiple domains.

Within this framework, I\ndevelop formal operators for the evolution of each subsystem and give precise\nconditions under which phase-aligned synchronization occurs across the lattice.\nThe main results include: (1) the existence and uniqueness of coherent\n(synchronized) states under a contractive coupling condition, (2) stability of\nthese coherent states and criteria for their emergence as a collective phase\ntransition in a continuous operator topology, and (3) the influence of\nsymmetries, with group-invariant coupling leading to flow-invariant synchrony\nsubspaces and structured cluster dynamics. Proofs are given for each theorem,\ndemonstrating full mathematical rigor. In a final section, I discuss\nhypothetical applications of this framework to symbolic lattice systems (e.g.\nsubshifts), to invariant group actions on dynamical lattices, and to operator\nfields over stratified manifolds in the spirit of noncommutative geometry.\nThroughout, I write in the first person to emphasize the exploratory nature of\nthis work. The paper avoids any reference to cosmology or observers, focusing\ninstead on clean, formal mathematics suitable for a broad array of dynamical\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have triggered surges in\nmarket valuations for AI-related companies, often outpacing the realization of\nunderlying capabilities. We examine the anchoring effect of AI capabilities on\nequity valuations and propose a Capability Realization Rate (CRR) model to\nquantify the gap between AI potential and realized performance. Using data from\nthe 2023--2025 generative AI boom, we analyze sector-level sensitivity and\nconduct case studies (OpenAI, Adobe, NVIDIA, Meta, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs) to\nillustrate patterns of valuation premium and misalignment. Our findings\nindicate that AI-native firms commanded outsized valuation premiums anchored to\nfuture potential, while traditional companies integrating AI experienced\nre-ratings subject to proof of tangible returns. We argue that CRR can help\nidentify valuation misalignment risk-where market prices diverge from realized\nAI-driven value. We conclude with policy recommendations to improve\ntransparency, mitigate speculative bubbles, and align AI innovation with\nsustainable market value.",

In the case of a trivial bundle and an\ninvertible presymplectic structure, this reduces to the well-known AKSZ sigma\nmodel construction. We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ\napproach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out\nthat such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDEs whose base spaces are\nagain gauge PDEs describing background fields. As such, the geometric structure\nis that of a bundle over a bundle over a given spacetime. Gauge PDEs over\nbackgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge)\nfields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. Less obvious\nexamples involve parameterised systems, Fedosov equations, and the so-called\nhomogeneous (presymplectic) gauge PDEs. The latter are the gauge-invariant\ngeneralisations of the familiar homogeneous PDEs and they provide a very\nconcise description of gauge fields on homogeneous spaces such as higher spin\ngauge fields on Minkowski, (A)dS, and conformal spaces. Finally, we briefly\ndiscuss how the higher-form symmetries and their gauging fit into the framework\nusing the simplest example of the Maxwell field.",

Choosing the right music can\nbe challenging due to the overwhelming number of options and the time-consuming\ntrial-and-error process. To address this, we propose Context-AI Tune (CAT), a\nsystem that generates personalized music based on environmental inputs and the\nuser's self-assessed stress level. A 2x2 within-subject experiment (N=26) was\nconducted with two independent variables: AI (AI, NoAI) and Environment (Busy\nHub, Quiet Library). CAT's effectiveness in reducing stress was evaluated using\nthe Visual Analog Scale for Stress (VAS-S). Results show that CAT is more\neffective than manually chosen music in reducing stress by adapting to user\ncontext.",

    "abstract": "The pursuit of advanced polymers for energy technologies, spanning\nphotovoltaics, solid-state batteries, and hydrogen storage, is hindered by\nfragmented data ecosystems that fail to capture the hierarchical complexity of\nthese materials. Polymer science lacks interoperable databases, forcing\nreliance on disconnected literature and legacy records riddled with\nunstructured formats and irreproducible testing protocols. This fragmentation\nstifles machine learning (ML) applications and delays the discovery of\nmaterials critical for global decarbonization. Three systemic barriers compound\nthe challenge. First, academic-industrial data silos restrict access to\nproprietary industrial datasets, while academic publications often omit\ncritical synthesis details. Second, inconsistent testing methods undermine\ncross-study comparability. Third, incomplete metadata in existing databases\nlimits their utility for training reliable ML models. Emerging solutions\naddress these gaps through technological and collaborative innovation. Natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) tools extract structured polymer data from decades of\nliterature, while high-throughput robotic platforms generate self-consistent\ndatasets via autonomous experimentation. Central to these advances is the\nadoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles,\nadapted to polymer-specific ontologies, ensuring machine-readability and\nreproducibility. Future breakthroughs hinge on cultural shifts toward open\nscience, accelerated by decentralized data markets and autonomous laboratories\nthat merge robotic experimentation with real-time ML validation.

We show\nthat the limited resolution of the instrument results in velocity distributions\nthat underestimate the core and overestimate the tails of the actual Maxwellian\nplasma velocity distribution functions. As a consequence, the velocity moments\nof the observed plasma underestimate the proton density and overestimate the\nproton temperature.

Wearable sensors were used to\ncontinuously and non-invasively collect physiological data, including\nelectrodermal activity to monitor stress responses. Analysis of data from 18\nparticipants revealed notable differences in EDR between light- and\nmedium-intensity activities, reflecting variations in autonomic nervous system\nactivity under stress. Also, a feature importance analysis revealed that peak\nand central tendency metrics of EDR were robust indicators of physiological\nresponses, between light- and medium-intensity activities. The findings\nemphasize the relationship between AR-enabled warnings, work intensity, and\nworker stress, offering an approach to active stress monitoring and improved\nsafety practices. By leveraging real-time physiological insights, this\nmethodology has the potential to support better stress management and the\ndevelopment of more effective safety warning systems for roadway work zones.\nThis research also provides valuable guidance for designing interventions to\nenhance worker safety, productivity, and well-being in high-risk settings.",

The explicit\nfunctional forms of the correlation kernels then imply that the general\n$n$-point correlation functions exhibit an asymptotic expansion in $1/N^2$,\nwhich moreover can be lifted to an asymptotic in $1/N^2$ for the spacing\ndistributions and their generating function.

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, the use of machine learning has increased\nexponentially. Models are far more complex than ever before, growing to\ngargantuan sizes and housing millions of weights. Unfortunately, the fact that\nlarge models have become the state of the art means that it often costs\nmillions of dollars to train and operate them. These expenses not only hurt\ncompanies but also bar non-wealthy individuals from contributing to new\ndevelopments and force consumers to pay greater prices for AI. Current methods\nused to prune models, such as iterative magnitude pruning, have shown great\naccuracy but require an iterative training sequence that is incredibly\ncomputationally and environmentally taxing. To solve this problem, BINGO is\nintroduced. BINGO, during the training pass, studies specific subsets of a\nneural network one at a time to gauge how significant of a role each weight\nplays in contributing to a network's accuracy. By the time training is done,\nBINGO generates a significance score for each weight, allowing for\ninsignificant weights to be pruned in one shot. BINGO provides an\naccuracy-preserving pruning technique that is less computationally intensive\nthan current methods, allowing for a world where AI growth does not have to\nmean model growth, as well.",
