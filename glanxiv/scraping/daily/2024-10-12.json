    "abstract": "Iterative refinement has emerged as an effective paradigm for enhancing the\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However,\nexisting approaches typically implement iterative refinement at the application\nor prompting level, relying on autoregressive (AR) modeling. The sequential\ntoken generation in AR models can lead to high inference latency. To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose Context-Wise Order-Agnostic Language Modeling\n(COrAL), which incorporates iterative refinement directly into the LLM\narchitecture while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach models\nmultiple token dependencies within manageable context windows, enabling the\nmodel to perform iterative refinement internally during the generation process.\nLeveraging the order-agnostic nature of COrAL, we introduce sliding blockwise\norder-agnostic decoding, which performs multi-token forward prediction and\nbackward reconstruction within context windows. This allows the model to\niteratively refine its outputs in parallel in the sliding block, effectively\ncapturing diverse dependencies without the high inference cost of sequential\ngeneration. Empirical evaluations on reasoning tasks demonstrate that COrAL\nimproves performance and inference speed, respectively, achieving absolute\naccuracy gains of $4.6\\%$ on GSM8K and $4.0\\%$ on LogiQA, along with inference\nspeedups of up to $3.9\\times$ over next-token baselines. Preliminary results on\ncode generation indicate a drop in pass rates due to inconsistencies in\norder-agnostic outputs, highlighting the inherent quality--speed trade-off.

However, the high-dimensional nature\nof code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency\nbottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper\nsystematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers\nacross three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and\nAssertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L)\nand four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's\nSemantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW).\nOur findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in\nefficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale\nretrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate\ndense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit\nGeneration task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in\nRougeL compared with BM25.

    "abstract": "Matrix-valued optimization tasks, including those involving symmetric\npositive definite (SPD) matrices, arise in a wide range of applications in\nmachine learning, data science and statistics. Classically, such problems are\nsolved via constrained Euclidean optimization, where the domain is viewed as a\nEuclidean space and the structure of the matrices (e.g., positive definiteness)\nenters as constraints. More recently, geometric approaches that leverage\nparametrizations of the problem as unconstrained tasks on the corresponding\nmatrix manifold have been proposed. While they exhibit algorithmic benefits in\nmany settings, they cannot directly handle additional constraints, such as\ninequality or sparsity constraints. A remedy comes in the form of constrained\nRiemannian optimization methods, notably, Riemannian Frank-Wolfe and Projected\nGradient Descent. However, both algorithms require potentially expensive\nsubroutines that can introduce computational bottlenecks in practise. To\nmitigate these shortcomings, we introduce a class of structured regularizers,\nbased on symmetric gauge functions, which allow for solving constrained\noptimization on the SPD manifold with faster unconstrained methods. We show\nthat our structured regularizers can be chosen to preserve or induce desirable\nstructure, in particular convexity and \"difference of convex\" structure. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in numerical experiments.",

However, in their simplest forms, graph-based models do not include any\n3D information and are unable to distinguish stereoisomers such as those\narising from different orderings of ligands around a metal center in\ncoordination complexes. In this work we present a modification to revised\nautocorrelation descriptors, our molecular graph featurization method for\nmachine learning various spin state dependent properties of octahedral\ntransition metal complexes (TMCs). Inspired by analytical semi-empirical models\nfor TMCs, the new modeling strategy is based on the many-body expansion (MBE)\nand allows one to tune the captured stereoisomer information by changing the\ntruncation order of the MBE. We present the necessary modifications to include\nthis approach in two commonly used machine learning methods, kernel ridge\nregression and feed-forward neural networks. On a test set composed of all\npossible isomers of binary transition metal complexes, the best MBE models\nachieve mean absolute errors of 2.75 kcal/mol on spin-splitting energies and\n0.26 eV on frontier orbital energy gaps, a 30-40% reduction in error compared\nto models based on our previous approach. We also observe improved\ngeneralization to previously unseen ligands where the best-performing models\nexhibit mean absolute errors of 4.00 kcal/mol (i.e., a 0.73 kcal/mol reduction)\non the spin-splitting energies and 0.53 eV (i.e., a 0.10 eV reduction) on the\nfrontier orbital energy gaps.

In this work, we study the\nconverse: in the low-compute regime, how does the incremental increase of\ninductive bias affect performance? To quantify inductive bias, we propose a\n\"soft MLP\" approach, which we coin Interpolated MLP (I-MLP). We control the\namount of inductive bias in the standard MLP by introducing a novel algorithm\nbased on interpolation between fixed weights from a prior model with high\ninductive bias. We showcase our method using various prior models, including\nCNNs and the MLP-Mixer architecture. This interpolation scheme allows\nfractional control of inductive bias, which may be attractive when full\ninductive bias is not desired (e.g. in the mid-compute regime).

This Chiral Effective Field Theory applies tothe Unitarity\nWindow (45deg<delta(k)<135deg,$k\\approx m_\\pi$) most relevant for low-energy\nnuclear systems. Its only LO scale is the scattering momentum; NLO adds only\nscattering length, effective range and non-iterated one-pion exchange (OPE);\nand N2LO only once-iterated OPE. Agreement in the 1S0 channel is very good.\nApparent large discrepancies in the 3S1 channel at k>100MeV are remedied by\ntaking only the central part of the pion's N2LO contribution. In\ncontradistinction to the tensor part, it is invariant under\nWigner-SU(4)symmetry and hence identical in 1S0 and 3S1. NLO pions are\nWigner-invariant. Both channels describe PWAs and pole parameters well within\nmutually consistent quantitative theory uncertainty estimates. Pionic effects\nare small, even for k>mpi.

We explore the\nrationale, design, and implementation of such registries, drawing on\ncomparisons with registries in analogous industries to make recommendations for\na registry that is efficient, unintrusive, and which will bring AI governance\ncloser to parity with the governmental insight into other high-impact\nindustries. We explore key information that should be collected, including\nmodel architecture, model size, compute and data used during training, and we\nsurvey the viability and utility of evaluations developed specifically for AI.\nOur proposal is designed to provide governmental insight and enhance AI safety\nwhile fostering innovation and minimizing the regulatory burden on developers.\nBy providing a framework that respects intellectual property concerns and\nsafeguards sensitive information, this registry approach supports responsible\nAI development without impeding progress. We propose that timely and accurate\nregistration should be encouraged primarily through injunctive action, by\nrequiring third parties to use only registered models, and secondarily through\ndirect financial penalties for non-compliance. By providing a comprehensive\nframework for AI model registries, we aim to support policymakers in developing\nfoundational governance structures to monitor and mitigate risks associated\nwith advanced AI systems.",

We develop multimodal long short-term memory\n(LSTM) network models, which are capable of forecasting the number of step\ncounts of a patient up to 24 hours in advance by examining data from activity\nand engagement modalities. Furthermore, we design goal-based forecasting models\nto predict whether a person's next-day steps will be over a certain threshold.\nResults: Multimodal LSTM with early fusion achieves 33% and 37% lower mean\nabsolute errors than linear regression and ARIMA respectively on the\nprediabetes dataset. LSTM also outperforms linear regression and ARIMA with a\nmargin of 13% and 32% on the sleep dataset. Multimodal forecasting models also\nperform with 72% and 79% accuracy on the prediabetes dataset and sleep dataset\nrespectively on goal-based forecasting. Conclusion: Our experiments conclude\nthat multimodal LSTM models with early fusion are better than multimodal LSTM\nwith late fusion and unimodal LSTM models and also than ARIMA and linear\nregression models.

By singular solutions we mean solutions that are not\ncontained in the general solution of the system of equations that describes the\ndynamic system under study.

It is shown that the\npresence of singular solutions, first of all, leads to the emergence of chaotic\nregimes. The dynamics of the system under study in the presence of singular\nsolutions can differ radically from the dynamics in which singular solutions\nare not considered.

    "abstract": "Biomedical literature is often written in highly specialized language, posing\nsignificant comprehension challenges for non-experts. Automatic text\nsimplification (ATS) offers a solution by making such texts more accessible\nwhile preserving critical information. However, evaluating ATS for biomedical\ntexts is still challenging due to the limitations of existing evaluation\nmetrics. General-domain metrics like SARI, BLEU, and ROUGE focus on\nsurface-level text features, and readability metrics like FKGL and ARI fail to\naccount for domain-specific terminology or assess how well the simplified text\nconveys core meanings (gist). To address this, we introduce SciGisPy, a novel\nevaluation metric inspired by Gist Inference Score (GIS) from Fuzzy-Trace\nTheory (FTT). SciGisPy measures how well a simplified text facilitates the\nformation of abstract inferences (gist) necessary for comprehension, especially\nin the biomedical domain. We revise GIS for this purpose by introducing\ndomain-specific enhancements, including semantic chunking, Information Content\n(IC) theory, and specialized embeddings, while removing unsuitable indexes. Our\nexperimental evaluation on the Cochrane biomedical text simplification dataset\ndemonstrates that SciGisPy outperforms the original GIS formulation, with a\nsignificant increase in correctly identified simplified texts (84% versus\n44.8%). The results and a thorough ablation study confirm that SciGisPy better\ncaptures the essential meaning of biomedical content, outperforming existing\napproaches.",

This bubble is small scaled\nand enjoys high contrasting mass density and bulk modulus. It is well known\nthat, under certain regimes between these scales, such a bubble generates a\nsingle low-frequency (or subwavelength) resonance called Minnaert resonance. In\nthis paper, we study the wave propagation governed by Minnaert resonance\neffects in time domain. We derive the point-approximation expansion of the wave\nfield. The dominant part is a sum of two terms.\n  1. The first one, which we call the primary wave, is the wave field generated\nin the absence of the bubble.\n  2. The second one, which we call the resonant wave, is generated by the\ninteraction between the bubble and the background. It is related to a\nDirac-source, in space, that is modulated, in time, with a coefficient which is\na solution of a $1$D Cauchy problem, for a second order differential equation,\nhaving as propagation and attenuation parameters the real and the imaginary\nparts, respectively, of the Minnaert resonance.\n  We show that the evolution of the resonant wave remains valid for a large\ntime of the order $\\epsilon^{-1}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the radius of the\nbubble, after which it collapses by exponentially decaying. Precisely, we\nconfirm that such resonant wave have life-time inversely proportional to the\nimaginary part of the related subwavelength resonances, which is in our case\ngiven by the Minnaert one.

Previous research advanced this field\nby adapting Large Language Models for clinical tasks, using diverse datasets to\ngenerate general EHR summaries.

This project builds on prior work by\ncreating a system that generates clinician-preferred, focused summaries,\nimproving EHR summarization for more efficient patient care. The proposed\nsystem leverages the Google Flan-T5 model to generate tailored EHR summaries\nbased on clinician-specified topics. The approach involved fine-tuning the\nFlan-T5 model on an EHR question-answering dataset formatted in the Stanford\nQuestion Answering Dataset (SQuAD) style, which is a large-scale reading\ncomprehension dataset with questions and answers. Fine-tuning utilized the\nSeq2SeqTrainer from the Hugging Face Transformers library with optimized\nhyperparameters. Key evaluation metrics demonstrated promising results: the\nsystem achieved an Exact Match (EM) score of 81.81%. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented\nUnderstudy for Gisting Evaluation) metrics showed strong performance, with\nROUGE-1 at 96.03%, ROUGE-2 at 86.67%, and ROUGE-L at 96.10%.

In this model, each differentiated\ncell (DC) produces two diffusing morphogens: a short-range activator and a\nlong-range inhibitor. Their combination creates the so-called local 'w' field.\nUndifferentiated cells (UCs) are passive. The question arises how to adapt it\nto modelling patterning processes in anisotropic substrates with a biaxial\ndependence of the morphogen diffusion rate. We use activation/inhibition\nregions with appropriate shape geometry defined by the so-called deformation\nparameter p. We complement this model by adding a physically reasonable\ntransition zone with controlled local field slope. The patterning process uses\nthe morphogenetic field W calculated separately for each cell, which is the sum\nof the 'w' values generated by all regional DCs surrounding the cell. It acts\nas a chemical signal determining the next state of the cell. We also introduce\na threshold W* defining the required absolute chemical signal strength. The\nstate of each cell can change depending on the rules for W and W*. This\nimproves the stability of the model evolution and extends its applications.\nUsing two pairs of two-point orthogonal correlation functions, we reveal their\ndirectional sensitivity to changes in biaxial anisotropy. Finally, we\nillustrate the general two-parameter dependence of the average final DC\nconcentration on the geometry of the activation/inhibition regions and on the\nvalue of the long-range inhibitor.

Our activities empower students with the tools to transform\ntheir own temporal datasets (e.g., FID) to a frequency spectrum. To ensure\naccessibility of the activities and lower the barrier to implementation, we\nutilize Google Colab's open-source, cloud-based platform to run Jupyter\nnotebooks. We also offer a pre-laboratory activity that introduces students to\nthe basics of Python and the Colab platform, and reviews the math and\nprogramming skills needed to complete the lab activities. These lab activities\nhelp students build a qualitative, quantitative, and practical understanding of\nthe FT.",

To evaluate such behavior, force transducers are commonly\nemployed in testing. However, the calibration of force transducers is typically\nlimited to static conditions and relies solely on gravitational forces exerted\non standard masses. Thus, assessing the uncertainty in force measurements using\nforce transducers during dynamic loading conditions remains a challenging task,\npresenting a significant obstacle in accurately characterizing the dynamic\nbehavior of materials. In this work, an optical technique to evaluate the\nmechanical properties of wires subjected to impact tensile loads is presented.\nThe wire under test is subjected to an impact tensile load by applying the\ninertial force of a rigid mass, which is supported by utilizing an aerostatic\nlinear bearing with sufficiently small friction. The inertial force applied to\nthe wire can be determined by multiplying the mass of the rigid mass by its\nacceleration, where the acceleration can be measured employing a Michelson type\noptical interferometer. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated\nthrough experiments and analysis of the dynamic characteristics of a tungsten\nwire under impact tensile loading conditions.",

We find that such sites exist at least on the lunar equator for prograde\nequatorial orbit launches. Three of the sites are located on the lunar\nnearside. We envision that this can be used to lift material from the Moon at\nlow cost because it gives prolonged opportunities for an active spacecraft to\ncatch the projectile. Passive projectiles can be made entirely from lunar\nmaterial so that a stream of Earth-imported parts is not needed. To reduce the\nmass and cost of the launcher, the projectile mass can be scaled down with a\ncorresponding increase in the launch frequency.

This paper presents SLIM, a new one-shot compression framework\nthat holistically integrates hardware-friendly quantization, sparsity, and\nlow-rank approximation into a unified process. First, we formulate the\nquantization process using a probabilistic approach (SLIM-Quant) that enables\nus to apply uniform quantization.

SLIM improves model accuracy by up to 5.66% (LLaMA-2-7B) for 2:4\nsparsity with 4-bit weight quantization, outperforming prior methods.

However, addressing this issue is challenging due\nto the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed\nselectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach,\nnamed ``BeNeDiff'', first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural\nsubspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs\nstate-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that\ninterpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on\nmulti-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across\nthe dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual\nlatent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the\ndisentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the\nbehaviors of interest.

Ever-increasing model complexity\ncoupled with limited memory resources on the participating devices severely\nbottlenecks the deployment of FL in real-world scenarios. Thus, a framework\nthat can effectively break the memory wall while jointly taking into account\nthe hardware and statistical heterogeneity in FL is urgently required. In this\npaper, we propose SmartSplit, a framework that effectively reduces the memory\nfootprint on the device side while guaranteeing the training progress and model\naccuracy for heterogeneous FL through model splitting.Towards this end,\nSmartSplit employs a hierarchical structure to adaptively guide the overall\ntraining process. In each training round, the central manager, hosted on the\nserver, dynamically selects the participating devices and sets the cutting\nlayer by jointly considering the memory budget, training capacity, and data\ndistribution of each device. The MEC manager, deployed within the edge server,\nproceeds to split the local model and perform training of the server-side\nportion. Meanwhile, it fine-tunes the splitting points based on the\ntime-evolving statistical importance. The on-device manager, embedded inside\neach mobile device, continuously monitors the local training status while\nemploying cost-aware checkpointing to match the runtime dynamic memory budget.\nExtensive experiments on representative datasets are conducted on both\ncommercial off-the-shelf mobile device testbeds. The experimental results show\nthat SmartSplit excels in FL training on highly memory-constrained mobile SoCs,\noffering up to a 94% peak latency reduction and 100-fold memory savings.

Unsteady vorticity contours or\ninterfaces often grow in complexity (lengthen and fold), either as a result of\nvortex interactions (like merger) or `filamentation'. In the latter, wave\ndisturbances riding on a background, equilibrium contour shape appear to\ninevitably steepen and break, forming filaments, repeatedly -- and perhaps\nendlessly. Here, we revisit the onset of filamentation. Building upon previous\nwork and using a weakly-nonlinear expansion to third order in wave amplitude,\nwe derive a universal, parameter-free amplitude equation which applies (with a\nminor change) both to a straight interface and a circular patch in the plane,\nas well as circular vortex patches on the surface of a sphere. We show that\nthis equation possesses a local, self-similar form describing the finite-time\nblow up of the wave slope (in a rescaled long time proportional to the inverse\nsquare of the initial wave amplitude). We present numerical evidence for this\nself-similar blow-up solution, and for the conjecture that almost all initial\nconditions lead to finite-time blow up.

We discover that gradient flow serves as an\ninherent mechanism that naturally divide the training process into two phases.\nIn Phase 1, the linear MLP quickly aligns with the two target signals for\ncorrect classification, whereas the softmax attention remains almost unchanged.\nIn Phase 2, the attention matrices and the MLP evolve jointly to enlarge the\nclassification margin and reduce the loss to a near minimum value. Technically,\nwe prove a novel property of the gradient flow, termed \\textit{automatic\nbalancing of gradients}, which enables the loss values of different samples to\ndecrease almost at the same rate and further facilitates the proof of near\nminimum training loss.

Specifically, we first\nconstruct a highly realistic 3D simulation environment based on the real\nbuildings, roads, and other elements in a real city. In this environment, we\ncombine historically collected data and simulation algorithms to conduct\nsimulations of pedestrian and vehicle flows with high fidelity. Further, we\ndesigned a set of evaluation tasks covering different EmbodiedAI abilities.\nMoreover, we provide a complete set of input and output interfaces for access,\nenabling embodied agents to easily take task requirements and current\nenvironmental observations as input and then make decisions and obtain\nperformance evaluations. On the one hand, it expands the capability of existing\nembodied intelligence to higher levels. On the other hand, it has a higher\npractical value in the real world and can support more potential applications\nfor artificial general intelligence. Based on this platform, we evaluate some\npopular large language models for embodied intelligence capabilities of\ndifferent dimensions and difficulties.",

Both undoped MAC and MAC@N exhibit metallic behavior,\nalthough only MAC features a Dirac-like cone. MAC has an estimated Young's\nmodulus value of about 410 GPa, while MAC@N's modulus can vary around 416 GPa\ndepending on nitrogen content. MAC displays optical activity in the ultraviolet\nrange, whereas MAC@N features light absorption within the infrared and visible\nranges, suggesting potential for distinct optoelectronic applications. Their\nstructural thermal stabilities were addressed through molecular dynamics\nsimulations.

Formally, a model $M$ maps arms\n$\\pi$ to a probability distribution $M(\\pi)$ of reward. A model class\n$\\mathcal{M}$ is a collection of models. For each model $M$, define its mean\nreward function $f^M(\\pi)=\\mathbb{E}_{r \\sim M(\\pi)}[r]$. In the bandit\nlearning problem, we proceed in rounds, pulling one arm $\\pi$ each round and\nobserving a reward sampled from $M(\\pi)$. With knowledge of $\\mathcal{M}$,\nsupposing that the true model $M\\in \\mathcal{M}$, the objective is to identify\nan arm $\\hat{\\pi}$ of near-maximal mean reward $f^M(\\hat{\\pi})$ with high\nprobability in a bounded number of rounds. If this is possible, then the model\nclass is said to be learnable.\n  Importantly, a result of \\cite{hanneke2023bandit} shows there exist model\nclasses for which learnability is undecidable. However, the model class they\nconsider features deterministic rewards, and they raise the question of whether\nlearnability is decidable for classes containing sufficiently noisy models. For\nthe first time, we answer this question in the positive by giving a complete\ncharacterization of learnability for model classes with arbitrary noise. In\naddition to that, we also describe the full spectrum of possible optimal query\ncomplexities. Further, we prove adaptivity is sometimes necessary to achieve\nthe optimal query complexity. Last, we revisit an important complexity measure\nfor interactive decision making, the Decision-Estimation-Coefficient\n\\citep{foster2021statistical,foster2023tight}, and propose a new variant of the\nDEC which also characterizes learnability in this setting.",

We start by manually crafting a minimal set of atomic instructions\n(<100) and developing combination rules to synthesize and verify complex\ninstructions for a seed set.

To further\nbridge the gap in instruction-following auto-evaluation for RAG systems, we\nintroduce FollowRAG Benchmark, which includes approximately 3K test samples,\ncovering 22 categories of general instruction constraints and four\nknowledge-intensive QA datasets. Due to its robust pipeline design, FollowRAG\ncan seamlessly integrate with different RAG benchmarks.

However, these explicit 3D\nmethods suffer from the following problems: 1) Inevitable information dropping\nduring 3D reconstruction; 2) Tight coupling between specific hardware and\nalgorithm for 3D reconstruction. It leads us to a question: Is it indispensable\nto reconstruct 3D information explicitly in recognition tasks? Hence, we\nconsider this problem in an implicit manner, leaving the nerve-wracking 3D\nreconstruction problem for learnable neural networks with the help of neural\nradiance fields (NeRFs). We propose FingerNeRF, a novel generalizable NeRF for\n3D finger biometrics. To handle the shape-radiance ambiguity problem that may\nresult in incorrect 3D geometry, we aim to involve extra geometric priors based\non the correspondence of binary finger traits like fingerprints or finger\nveins. First, we propose a novel Trait Guided Transformer (TGT) module to\nenhance the feature correspondence with the guidance of finger traits. Second,\nwe involve extra geometric constraints on the volume rendering loss with the\nproposed Depth Distillation Loss and Trait Guided Rendering Loss. To evaluate\nthe performance of the proposed method on different modalities, we collect two\nnew datasets: SCUT-Finger-3D with finger images and SCUT-FingerVein-3D with\nfinger vein images. Moreover, we also utilize the UNSW-3D dataset with\nfingerprint images for evaluation. In experiments, our FingerNeRF can achieve\n4.37% EER on SCUT-Finger-3D dataset, 8.12% EER on SCUT-FingerVein-3D dataset,\nand 2.90% EER on UNSW-3D dataset, showing the superiority of the proposed\nimplicit method in 3D finger biometrics.",

A theoretical model is proposed to describe\nthe selection rules for resonant optical d-d transitions of an isolated\nMn$^{2+}$ ion in a ZnSe cubic crystal. These rules are based on the analysis of\nthe total angular momentum symmetry for the ground ($^6$A$_1$) and first\nexcited ($^4$T$_1$) states of the Mn$^{2+}$ ion. This discussion neglects the\nspecific mechanism for spin-flip processes in a d-shell of the ion during\noptical excitation. The analysis is founded on the rotational symmetry of the\neffective total angular momenta and parity for each state as a whole.\nAdditionally, the Jahn-Teller coupling of the excited state orbital parts with\ntetragonal ($e$-type) local distortions of the crystal lattice is considered.\nThis coupling results in the segregation of cubic axes and spin projections on\nthese axes due to weak spin-orbit and spin-spin coupling in the excited state.\nThis leads to energy splitting for spin states with their projections of $\\pm\n1/2$ and $\\pm 3/2$ on each axis distinguished by specific Jahn-Teller\ndistortion in the corresponding atomic potential minimum.

On the PES, the\nfission valley becomes larger in the (Q20, Q30) plane, and the triaxial\ndeformation is suppressed around the outer barrier after considering the tensor\nforce. Incorporating the tensor force into the dynamical process enhances the\ndifference in shape evolution between two asymmetric channels. More\ninterestingly, the charge distribution from TDHF with double PNP calculations\nshows a strong odd-even effect after including the tensor force. In addition,\nthe total mass and charge distributions of fission fragments show a slight\nshift towards larger asymmetry and are more consistent with the experiments\nwhen tensor components are included. We also find that the tensor force\nenhances energy gaps of the deformed shells for heavy fragments. Moreover, the\nTKEs of fragments are in accord with the experiments, and after incorporating\nthe tensor force, we observe a higher concentration of the calculated TKEs for\nheavy fragments at Z = 52 and Z = 56. Conclusions: The tensor force plays a\nrole in both static and dynamical processes in nuclear fission, improving the\naccuracy of theoretical descriptions within the current framework. Our\ncalculations have shown that the fission-barrier height with SLy5t is closer to\nthe empirical value than that of SLy5. Additionally, the inclusion of the\ntensor force not only manifests the odd-even effect in charge distribution but\nalso improves the description of total mass and charge distributions.",

    "abstract": "Multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks are predominantly used to develop\ndata-driven constitutive models for granular materials. They offer a compelling\nalternative to traditional physics-based constitutive models in predicting\nnonlinear responses of these materials, e.g., elasto-plasticity, under various\nloading conditions. To attain the necessary accuracy, MLPs often need to be\nsufficiently deep or wide, owing to the curse of dimensionality inherent in\nthese problems. To overcome this limitation, we present an elasto-plasticity\ninformed Chebyshev-based Kolmogorov-Arnold network (EPi-cKAN) in this study.\nThis architecture leverages the benefits of KANs and augmented Chebyshev\npolynomials, as well as integrates physical principles within both the network\nstructure and the loss function. The primary objective of EPi-cKAN is to\nprovide an accurate and generalizable function approximation for non-linear\nstress-strain relationships, using fewer parameters compared to standard MLPs.\nTo evaluate the efficiency, accuracy, and generalization capabilities of\nEPi-cKAN in modeling complex elasto-plastic behavior, we initially compare its\nperformance with other cKAN-based models, which include purely data-driven\nparallel and serial architectures. Furthermore, to differentiate EPi-cKAN's\ndistinct performance, we also compare it against purely data-driven and\nphysics-informed MLP-based methods. Lastly, we test EPi-cKAN's ability to\npredict blind strain-controlled paths that extend beyond the training data\ndistribution to gauge its generalization and predictive capabilities. Our\nfindings indicate that, even with limited data and fewer parameters compared to\nother approaches, EPi-cKAN provides superior accuracy in predicting stress\ncomponents and demonstrates better generalization when used to predict sand\nelasto-plastic behavior under blind triaxial axisymmetric strain-controlled\nloading paths.",

In contrast to conventional visual instruction tuning\napproaches that exclusively supervise text outputs, ROSS prompts LMMs to\nsupervise visual outputs via reconstructing input images. By doing so, it\ncapitalizes on the inherent richness and detail present within input images\nthemselves, which are often lost in pure text supervision. However, producing\nmeaningful feedback from natural images is challenging due to the heavy spatial\nredundancy of visual signals. To address this issue, ROSS employs a denoising\nobjective to reconstruct latent representations of input images, avoiding\ndirectly regressing exact raw RGB values. This intrinsic activation design\ninherently encourages LMMs to maintain image detail, thereby enhancing their\nfine-grained comprehension capabilities and reducing hallucinations.\nEmpirically, ROSS consistently brings significant improvements across different\nvisual encoders and language models.

The steady-state\nproblem of the Keller-Segel system is reduced to a scalar Dirichlet nonlocal\nelliptic problem with singularity. Studying this nonlocal problem, we obtain\nthe unique steady-state solution which possesses a boundary spike-layer profile\nas nutrient diffusion coefficient $\\varepsilon>0$ tends to zero. When the\ndomain is radially symmetric, we find the explicit expansion for the slope of\nboundary-layer profiles at the boundary and boundary-layer thickness in terms\nof the radius as $\\varepsilon>0$ is small, which pinpoints how the boundary\ncurvature affects the boundary-layer profile and thickness. Furthermore, we\nestablish the nonlinear exponential stability of the boundary-layer\nsteady-state solution for the radially symmetric domain. The main challenge\nencountered in the analysis is that the singularity will arise when the\nnutrient diffusion coefficient $\\varepsilon>0$ is small for both stationary and\ntime-dependent problems. By relegating the nonlocal steady-state problem to\nlocal problems and performing a delicate analysis using the barrier method and\nFermi coordinates, we can obtain refined estimates for the solution of local\nsteady-state problem near the boundary. This strategy finally helps us to find\nthe asymptotic profile of the solution to the nonlocal problem as $\\varepsilon\n\\to 0$ so that the singularity is accurately captured and hence properly\nhandled to achieve our results.",

By embracing this mathematical underpinning, the research seeks to\nextract more information about the behavior of the function under complex\nreal-world scenarios and estimate the motion of areas with a lack of texture.\nAn impressive showcase of the algorithm's capabilities emerges through its\nperformance on renowned optical flow benchmarks such as KITTI (2015) and\nMiddlebury. The average endpoint error (AEE), which computes the Euclidian\ndistance between the calculated flow field and the ground truth flow field,\nstands notably diminished, validating the effectiveness of the algorithm in\nhandling complex motion patterns.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical\nimaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution\nimaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and\nblood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a\nmultiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is\nhighly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the\nproblem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems,\nas there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various\napplications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the\nsystems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel\ncomputational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT\nimaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach\nincorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming\nthe bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT,\nincluding priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the\nvariational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood\nfunction needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based\ndesign metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of\nestimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in\nguiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT\ndesign schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry.

It is observed that whether the user's needs are\nmet often triggers various sentiments, which can be pertinent to the successful\nestimation of user satisfaction, and vice versa. Thus, User Satisfaction\nEstimation (USE) and Sentiment Analysis (SA) should be treated as a joint,\ncollaborative effort, considering the strong connections between the sentiment\nstates of speakers and the user satisfaction. Existing joint learning\nframeworks mainly unify the two highly pertinent tasks over cascade or\nshared-bottom implementations, however they fail to distinguish task-specific\nand common features, which will produce sub-optimal utterance representations\nfor downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Speaker Turn-Aware\nMulti-Task Adversarial Network (STMAN) for dialogue-level USE and\nutterance-level SA. Specifically, we first introduce a multi-task adversarial\nstrategy which trains a task discriminator to make utterance representation\nmore task-specific, and then utilize a speaker-turn aware multi-task\ninteraction strategy to extract the common features which are complementary to\neach task.

Among the various approaches for XMC, tree-based linear\nmodels are effective due to their superior efficiency and simplicity.

Many past works\nassume that storing the model is not affordable and apply techniques such as\npruning to save space, which may lead to performance loss. In this work, we\nconduct both theoretical and empirical analyses on the space to store a tree\nmodel under the assumption of sparse data, a condition frequently met in text\ndata. We found that, some features may be unused when training binary\nclassifiers in a tree method, resulting in zero values in the weight vectors.\nHence, storing only non-zero elements can greatly save space. Our experimental\nresults indicate that tree models can achieve up to a 95% reduction in storage\nspace compared to the standard one-vs-rest method for multi-label text\nclassification. Our research provides a simple procedure to estimate the size\nof a tree model before training any classifier in the tree nodes.

Unlike the isolated formation\nchannel, double NS systems from the dynamical formation channel have moderate\nto high orbital eccentricities.

    "abstract": "This study presents two models to optimize pressure management in water\ndistribution networks. The first model forecasts pressure at distribution\npoints and compares predictions with actual data to detect anomalies such as\nleaks and blockages. Early detection allows for timely interventions,\nminimizing economic losses and ensuring system sustainability. The second model\nestimates the necessary inlet pressure based on the influence of various\ndistribution points, ensuring consistent water supply while reducing waste and\noptimizing resource management. Both models utilize modern machine learning\nalgorithms to enhance the prediction process. The methodology includes the\nCNN-EMD model, which analyzes historical data collected every 15 minutes over\ntwo months to predict future pressures. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)\nmethod identifies fluctuations and anomalies, improving prediction accuracy.\nThe second model combines CNN, EMD, and LSTM techniques to forecast required\ninlet pressure, emphasizing the impact of distribution points. Results show\nthat the CNN-EMD and CNN-EMD-LSTM models enhance pressure management\ncapabilities, with the first model achieving an anomaly detection accuracy of\n85% to 95% and the second model predicting inlet pressure with an average\naccuracy of 93%. This enables flexible system adjustments and identifies\ncritical factors affecting inlet pressure. In conclusion, advanced machine\nlearning models like CNN-EMD and LSTM significantly improve pressure management\nin water distribution networks, facilitating early issue identification,\nensuring efficient water supply, and optimizing resource management for future\ngenerations.",

While recognizing the significance of the CTTS task, prior\nstudies have not thoroughly investigated speech emphasis expression, which is\nessential for conveying the underlying intention and attitude in human-machine\ninteraction scenarios, due to the scarcity of conversational emphasis datasets\nand the difficulty in context understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel\nEmphasis Rendering scheme for the CTTS model, termed ER-CTTS, that includes two\nmain components: 1) we simultaneously take into account textual and acoustic\ncontexts, with both global and local semantic modeling to understand the\nconversation context comprehensively; 2) we deeply integrate multi-modal and\nmulti-scale context to learn the influence of context on the emphasis\nexpression of the current utterance. Finally, the inferred emphasis feature is\nfed into the neural speech synthesizer to generate conversational speech. To\naddress data scarcity, we create emphasis intensity annotations on the existing\nconversational dataset (DailyTalk).

This phenomenon holds implications for various\nneurological conditions, including spreading depression, migraine, certain\ntypes of epilepsy, and potentially, learning processes. A quantitative analysis\nis essential for understanding the dynamics of potassium clearance following a\nseries of action potentials. This clearance process involves multiple\nstructures along the nerve, including glia, the extracellular space, axons, and\nthe perivascular space, necessitating a spatially distributed systems approach\nakin to the cable equations of nerve physiology. In this study, we propose a\nmulti-domain model for the optic nerve to investigate potassium accumulation\nand clearance dynamics. The model accounts for the convection, diffusion, and\nelectrical migration of fluid and ions, revealing the significant roles of glia\nand the perivascular space in potassium buffering. Specifically, our findings\nsuggest that potassium clearance primarily occurs through convective flow\nwithin the syncytia of glia, driven by osmotic pressure differences.\nAdditionally, the perivascular space serves as a crucial pathway for potassium\nbuffering and fluid circulation, further contributing to the overall clearance\nprocess.

The core innovation of our work lies in\nintroducing a novel complexification approach to the energy parameter $u$,\ndistinct from the common complexification of the (semi-classical) expansion\nparameter used in Borel summability. This new technique allows for continuous\nanalytical continuation across different sectors of a potential while\nmaintaining the exact quantization condition, even before median summation. By\nredefining the $A$-cycle above the potential barrier top, we ensure the\nquantization condition remains real and, by use of the Stokes automorphism and\nthe median resummation, show that the resurgence structure is preserved across\ntransitions between sectors. Furthermore, we discuss the Weber-type exact-WKB\nmethod, offering exact estimates for quantum actions around all types of saddle\npoints, generalizing previous results. Through the analysis of these quantum\nactions, we reveal the presence of $S$-duality, facilitating the exchange\nbetween perturbative and non-perturbative behaviors, and we conjecture the\nmapping of the P-NP relations between dual theories.

    "abstract": "Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) aims to generate natural textual\ndescriptions for input audio signals. Recent progress in audio pre-trained\nmodels and large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced audio\nunderstanding and textual reasoning capabilities, making improvements in AAC\npossible. In this paper, we propose SLAM-AAC to further enhance AAC with\nparaphrasing augmentation and CLAP-Refine through LLMs. Our approach uses the\nself-supervised EAT model to extract fine-grained audio representations, which\nare then aligned with textual embeddings via lightweight linear layers. The\ncaption generation LLM is efficiently fine-tuned using the LoRA adapter.\nDrawing inspiration from the back-translation method in machine translation, we\nimplement paraphrasing augmentation to expand the Clotho dataset during\npre-training. This strategy helps alleviate the limitation of scarce audio-text\npairs and generates more diverse captions from a small set of audio clips.\nDuring inference, we introduce the plug-and-play CLAP-Refine strategy to fully\nexploit multiple decoding outputs, akin to the n-best rescoring strategy in\nspeech recognition. Using the CLAP model for audio-text similarity calculation,\nwe could select the textual descriptions generated by multiple searching beams\nthat best match the input audio. Experimental results show that SLAM-AAC\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on Clotho V2 and AudioCaps, surpassing\nprevious mainstream models.",

In this method, near a discontinuity, if there is a\nsmooth sub-stencil with higher-order of accuracy, it is used in the\nreconstruction procedure. Furthermore, in smooth regions, all the sub-stencils\nof the same order of accuracy form the stencil with the highest order of\naccuracy as the conventional WENO scheme. The presented method is assessed\nusing several test cases of the linear wave equation and one- and\ntwo-dimensional Euler's equations of gas dynamics.

At this level of quality,\ndistinguishing between compressed and original content becomes difficult,\nhighlighting the need for assessment methodologies that are sensitive to even\nthe smallest visual quality differences. Conventional subjective visual quality\nassessments often use absolute category rating scales, ranging from\n``excellent'' to ``bad''. While suitable for evaluating more pronounced\ndistortions, these scales are inadequate for detecting subtle visual\ndifferences. The JPEG standardization project AIC is currently developing a\nsubjective image quality assessment methodology for high-fidelity images. This\npaper presents the proposed assessment methods, a dataset of high-quality\ncompressed images, and their corresponding crowdsourced visual quality ratings.\nIt also outlines a data analysis approach that reconstructs quality scale\nvalues in just noticeable difference (JND) units. The assessment method uses\nboosting techniques on visual stimuli to help observers detect compression\nartifacts more clearly. This is followed by a rescaling process that adjusts\nthe boosted quality values back to the original perceptual scale. This\nreconstruction yields a fine-grained, high-precision quality scale in JND\nunits, providing more informative results for practical applications.

In particular, cosmological studies based on cosmic\nshear and other large-scale structure probes routinely find a value of the\namplitude of the fluctuations in the universe S8 smaller than the one inferred\nfrom the primary cosmic microwave background. In this work, we investigate this\ntension by measuring structure evolution across cosmic time as probed by the\nnumber counts of the massive halos with the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey\ncluster catalog in the Western Galactic Hemisphere complemented with the\noverlapping Dark Energy Survey Year-3, KiloDegree Survey, and Hyper Suprime-Cam\ndata for weak lensing mass calibration, by implementing two different\nparameterizations and a model-agnostic method. In the first model, we measure\nthe cosmic linear growth index as {\\gamma} = 1.19 \\pm 0.21, in tension with the\nstandard value of {\\gamma} = 0.55, but in good statistical agreement with other\nlarge-scale structures probes. The second model is a phenomenological scenario\nin which we rescale the linear matter power spectrum at low redshift to\ninvestigate a potential reduction of structure formation, providing similar\nresults. Finally, in a third strategy, we consider a standard {\\Lambda}CDM\ncosmology, but we separate the cluster catalog into five redshift bins,\nmeasuring the cosmological parameters in each and inferring the evolution of\nthe structure formation, finding hints of a reduction. Interestingly, the S8\nvalue inferred from eRASS1 cluster number counts, when we add a degree of\nfreedom to the matter power spectrum, recovers the value inferred by cosmic\nshear studies.",

This is a major limitation since the\nnumber of clusters is typically unknown if labeled data is unavailable. Thus,\nan area of research has emerged that addresses this problem. Most of these\napproaches estimate the number of clusters separated from the clustering\nprocess.

Despite their success, these\nmethods also present limitations when dealing with practical FedMVC scenarios\ninvolving heterogeneous hybrid views, where a mixture of both single-view and\nmulti-view clients exhibit varying degrees of heterogeneity. In this paper, we\npropose a novel FedMVC framework, which concurrently addresses two challenges\nassociated with heterogeneous hybrid views, i.e., client gap and view gap. To\naddress the client gap, we design a local-synergistic contrastive learning\napproach that helps single-view clients and multi-view clients achieve\nconsistency for mitigating heterogeneity among all clients. To address the view\ngap, we develop a global-specific weighting aggregation method, which\nencourages global models to learn complementary features from hybrid views.

In this paper, we develop a coarse-grained, discrete\nstate model of a self-aggregating colloidal particle system inspired by the\nconcepts of Markov state modelling. The specific self-aggregating system\nstudied here involves field-responsive colloidal particles in orthogonal\nelectric and magnetic fields. Starting from particle-resolved (Brownian\ndynamics) simulations, we define the discrete states by categorizing each\nparticle according to it's local structure. We then describe the kinetics\nbetween these states as a series of stochastic, memoryless jumps. In contrast\nto other works on colloidal self-assembly, our coarse-grained approach\ndescribes the simultaneous formation and evolution of multiple aggregates from\nsingle particles. Our discrete model also takes into account the changes in\ntransition dynamics between the discrete states as the size of the largest\ncluster grows. We validate the coarse-grained model by comparing the predicted\npopulation fraction in each of the discrete states with those calculated\ndirectly from the particle-resolved simulations as a function of the largest\ncluster size. We then predict population fractions in presence of\nnoise-averaging and in a situation where a model parameter is changed\ninstantaneously after a certain time.

In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric\nactive compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the\ncentre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another\nviscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to\ncharacterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah\nnumber to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary\nnumber so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine\nthree cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet\nsuspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian\nfluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined\nwithin a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid.\nOur findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet\nare determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of\nthe droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of\nthe surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this\ninteraction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow,\nwhich governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn,\nplays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the\nsquirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either\nenhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a\ndroplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.",

CCBIE facilitates\nautomatic and dynamic soft clustering of items in a top-down manner, and\ncapturing macro-preference information of users through clusters. Specifically,\nby leveraging the cluster embedding matrix of items, CCBIE calculates the\ncluster assignment matrix for items and also captures the extent of user\npreferences across different clusters, thereby elucidating the similarity\nbetween users and items on a macro-scale level. CCBIE effectively preserves the\nglobal properties of bipartite graphs, maintaining the cluster structure of\nisomorphic nodes and accounting for long-range dependencies among heterogeneous\nnodes. Our approach significantly enhances user-item collaborative relation\nmodeling by integrating adaptive clustering for relationship learning, thereby\nmarkedly improving prediction performance, particularly benefiting cold users\nand items.

The duration of the\nprocess depends not only on the total population size $n$, but also on the\nspatial structure of the population. In this work, we consider the Moran\nprocess with a single type of individuals who invade and colonize an otherwise\nempty environment. Mathematically, this corresponds to the setting where the\nresidents have zero reproduction rate, thus they never reproduce. We present\ntwo main contributions. First, in contrast to the Moran process in which\nresidents do reproduce, we show that the colonization time is always at most a\npolynomial function of the population size $n$. Namely, we show that\ncolonization always takes at most $\\frac12n^3-\\frac12n^2$ expected steps, and\nfor each $n$, we exactly identify the unique slowest spatial structure where it\ntakes exactly that many steps. Moreover, we establish a stronger bound of\nroughly $n^{2.5}$ steps for spatial structures that contain only two-way\nconnections and an even stronger bound of roughly $n^2$ steps for lattice-like\nspatial structures. Second, we discuss various complications that one faces\nwhen attempting to measure fixation times and colonization times in spatially\nstructured populations, and we propose to measure the real duration of the\nprocess, rather than counting the steps of the classic Moran process.",

To overcome these limitations, we present DRCap, a\ndata-efficient and flexible zero-shot audio captioning system that requires\ntext-only data for training and can quickly adapt to new domains without\nadditional fine-tuning. DRCap integrates a contrastive language-audio\npre-training (CLAP) model and a large-language model (LLM) as its backbone.\nDuring training, the model predicts the ground-truth caption with a fixed text\nencoder from CLAP, whereas, during inference, the text encoder is replaced with\nthe audio encoder to generate captions for audio clips in a zero-shot manner.\nTo mitigate the modality gap of the CLAP model, we use both the projection\nstrategy from the encoder side and the retrieval-augmented generation strategy\nfrom the decoder side. Specifically, audio embeddings are first projected onto\na text embedding support to absorb extensive semantic information within the\njoint multi-modal space of CLAP. At the same time, similar captions retrieved\nfrom a datastore are fed as prompts to instruct the LLM, incorporating external\nknowledge to take full advantage of its strong generative capability.\nConditioned on both the projected CLAP embedding and the retrieved similar\ncaptions, the model is able to produce a more accurate and semantically rich\ntextual description. By tailoring the text embedding support and the caption\ndatastore to the target domain, DRCap acquires a robust ability to adapt to new\ndomains in a training-free manner.

These models\nhave, however, been shown to be notoriously difficult to train, which we\nhypothesize is partially due to the architectures, called ansatzes, that are\nhardly studied at this point. Therefore, in this paper, we take a step back and\nanalyze ansatzes. We initially consider their expressivity, i.e., the space of\noperations they are able to express, and show that the closeness to being a\n2-design, the primarily used measure, fails at capturing this property. Hence,\nwe look for alternative ways to characterize ansatzes by considering the local\nneighborhood of the model space, in particular, analyzing model\ndistinguishability upon small perturbation of parameters. We derive an upper\nbound on their distinguishability, showcasing that QNNs with few parameters are\nhardly discriminable upon update. Our numerical experiments support our bounds\nand further indicate that there is a significant degree of variability, which\nstresses the need for warm-starting or clever initialization. Altogether, our\nwork provides an ansatz-centric perspective on training dynamics and\ndifficulties in QNNs, ultimately suggesting that iterative training of small\nquantum models may not be effective, which contrasts their initial motivation.",

In literature it has been proved that considering a\nvariable viscosity fluid saturating a porous medium does not produce any\nadditional oscillating motions at the onset of convection. In this direction,\nsimilar results have been obtained in [1], where the authors prove the validity\nof the principle of exchange of stabilities in a rotating porous medium. Here,\nit is shown numerically that the combined effect of rotation and variable\nviscosity may lead to the occurrence of oscillatory convection. This result is\nremarkable and not known in literature, to the best of our knowledge. The\nstabilising effect of rotation on the onset of convection is recovered, while\nit is shown that the effect of variable viscosity on the behaviour of the\ncritical Rayleigh number depends on the choice of the Taylor number.

Accurately reconstructing an object's complete 3D structure and texture\nhas numerous applications in real-world scenarios, including robotic\nmanipulation, grasping, 3D scene understanding, and AR/VR. Recent advancements\nin 3D object generation have introduced techniques that reconstruct an object's\n3D shape and texture by optimizing the efficient representation of Gaussian\nSplatting, guided by pre-trained 2D or 3D diffusion models. However, a notable\ndisparity exists between the training datasets of these models, leading to\ndistinct differences in their outputs. While 2D models generate highly detailed\nvisuals, they lack cross-view consistency in geometry and texture. In contrast,\n3D models ensure consistency across different views but often result in overly\nsmooth textures. We propose bridging the gap between 2D and 3D diffusion models\nto address this limitation by integrating a two-stage frequency-based\ndistillation loss with Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we leverage geometric\npriors in the low-frequency spectrum from a 3D diffusion model to maintain\nconsistent geometry and use a 2D diffusion model to refine the fidelity and\ntexture in the high-frequency spectrum of the generated 3D structure, resulting\nin more detailed and fine-grained outcomes.

Firstly, we establish the differential algebraic equation models of\nthe rupture and leakage faults respectively. The boundary conditions at the\nfault locations are derived using the method of characteristics. Secondly, we\npropose utilizing a semi-implicit approach to perform post-fault simulations.\nThe approach, based on the stiffly-accurate Rosenbrock scheme, possesses the\nimplicit numerical stability and explicit computation burdens. Therefore, the\nhigh-dimensional and multi-time-scale stiff models can be solved in an\nefficient and robust way. Thirdly, to accurately locate the simulation events,\nwhich can not be predicted a priori, we propose a critical-time-location\nstrategy based on the continuous Runge-Kutta approach. In case studies, we\nverified the accuracy and the efficiency superiority of the proposed simulation\napproach. The impacts of gas faults on gas and power dynamics were investigated\nby simulation, where the critical events were identified accurately.

    "abstract": "In the real world, unmanned surface vehicles (USV) often need to coordinate\nwith each other to accomplish specific tasks. However, achieving cooperative\ncontrol in multi-agent systems is challenging due to issues such as\nnon-stationarity and partial observability. Recent advancements in Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) provide new perspectives to address these\nchallenges. Therefore, we propose using the multi-agent deep deterministic\npolicy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm with communication to address multiple\nships' cooperation problems under partial observability. We developed two tasks\nbased on OpenAI's gym environment: cooperative navigation and cooperative\ncollision avoidance. In these tasks, ships must not only learn effective\ncontrol strategies but also establish communication protocols with other\nagents. We analyze the impact of external noise on communication, the effect of\ninter-agent communication on performance, and the communication patterns\nlearned by the agents. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework\neffectively addresses cooperative navigation and collision avoidance among\nmultiple vessels, significantly outperforming traditional single-agent\nalgorithms. Agents establish a consistent communication protocol, enabling them\nto compensate for missing information through shared observations and achieve\nbetter coordination.",

Dimensionality reduction is one\nof the main challenges in the modern era of big data and big models.\nDimensionality reduction for systems with Lyapunov functions requires it\npreserving dissipativity: the reduced system must also have a Lyapunov\nfunction, which is expected to be a restriction of the original Lyapunov\nfunction on the manifold of the reduced motion. An additional complexity of the\nproblem is that the equations of motion themselves are often unknown in detail\nin advance and must be determined in the course of the study, while the\nLyapunov function could be determined based on incomplete data. Therefore, the\nprojection problem arises: for a given Lyapunov function, find a field of\nprojectors such that the reduction of it any dissipative system is again a\ndissipative system. In this paper, we present an explicit construction of such\nprojectors and prove their uniqueness. We have also taken the first step beyond\nthe approximation by manifolds.

This has sparked many efforts focusing on enhancing\nefficiency during training and inference. In this study, we investigate the\ncomputation redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) during\ninference. We propose different methods to skip computations, such as skipping\nentire blocks, FFN or self-attention (SA) layers. Additionally, we explore\nparallelizing certain layers, such as FFN and SA layers. Our findings validate\nthat (1) significant amount of computations can be avoided at inference time,\nespecially for tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). (2) Skipping\ncomputations during training can recover 97% of the original performance, even\nwhen skipping half of the blocks or removing 70% of the weights. Alternatively,\n(3) properly training with smaller LLMs can yield comparable performance to\nLLMs 2 or 3 times larger. To conclude, we extend our investigation to recent\nMLLMs, such as LLaVA-1.5, showing similar observations. Our work show that\nthere is redundant computations inside MLLMs and thus the potential for\nsignificantly improving inference costs without sacrificing performance.

The BH was seeded with\na mass of $10^4$ M$_\\odot$ at redshift $z\\approx17$. We compare the base model\nthat uses an Eddington limit on the BH accretion rate and thermal isotropic\nfeedback by the AGN, with one where super-Eddington accretion is allowed, as\nwell as two other models with BH spin and jets. In the base model, the BH grows\nat the Eddington limit from $z=9$ to $z=5.5$, when it becomes massive enough to\nhalt its own and its host galaxy's growth through feedback. We find that\nallowing super-Eddington accretion leads to drastic differences, with the BH\ngoing through an intense but short super-Eddington growth burst around\n$z\\approx7.5$, during which it increases its mass by orders of magnitude,\nbefore feedback stops further growth (of both the BH and the galaxy). By\n$z\\approx4$ the galaxy is only half as massive in the super-Eddington cases,\nand an order of magnitude more extended, with the half-mass radius reaching\nvalues of a few physical kpc instead of a few hundred pc. The BH masses in our\nsimulations are consistent with the intrinsic BH mass$-$stellar mass relation\ninferred from high-redshift observations by JWST. This shows that galaxy\nformation models using the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology are capable of reproducing\nthe observed massive BHs at high redshift.

    "abstract": "The inner shadow of a black hole, as a projection of the event horizon, is\nregarded as a potential tool for testing gravitational theories and\nconstraining system parameters. Whether this holds in the case of a tilted\naccretion disk warrants further investigation. In this paper, we employ a\nray-tracing algorithm to simulate images of the Kerr black hole illuminated by\na tilted thin accretion disk, with particular attention to the relationship\nbetween the inner shadow and system parameters. Our findings reveal that in the\ncase of an equatorial accretion disk, the Kerr black hole exhibits a minimum\ninner shadow size of $S_{\\textrm{min}} = 13.075$ M$^{2}$, where M denotes the\nblack hole mass. This minimum is achieved when the viewing angle is $0^{\\circ}$\nand the spin parameter approaches $1$. However, with a non-zero disk tilt, the\ninner shadow exhibits novel configurations -- taking on petal, crescent, or\neyebrow shapes -- significantly smaller than $S_{\\textrm{min}}$ across various\nparameter spaces. This indicates that the inner shadow is highly sensitive to\nthe accretion environment, suggesting that caution is needed when using it as a\ndiagnostic tool for black holes. Notably, an observed inner shadow smaller than\n$S_{\\textrm{min}}$ would either indicate the presence of a tilted accretion\ndisk or support the viability of modified gravity. Moreover, in certain\nparameter spaces, we identify the emergence of a dual-shadow structure, which\ncould also serve as a probe for the tilted accretion disk.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring thermal comfort is essential for the well-being and productivity of\nindividuals in built environments. Of the various thermal comfort indicators,\nthe mean radiant temperature (MRT) is very challenging to measure. Most common\nmeasurement methodologies are time-consuming and not user-friendly. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes a novel MRT measurement framework that uses\nvisual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and semantic segmentation\ntechniques. The proposed approach follows the rule of thumb of the traditional\nMRT calculation method using surface temperature and view factors. However, it\nemploys visual SLAM and creates a 3D thermal point cloud with enriched surface\ntemperature information. The framework then implements Grounded SAM, a new\nobject detection and segmentation tool to extract features with distinct\ntemperature profiles on building surfaces. The detailed segmentation of thermal\nfeatures not only reduces potential errors in the calculation of the MRT but\nalso provides an efficient reconstruction of the spatial MRT distribution in\nthe indoor environment. We also validate the calculation results with the\nreference measurement methodology. This data-driven framework offers faster and\nmore efficient MRT measurements and spatial mapping than conventional methods.\nIt can enable the direct engagement of researchers and practitioners in MRT\nmeasurements and contribute to research on thermal comfort and radiant cooling\nand heating systems.",

Despite many years of search for the neutrino events\nassociated with GRBs from IceCube, there were no results. However, the absence\nof search results for neutrinos provides a unique opportunity to constrain the\nparameter space of GRB jet models. In this paper, we chose four peculiar GRBs\nwith two different types of jet composition to investigate neutrino emission.\nIt is found that only GRB 211211A could be well constrained within the\ndissipative photosphere model. By adopting the specific parameters of the\nphotosphere, one can obtain $\\varepsilon _{\\rm p}/\\varepsilon_{\\rm e}<8$ for\n$f_{\\rm p}>0.2$ from GRB 211211A.

Moreover, we also investigate the\ndetection prospects of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs and find that it is\ndifficult to detect at least one high-energy neutrino associated with GRBs from\nthe ICMART model even during the IceCube-Gen2 operation. For the GRB\n211211A-like events, it is possible to detect at least one neutrino coincident\nwith the gravitational wave during the IceCube-Gen2 operation, if such an event\noriginated from mergers of compact stars within the photosphere dissipation.",

Comprehensive experimental results, including evaluations on public\nacademic benchmarks for natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning,\nand image-text understanding, as well as real-world industrial text Ads\nrelevance datasets, demonstrate that MTL-LoRA outperforms LoRA and its various\nvariants with comparable or even fewer learnable parameters in MTL setting.",

    "abstract": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) is the task of answering a question about an\nimage and requires processing multimodal input and reasoning to obtain the\nanswer. Modular solutions that use declarative representations within the\nreasoning component have a clear advantage over end-to-end trained systems\nregarding interpretability. The downside is that crafting the rules for such a\ncomponent can be an additional burden on the developer. We address this\nchallenge by presenting an approach for declarative knowledge distillation from\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). Our method is to prompt an LLM to extend an\ninitial theory on VQA reasoning, given as an answer-set program, to meet the\nrequirements of the VQA task. Examples from the VQA dataset are used to guide\nthe LLM, validate the results, and mend rules if they are not correct by using\nfeedback from the ASP solver. We demonstrate that our approach works on the\nprominent CLEVR and GQA datasets.

    "abstract": "The hybrid analog/digital architecture that connects a limited number of RF\nchains to multiple antennas through phase shifters could effectively address\nthe energy consumption issues in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nsystems. However, the main challenges in hybrid precoding lie in the coupling\nbetween analog and digital precoders and the constant modulus constraint.\nGenerally, traditional optimization algorithms for this problem typically\nsuffer from high computational complexity or suboptimal performance, while deep\nlearning based solutions exhibit poor scalability and robustness. This paper\nproposes a plug and play, free of pre-training solution that leverages gradient\nguided meta learning (GGML) framework to maximize the spectral efficiency of\nMIMO systems through hybrid precoding. Specifically, GGML utilizes gradient\ninformation as network input to facilitate the sharing of gradient information\nflow. We retain the iterative process of traditional algorithms and leverage\nmeta learning to alternately optimize the precoder. Simulation results show\nthat this method outperforms existing methods, demonstrates robustness to\nvariations in system parameters, and can even exceed the performance of fully\ndigital weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) precoding with the same\nnumber of antennas.",

    "abstract": "Recently, quantization has been widely used for the compression and\nacceleration of large language models (LLMs). Due to the outliers in LLMs, it\nis crucial to flatten weights and activations to minimize quantization error\nwith equally spaced quantization points. Prior research explores various\npre-quantization transformations to suppress outliers, such as per-channel\nscaling and Hadamard transformation. However, we observe that these transformed\nweights and activations can still exhibit steep and dispersed distributions. In\nthis paper, we propose FlatQuant (Fast and Learnable Affine Transformation), a\nnew post-training quantization approach that enhances the flatness of weights\nand activations. Our approach identifies optimal affine transformations for\neach linear layer, calibrated in hours via a lightweight objective. To reduce\nruntime overhead of affine transformation, we apply Kronecker product with two\nlightweight matrices, and fuse all operations in FlatQuant into a single\nkernel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlatQuant establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art benchmark for quantization. For example, it achieves less than\n1\\% accuracy drop for W4A4 quantization on the LLaMA-3-70B model, surpassing\nSpinQuant by 7.5\\%. Additionally, it provides up to 2.3x prefill speedup and\n1.7x decoding speedup compared to the FP16 model. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/ruikangliu/FlatQuant.",

Specifically, RAEE leverages large language models (LLMs) as\nevaluation agents, incorporating an adaptive mechanism to achieve adaptive\nevaluations for precision and recall of triggers and arguments. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that: (1) RAEE achieves a very strong correlation with\nhuman judgments; (2) after reassessing 14 models, including advanced LLMs, on\n10 datasets, there is a significant performance gap between exact match and\nRAEE. The exact match evaluation significantly underestimates the performance\nof existing event extraction models, and in particular underestimates the\ncapabilities of LLMs; (3) fine-grained analysis under RAEE evaluation reveals\ninsightful phenomena worth further exploration.

We find that both thermal and nonthermal emissions do\nexist in the prompt emission of those four bright GRBs, which suggests that a\nhybrid jet (e.g., matter and Poynting-flux outflow) in GRBs should exist.\nMoreover, strong positive correlations (e.g., $F_{\\rm tot}-\\Gamma$ and $F_{\\rm\ntot}-kT$) in the time-resolved spectra of ME and EE for those four GRBs have\nbeen discovered.

Among them, JSON is the most popular choice for exchanging\ndata between different systems and programming languages, while JSON libraries\nserve as the programming toolkit for this task. Despite their widespread use,\nbugs in JSON libraries can cause severe issues such as data inconsistencies and\nsecurity vulnerabilities. Unit test generation techniques are widely adopted to\nidentify bugs in various libraries. However, there is limited systematic\ntesting effort specifically for exposing bugs within JSON libraries in\nindustrial practice. In this paper, we propose JSONTestGen, an approach\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate unit tests for fastjson2, a\npopular open source JSON library from Alibaba. Pre-trained on billions of\nopen-source text and code corpora, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable abilities\nin programming tasks. Based on historical bug-triggering unit tests, we utilize\nLLMs to generate more diverse test cases by incorporating JSON domain-specific\nmutation rules. To systematically and efficiently identify potential bugs, we\nadopt differential testing on the results of the generated unit tests. Our\nevaluation shows that JSONTestGen outperforms existing test generation tools in\nunknown defect detection. With JSONTestGen, we found 34 real bugs in fastjson2,\n30 of which have already been fixed, including 12 non-crashing bugs.

    "abstract": "This review describes the field of Bose polarons, arising when mobile\nimpurities are immersed into a bosonic quantum gas. The latter can be realized\nby a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms, or of exciton\npolaritons in a semiconductor, which has led to a series of experimental\nobservations of Bose polarons near inter-species Feshbach resonances that we\nsurvey. Following an introduction to the topic, with references to its historic\nroots and a presentation of the Bose polaron Hamiltonian, we summarize\nstate-of-the-art experiments. Next we provide a detailed discussion of polaron\nmodels, starting from the ubiquitous Fr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian that applies at\nweak couplings. We proceed by a survey of concurrent theoretical methods used\nfor solving strongly interacting Bose polaron problems. The subsequent sections\nare devoted to the large bodies of work investigating strong coupling Bose\npolarons, including detailed comparisons with radio-frequency (RF) spectra\nobtained in ultracold atom experiments; to investigations of universal few-body\nand Efimov states associated with a Feshbach resonance in atomic mixtures; to\nstudies of quantum dynamics and polarons out of equilibrium; Bose polarons in\nlow-dimensional; induced interactions among polarons and bipolaron formation;\nand to Bose polarons at non-zero temperatures. We end our review by detailed\ndiscussions of closely related experimental setups and systems, including ionic\nimpurities, systems with strong light-matter interactions, and variations and\nextensions of the Bose polaron concepts e.g. to baths with topological order or\nstrong interactions relevant for correlated electrons. Finally, an outlook is\npresented, highlighting possible future research directions and open questions\nin the field as a whole.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication\n(ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in\nwhich the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a\nmulti-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming\nis studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna\npositions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide\na new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response,\nand further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication\nand sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information\n(MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex\nfractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the\nfractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm\nto address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively\nsolving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the\nantenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the\ndirect gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas,\na 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation\nresults show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC\nsystem, achieving 59.8\\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system\nenabled by FPAs.

Despite its effectiveness, the mechanism behind ICL\nremains underexplored. To better understand how ICL integrates the examples\nwith the knowledge learned by the LLM during pre-training (i.e., pre-training\nknowledge) and how the examples impact ICL, this paper conducts a theoretical\nstudy in binary classification tasks. In particular, we introduce a\nprobabilistic model extending from the Gaussian mixture model to exactly\nquantify the impact of pre-training knowledge, label frequency, and label noise\non the prediction accuracy. Based on our analysis, when the pre-training\nknowledge contradicts the knowledge in the examples, whether ICL prediction\nrelies more on the pre-training knowledge or the examples depends on the number\nof examples. In addition, the label frequency and label noise of the examples\nboth affect the accuracy of the ICL prediction, where the minor class has a\nlower accuracy, and how the label noise impacts the accuracy is determined by\nthe specific noise level of the two classes. Extensive simulations are\nconducted to verify the correctness of the theoretical results, and real-data\nexperiments also align with the theoretical insights.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of Internet technology, the threat of malware to\ncomputer systems and network security has intensified. Malware affects\nindividual privacy and security and poses risks to critical infrastructures of\nenterprises and nations. The increasing quantity and complexity of malware,\nalong with its concealment and diversity, challenge traditional detection\ntechniques. Static detection methods struggle against variants and packed\nmalware, while dynamic methods face high costs and risks that limit their\napplication. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel and efficient\nmalware detection techniques to improve accuracy and robustness.\n  This study first employs the minhash algorithm to convert binary files of\nmalware into grayscale images, followed by the extraction of global and local\ntexture features using GIST and LBP algorithms. Additionally, the study\nutilizes IDA Pro to decompile and extract opcode sequences, applying N-gram and\ntf-idf algorithms for feature vectorization. The fusion of these features\nenables the model to comprehensively capture the behavioral characteristics of\nmalware.\n  In terms of model construction, a CNN-BiLSTM fusion model is designed to\nsimultaneously process image features and opcode sequences, enhancing\nclassification performance. Experimental validation on multiple public datasets\ndemonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional\ndetection techniques in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score, particularly\nin detecting variants and obfuscated malware with greater stability.\n  The research presented in this paper offers new insights into the development\nof malware detection technologies, validating the effectiveness of feature and\nmodel fusion, and holds promising application prospects.",

To further equip these T2I models with\nfine-grained spatial control, approaches like ControlNet introduce an extra\nnetwork that learns to follow a condition image. However, for every single\ncondition type, ControlNet requires independent training on millions of data\npairs with hundreds of GPU hours, which is quite expensive and makes it\nchallenging for ordinary users to explore and develop new types of conditions.\nTo address this problem, we propose the CtrLoRA framework, which trains a Base\nControlNet to learn the common knowledge of image-to-image generation from\nmultiple base conditions, along with condition-specific LoRAs to capture\ndistinct characteristics of each condition. Utilizing our pretrained Base\nControlNet, users can easily adapt it to new conditions, requiring as few as\n1,000 data pairs and less than one hour of single-GPU training to obtain\nsatisfactory results in most scenarios. Moreover, our CtrLoRA reduces the\nlearnable parameters by 90% compared to ControlNet, significantly lowering the\nthreshold to distribute and deploy the model weights. Extensive experiments on\nvarious types of conditions demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our\nmethod. Codes and model weights will be released at\nhttps://github.com/xyfJASON/ctrlora.",

However, existing mainstream TTA methods,\npredominantly operating at batch level, often exhibit suboptimal performance in\ncomplex real-world scenarios, particularly when confronting outliers or mixed\ndistributions. This phenomenon stems from a pronounced over-reliance on\nstatistical patterns over the distinct characteristics of individual instances,\nresulting in a divergence between the distribution captured by the model and\ndata characteristics. To address this challenge, we propose Meet-In-The-Middle\nbased Test-Time Adaptation ($\\textbf{MITA}$), which introduces energy-based\noptimization to encourage mutual adaptation of the model and data from opposing\ndirections, thereby meeting in the middle. MITA pioneers a significant\ndeparture from traditional approaches that focus solely on aligning the model\nto the data, facilitating a more effective bridging of the gap between model's\ndistribution and data characteristics.

However, we discover that the superior OOD\ndetection performance of state-of-the-art methods is achieved by secretly\nsacrificing the OOD generalization ability. Specifically, the classification\naccuracy of these models could deteriorate dramatically when they encounter\neven minor noise. This phenomenon contradicts the goal of model trustworthiness\nand severely restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios. What is the\nhidden reason behind such a limitation? In this work, we theoretically\ndemystify the ``\\textit{sensitive-robust}'' dilemma that lies in many existing\nOOD detection methods.

Using models like the Large Language and Vision Assistant\n(LLAVA), we generate high-quality captions based on fixed templates that\ncapture key semantic attributes such as gender, clothing, and age. By\naugmenting ReID training sets from uni-modality (image) to bi-modality (image\nand text), we introduce CLIP-SCGI, a simple yet effective framework that\nleverages synthesized captions to guide the learning of discriminative and\nrobust representations. Built on CLIP, CLIP-SCGI fuses image and text\nembeddings through two modules to enhance the training process. To address\nquality issues in generated captions, we introduce a caption-guided inversion\nmodule that captures semantic attributes from images by converting relevant\nvisual information into pseudo-word tokens based on the descriptions. This\napproach helps the model better capture key information and focus on relevant\nregions. The extracted features are then utilized in a cross-modal fusion\nmodule, guiding the model to focus on regions semantically consistent with the\ncaption, thereby facilitating the optimization of the visual encoder to extract\ndiscriminative and robust representations. Extensive experiments on four\npopular ReID benchmarks demonstrate that CLIP-SCGI outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art by a significant margin.",

Due to the\nmotion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature\nmatching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish,\nmaking direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct\nmethods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping\nsub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of\nfreedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an\nevent-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline.\nSpecifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient\nstrategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events.\nThe mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and\nlocal smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To\ncircumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and\nyaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion\npriors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for\ncontinuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling\nan accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system\nscales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better\nglobal positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive\nevaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions\nand scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against\nfive state-of-the-art methods.",

We\nsuppose that the flow is steady, axisymmetric, and rotating. Also, we focus on\nthe model in which the mass, the angular momentum, and the energy can be\ntransported outward by outflow. Similar to the pioneering studies, we consider\na power-law function for mass inflow rate as $\\dot{M} \\propto r^s$. We assume\nthat the power index $s$ is proportional to the dimensionless thickness $H/R$\nof disc. To analyze such a system, the hydrodynamic equations have extracted in\ncylindrical coordinates $(r,\\varphi,z)$. Then, the flow equations were\nvertically integrated, and a set of self-similar solutions was got in the\nradial direction. Our solutions include three essential parameters: $\\lambda$,\n$f$ and $\\zeta$.\n  The influence of the outflow on the dynamics of the disc is investigated by\nthe $\\lambda$ parameter. The degree of advection of flow is shown by the\nadvection parameter $f$. Also, energy extraction from the disc by the outflow\nis showed by $\\zeta$ parameter. Our findings demonstrate a significant\ncorrelation between the outflow parameters, flow advection parameter, and the\ntemperature, thickness, and inflow-outflow rate of the disc. In addition, we\nexplored the influence of these parameters on the power index $s$, too.

    "abstract": "The nearby long gamma-ray burst (GRB) 190829A was observed using the\nHST/WFC3/IR grisms about four weeks to 500 days after the burst. We find the\nspectral features of its associated supernova, SN 2019oyw, are redshifted by\nseveral thousands km/s compared to the redshift of the large spiral galaxy on\nwhich it is superposed. This velocity offset is seen in several features but\nmost clearly in Ca II NIR triplet $\\lambda\\lambda$ 8498, 8542, 8662 (CaIR3). We\nalso analyze VLT/FORS and X-shooter spectra of the SN and find strong evolution\nwith time of its P-Cygni features of CaIR3 from the blue to the red. However,\ncomparison with a large sample of Type Ic-BL and Ic SNe shows no other object\nwith the CaIR3 line as red as that of SN 2019oyw were it at the z = 0.0785\nredshift of the disk galaxy. This implies that SN 2019oyw is either a highly\nunusual SN or is moving rapidly with respect to its apparent host. Indeed,\nusing CaIR3 we find the redshift of SN 2019oyw is 0.0944 <= z <= 0.1156. The\nGRB-SN is superposed on a particularly dusty region of the massive spiral\ngalaxy; therefore, while we see no sign of a small host galaxy behind the\nspiral, it could be obscured. Our work provides a surprising result on the\norigins of GRB 190829A, as well as insights into the time evolution of GRB-SNe\nspectra and a method for directly determining the redshift of a GRB-SN using\nthe evolution of strong spectral features such as CaIR3.",

Consequently, this places\nstringent demands on X-ray detector technology, especially when X-ray energy\nexceeds 20 keV. The selection of a suitable scintillator material is crucial\nfor achieving optimal timing resolution, yet it poses a significant challenge\nin dynamic X-ray imaging. This study delves into the optimization of\nscintillator properties and their impact on spatial resolution and light\noutput, elucidating the performance of Ce-doped Gd3Ga3Al2O12 (GAGG:Ce)\nscintillators for X-ray imaging applications. We developed a micro X-ray\nimaging detector using a 100 $\\mu$m-thick GAGG:Ce scintillator plate and\nconducted X-ray imaging tests at the Aichi SR facility. The results\ndemonstrated that the resolution, quantified as the chart slit width at a\ncontrast transfer function (CTF) value of 10%, reached 2 - 3 $\\mu$m with a 4x\nlens, 0.52 $\\mu$m $\\pm$ 0.03 $\\mu$m with a 20x lens, and 0.42 $\\mu$m $\\pm$ 0.01\n$\\mu$m with a 40x lens. Although the results of this study did not achieve a\nspatial resolution nearing the effective pixel size of the 40x lens, the text\nalso elucidates the underlying reasons for this limitation. Furthermore, we\ncompared the X-ray sensitivity of our GAGG:Ce scintillator plate with that of a\ncommercial LuAG:Ce scintillator, revealing an approximately 1.5-fold increase\nin light output. As a demonstration, transmission images of dried small fish\nwere captured using the GAGG:Ce scintillator plate and the developed X-ray\nimaging system.

However, due to the imbalanced\ndistribution of pre-trained datasets, CLIP suffers from the bias problem in\nreal-world applications. Existing debiasing methods struggle to obtain\nsufficient image samples for minority groups and incur high costs for group\nlabeling. To address the limitations, we propose a Text-Only Debiasing\nframework called TOD, leveraging a text-as-image training paradigm to mitigate\nvisual biases. Specifically, this approach repurposes the text encoder to\nfunction as an image encoder, thereby eliminating the need for image data.\nSimultaneously, it utilizes a large language model (LLM) to generate a balanced\ntext dataset, which is then used for prompt tuning. However, we observed that\nthe model overfits to the text modality because label names, serving as\nsupervision signals, appear explicitly in the texts. To address this issue, we\nfurther introduce a Multi-Target Prediction (MTP) task that motivates the model\nto focus on complex contexts and distinguish between target and biased\ninformation. Extensive experiments on the Waterbirds and CelebA datasets show\nthat our method significantly improves group robustness, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results among image-free methods and even competitive\nperformance compared to image-supervised methods. Furthermore, the proposed\nmethod can be adapted to challenging scenarios with multiple or unknown bias\nattributes, demonstrating its strong generalization and robustness.",

Our\nresults indicate that while more training data generally leads to higher\nalgorithm performance, certain algorithms, such as FunkSVD and BiasedMF,\nparticularly with unbalanced and sparse datasets like Amazon Toys and Games,\nmaintain high-quality recommendations with up to a 50% reduction in training\ndata, achieving nDCG@10 scores within approximately 13% of full dataset\nperformance. These findings suggest that strategic dataset reduction can\ndecrease computational and environmental costs without substantially\ncompromising recommendation quality. This study advances sustainable and green\nrecommender systems by providing insights for reducing energy consumption while\nmaintaining effectiveness.",

We\nconsider a scenario where a base station (BS) is equipped with a uniform linear\narray (ULA) on a moving platform. The objective is to locate a point target in\nthe two-dimensional (2D) space by leveraging the near-field channel\ncharacteristics created by the movement of antenna arrays. Under this setup, we\nanalyze the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's 2D coordinate,\nwhich provides the fundamental sensing performance limits for localization. It\nis revealed that our proposed design with a moving array achieves a CRB that is\nproportional to the CRB obtained by an equivalent extremely large ULA matching\nthe platform's size. This shows that the movement of antenna array\nsignificantly enlarges its effective aperture to enable near-field sensing.\nNumerical results show that the proposed moving array design substantially\nenhances the target estimation performance compared to the conventional fixed\narray benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Recently, spatial-temporal forecasting technology has been rapidly developed\ndue to the increasing demand for traffic management and travel planning.\nHowever, existing traffic forecasting models still face the following\nlimitations. On one hand, most previous studies either focus too much on\nreal-world geographic information, neglecting the potential traffic correlation\nbetween different regions, or overlook geographical position and only model the\ntraffic flow relationship. On the other hand, the importance of different time\nslices is ignored in time modeling. Therefore, we propose a Fusion Matrix\nPrompt Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial-Temporal Interactive Traffic Forecasting\nFramework (FMPESTF), which is composed of spatial and temporal modules for\ndown-sampling traffic data. The network is designed to establish a traffic\nfusion matrix considering spatial-temporal heterogeneity as a query to\nreconstruct a data-driven dynamic traffic data structure, which accurately\nreveal the flow relationship of nodes in the traffic network. In addition, we\nintroduce attention mechanism in time modeling, and design hierarchical\nspatial-temporal interactive learning to help the model adapt to various\ntraffic scenarios. Through extensive experimental on six real-world traffic\ndatasets, our method is significantly superior to other baseline models,\ndemonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in dealing with traffic forecasting\nproblems.",

    "abstract": "Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized inference models designed\nto sample from unnormalized distributions over composable objects, with\napplications in generative modeling for tasks in fields such as causal\ndiscovery, NLP, and drug discovery. Traditionally, the training procedure for\nGFlowNets seeks to minimize the expected log-squared difference between a\nproposal (forward policy) and a target (backward policy) distribution, which\nenforces certain flow-matching conditions. While this training procedure is\nclosely related to variational inference (VI), directly attempting standard\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization can lead to proven biased and\npotentially high-variance estimators. Therefore, we first review four\ndivergence measures, namely, Renyi-$\\alpha$'s, Tsallis-$\\alpha$'s, reverse and\nforward KL's, and design statistically efficient estimators for their\nstochastic gradients in the context of training GFlowNets. Then, we verify that\nproperly minimizing these divergences yields a provably correct and empirically\neffective training scheme, often leading to significantly faster convergence\nthan previously proposed optimization. To achieve this, we design control\nvariates based on the REINFORCE leave-one-out and score-matching estimators to\nreduce the variance of the learning objectives' gradients.

Recently it was discovered that in\na many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence\nacross the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase\ntransition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different\nparts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe\nexperimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially\ncostly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the\nsimulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the\ndiscovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed\nexperimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase\ntransition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is\nfully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum\ninformation is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change\nin the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in\nthe process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each\nblock the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the\ntransition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of\nrepetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions\nis increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through\nnumerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations\nusing an effective random-matrix theory model.",

To push DARE's limits, we introduce DAREx (DARE the\neXtreme), which features two algorithmic improvements: (1) DAREx-q, a rescaling\nfactor modification that significantly boosts performance at high pruning rates\n(e.g., >30 % on COLA and SST2 for encoder models, with even greater gains in\ndecoder models), and (2) DAREx-L2, which combines DARE with AdamR, an\nin-training method that applies appropriate delta regularization before DPP. We\nalso demonstrate that DAREx-q can be seamlessly combined with vanilla\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA and can facilitate\nstructural DPP. Additionally, we revisit the application of importance-based\npruning techniques within DPP, demonstrating that they outperform random-based\nmethods when delta parameters are large. Through this comprehensive study, we\ndevelop a pipeline for selecting the most appropriate DPP method under various\npractical scenarios.",

The well-recognized problem of the global existence of smooth solutions for\nthe 2D inviscid Oldroyd-B model without smallness assumptions is open due to\nthe complex structure of Q. Therefore improving the smallness assumptions,\nespecially in lower regularity class, is the core question in the area of fluid\nmodels. On the other hand, long-time behaviors of solutions including temporal\ndecay and uniform-in-time damping stability are also of deep significance.\nThese problems have been widely studied, however, the existing results are not\nregularity critical and the (uniform) vanishing damping limit has not been\ndiscussed. The goal of this work is to dig deeper in this direction.\n  In this work we first establish the local well-posedness in the sense of\nHadamard with critical regularity. Then, by virtue of the sharp commutator\nestimate for Calderon-Zygmund operator, we establish the global existence of\nsolutions for d=2 with damping in the low regularity class, which to our best\nknowledge, is novel in the literature. Furthermore, in both 2D and 3D cases, we\nprove the global existence of the solutions to the inviscid Oldroyd-B model\nindependent of the damping parameters. In addition, we obtain the optimal\ntemporal decay rates and time integrability by improving the existing Fourier\nsplitting method and developing a novel decomposition strategy. One of the\nmajor contributions of the presenting paper is to prove the uniform-in-time\nvanishing damping limit for the inviscid Oldroyd-B model and discover the\ncorrelation between sharp vanishing damping rate and the temporal decay rate.\nFinally, we will support our findings by providing numerical evidence regarding\nthe vanishing damping limit in the periodic domain T^d.",

A long line of work established that\nuniformity testing has sample complexity $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}\\varepsilon^{-2})$.\nHowever, when the input distribution is neither uniform nor far from uniform,\nknown algorithms may have highly non-replicable behavior.

Unfortunately, these forces may be too time-consuming to evaluate by\nconventional finite element modeling within an optimization loop. Although\nmutual forces can be computed rapidly by approximating large-bore coils as\ninfinitely thin, this approximation does not hold for self-forces as it leads\nto an unphysical divergence. Recently, a novel reduced model for the\nself-field, self-force, and self-inductance of electromagnetic coils based on\nfilamentary models was rigorously derived and demonstrated to be highly\naccurate and numerically efficient to evaluate. In this paper, we present an\nimplementation of the reduced self-force model employing automatic\ndifferentiation within the SIMSOPT stellarator design software and use it in\nderivative-based coil optimization for a quasi-axisymmetric stellarator. We\nshow that it is possible to significantly reduce point-wise forces throughout\nthe coils, though this comes with trade-offs to fast particle losses and the\nminimum distance between coils and the plasma surface. The trade-off between\nmagnetic forces and coil-surface distance is mediated by the minimum coil-coil\ndistance for coils near the inboard side of the \"bean\" cross-section of the\nplasma. The relationship between forces and fast particle losses is mediated by\nthe normal field error. Coil forces can be lowered to a threshold with minimal\ndeterioration to losses.

The effects of laser-induced heating manifest\nas the decrease in the peak height, redshift, and broadening of the ZPLs in the\nPL spectrum. The local temperature in the sample can be determined from the\ncenter energy of the ZPLs by using the Varshni equation.

Ad hoc collection efforts lead to a data\nrecord that is sparse, unreliable, and non-interoperable.\n  This paper presents a sociotechnical methodology to collect, manage, serve,\nand maintain pedestrian path data at a statewide scale. Combining the\nautomation afforded by computer-vision approaches applied to aerial imagery and\nexisting road network data with the quality control afforded by interactive\ntools, we aim to produce routable pedestrian pathways for the entire State of\nWashington within approximately two years. We extract paths, crossings, and\ncurb ramps at scale from aerial imagery, integrating multi-input segmentation\nmethods with road topology data to ensure connected, routable networks. We then\norganize the predictions into project regions selected for their value to the\npublic interest, where each project region is divided into intersection-scale\ntasks. These tasks are assigned and tracked through an interactive tool that\nmanages concurrency, progress, feedback, and data management.\n  We demonstrate that our automated systems outperform state-of-the-art methods\nin producing routable pathway networks, which then significantly reduces the\ntime required for human vetting.

We identify wind intervals from different\nsource regions: coronal hole (CH) interiors, streamers, and low Mach number\nboundary layers (LMBLs), i.e. the inner boundaries of coronal holes. We present\ntheir statistical trends in the acceleration process. Most of the observations\ncan be reproduced by a two-fluid hydrodynamic model with realistic corona\ntemperatures. In such a model, the solar wind is accelerated by the combined\nthermal pressures of protons and electrons,but it is mainly the difference in\nthe proton pressure that leads to the difference in the solar wind speed. The\nproton pressure is the highest in the fastest CH wind, with a high initial\nproton temperature that decreases slowly. It is lower in the relatively slow\nLMBL wind, and the lowest in the slowest streamer wind. The proton temperature\nis quadratically correlated with the wind speed when scaled to the same\ndistance. In contrast, the electron temperature shows no significant\ndifferences for different wind types or wind speeds, indicating more similar\ncontributions from the electron pressure. The model gives reasonable locations\nfor the sonic critical point, which is on average at 3.6-7.3 solar radii and\ncan also extend to large distances when the proton temperature is extremely\nlow, as in the LMBL wind.

    "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of Software Engineering, the paradigm of software\necosystems has emerged, giving rise to proprietary software ecosystems (PSECO),\nwith their central organizations known as keystones. PSECO is characterized by\nthe contribution of various technologies produced as private and protected by\nintellectual property and confidentiality agreements, centered on common\ntechnological platforms. Sustaining these PSECO technological platforms is\nvital, as any incident can have substantial repercussions. This work introduces\na framework for incident management to support the organizations' management\nteams in the PSECO context, called IM Framework. The IM Framework was developed\nin close collaboration with practitioners across a large international\norganization. We grounded the IM Framework based on the results of a rapid\nreview study that retrieved 293 studies, of which 23 were selected after\napplying review procedures. This framework comprises five core categories:\norganizational goals, practices, success factors, associated benefits, and\nprevalent barriers. The IM Framework offers practical guidance for the PSECO\nmanagement team, focusing on real-world applications to enhance reliability and\nresilience in a complex and dynamic software environment. Our study also\npromises to fill the gap in incident management governance by supporting the\nPSECO organization's management team and maintaining robust technological\nplatforms amidst evolving business demands and market pressures.",

    "abstract": "Automatic essay grading (AEG) has attracted the the attention of the NLP\ncommunity because of its applications to several educational applications, such\nas scoring essays, short answers, etc. AEG systems can save significant time\nand money when grading essays. In the existing works, the essays are graded\nwhere a single network is responsible for the whole process, which may be\nineffective because a single network may not be able to learn all the features\nof a human-written essay. In this work, we have introduced a new model that\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models in the field of AEG. We have used the\nconcept of collaborative and transfer learning, where one network will be\nresponsible for checking the grammatical and structural features of the\nsentences of an essay while another network is responsible for scoring the\noverall idea present in the essay. These learnings are transferred to another\nnetwork to score the essay. We also compared the performances of the different\nmodels mentioned in our work, and our proposed model has shown the highest\naccuracy of 85.50%.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based\nTime-to-Digital Converter (TDC) design suitable for high timing resolution\napplications, utilizing two new techniques. First, a cross-detection (CD)\nmethod is introduced that minimizes the occurrence of bubbles, which cause\ninaccuracy in the timing measurement of a TDC in thermometer codes, by altering\nthe conventional sampling pattern, thereby yielding an average bin size half of\nits typical size. The second technique employs dual-side monitoring (DSM) of\nthermometer codes, including end-of-propagation (EOP) and start-of-propagation\n(SOP). Distinct from conventional TDCs, which focus solely on SOP thermometer\ncodes, this technique utilizes EOP to calibrate SOP, simultaneously enhancing\ntime resolution and the TDC's stability against changes in temperature and\nlocation. The proposed DSM scheme necessitates only an additional CARRY4 for\ncapturing the EOP thermometer code, rendering it a resource-efficient solution.\nThe CD-DSM TDC has been successfully implemented on a Virtex-7 Xilinx FPGA (a\n28-nm process), with an average bin size of 6.1 ps and a root mean square of\n3.8 ps. Compared to conventional TDCs, the CD-DSM TDC offers superior\nlinearity. The successful measurement of ultra-high coincidence timing\nresolution (CTR) from two Cerenkov radiator integrated microchannel plate\nphotomultiplier tubes (CRI-MCP-PMTs) was conducted with the CD-DSM TDCs for\nsub-100 ps timing measurements. A comparison with current-edge TDCs further\nhighlights the superior performance of the CD-DSM TDCs.",

The developed digitizer independently processes\nthese two types of photons for precise energy and timing measurements. The\ndigitizer incorporates a noise-resistant binary counter that measures energy\nsignals using a time-over-threshold (TOT) method. For timing measurement, we\nemploy an embedded dual-side monitoring time-to-digital converter (TDC), which\nefficiently captures timing information while maintaining low resource usage.\nWe validated the efficacy of our FPGA-based TOF digitizer through extensive\nexperiments, including both an electrical setup and a coincidence test using\nBGO pixels. Our evaluations of TOT energy and timing performance utilized two\n$3 \\times 3 \\times 20 \\ \\text{mm}^3$ BGO pixels coupled to CHK-HD MT silicon\nphotomultipliers (SiPMs). The digitizer achieved a coincidence timing\nresolution (CTR) of 407 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) for coincidence\nevents falling within the full width at tenth maximum (FWTM) of the measured\nTOT energy spectrum. Notably, when measured with an oscilloscope, the same\ndetector pair exhibited a CTR of 403 ps FWHM, confirming that the performance\nof the developed digitizer is comparable to that of oscilloscopes.
