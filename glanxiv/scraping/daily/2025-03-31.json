    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the application of Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS)\nin Quantum Wireless Sensor Networks (QWSNs) to enhance communication\nperformance. QWSNs combine quantum communication principles with traditional\nwireless sensor network technologies, offering the potential for improved\nsecurity, energy efficiency, and signal quality. TRS, a concept from signal\nprocessing and quantum mechanics, focuses transmitted signals back toward the\nreceiver, compensating for noise, interference, and fading effects. By applying\nTRS to QWSNs, we aim to optimize throughput, reduce latency, and enhance energy\nefficiency in challenging communication environments. The paper presents a\ntheoretical framework for integrating TRS into QWSNs, including mathematical\nformulations for its impact on key network performance metrics. We also\nconsider real-world channel models, such as Rayleigh and Rician fading, along\nwith network interference, to demonstrate how TRS can improve communication in\npractical settings. The discussion extends to the broader potential of TRS in\nquantum communication systems, particularly in **Quantum Key Distribution\n(QKD)**, **quantum entanglement**, and **quantum networking** applications. The\nfindings highlight TRS as a promising approach to optimize quantum\ncommunication in sensor networks and provide a foundation for future research\nin the intersection of quantum technologies and wireless networks.",

Third,\ngiant planets, in contrast, form more frequently around stars with\nhigher-mass/metallicity. Lastly, we extend a subset of simulations to $1$ Gyr\nto investigate the long-term evolution of the systems' architecture.

The phenomenon is poorly understood and has received renewed\nattention as a potential risk to a planned future space mission to image\npotentially habitable exoplanets and characterize their atmospheres (exo-Earth\nimaging) such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). In this article, we\nreview the current understanding of hot exozodiacal dust and its implications\nfor HWO. We argue that the observational evidence suggests that the phenomenon\nis most likely real and indeed caused by hot dust, although conclusive proof in\nparticular of the latter statement is still missing. Furthermore, we find that\nthere exists as of yet no single model that is able to successfully explain the\npresence of the dust. We find that it is plausible and not unlikely that large\namounts of hot exozodiacal dust in a system will critically limit the\nsensitivity of exo-Earth imaging observations around that star. It is thus\ncrucial to better understood the phenomenon in order to be able to evaluate the\nactual impact on such a mission, and current and near-future observational\nopportunities for acquiring the required data exist. At the same time, hot\nexozodiacal dust (and warm exozodiacal dust closer to a system's habitable\nzone) has the potential to provide important context for HWO observations of\nrocky, HZ planets, constraining the environment in which these planets exist\nand hence to determine why a detected planet may be capable to sustain life or\nnot.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a physics-informed training framework for\nprojection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs). We extend the PROM-ANN\narchitecture by complementing snapshot-based training with a FEM-based,\ndiscrete physics-informed residual loss, bridging the gap between traditional\nprojection-based ROMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Unlike\nconventional PINNs that rely on analytical PDEs, our approach leverages FEM\nresiduals to guide the learning of the ROM approximation manifold. Key\ncontributions include: (1) a parameter-agnostic, discrete residual loss\napplicable to non-linear problems, (2) an architectural modification to\nPROM-ANN improving accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and (3) an\nempirical study on the proposed physics informed training process for ROMs.\n  The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem,\nsimulating a rubber cantilever under multi-axial loads. The main accomplishment\nin regards to the proposed residual-based loss is its applicability on\nnon-linear problems by interfacing with FEM software while maintaining\nreasonable training times. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD by orders of\nmagnitude in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the original formulation\nis not able to learn a proper mapping for this use-case. Finally, the\napplication of physics informed training in ANN-PROM modestly narrows the gap\nbetween data reconstruction and ROM accuracy, however it highlights the\nuntapped potential of the proposed residual-driven optimization for future ROM\ndevelopment.

Although lengthening generated scratchpads has proven\neffective for mathematical tasks, the broader impact of this approach on other\ntasks remains less clear. In this work, we investigate the benefits and\nlimitations of scaling methods across nine state-of-the-art models and eight\nchallenging tasks, including math and STEM reasoning, calendar planning,\nNP-hard problems, navigation, and spatial reasoning. We compare conventional\nmodels (e.g., GPT-4o) with models fine-tuned for inference-time scaling (e.g.,\no1) through evaluation protocols that involve repeated model calls, either\nindependently or sequentially with feedback. These evaluations approximate\nlower and upper performance bounds and potential for future performance\nimprovements for each model, whether through enhanced training or multi-model\ninference systems. Our extensive empirical analysis reveals that the advantages\nof inference-time scaling vary across tasks and diminish as problem complexity\nincreases. In addition, simply using more tokens does not necessarily translate\nto higher accuracy in these challenging regimes. Results from multiple\nindependent runs with conventional models using perfect verifiers show that,\nfor some tasks, these models can achieve performance close to the average\nperformance of today's most advanced reasoning models. However, for other\ntasks, a significant performance gap remains, even in very high scaling\nregimes.

    "abstract": "Design requirements for moving parts in mechanical assemblies are typically\nspecified in terms of interactions with other parts. Some are purely kinematic\n(e.g., pairwise collision avoidance) while others depend on physics and\nmaterial properties (e.g., deformation under loads). Kinematic design methods\nand physics-based shape/topology optimization (SO/TO) deal separately with\nthese requirements. They rarely talk to each other as the former uses set\nalgebra and group theory while the latter requires discretizing and solving\ndifferential equations. Hence, optimizing a moving part based on physics\ntypically relies on either neglecting or pruning kinematic constraints in\nadvance, e.g., by restricting the design domain to a collision-free space using\nan unsweep operation. In this paper, we show that TO can be used to co-design\ntwo or more parts in relative motion to simultaneously satisfy physics-based\ncriteria and collision avoidance. We restrict our attention to maximizing\nlinear-elastic stiffness while penalizing collision measures aggregated in\ntime. We couple the TO loops for two parts in relative motion so that the\nevolution of each part's shape is accounted for when penalizing collision for\nthe other part. The collision measures are computed by a correlation functional\nthat can be discretized by left- and right-multiplying the shape design\nvariables by a pre-computed matrix that depends solely on the motion. This\ndecoupling is key to making the computations scalable for TO iterations. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with 2D and 3D examples.",

    "abstract": "Measurement based quantum computing is preformed by adding non-Clifford\nmeasurements to a prepared stabilizer states. Entangling gates like CZ are\nlikely to have lower fidelities due to the nature of interacting qubits, so\nwhen preparing a stabilizer state, we wish to minimize the number of required\nentangling states. This naturally introduces the notion of CZ-distance.\n  Every stabilizer state is local-Clifford equivalent to a graph state, so we\nmay focus on graph states $\\left\\vert G \\right\\rangle$. As a lower bound for\ngeneral graphs, there exist $n$-vertex graphs $G$ such that the CZ-distance of\n$\\left\\vert G \\right\\rangle$ is $\\Omega(n^2 / \\log n)$. We obtain significantly\nimproved bounds when $G$ is contained within certain proper classes of graphs.\nFor instance, we prove that if $G$ is a $n$-vertex circle graph with clique\nnumber $\\omega$, then $\\left\\vert G \\right\\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $4n\n\\log \\omega + 7n$. We prove that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph of rank-width at\nmost $k$, then $\\left\\vert G \\right\\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most\n$(2^{2^{k+1}} + 1) n$. More generally, this is obtained via a bound of $(k+2)n$\nthat we prove for graphs of twin-width at most $k$.\n  We also study how bounded-rank perturbations and low-rank cuts affect the\nCZ-distance. As a consequence, we prove that Geelen's Weak Structural\nConjecture for vertex-minors implies that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph\ncontained in some fixed proper vertex-minor-closed class of graphs, then\n$\\left\\vert G \\right\\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $O(n\\log n)$.

Experimental results on a real\nhigh-frequency dataset containing order book depth, spread, and trading volume\nshow that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional machine\nlearning (such as decision trees and random forests) and deep learning methods\n(such as MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM) in terms of accuracy (0.93), F1-Score (0.91), and\nAUC-ROC (0.95). Ablation experiments verify the contribution of each component,\nand the visualization of order book depth and anomaly detection further reveals\nthe effectiveness of the model under complex market dynamics. Despite the false\npositive problem, the model still provides important support for market\nsupervision.

    "abstract": "The biopharmaceutical industry is increasingly developing digital twins to\ndigitalize and automate the manufacturing process in response to the growing\nmarket demands. However, this shift presents significant challenges for human\noperators, as the complexity and volume of information can overwhelm their\nability to manage the process effectively. These issues are compounded when\ndigital twins are designed without considering interaction and collaboration\nwith operators, who are responsible for monitoring processes and assessing\nsituations, particularly during abnormalities. Our review of current trends in\nbiopharma digital twin development reveals a predominant focus on technology\nand often overlooks the critical role of human operators. To bridge this gap,\nthis article proposes a collaborative intelligence framework that emphasizes\nthe integration of operators with digital twins. Approaches to system design\nthat can enhance operator trust and human-machine interface usability are\npresented. Moreover, innovative training programs for preparing operators to\nunderstand and utilize digital twins are discussed. The framework outlined in\nthis article aims to enhance collaboration between operators and digital twins\neffectively by using their full capabilities to boost resilience and\nproductivity in biopharmaceutical manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective at deceiving, when prompted to do\nso. But under what conditions do they deceive spontaneously? Models that\ndemonstrate better performance on reasoning tasks are also better at prompted\ndeception. Do they also increasingly deceive spontaneously in situations where\nit could be considered rational to do so? This study evaluates spontaneous\ndeception produced by LLMs in a preregistered experimental protocol using tools\nfrom signaling theory. A range of proprietary closed-source and open-source\nLLMs are evaluated using modified 2x2 games (in the style of Prisoner's\nDilemma) augmented with a phase in which they can freely communicate to the\nother agent using unconstrained language. This setup creates an opportunity to\ndeceive, in conditions that vary in how useful deception might be to an agent's\nrational self-interest. The results indicate that 1) all tested LLMs\nspontaneously misrepresent their actions in at least some conditions, 2) they\nare generally more likely to do so in situations in which deception would\nbenefit them, and 3) models exhibiting better reasoning capacity overall tend\nto deceive at higher rates. Taken together, these results suggest a tradeoff\nbetween LLM reasoning capability and honesty. They also provide evidence of\nreasoning-like behavior in LLMs from a novel experimental configuration.\nFinally, they reveal certain contextual factors that affect whether LLMs will\ndeceive or not.

One of the most important control parameters to\noptimise for is the evolution time (pulse duration). However, most existing\nworks focus on finding the shortest evolution time theoretically possible\nwithout offering explicit pulse constructions under practical constraints like\nnoise in the system. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing an\nefficient method to perform the Chopped Random Basis (CRAB) optimisation in the\npresence of noise, specifically when the noise commutes with the gate\nHamiltonian. This noise-aware approach allows for direct optimisation of the\nevolution time alongside other control parameters, significantly reducing the\ncomputational cost compared to full noisy simulations. The protocol is\ndemonstrated through numerical simulations on state-to-state transfer and gate\ncompilation problems under several noise models. Results show that the\noptimised fidelity has a strong dependence on evolution time due to noise,\ndrift Hamiltonian, and local traps in optimisation, highlighting the necessity\nof optimising evolution time in practical settings that can lead to a\nsubstantial gain in the fidelity. Our pulse optimisation protocol can\nconsistently reach the global optimal time and fidelity in all of our examples.\nWe hope that our protocol can be the start of many more works on the crucial\ntopic of control pulse time optimisation in practical settings.",

Herein, we identify the\nrequirements for successful epitaxy of Zn3P2 nanowires using metalorganic\nchemical vapour deposition and the impact on interface structure and defect\nformation. Furthermore, using high-throughput optical spectroscopy we were able\nto demonstrate shifts in the photoluminescence intensity and energy by tuning\nthe V/II ratio during growth, highlighting the compositional tunability of the\noptoelectronic properties of Zn3P2 nanowires.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of industrial automation has highlighted the need for\nprecise and efficient defect detection in large-scale machinery. Traditional\ninspection techniques, involving manual procedures such as scaling tall\nstructures for visual evaluation, are labor-intensive, subjective, and often\nhazardous. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces an automated\ndefect detection framework built on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and the\nconcept of digital twins. The system utilizes UAVs to capture images and\nreconstruct 3D models of machinery, producing both a standard reference model\nand a current-state model for comparison. Alignment of the models is achieved\nthrough the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, enabling precise point\ncloud analysis to detect deviations that signify potential defects. By\neliminating manual inspection, this method improves accuracy, enhances\noperational safety, and offers a scalable solution for defect detection. The\nproposed approach demonstrates great promise for reliable and efficient\nindustrial applications.",

We provide a\nuniversality result for the moderate deviations of the transition probability\nof this model over a wide class of choices of random environments.

Finally, we train a supervised denoising network\nusing noisy images paired with the denoised outputs generated by the diffusion\nmodel. Our results demonstrate that DiffDenoise outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods in both synthetic and real-world medical image\ndenoising tasks.

In this paper, we report on\na project to build an implementation of GOL within GOL, via logic circuits,\nfully formally verified within the HOL4 theorem prover. This required a\ncombination of interactive tactic proving, symbolic simulation, and\nsemi-automated forward proof to assemble the components into an infinite\ncircuit which can calculate the next step of the simulation while respecting\nsignal propagation delays. The result is a verified \"GOL in GOL compiler\" which\ntakes an initial GOL state and returns a mega-cell version of it that can be\npassed to off-the-shelf GOL simulators, such as Golly.

Recently, the notion of a quantum acceleration limit has been\nproposed for any unitary time evolution of quantum systems governed by\narbitrary nonstationary Hamiltonians. This limit articulates that the rate of\nchange over time of the standard deviation of the Hamiltonian\noperator-representing the acceleration of quantum evolution within projective\nHilbert space-is constrained by the standard deviation of the time-derivative\nof the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we extend our earlier findings to encompass\nany observable A within the framework of unitary quantum dynamics. This\nrelationship signifies that the speed of the standard deviation of any\nobservable is limited by the standard deviation of its associated velocity-like\nobservable. Finally, for pedagogical purposes, we illustrate the relevance of\nour inequality by providing clear examples. We choose suitable observables\nrelated to the unitary dynamics of two-level quantum systems, as well as a\nharmonic oscillator within a finite-dimensional Fock space.",

In this paper we conjecture an analogous \"extremal\nmonomial property\" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules\nover the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters\ndefined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest\nmonomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove\nit for simple reflections.

We show that\nthese X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators\nfor all w in W.

By including both of them in the Hamiltonian, we prove that an\nincrease of the Ohmic dissipation strength induces a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition in thermodynamic\nequilibrium. Then we study charge and phase fluctuations at the thermodynamic\nequilibrium within the linear response theory. We find that the phase particle\nmotion, in a quantum Josephson junction, does not change from diffusive to\nlocalized, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition, as is commonly\nbelieved. At the transition, we prove that: i) the motion of the phase particle\nchanges from ballistic to localized; ii) by turning on the coupling with the\nenvironment, a long-lived excitation at finite frequency emerges in the charge\nresponse function: it evolves first into a resonance and then disappears at the\ntransition.

The task requires two key\ncompetencies: (1) algorithm comprehension: synthesizing information from papers\nand academic literature to understand implementation logic, and (2) coding\nexpertise: identifying dependencies and correctly implementing necessary APIs.\nTo facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce SciReplicate-Bench, a benchmark\nof 100 tasks from 36 NLP papers published in 2024, featuring detailed\nannotations and comprehensive test cases. Building on SciReplicate-Bench, we\npropose Sci-Reproducer, a dual-agent framework consisting of a Paper Agent that\ninterprets algorithmic concepts from literature and a Code Agent that retrieves\ndependencies from repositories and implements solutions. To assess algorithm\nunderstanding, we introduce reasoning graph accuracy, which quantifies\nsimilarity between generated and reference reasoning graphs derived from code\ncomments and structure. For evaluating implementation quality, we employ\nexecution accuracy, CodeBLEU, and repository dependency/API recall metrics. In\nour experiments, we evaluate various powerful non-reasoning and reasoning LLMs\nas foundational models. The best-performing LLM using \\ModelName~achieves only\n39% execution accuracy, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty. Our analysis\nidentifies missing or inconsistent algorithm descriptions as key barriers to\nsuccessful reproduction.

In this work, we propose\nElaLoRA, an adaptive low-rank adaptation framework that dynamically prunes and\nexpands ranks based on gradient-derived importance scores. To the best of our\nknowledge, ElaLoRA is the first method that enables both rank pruning and\nexpansion during fine-tuning. Experiments across multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrate that ElaLoRA consistently outperforms existing PEFT methods across\ndifferent parameter budgets. Furthermore, our studies validate that layers\nreceiving higher rank allocations contribute more significantly to model\nperformance, providing theoretical justification for our adaptive strategy. By\nintroducing a principled and adaptive rank allocation mechanism, ElaLoRA offers\na scalable and efficient fine-tuning solution, particularly suited for\nresource-constrained environments.",

As a\nresult, many scientific studies rely on suboptimal, precomputed atlases from\nmismatched populations, negatively impacting downstream analyses. MultiMorph\naddresses these challenges with a feedforward model that rapidly produces\nhigh-quality, population-specific atlases in a single forward pass for any 3D\nbrain dataset, without any fine-tuning or optimization. MultiMorph is based on\na linear group-interaction layer that aggregates and shares features within the\ngroup of input images.

Experimentally, MultiMorph outperforms state-of-the-art\noptimization-based and learning-based atlas construction methods in both small\nand large population settings, with a 100-fold reduction in time.

    "abstract": "SBND is a 112 ton liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino\ndetector located 110 meters from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) target at\nFermilab. Its main goals include searches for eV-scale sterile neutrinos as\npart of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program, other searches for physics\nbeyond the Standard Model, and precision studies of neutrino-argon\ninteractions. In addition, SBND is providing a platform for LArTPC neutrino\ndetector technology development and is an excellent training ground for the\ninternational group of scientists and engineers working towards the upcoming\nflagship Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). SBND began operation in\nJuly 2024, and started collecting stable neutrino beam data in December 2024\nwith an unprecedented rate of ~7,000 neutrino events per day. During its\ncurrently approved operation plans (2024-2027), SBND is expected to accumulate\nnearly 10 million neutrino interactions. The near detector dataset will be\ninstrumental in testing the sterile neutrino hypothesis with unprecedented\nsensitivity in SBN and in probing signals of beyond the Standard Model physics.\nIt will also be used to significantly advance our understanding of the physics\nof neutrino-argon interactions ahead of DUNE. After the planned accelerator\nrestart at Fermilab (2029+), opportunities are being explored to operate SBND\nin antineutrino mode in order to address the scarcity of antineutrino-argon\nscattering data, or in a dedicated beam-dump mode to significantly enhance\nsensitivity to searches for new physics. SBND is an international effort, with\napproximately 40% of institutions from Europe, contributing to detector\nconstruction, commissioning, software development, and data analysis. Continued\nEuropean involvement and leadership are essential during SBND's operations and\nanalysis phase for both the success of SBND, SBN and its role leading up to\nDUNE.",

We consider the challenging case of system identification under\nadversarial attacks, where the probability of having an attack at each time is\n$\\Theta(1/k)$ while the value of the attack is arbitrary. We first show that\nthe $\\ell_1$-norm estimator exactly identifies the true Markov parameter matrix\nfor nilpotent systems under any type of attack. We then build on this result to\nextend it to general systems and show that the estimation error exponentially\ndecays as $k$ grows. The estimated balanced truncation model accordingly shows\nan exponentially decaying error for the identification of the true system up to\na similarity transformation. This work is the first to provide the input-output\nanalysis of the system with partial observations under arbitrary attacks.",

Its estimation can be a particularly difficult\ntask when follow-up is not sufficient, that is when the censoring mechanism has\na smaller support than the distribution of the target data. In the latter case,\nnon-parametric estimators were recently proposed using extreme value\nmethodology, assuming that the distribution of the susceptible population is in\nthe Fr\\'echet or Gumbel max-domains of attraction. In this paper, we take the\nextreme value techniques one step further, to jointly estimate the cure rate\nand the extreme value index, using probability plotting methodology, and in\nparticular using the full information contained in the top order statistics. In\nother words, under sufficient or insufficient follow-up, we reconstruct the\nimmune proportion. To this end, a Peaks-over-Threshold approach is proposed\nunder the Gumbel max-domain assumption. Next, the approach is also transferred\nto more specific models such as Pareto, log-normal and Weibull tail models,\nallowing to recognize the most important tail characteristics of the\nsusceptible population. We establish the asymptotic behavior of our estimators\nunder regularization. Though simulation studies, our estimators are show to\nrival and often outperform established models, even when purely considering\ncure rate estimation.

    "abstract": "Reproducing realistic collective behaviors presents a captivating yet\nformidable challenge. Traditional rule-based methods rely on hand-crafted\nprinciples, limiting motion diversity and realism in generated collective\nbehaviors. Recent imitation learning methods learn from data but often require\nground truth motion trajectories and struggle with authenticity, especially in\nhigh-density groups with erratic movements. In this paper, we present a\nscalable approach, Collective Behavior Imitation Learning (CBIL), for learning\nfish schooling behavior directly from videos, without relying on captured\nmotion trajectories. Our method first leverages Video Representation Learning,\nwhere a Masked Video AutoEncoder (MVAE) extracts implicit states from video\ninputs in a self-supervised manner. The MVAE effectively maps 2D observations\nto implicit states that are compact and expressive for following the imitation\nlearning stage. Then, we propose a novel adversarial imitation learning method\nto effectively capture complex movements of the schools of fish, allowing for\nefficient imitation of the distribution for motion patterns measured in the\nlatent space. It also incorporates bio-inspired rewards alongside priors to\nregularize and stabilize training. Once trained, CBIL can be used for various\nanimation tasks with the learned collective motion priors. We further show its\neffectiveness across different species. Finally, we demonstrate the application\nof our system in detecting abnormal fish behavior from in-the-wild videos.",

    "abstract": "In the Edge Inference (EI) paradigm, where a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is\nsplit across the transceivers to wirelessly communicate goal-defined features\nin solving a computational task, the wireless medium has been commonly treated\nas a source of noise. In this paper, motivated by the emerging technologies of\nReconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces\n(SIM) that offer programmable propagation of wireless signals, either through\ncontrollable reflections or diffractions, we optimize the RIS/SIM-enabled smart\nwireless environment as a means of over-the-air computing, resembling the\noperations of DNN layers. We propose a framework of Metasurfaces-Integrated\nNeural Networks (MINNs) for EI, presenting its modeling, training through a\nbackpropagation variation for fading channels, and deployment aspects. The\noverall end-to-end DNN architecture is general enough to admit RIS and SIM\ndevices, through controllable reconfiguration before each transmission or fixed\nconfigurations after training, while both channel-aware and channel-agnostic\ntransceivers are considered. Our numerical evaluation showcases metasurfaces to\nbe instrumental in performing image classification under link budgets that\nimpede conventional communications or metasurface-free systems. It is\ndemonstrated that our MINN framework can significantly simplify EI\nrequirements, achieving near-optimal performance with $50~$dB lower testing\nsignal-to-noise ratio compared to training, even without transceiver channel\nknowledge.",

Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has emerged as a promising\naltermagnetic candidate due to its compensated antiparallel magnetic order and\nstrong spin-split electronic bands. However, recent experimental and\ntheoretical reports also suggest that RuO2 may be non-magnetic in its ground\nstate, underscoring the need for deeper investigations into its magnetic\ncharacter. Specifically, the (100)-oriented RuO2 films are expected to generate\nspin currents with transverse spin polarization parallel to the N\\'eel vector.\nHere, we investigate magnetotransport in epitaxial RuO2/Permalloy (Py)\nheterostructures to examine spin Hall magnetoresistance and interfacial effects\ngenerated in such systems. Our measurements reveal a pronounced negative\nangular-dependent magnetoresistance for variation of magnetic field direction\nperpendicular to the charge current direction. Detailed temperature-, magnetic\nfield-, and crystallographic orientation-dependent measurements indicate that\ninterface-generated spin current (IGSC) at the RuO2/Py interface predominantly\ngoverns the observed magnetoresistance. This shows that strong interface\neffects dominate over possible altermagnetic contributions from RuO2. Our\nresults show that the role of interface-generated spin currents is crucial and\nshould not be overlooked in studies of altermagnetic systems. A critical step\nin this direction is disentangling interfacial from altermagnetic\ncontributions. The insight into interfacial contributions from altermagnetic\ninfluences is essential for the advancement of RuO2 based spintronic memory and\nsensing applications.",

This outer stable layer (OSL) delays particle exchange and\naccelerates the cooling of the deep interior. Consequently, the He-depletion at\nthe Mbar-level where H/He phase separation occurs would be stronger than seen\nin the atmosphere. We find that the inverted He-gradient across the OSL leads\nto atmospheric heavy element abundances that are up to dZatm=0.03 (+2x solar)\nhigher than for adiabatic models. With an additional inverted Z-gradient, Zatm\nup to 3x solar is possible. Models with 1x solar Zatm have a dilute core\nconfined to the inner 0.2-0.3 MJ (0.4-0.5 RJ), smaller than in adiabatic\nmodels. Models with 3x solar Zatm have a largely homogeneous-Z interior at 1x\nsolar. The low observed atmospheric Ne/He ratio suggests that Ne is transported\nthrough the OSL as efficiently as He is and at an enhanced diffusivity as is\ncharacteristic of double diffusive convection.

Secondly, based on the extracted robust spatial structure prior, we\ndevelop the lighting-agnostic structure rendering strategy, which facilitates\nthe optimization of the scene structure and object appearance. Moreover, a\nprogressive denoising module is introduced to effectively mitigate the noise\nwithin the light-invariant representation.

The current study aims at improved understanding of solute\naccumulation near evaporating surfaces. Analytical and numerical modelling\nstudies have suggested the development of local instabilities due to density\ndifferences during evaporation in case of saturated porous media with high\npermeability. These instabilities lead to density-driven downward flow through\nfingering, and thus a redistribution of solutes. To experimentally investigate\nthis, we performed evaporation experiments on two types of porous media (F36\nand W3) with intrinsic permeabilities that differed by two orders of magnitude.\nUsing magnetic resonance imaging (23Na-MRI), we monitored the development of\nsolute accumulation and subsequent redistribution during evaporation with a\ncontinuous supply of water at the bottom of the samples. Significant\ndifferences between the Na enrichment patterns were observed for the two porous\nmedia. The F36 sample showed an initial enrichment at the surface within the\nfirst hour, but soon after a downwards moving plume developed that\nredistributed NaCl back into the column. Average depth profiles of Na\nconcentrations showed that the surface concentration reached only 2.5 M, well\nbelow the solubility limit. In contrast, the W3 sample with lower permeability\nshowed enrichment in a shallow near-surface zone where a concentration of over\n6 M was reached. Comparison of experimental results with numerical simulations\nusing DuMux showed qualitative agreement between measured and modelled solute\nconcentrations. This study experimentally confirms the importance of\ndensity-driven redistribution of solutes in case of saturated porous media,\nwhich has implications for predicting evaporation rates and the time to the\nstart of salt crust formation.",

The\nproposed wind turbine has an expected electricity generation of 2MW. We studied\nthe wind atlas of Oman and from which we determined the maximum possible mean\nwind speed in the entire Sultanate and built our design based on that reference\nvalue, which is 6m/s (21.6km/h).

To address this, we introduce SmartScan, an AI framework\nthat automates data extraction for optimal sensor placement. SmartScan\nidentifies subspaces of interest from satellite images using an interactive\ntool to create facility-specific constraint sets efficiently. SmartScan\nleverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a prompt-based transformer for\nzero-shot segmentation, enabling subspace extraction without explicit training.\nIt operates in two modes: (1) Data Curation Mode, where satellite images are\nprocessed to extract high-quality subspaces using an interactive prompting\nsystem for SAM, and (2) Autonomous Mode, where user-curated prompts train a\ndeep learning network to replace manual prompting, fully automating subspace\nextraction. The interactive tool also serves for quality control, allowing\nusers to refine AI-generated outputs and generate additional constraint sets as\nneeded. With its AI-driven prompting mechanism, SmartScan delivers\nhigh-throughput, high-quality subspace extraction with minimal human\nintervention, enhancing scalability and efficiency.

This paper proposes an\nadvanced AI-driven technique to detecting glioma, meningioma, and pituitary\nbrain tumors using YoloV11 and YoloV8 deep learning models.\n  Methods: Using a transfer learning-based fine-tuning approach, we integrate\ncutting-edge deep learning techniques with medical imaging to classify brain\ntumors into four categories: No-Tumor, Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary\nTumors.\n  Results: The study utilizes the publicly accessible CE-MRI Figshare dataset\nand involves fine-tuning pre-trained models YoloV8 and YoloV11 of 99.49% and\n99.56% accuracies; and customized CNN accuracy of 96.98%. The results validate\nthe potential of CNNs in achieving high precision in brain tumor detection and\nclassification, highlighting their transformative role in medical imaging and\ndiagnostics.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the effects of various forms of noise on one-dimensional systems\nof non-interacting fermions. In the strong noise limit, we demonstrate, under\nmild assumptions, that the statistics of the fermionic correlation matrix in\nthe thermodynamic limit follow a universal form described by the recently\nintroduced quantum simple symmetric exclusion process (Q-SSEP). For charge\ntransport, we show that Q-SSEP, along with all models in its universality\nclass, shares the same large deviation function for the transferred charge as\nthe classical SSEP model. The method we introduce to derive this result relies\non a gauge-like invariance associated with the choice of the bond where the\ncurrent is measured. This approach enables the explicit calculation of the\ncumulant generating function for both Q-SSEP and SSEP and establishes an exact\ncorrespondence between them. These analytical findings are validated by\nextensive numerical simulations. Our results establish that a wide range of\nnoisy free-fermionic models share the same Q-SSEP universality class and show\nthat their transport properties are essentially classical.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks have shown significant\npromise in leveraging external knowledge to enhance the performance of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). However, conventional RAG methods often retrieve\ndocuments based solely on surface-level relevance, leading to many issues: they\nmay overlook deeply buried information within individual documents, miss\nrelevant insights spanning multiple sources, and are not well-suited for tasks\nbeyond traditional question answering. In this paper, we propose Insight-RAG, a\nnovel framework designed to address these issues. In the initial stage of\nInsight-RAG, instead of using traditional retrieval methods, we employ an LLM\nto analyze the input query and task, extracting the underlying informational\nrequirements. In the subsequent stage, a specialized LLM -- trained on the\ndocument database -- is queried to mine content that directly addresses these\nidentified insights. Finally, by integrating the original query with the\nretrieved insights, similar to conventional RAG approaches, we employ a final\nLLM to generate a contextually enriched and accurate response. Using two\nscientific paper datasets, we created evaluation benchmarks targeting each of\nthe mentioned issues and assessed Insight-RAG against traditional RAG pipeline.\nOur results demonstrate that the Insight-RAG pipeline successfully addresses\nthese challenges, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin in\nmost cases. These findings suggest that integrating insight-driven retrieval\nwithin the RAG framework not only enhances performance but also broadens the\napplicability of RAG to tasks beyond conventional question answering.",

Here we measure density by the growth of the\ncounting function of $\\sigma$ in the sense of integrability or\n$\\limsup$-conditions relative to suitable comparison functions. These questions\nhave been around for many years. However, full answers have been obtained only\nvery recently -- in partly still unpublished work.\n  The way we measure density of eigenvalues must be clearly distinguished from\nspectral asymptotics, where one asks for an asymptotic expansion of\neigenvalues. We explicitly and on purpose do not go into this direction and do\nnot present any results about spectral asymptotics.\n  We understand this survey as a focussed presentation of results revolving\naround the initially stated questions, and not as an exhaustive account on the\nliterature which is in the one or other way related to the area. It does not\ncontain any proofs, but we do comment on proof methods.\n  The theorems we present are very diverse. They rely on different methods from\noperator theory, complex analysis, and classical analysis, and beautifully\ninvoke the interplay between these areas. Besides the fundamental theorems\nsolving the problem and several selected additions, we decided to include a\nnumber of results devoted to the spectral theory of Jacobi matrices, in other\nwords, to the Hamburger moment problem. The connection between the theories of\ncanonical systems and moment problems gives rise to important new insights, yet\nseems to be less widely known than other connections, e.g., with Krein-Feller\nor Schr\\\"odinger operators.\n  We compile all necessary prerequisites from the general theory to make the\nexposition as self-contained as possible.

However, while existing\nmethods have shown success in image-based tasks, their effectiveness remains\nunexplored for sequential time-series data from sensor systems, particularly\naudio inputs. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study\nevaluating six representative Meta-CL approaches using three network\narchitectures on five datasets from both image and audio modalities. We develop\nMetaCLBench, an end-to-end Meta-CL benchmark framework for edge devices to\nevaluate system overheads and investigate trade-offs among performance,\ncomputational costs, and memory requirements across various Meta-CL methods.\nOur results reveal that while many Meta-CL methods enable to learn new classes\nfor both image and audio modalities, they impose significant computational and\nmemory costs on edge devices. Also, we find that pre-training and meta-training\nprocedures based on source data before deployment improve Meta-CL performance.\nFinally, to facilitate further research, we provide practical guidelines for\nresearchers and machine learning practitioners implementing Meta-CL on\nresource-constrained environments and make our benchmark framework and tools\npublicly available, enabling fair evaluation across both accuracy and\nsystem-level metrics.",

This paper provides a detailed comparison of the effectiveness of\nentropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods for the stabilization of\ncompressible (wall-bounded) turbulent flows. For this investigation, an entropy\nstable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method is applied on\nGauss-Legendre and Gauss-Lobatto nodes. In the compressible regime, an\nadditional stabilization technique for shock capturing based on a convex\nblending of a low-order finite volume with the high-order discontinuous\nGalerkin operator is utilized. The present investigation provides a systematic\nstudy from convergence tests, to the Taylor-Green vortex and finally to a more\nintricate turbulent wall-bounded 3D diffuser flow, encompassing both weakly\ncompressible and compressible regimes. The comparison demonstrates that the\nDGSEM on Gauss-Lobatto nodes is less accurate due to the lower integration\naccuracy. Conversely, it is faster than the DGSEM on Gauss-Legendre nodes due\nto a less severe time step restriction and simpler numerical operator. To the\nauthor's knowledge, this is the first time for which a comparison of entropy\nstable DGSEM on Gauss-Lobatto and Gauss-Legendre has been performed for\ncompressible, wall-bounded turbulent flows with separation.",

    "abstract": "It is common practice to outsource the training of machine learning models to\ncloud providers. Clients who do so gain from the cloud's economies of scale,\nbut implicitly assume trust: the server should not deviate from the client's\ntraining procedure. A malicious server may, for instance, seek to insert\nbackdoors in the model. Detecting a backdoored model without prior knowledge of\nboth the backdoor attack and its accompanying trigger remains a challenging\nproblem. In this paper, we show that a client with access to multiple cloud\nproviders can replicate a subset of training steps across multiple servers to\ndetect deviation from the training procedure in a similar manner to\ndifferential testing. Assuming some cloud-provided servers are benign, we\nidentify malicious servers by the substantial difference between model updates\nrequired for backdooring and those resulting from clean training. Perhaps the\nstrongest advantage of our approach is its suitability to clients that have\nlimited-to-no local compute capability to perform training; we leverage the\nexistence of multiple cloud providers to identify malicious updates without\nexpensive human labeling or heavy computation. We demonstrate the capabilities\nof our approach on an outsourced supervised learning task where $50\\%$ of the\ncloud providers insert their own backdoor; our approach is able to correctly\nidentify $99.6\\%$ of them. In essence, our approach is successful because it\nreplaces the signature-based paradigm taken by existing approaches with an\nanomaly-based detection paradigm.

For a given integer t, the subgraph compositions contain either\nvectors of labels for each connected subgraph of order t\n(t-multiset-compositions) or the sum of all labels of all connected subgraphs\nof order t (t-sum-composition). We ask whether, given a graph of which we know\nthe structure and an oracle whom you can query for compositions, we can\nreconstruct the labeling of the graph. If it is possible, then the graph is\nreconstructable; otherwise, it is confusable, and two labeled graphs with the\nsame compositions are called equicomposable. We prove that reconstructing\nthrough a brute-force algorithm is wildly inefficient, before giving methods\nfor reconstructing several graph classes using as few compositions as possible.\nWe also give negative results, finding the smallest confusable graphs and\ntrees, as well as families with a large number of equicomposable non-isomorphic\ngraphs. An interesting result occurs when twinning one leaf of a path: some\npaths are confusable, creating a twin out of a leaf sees the graph alternating\nbetween reconstructable and confusable depending on the parity of the path, and\ncreating a false twin out of a leaf makes the graph reconstructable using only\nsum-compositions in all cases.",

This contrasts with the quasi-sure setting of Bouchard and Nutz,\nin which prices are Borel-measurable and graphs of local priors are analytic\nsets, while strategies and stochastic kernels inherit only universal\nmeasurability. In our projective framework, we establish several\ncharacterizations of the robust no-arbitrage condition, already known in the\nquasi-sure setting, but under significantly more elegant and consistent\nassumptions. These characterisations have important applications, in\nparticular, the existence of solutions to the robust utility maximization\nproblem.

This study explores the application of deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) for real-time drum control in microreactors,\nexploring performance in regard to load-following scenarios. By leveraging a\npoint kinetics model with thermal and xenon feedback, we first establish a\nbaseline using a single-output RL agent, then compare it against a traditional\nproportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. This study demonstrates that\nRL controllers, including both single- and multi-agent RL (MARL) frameworks,\ncan achieve similar or even superior load-following performance as traditional\nPID control across a range of load-following scenarios. In short transients,\nthe RL agent was able to reduce the tracking error rate in comparison to PID.\nOver extended 300-minute load-following scenarios in which xenon feedback\nbecomes a dominant factor, PID maintained better accuracy, but RL still\nremained within a 1% error margin despite being trained only on short-duration\nscenarios. This highlights RL's strong ability to generalize and extrapolate to\nlonger, more complex transients, affording substantial reductions in training\ncosts and reduced overfitting. Furthermore, when control was extended to\nmultiple drums, MARL enabled independent drum control as well as maintained\nreactor symmetry constraints without sacrificing performance -- an objective\nthat standard single-agent RL could not learn. We also found that, as\nincreasing levels of Gaussian noise were added to the power measurements, the\nRL controllers were able to maintain lower error rates than PID, and to do so\nwith less control effort.",

As the\nnumber of peaks exceeds by far the number of integration variables, such\nintegrals can practically be performed within the multichannel Monte Carlo\napproach, with different phase space parameterizations, each designed to smooth\npossibly a few peaks at a time.

While existing methods achieve substantial performance\nby employing well-designed model architecture, they overlook a significant\nchallenge: the temporal misalignment inherent in ground-truth labels. This\nmisalignment arises when frames labeled as containing events do not align\naccurately with the actual event times, often as a result of human annotation\nerrors or the inherent difficulties in precisely identifying event boundaries\nacross neighboring frames. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel dynamic\nlabel assignment strategy that allows predictions to have temporal offsets from\nground-truth action times during training, ensuring consistent event spotting.\nOur method extends the concept of minimum-cost matching, which is utilized in\nthe spatial domain for object detection, to the temporal domain. By calculating\nmatching costs based on predicted action class scores and temporal offsets, our\nmethod dynamically assigns labels to the most likely predictions, even when the\npredicted times of these predictions deviate from ground-truth times,\nalleviating the negative effects of temporal misalignment in labels.

    "abstract": "A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing\nforces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a\nprecise interplay of excitation and inhibition, the 80:20 ratio, is at the\nbasis of the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural\nnetworks, reinforcement learning allows for fine-tuning internal signed\nconnections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli, and ensuring\nrobust performance. At present, engineered structures of competing components\nare, however, largely unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases\nare closely linked with frustration mechanisms in the hosting network. In this\ncontext, the spin glass theory has shown how an apparently uncontrollable\nnon-ergodic chaotic behavior arises from the complex interplay of competing\ninteractions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states\npreventing the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time.\nHere, we tackle the problem of disentangling topology and dynamics in systems\nwith antagonistic interactions. We make use of the signed Laplacian operator to\ndemonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks\npercolate, shaping the geometrical arena and complex energy landscape of the\nsystem. This unveils novel, highly robust multistable phases and establishes\ndeep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing\na natural topological and algebraic description of their still-unknown set of\npure states at zero temperature.",

    "abstract": "Modern radio interferometers enable high-resolution polarization imaging,\noffering insights into cosmic magnetism through Rotation Measure (RM)\nsynthesis. Traditional 2+1D RM synthesis treats the 2D spatial and 1D spectral\ntransforms separately. A fully 3D approach transforms data directly from\nvisibility-frequency space to sky-Faraday depth space using a 3D Fourier\ntransform. Faraday synthesis uses the full dataset for improved reconstruction\nbut requires a 3D deconvolution algorithm to subtract artifacts from the\nresidual image. Applying this method to modern interferometers also requires\ncorrections for direction-dependent effects (DDEs). We extend Faraday synthesis\nby incorporating DDE corrections, enabling accurate polarized imaging in the\npresence of instrumental and ionospheric effects. We implement this method\nwithin DDFACET, introducing a direction-dependent deconvolution algorithm\n(DDFSCLEAN) that applies DDE corrections in a faceted framework. Additionally,\nwe parameterize the CLEAN components and evaluate the model over a larger set\nof frequency channels, naturally correcting for bandwidth depolarization. The\nmethod is tested on both synthetic and real data. Our results show that Faraday\nsynthesis enables deeper deconvolution, reduces artifacts, and increases\ndynamic range. The depolarization correction improves recovery of polarized\nflux, allowing coarser frequency resolution without loss of sensitivity at high\nFaraday depths. From the 3D reconstruction, we identify a polarized source in a\nLOFAR Surveys pointing not detected by earlier RM surveys. Faraday synthesis is\nmemory-intensive due to the large transforms between the visibility domain and\nthe Faraday cube, and is only now becoming practical. Nevertheless, our\nimplementation achieves comparable or faster runtimes than the 2+1D approach,\nmaking it a competitive alternative for polarization imaging.",

Finally, we demonstrate the\nusefulness of SuperEvent by its integration into a modern sparse keypoint and\ndescriptor-based SLAM framework originally developed for traditional cameras,\nsurpassing the state-of-the-art in event-based SLAM by a wide margin.

DIF arises when a test item functions differently\nacross subgroups that are typically defined by the respondents' demographic\ncharacteristics. Most of the existing research has focused on the statistical\ndetection of DIF, yet less attention has been given to reducing or eliminating\nDIF and understanding why it occurs. Simultaneously, the use of computer-based\nassessments has become increasingly popular. The data obtained from respondents\ninteracting with an item are recorded in computer log files and are referred to\nas process data. Process data provide valuable insights into respondents'\nproblem-solving strategies and progress, offering new opportunities for DIF\nanalysis.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new algorithm for set-based state estimation of\nnonlinear discrete-time systems with bounded uncertainties. The novel method\nbuilds upon essential properties and computational advantages of constrained\nzonotopes (CZs) and polyhedral relaxations of factorable representations of\nnonlinear functions to propagate CZs through nonlinear functions, which is\nusually done using conservative linearization in the literature. The new method\nalso refines the propagated enclosure using nonlinear measurements. To achieve\nthis, a lifted polyhedral relaxation is computed for the composite nonlinear\nfunction of the system dynamics and measurement equations, in addition to\nincorporating the measured output through equality constraints. Polyhedral\nrelaxations of trigonometric functions are enabled for the first time, allowing\nto address a broader class of nonlinear systems than our previous works.\nAdditionally, an approach to obtain an equivalent enclosure with fewer\ngenerators and constraints is developed. Thanks to the advantages of the\npolyhedral enclosures based on factorable representations, the new state\nestimation method provides better approximations than those resulting from\nlinearization procedures. This led to significant improvements in the\ncomputation of convex sets enclosing the system states consistent with measured\noutputs. Numerical examples highlight the advantages of the novel algorithm in\ncomparison to existing CZ methods based on the Mean Value Theorem and DC\nprogramming principles.",

Traditional approaches often rely on\nwannier interpolation, which can introduce inaccuracies and computational\noverhead.

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is an important application in various domains such\nas energy management, traffic planning, financial markets, meteorology, and\nmedicine. However, real-time series data often present intricate temporal\nvariability and sharp fluctuations, which pose significant challenges for time\nseries forecasting. Previous models that rely on 1D time series representations\nusually struggle with complex temporal variations. To address the limitations\nof 1D time series, this study introduces the Times2D method that transforms the\n1D time series into 2D space. Times2D consists of three main parts: first, a\nPeriodic Decomposition Block (PDB) that captures temporal variations within a\nperiod and between the same periods by converting the time series into a 2D\ntensor in the frequency domain. Second, the First and Second Derivative\nHeatmaps (FSDH) capture sharp changes and turning points, respectively.\nFinally, an Aggregation Forecasting Block (AFB) integrates the output tensors\nfrom PDB and FSDH for accurate forecasting. This 2D transformation enables the\nutilization of 2D convolutional operations to effectively capture long and\nshort characteristics of the time series. Comprehensive experimental results\nacross large-scale data in the literature demonstrate that the proposed Times2D\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term\nforecasting.

We\nrefined previous models by incorporating heating, cooling, and radiation forces\nfrom spectral lines calculated using a photoionization code, assuming that\ncomposite AGN spectra irradiate the gas. For black holes with masses $3 \\times\n10^{6} \\lesssim {\\rm M_{BH}/M_{\\odot}} \\lesssim 10^{8}$, the mass loss rate,\n${\\rm \\dot{M}_w}$ increases proportionally with the disk Eddington fraction,\n$\\Gamma$. The insensitivity of ${\\rm \\dot{M}_w}$ to the hardness of the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) arises because the central region is\ndominated by radiation in the frequency range with ample spectral lines for the\nrange of $M_{BH}$ considered here. Disc winds are suppressed or fail outside\nthe above mass range because of a dearth of line-driving photons. We find\n\\emph{stronger} winds, both in terms of ${\\rm \\dot{M}_w}$ and wind velocity\ncompared to previous disc wind models. Our winds are stronger because of an\nenhanced line force from including many spectral lines in the X-ray band. These\nlines were unavailable and, hence, unaccounted for in previous photoionization\nstudies and their subsequent application to AGN wind models. For $\\Gamma\n\\gtrsim 0.4$, ${\\rm \\dot{M}_w}$ is higher than the assumed disc accretion rate,\nimplying that the wind feeds back strongly. Our findings indicate the necessity\nof utilizing comprehensive and current atomic data along with a more thorough\napproach to radiation transfer - both spatially and temporally - to accurately\ncalculate the line force.",

    "abstract": "Reliable collision avoidance under extreme situations remains a critical\nchallenge for autonomous vehicles. While large language models (LLMs) offer\npromising reasoning capabilities, their application in safety-critical evasive\nmaneuvers is limited by latency and robustness issues. Even so, LLMs stand out\nfor their ability to weigh emotional, legal, and ethical factors, enabling\nsocially responsible and context-aware collision avoidance. This paper proposes\na scenario-aware collision avoidance (SACA) framework for extreme situations by\nintegrating predictive scenario evaluation, data-driven reasoning, and\nscenario-preview-based deployment to improve collision avoidance\ndecision-making. SACA consists of three key components. First, a predictive\nscenario analysis module utilizes obstacle reachability analysis and motion\nintention prediction to construct a comprehensive situational prompt. Second,\nan online reasoning module refines decision-making by leveraging prior\ncollision avoidance knowledge and fine-tuning with scenario data. Third, an\noffline evaluation module assesses performance and stores scenarios in a memory\nbank. Additionally, A precomputed policy method improves deployability by\npreviewing scenarios and retrieving or reasoning policies based on similarity\nand confidence levels. Real-vehicle tests show that, compared with baseline\nmethods, SACA effectively reduces collision losses in extreme high-risk\nscenarios and lowers false triggering under complex conditions.

Many recent studies on quantum\ndynamics focus on expectation values of nonlinear observables; however, their\nexperimental measurement is hindered by the post-selection problem -- namely,\nthe substantial overhead caused by uncontrollable measurement outcomes. In this\nwork, we propose a post-selection--free experimental strategy based on a fully\nquantum approach. The key idea is to deterministically simulate the\npost-selected quantum states by applying quantum singular value transformation\n(QSVT) algorithms. For pure initial state post-selection, our method is a\ngeneralization of fixed-point amplitude amplification to arbitrary projective\nmeasurements, achieving an optimal quadratic speedup. We further extend this\nframework to mixed initial state post-selection by applying linear amplitude\namplification via QSVT, which significantly enhances the measurement success\nprobability. However, a deterministic quantum algorithm for preparing the\npost-selected mixed state is generally impossible because of\ninformation-theoretic constraints imposed by quantum coding theory.\nAdditionally, we introduce a pseudoinverse decoder for measurement-induced\nquantum teleportation. This decoder possesses the novel property that, when\nconditioned on a successful flag measurement, the decoding is nearly perfect\neven in cases where channel decoders are information-theoretically impossible.\nOverall, our work establishes a powerful approach for measuring novel quantum\ndynamical phenomena and presents quantum algorithms as a new perspective for\nunderstanding quantum dynamics and quantum chaos.",

    "abstract": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a transformative\nshift in artificial intelligence, paving the way for advanced intelligent\nagents capable of sophisticated reasoning, robust perception, and versatile\naction across diverse domains. As these agents increasingly drive AI research\nand practical applications, their design, evaluation, and continuous\nimprovement present intricate, multifaceted challenges. This book provides a\ncomprehensive overview, framing intelligent agents within modular,\nbrain-inspired architectures that integrate principles from cognitive science,\nneuroscience, and computational research. We structure our exploration into\nfour interconnected parts. First, we systematically investigate the modular\nfoundation of intelligent agents, systematically mapping their cognitive,\nperceptual, and operational modules onto analogous human brain functionalities\nand elucidating core components such as memory, world modeling, reward\nprocessing, goal, and emotion. Second, we discuss self-enhancement and adaptive\nevolution mechanisms, exploring how agents autonomously refine their\ncapabilities, adapt to dynamic environments, and achieve continual learning\nthrough automated optimization paradigms. Third, we examine multi-agent\nsystems, investigating the collective intelligence emerging from agent\ninteractions, cooperation, and societal structures. Finally, we address the\ncritical imperative of building safe and beneficial AI systems, emphasizing\nintrinsic and extrinsic security threats, ethical alignment, robustness, and\npractical mitigation strategies necessary for trustworthy real-world\ndeployment. By synthesizing modular AI architectures with insights from\ndifferent disciplines, this survey identifies key research challenges and\nopportunities, encouraging innovations that harmonize technological advancement\nwith meaningful societal benefit.",

    "abstract": "Axions can naturally be very light due to the protection of (approximate)\nshift symmetry. Because of the pseudoscalar nature, the long-range force\nmediated by the axion at the tree level is spin dependent, which cannot lead to\nobservable effects between two unpolarized macroscopic objects. At the one-loop\nlevel, however, the exchange of two axions does mediate a spin-independent\nforce. This force is coherently enhanced when there exists an axion background.\nIn this work, we study the two-axion exchange force in a generic axion\nbackground. We find that the breaking of the axion shift symmetry plays a\ncrucial role in determining this force. The background-induced axion force\n$V_{\\rm bkg}$ vanishes in the shift-symmetry restoration limit. The shift\nsymmetry can be broken either explicitly by non-perturbative effects or\neffectively by the axion background. When the shift symmetry is broken, $V_{\\rm\nbkg}$ scales as $1/r$ and could be further enhanced by a large occupation\nnumber of the background axions. We investigate possible probes on this using\nfifth-force search and atomic spectroscopy experiments.",

We\nfind an increase in the star formation rate (SFR), potential ignition of active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) and significant morphology changes. However, at what\nstage during interactions or mergers these changes begin to occur remains an\nopen question. With a combination of machine learning and visual\nclassification, we select a sample of 3,162 interacting and merging galaxies in\nthe Cosmic Evolutionary Survey (COSMOS) field across a redshift range of 0.0 -\n1.2. We divide this sample into four distinct stages of interaction based on\ntheir morphology, each stage representing a different phase of the dynamical\ntimescale. We use the rich ancillary data available in COSMOS to probe the\nrelation between interaction stage, stellar mass, SFR, and AGN fraction. We\nfind that the distribution of SFRs rapidly change with stage for mass\ndistributions consistent with being drawn from the same parent sample. This is\ndriven by a decrease in the fraction of red sequence galaxies (from 17% as\nclose pairs to 1.4% during merging) and an increase in the fraction of\nstarburst galaxies (from 7% to 32%). We find the AGN fraction increases by a\nfactor of 1.2 only at coalescence. We find the effects of interaction peak at\nthe point of closest approach and coalescence of the two systems.

Such refrigerators can be realized by combining\ncorrelated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a\nfour-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths\nvia two independent two-photon transitions.

We demonstrate\nthat, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical\nphases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic\nmatrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different\nstroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric\ninterpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence\nor absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher\ndimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is\nassociated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal\nhorizon which disappears in the non heating phase. We develop perturbative\napproaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show,\nhow tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric\nframework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.",

We detected 3640 HI absorption features.\nThis represents the largest Galactic HI absorption line catalog to date. Based\non the strong correlation between the HI 21-cm emission line column densities\n($N_{HI}$) and the visual extinction ($A_V$) measured toward the pointing\ncenter, along with the confinement of the absorption features to a narrow range\nin radial velocities (-25$<v_{\\rm LSR}$[kms$^{-1}$]$<$+25), we infer that the\ndetected absorption lines form a homogeneous sample of HI clouds in the local\ninterstellar medium (LISM). The HI 21-cm absorption optical depth is linearly\ncorrelated to $N_{HI}$ and $A_V$, up to $A_V$ of about 1 mag. Above this\nthreshold, $A_V$ traces the total hydrogen content, and consequently, $A_V$ and\n$N_{HI}$ scale, differently. The slopes of $N_{HI}$ distributions of central\nsight lines with HI 21-cm absorption detections and non-detection differ at\n$>2\\sigma$. A similar difference is observed for H$_2$ detections and\nnon-detections in damped Lyman-alpha systems at $z$ > 1.8, implying that\nturbulence-driven WNM-to-CNM conversion is the common governing factor for the\npresence of HI 21-cm and H$_2$ absorption. Through a comparison of central and\noff-axis absorption features, we find that the slope of rms fluctuations in the\noptical depth variations in the quiescent gas associated with LISM is shallower\nthan the earlier measurements in the disk. The densities (20-30 cm$^{-3}$)\ninferred from the optical depth variations are typical of the CNM values.

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is enabling unprecedented automation\nin content creation and decision support, but it also raises novel risks. This\npaper presents a first-principles risk assessment framework underlying the IEEE\nP3396 Recommended Practice for AI Risk, Safety, Trustworthiness, and\nResponsibility. We distinguish between process risks (risks arising from how AI\nsystems are built or operated) and outcome risks (risks manifest in the AI\nsystem's outputs and their real-world effects), arguing that generative AI\ngovernance should prioritize outcome risks. Central to our approach is an\ninformation-centric ontology that classifies AI-generated outputs into four\nfundamental categories: (1) Perception-level information, (2) Knowledge-level\ninformation, (3) Decision/Action plan information, and (4) Control tokens\n(access or resource directives). This classification allows systematic\nidentification of harms and more precise attribution of responsibility to\nstakeholders (developers, deployers, users, regulators) based on the nature of\nthe information produced. We illustrate how each information type entails\ndistinct outcome risks (e.g. deception, misinformation, unsafe recommendations,\nsecurity breaches) and requires tailored risk metrics and mitigations. By\ngrounding the framework in the essence of information, human agency, and\ncognition, we align risk evaluation with how AI outputs influence human\nunderstanding and action. The result is a principled approach to AI risk that\nsupports clear accountability and targeted safeguards, in contrast to broad\napplication-based risk categorizations. We include example tables mapping\ninformation types to risks and responsibilities. This work aims to inform the\nIEEE P3396 Recommended Practice and broader AI governance with a rigorous,\nfirst-principles foundation for assessing generative AI risks while enabling\nresponsible innovation.",

For the method to be applicable, two conditions need to be met: the\nphoton number should be conserved in the later stages of the jet, and the\noriginal photon temperature must be inferred from the data. The case of\ndissipation via subphotospheric shocks is discussed in detail, and we show that\nthe method is particularly efficient when a low-energy spectral break is\nidentified. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by applying it to two\ndifferent GRB spectra.

    "abstract": "[abridged] AGN feedback is a crucial ingredient for understanding galaxy\nevolution. However, a complete quantitative time-dependent framework, including\nthe dependence of such feedback on AGN, host galaxy, and host halo properties,\nis yet to be developed. Using the complete sample of 682 radio AGN from the\nLOFAR-eFEDS survey ($z<0.4$), we derive the average jet power of massive\ngalaxies and its variation as a function of stellar mass ($M_*$), halo mass\n($M_h$) and radio morphology. We compare the incidence distributions of compact\nand complex radio AGN as a function of specific black hole kinetic power,\n$\\lambda_{\\rm Jet}$, and synthesise, for the first time, the radio luminosity\nfunction (RLF) by $M_*$ and radio morphology. Our RLF and derived total radio\nAGN kinetic luminosity density, $\\log \\Omega_{\\rm kin}/[\\rm\n{W~Mpc^{-3}}]=32.15_{-0.34}^{+0.18}$, align with previous work. We find that\nkinetic feedback from radio AGN dominates over any plausible inventory of\nradiatively-driven feedback for galaxies with $\\log M_*/M_\\odot > 10.6$. More\nspecifically, it is the compact radio AGN which dominate this global kinetic\nenergy budget for all but the most massive galaxies ($10.6 < \\log M_*/M_{\\odot}\n< 11.5$). Subsequently, we compare the average injected jet energy against the\ngalaxy and halo binding energy, and against the total thermal energy of the\nhost gas within halos. We find that radio AGN cannot fully unbind their host\ngalaxies nor host halos. However, they have enough energy to impact the global\nthermodynamical heating and cooling balance in small halos and significantly\ncontribute to offsetting local cooling flows in even the most massive clusters\ncores. Overall, our findings provide important insights on jet powering,\naccretion processes and black hole-galaxy coevolution via AGN feedback, as well\nas a clear observational benchmark to calibrate AGN feedback simulations.",

Two degrees of freedom of the field are\ndescribed by scalar-type components, which are coupled due to the mass term,\nwhile the remaining two degrees of freedom are described by a vector-type\ncomponent, which decouples completely.

In\nthe scalar-type sector, the radial differential equation for each polarization\nis a Fuchsian differential equation with five singularities, whereas in the\nvector-type sector, the radial equation has four singularities.

Research involving stationary Unruh-DeWitt (UDW)\ndetectors near a (2+1)-dimensional Ba\\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black\nhole has uncovered phenomena such as entanglement shadows, entanglement\namplification through black hole rotation, and differences between bipartite\nand tripartite entanglement. For a (1+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole,\nit has been shown that two infalling UDW detectors can harvest entanglement\nfrom the scalar quantum vacuum even when separated by an event horizon. In this\npaper, we calculate the mutual information between two UDW detectors coupled to\na massless quantum scalar field, with the detectors starting at rest and\nfalling radially into a non-rotating (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole. The\ntrajectory of the detectors includes regions where both detectors are switched\non outside of the horizon; where one detector is switched on inside of the\nhorizon while the other switches on outside; and where both detectors switch on\ninside of the horizon. We investigate different black hole masses, detector\nenergy gaps, widths and temporal separations of the detector switching\nfunctions, and field boundary conditions. We find that black holes--even the\nsimplest kind having constant curvature--significantly affect the correlation\nproperties of quantum fields in the vacuum state. These correlations, both\noutside and inside the horizon, can be mapped out by infalling detectors.",

Using this approach, QNM wavefunctions remain\nfinite at the horizon and spatial infinity.

    "abstract": "Determining the steady state of an open quantum system is crucial for\ncharacterizing quantum devices and studying various physical phenomena. Often,\ncomputing a single steady state is insufficient, and it is necessary to explore\nits dependence on multiple external parameters. In such cases, calculating the\nsteady state independently for each combination of parameters quickly becomes\nintractable. Perturbation theory (PT) can mitigate this challenge by expanding\nsteady states around reference parameters, minimizing redundant computations\nacross neighboring parameter values. However, PT has two significant\nlimitations: it relies on the pseudo-inverse -- a numerically costly operation\n-- and has a limited radius of convergence. In this work, we remove both of\nthese roadblocks. First, we introduce a variational perturbation theory (VPT)\nand its multipoint generalization that significantly extends the radius of\nconvergence even in the presence of non-analytic effects such as dissipative\nphase transitions. Then, we develop two numerical strategies that eliminate the\nneed to compute pseudo-inverses. The first relies on a single LU decomposition\nto efficiently construct the steady state within the convergence region, while\nthe second reformulates VPT as a Krylov space recycling problem and uses\npreconditioned iterative methods. We benchmark these approaches across various\nmodels, demonstrating their broad applicability and significant improvements\nover standard PT.",

In\nthis model, the dark matter relic abundance can be achieved by a variety of\nmechanisms: freeze-in, out-of-equilibrium freeze-out, and secluded freeze-out.\nWe demonstrate that the secluded freeze-out regime in the considered mass range\nis now entirely excluded by a combination of direct and indirect detection\nconstraints.

This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental\nprocesses such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into\nalready occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of\nlight scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\\rm\nf}$, where $N_{\\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state.\nHere, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a\nquasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak\ninteractions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have\na dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local)\nbeyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can\ncompletely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive\nones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly\ntuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of\nmagnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics.

In redback spider pulsars, the IBS\ntypically wraps around the pulsar, leading to a near-normal IBS shock with\nrelatively bright X-ray emission. The characteristic energies of radiating\nparticles and the magnetic fields in the IBS suggest spectral features in the\nhard X-ray band. Here we perform joint soft-hard X-ray analyses of three\nredback pulsars, J1723-2837, J2215+5135, and J2339-0533, including new J2215\nNuSTAR data.

Interpreting these as synchrotron cooling features allows us to\nestimate the IBS magnetic field $B_{\\rm IBS} \\sim 40-100$ G and place lower\nbounds on the maximum radiating electron energy.

However, applying it to extremely sparse, unposed views in\nunbounded 360{\\deg} scenes remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we\npropose a novel neural rendering framework to accomplish the unposed and\nextremely sparse-view 3D reconstruction in unbounded 360{\\deg} scenes. To\nresolve the spatial ambiguity inherent in unbounded scenes with sparse input\nviews, we propose a layered Gaussian-based representation to effectively model\nthe scene with distinct spatial layers. By employing a dense stereo\nreconstruction model to recover coarse geometry, we introduce a layer-specific\nbootstrap optimization to refine the noise and fill occluded regions in the\nreconstruction. Furthermore, we propose an iterative fusion of reconstruction\nand generation alongside an uncertainty-aware training approach to facilitate\nmutual conditioning and enhancement between these two processes.

    "abstract": "The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the\nextended, localized, and critical, which bring up seven distinct fundamental\nphases in nature: three pure phases and four coexisting ones with mobility\nedges, yet a unified theory with full characterization and realization of all\nthese phases has not been developed. Here we propose a complete and unified\nframework based on a spinful quasiperiodic (QP) system which realizes all the\nfundamental localization phases, with the exact and universal results being\nobtained for their characterization. First, we show that the pure phases are\nobtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spinful QP model,\ngiving a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases and otherwise the\ncoexisting ones. Further, we uncover a novel universal mechanism for the\ncritical states that their emergence is protected by the generalized\nincommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful QP model, which considerably\nbroadens the rigorous realizations of the exotic critical states. We then show\nthe criteria of exact solvability for the present spinful QP system, with which\nwe construct various exactly solvable models for all distinct localization\nphases. In particular, we propose two novel models, dubbed spin-selective QP\nlattice model and QP optical Raman lattice model, to achieve all basic types of\nmobility edges and all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization\nphysics, respectively. The experimental scheme is proposed and studied in\ndetail to realize these models with high feasibility. This study establishes a\ncomplete and profound theoretical framework which enables an in-depth\nexploration of the broad classes of all fundamental localization phenomena in\nQP systems, and offers key insights for constructing their exactly solvable\nmodels with experimental feasibility.",

The dataset is aimed at distilling the complex plan generation task\ninto separate atomic reasoning tasks in their easiest possible form, boolean or\nmultiple-choice questions, where the model has to choose the right answer from\nthe provided options. While the aim of ACPBench is to test the simplest form of\nreasoning about action and change, when tasked with planning, a model does not\ntypically have options to choose from and thus the reasoning required for\nplanning dictates an open-ended, generative form for these tasks. To that end,\nwe introduce ACPBench Hard, a generative version of ACPBench, with open-ended\nquestions which the model needs to answer. Models that perform well on these\ntasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a\npolicy. We discuss the complexity of these tasks as well as the complexity of\nvalidating the correctness of their answers and present validation algorithms\nfor each task. Equipped with these validators, we test the performance of a\nvariety of models on our tasks and find that for most of these tasks the\nperformance of even the largest models is still subpar. Our experiments show\nthat no model outperforms another in these tasks and with a few exceptions all\ntested language models score below 65%, indicating that even the current\nfrontier language models have a long way to go before they can reliably reason\nabout planning.

As a result, we obtain the first\nalmost-linear time algorithm that solves $\\ell_{q, p}$ flows on directed graphs\nto high accuracy. Second, we present optimization tools to reduce approximately\nsolving composite $\\ell_{1, \\infty}$-regression problems to solving\n$m^{o(1)}\\epsilon^{-1}$ instances of composite $\\ell_{q, p}$-regression\nproblem. The method builds upon recent advances in solving box-simplex games\n[Jambulapati-Tian, NeurIPS 2023] and the area convex regularizer introduced in\n[Sherman, STOC 2017] to obtain faster rates for constrained versions of the\nproblem.

Most variants rely on the same core algorithm:\ndepth-sorting of Gaussian splats then rasterizing in primitive order. This\nensures correct alpha compositing, but can cause rendering artifacts due to\nbuilt-in approximations. Moreover, for a fixed representation, sorted rendering\noffers little control over render cost and visual fidelity. For example, and\ncounter-intuitively, rendering a lower-resolution image is not necessarily\nfaster. In this work, we address the above limitations by combining 3D Gaussian\nsplatting with stochastic rasterization. Concretely, we leverage an unbiased\nMonte Carlo estimator of the volume rendering equation. This removes the need\nfor sorting, and allows for accurate 3D blending of overlapping Gaussians. The\nnumber of Monte Carlo samples further imbues 3DGS with a way to trade off\ncomputation time and quality.

    "abstract": "Supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies gain mass through\naccretion disks. Models predict that quasi-spherical winds, expelled by the\nblack hole during active accretion phases, have a key role in shaping galaxy\nevolution by regulating star formation, the distribution of metals over\nkiloparsec scales, and by sweeping ambient gas to the outskirts and beyond of\ngalaxies. Nonetheless, the mechanism driving these outflows and the amount of\nenergy exchanged between the wind and the galaxy's interstellar medium remain\nunclear. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the kinematical properties of\nwinds in a sample of nearby active galaxies using the novel kinematic tool\nMOKA3D, which takes into account the clumpy nature of the ISM. We find\nremarkable similarities among the properties of the outflows in all the\ngalaxies examined. In particular, we provide the first evidence that outflows\nexhibit a regular trend in radial velocity, initially constant or slightly\ndecreasing, followed by rapid acceleration starting at approximately 1 kpc from\nthe nucleus, despite the seemingly complex kinematics observed. The observed\nbehavior aligns with our current theoretical understanding of Active Galactic\nNuclei outflows, where a momentum-driven phase transitions to an\nenergy-conserving phase just beyond approximately 1 kpc. The constant velocity\nof the momentum-driven wind is then rapidly accelerated following the\ninefficient Compton cooling of post-shock material and the transition to energy\nconservation. The measured radial terminal velocities of the outflows are\nalways larger than the escape velocities from the host galaxies, confirming the\nkey role of outflows in shaping the galaxy properties and evolution, as a\nmanifestation of AGN feedback. Our results, only made possible by our novel\nkinematic analysis tool, are crucial to understand the origin and the powering\nmechanism of these winds.",

    "abstract": "The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from\npreviously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of\nincreased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress\nKV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can\naccumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired\noutputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache\nquantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to\ncapture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor\nquantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and\noriginal keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of\nquantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no\nmodel fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and\nis grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical\nexperiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82,\nimproves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark\nscores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.",

We then examine\nhow to integrate the low-quality image features under the ControlNet\narchitecture to adjust the degree of image details enhancement. Consequently,\nwe develop a ControlNet-like model to identify the target region and allocate\ndifferent integration scales to the target and surrounding regions, enabling\nregion-customized image restoration that aligns with user instructions.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed InstructRestore approach\nenables effective human-instructed image restoration, such as images with bokeh\neffects and user-instructed local enhancement.

    "abstract": "Entanglement distribution is essential for unlocking the potential of\ndistributed quantum information processing. We consider an $N$-partite network\nwhere entanglement is distributed via a central source over lossy channels, and\nnetwork participants cooperate to establish entanglement between any two chosen\nparties under local operations and classical communication (LOCC) constraints.\nWe develop a general mathematical framework to assess the optimal average\nbipartite entanglement shared in a lossy distribution, and introduce a\ntractable lower bound by optimizing over a subset of single-parameter LOCC\ntransformations. Our results show that probabilistically extracting Bell pairs\nfrom W states is more advantageous than deterministically extracting them from\nGHZ-like states in lossy networks, with this advantage increasing with network\nsize. We further extend our analysis analytically, proving that W states remain\nmore effective in large-scale networks. These findings offer valuable insights\ninto the practical deployment of near-term networks, revealing a fundamental\ntrade-off between deterministic entanglement distribution protocols and\nloss-sensitive resources.",

While\npathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative\nadvancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable\nstorage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore,\nensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous\nvalidation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present\nPathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via\nself-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from\n20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously\nevaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public\ndatasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer\nclassification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification,\nbiomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of\nstructured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across\n27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks,\nincluding pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype\ndiagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to\ngenerate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and\ndiagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by\nfoundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra\nexemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised\npathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade\ntasks.

Molecular systems provide a complementary,\nchemically tunable, platform for room-temperature optically detected magnetic\nresonance (ODMR)-based quantum sensing. A critical parameter governing sensing\nsensitivity is the optical contrast-i.e., the difference in emission between\ntwo spin states. In state-of-the-art solid-state defects such as the\nnitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, this contrast is approximately 30%. Here,\ncapitalizing on chemical tunability, we show that room-temperature ODMR\ncontrasts of 40% can be achieved in molecules. Using a nitrogen-substituted\nanalogue of pentacene (6,13-diazapentacene), we enhance contrast compared to\npentacene and, by determining the triplet kinetics through time-dependent\npulsed ODMR, show how this arises from accelerated anisotropic intersystem\ncrossing.

We develop enhanced analyses for quantum simulation of Schr\\\"odinger\noperators with black-box potential via the pseudo-spectral method, providing\nexplicit resource estimates independent of wavefunction assumptions. These\nbounds are applied to assess the complexity of optimization through QHD. Our\nfindings pertain to unconstrained convex optimization in $d$ dimensions. In\ncontinuous time, we demonstrate that QHD, with suitable parameters, can achieve\narbitrarily fast convergence rates. The optimization speed limit arises solely\nfrom the discretization of the dynamics, mirroring a property of the classical\ndynamics underlying QHD. Considering this cost, we show that a $G$-Lipschitz\nconvex function can be optimized to an error of $\\epsilon$ with\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{1.5}G^2 R^2/\\epsilon^2)$ queries. Moreover, under\nreasonable assumptions on the complexity of Hamiltonian simulation,\n$\\widetilde{\\Omega}(d/\\epsilon^2)$ queries are necessary. Thus, QHD does not\noffer a speedup over classical zeroth order methods with exact oracles.\nHowever, we demonstrate that the QHD algorithm tolerates\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^3/d^{1.5}G^2 R^2)$ noise in function\nevaluation. We show that QHD offers a super-quadratic query advantage over all\nknown classical algorithms tolerating this level of evaluation noise in the\nhigh-dimension regime. Additionally, we design a quantum algorithm for\nstochastic convex optimization that provides a super-quadratic speedup over all\nknown classical algorithms in the high-dimension regime. To our knowledge,\nthese results represent the first rigorous quantum speedups for convex\noptimization achieved through a dynamical algorithm.",

Given the stacked structure of neural\nnetworks, where each block builds on the representation of the block below,\nthis approach leads to hierarchical representations. More abstract features\nlive on the top blocks of the model, while features on lower blocks are\nexpected to be less abstract. In contrast to this, we introduce a new learning\nmethod named NoProp, which does not rely on either forward or backwards\npropagation across the entire network. Instead, NoProp takes inspiration from\ndiffusion and flow matching methods, where each block independently learns to\ndenoise a noisy target using only local targets and back-propagation within the\nblock. We believe this work takes a first step towards introducing a new family\nof learning methods that does not learn hierarchical representations -- at\nleast not in the usual sense. NoProp needs to fix the representation at each\nblock beforehand to a noised version of the target, learning a local denoising\nprocess that can then be exploited at inference. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image\nclassification benchmarks.

Our\nfindings reveal that test-time scaling laws hold for WFMs and that SWIFT\nprovides a scalable and effective pathway for improving WFM inference without\nretraining or increasing model size.

    "abstract": "In this study, we advance the understanding of non-equilibrium systems by\nderiving thermodynamic relations for a heat engine operating under an\nexponentially decreasing temperature profile. Such thermal configurations\nclosely mimic spatially localized heating such as laser-induced thermal\ngradients. Using exact analytical solutions, we show that this arrangement\nresults in significantly higher velocity, entropy production, and extraction\nrates than piecewise thermal profiles, while exhibiting reduced irreversibility\nand complexity relative to linear or quadratic gradients. We further examine\nthe thermodynamic behavior of the Brownian particles in the networks. Our study\nreveals that the velocity and entropy production rates remain independent of\nnetwork size; on the contrary, extensive quantities such as total entropy\ndepend on the number of microstates. Additionally, we show that a Brownian\nparticle in a ratchet potential with spatially varying temperature achieves\ndirected motion, even without external forces driven by solely thermal\nasymmetry. These findings highlight the critical role of temperature asymmetry\nin controlling the transport processes and optimizing the particle dynamics.\nThis in turn will have promising applications in microfluidic devices and\nnanoscale sensors. Finally, we explore the influence of the system parameters\non the efficiency and performance of the heat engine. The exponential\ntemperature profiles enable faster velocities while simultaneously exhibiting\nhigher efficiency compared with other thermal arrangements. Moreover, by\naddressing key questions on entropy production, we provide insights into the\ntransition between nonequilibrium and equilibrium systems and contribute tools\nfor optimizing energy-efficient systems in both natural and engineered\nsettings.",

We have used the MIRI instrument on JWST\nto image the massive filament NGC6334M at d~1.3 kpc with unprecedented\nresolution and dynamic range at 7.7 and 25.5 microns. Our observations reveal\nthe fine structure of the filament in absorption against mid-infrared\nbackground emission. From the absorption data, we derive high-resolution column\ndensity maps and perform a detailed analysis of the filament structure. We find\na median filament width of 0.12+/-0.02 pc at both wavelengths, resolved by\nalmost two orders of magnitude by MIRI, and consistent with the typical\nhalf-power width of Herschel filaments in nearby (d<0.5 kpc) clouds. The JWST\ndata also reveal the presence of a quasi-periodic series of side filaments with\na similar projected spacing of 0.125+/-0.015 pc. Combining our JWST results\nwith Spitzer and APEX/Herschel data, we perform a study of cloud structure over\nfour orders of magnitude in linear scale. A convergence test shows that our\nwidth estimates for NGC6334M are robust and reflect the presence of a true\ncharacteristic scale. While there is evidence of a Kolmogorov-like spectrum of\nsmall-scale fluctuations down the 1.6x10^-3 pc resolution of the JWST\nobservations, we identify a break in the power spectrum of column density\nfluctuations at a scale ~0.1-0.4 pc comparable to the width of NGC6334M and its\nside filaments.

    "abstract": "The last several decades have seen significant advances in the theoretical\nmodeling of materials within the fields of solid-state physics and materials\nscience, but many methods commonly applied to this problem struggle to capture\nstrong electron correlation accurately. Recent widespread interest in quantum\nmaterials -- where strong correlation plays a crucial role in the quantum\neffects governing their behavior -- further highlights the need for theoretical\nmethods capable of rigorously treating such correlation. Here, we present a\nperiodic generalization of variational two-electron reduced density matrix\n(2-RDM) theory, a bootstrapping-type method that minimizes the ground-state\nenergy as a functional of the 2-RDM without relying on the wavefunction. The\n2-RDM is computed directly by semidefinite programming with\n$N$-representability conditions, ensuring accurate treatment of strongly\ncorrelated electronic systems. By exploiting translational symmetry, we\nsignificantly reduce computational scaling, enabling applications to realistic\nmaterials-scale systems. Additionally, we introduce an alternative to\nconventional energy band structures: natural-orbital occupation-number bands,\nwhich, being independent of mean-field assumptions, offer deeper insights into\nelectron correlation effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach\nby applying the theory to hydrogen chains, molybdenum disulfide, and nickel\noxide, showing that natural-orbital occupation bands correctly capture\nelectronic character in regimes where density functional theory fails. This\nwork represents a major step toward accurately describing the electronic\nstructure of quantum materials using reduced density matrices rather than\nwavefunctions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding tissue motion in surgery is crucial to enable applications in\ndownstream tasks such as segmentation, 3D reconstruction, virtual tissue\nlandmarking, autonomous probe-based scanning, and subtask autonomy. Labeled\ndata are essential to enabling algorithms in these downstream tasks since they\nallow us to quantify and train algorithms. This paper introduces a point\ntracking challenge to address this, wherein participants can submit their\nalgorithms for quantification. The submitted algorithms are evaluated using a\ndataset named surgical tattoos in infrared (STIR), with the challenge aptly\nnamed the STIR Challenge 2024. The STIR Challenge 2024 comprises two\nquantitative components: accuracy and efficiency. The accuracy component tests\nthe accuracy of algorithms on in vivo and ex vivo sequences. The efficiency\ncomponent tests the latency of algorithm inference. The challenge was conducted\nas a part of MICCAI EndoVis 2024. In this challenge, we had 8 total teams, with\n4 teams submitting before and 4 submitting after challenge day. This paper\ndetails the STIR Challenge 2024, which serves to move the field towards more\naccurate and efficient algorithms for spatial understanding in surgery. In this\npaper we summarize the design, submissions, and results from the challenge. The\nchallenge dataset is available here: https://zenodo.org/records/14803158 , and\nthe code for baseline models and metric calculation is available here:\nhttps://github.com/athaddius/STIRMetrics",

    "abstract": "We use the ASTRID cosmological simulation to forecast massive black hole\n(MBH) mergers detectable by LISA down to $z=0$. ASTRID directly models MBH\ndynamical friction, allowing a realistic tracking of their trajectory. It also\nincorporates relatively low-mass MBH seeds down to $5\\times\n10^{4}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, providing a more complete picture of LISA MBH\nmergers. We find that LISA MBH mergers initially have high eccentricities,\npeaking around $e_0 = 0.8$ across all redshifts. Accounting for this boosts the\nevent rate from 5.6/yr (if circular orbits are assumed) to 10.5/yr. This\nenhancement is largely due to additional inspiral sources that will coalesce\nafter LISA's observation, which constitute 46% of detected events. This\nunderscores the importance of LISA's sensitivity to the early inspiral phase,\nespecially for eccentric binaries that emit gravitational waves across a wider\nfrequency band. Most LISA events in ASTRID arise from $M_{\\mathrm{BH}} \\sim\n10^{5-6}~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, low-redshift ($z<2$) and low mass-ratio ($q\\sim\n0.01-0.1)$ mergers. Accounting for eccentricity broadens the detectable MBH\nmass range up to $10^9~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, and shifts the peak of detectable\nmergers to a lower redshift $z_{\\rm peak} = 0.8$. This implies that the most\nmassive LISA events may also be PTA sources. We predict LISA events to be in\nvarious galaxy environments, including many low-mass satellite galaxies. The EM\ncounterparts of most LISA sources have AGN luminosities $L_{\\rm bol}>\n10^{42}$erg/s, albeit only $1\\%$ with $ > 10^{44}$erg/s. The brightest AGN are\nthose associated with the rare LISA/PTA events with $M_{\\rm BH} >\n10^{8}~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$.",

Furthermore, we provide a\ncondition for reversibility and propose a generator matrix formula for the\nlargest reversible subcode of any linear code.

Additionally, we examine the intersection of a pair of MT codes,\npossibly with different shift constants, and demonstrate that this intersection\nis not necessarily MT. However, when the intersection admits an MT structure,\nwe propose the corresponding shift constants. We also establish a GPM formula\nfor the intersection of a pair of MT codes with the same shift constants. This\nresult enables us to derive a GPM formula for the intersection of an MT code\nand the Galois dual of another MT code. Finally, we examine conditions for\nvarious properties on MT codes.

To address this, we introduce Self-attentive Temporal Embedding Probing\n(STEP), a simple yet effective approach designed to enforce temporal\nsensitivity in parameter-efficient image-to-video transfer.

We generate disordered SHU packings of identical and `nonoverlapping'\nspheres in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space using a modified\ncollective-coordinate optimization algorithm that incorporates a soft-core\nrepulsive potential between particles in addition to the standard stealthy pair\npotential. These SHU packings are ultradense, spanning a broad spectrum of\nstructures depending on the stealthiness parameter $\\chi$. We consider\ntwo-phase media composed of hard particles derived from ultradense SHU packings\nembedded in a matrix phase, with varying stealthiness parameter $\\chi$ and\npacking fractions $\\phi$. Our main objective is the estimation of the dynamical\nphysical properties of such two-phase media, namely, the effective dynamic\ndielectric constant and the time-dependent diffusion spreadability, which is\ndirectly related to nuclear magnetic relaxation in fluid-saturated porous\nmedia. We show through spreadability that two-phase media derived from\nultradense SHU packings exhibit faster interphase diffusion due to the higher\npacking fractions achievable compared to media obtained without soft-core\nrepulsion. The imaginary part of the effective dynamic dielectric constant of\nSHU packings vanishes at a small wavenumber, implying perfect transparency for\nthe corresponding wavevectors. We also obtain cross-property relations between\ntransparency characteristics and long-time behavior of the spreadability for\nsuch two-phase media.

    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of quark production on bottom-up thermalization in\nheavy-ion collisions. First, we extend the parametric estimates of bottom-up\nthermalization in pure gluon systems by incorporating quark production in the\nweak-coupling (high-energy) limit. Our analysis reveals that quark production\ndoes not alter the qualitative features of the three-stage thermalization\nprocess in this limit. Furthermore, we obtain the scaling behavior of the quark\nnumber density over time at each stage. Then, by solving the Boltzmann equation\nin diffusion approximation (BEDA) for longitudinally boost-invariant systems,\nwe demonstrate how our detailed numerical simulations approach the predicted\nthree-stage thermalization picture as the strong coupling $\\alpha_s$ decreases.\nFinally, we carry out a detailed comparison of our BEDA results with those\nobtained by solving the QCD effective kinetic theory for intermediate values of\n$\\alpha_s$, observing remarkably good quantitative agreement between the two\napproaches.",

This method transforms the\nsparse, continuous input latent space into a compact, structured discrete proxy\nspace, allowing each element to correspond to a specific real data point,\nthereby improving CR performance. Instead of direct quantization, we first map\nthe input latent variables into a less entangled ``style'' space and apply\nquantization using a learnable codebook.

Evaluation of increasingly generalist robot policies\nrequires an increasingly diverse repertoire of evaluation environments, making\nthe evaluation bottleneck even more pronounced.

We show that AutoEval can nearly fully eliminate human involvement in\nthe evaluation process, permitting around the clock evaluations, and the\nevaluation results correspond closely to ground truth evaluations conducted by\nhand. To facilitate the evaluation of generalist policies in the robotics\ncommunity, we provide public access to multiple AutoEval scenes in the popular\nBridgeData robot setup with WidowX robot arms.

    "abstract": "Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using\nsynthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum\ncomputers to date. It often requires determining observables with high\nprecision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase\ntransitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated\nin data postprocessing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We\npresent a readout error-mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli\nmeasurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The\nproposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is\nscalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient\ncharacterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures,\nusing overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the\nprotocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits\nemploying readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.",

Conventional methods typically rely on supervised learning, where\nground-truth labels are directly optimized against predicted trajectories. This\namplifies the limitations caused by long-tailed data distributions, making it\ndifficult for the model to capture abnormal behaviors. In this work, we propose\na self-supervised pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that explicitly\nmodels position, velocity, and acceleration. We leverage velocity and\nacceleration information to enhance position prediction through feature\ninjection and a self-supervised motion consistency mechanism. Our model\nhierarchically injects velocity features into the position stream. Acceleration\nfeatures are injected into the velocity stream. This enables the model to\npredict position, velocity, and acceleration jointly. From the predicted\nposition, we compute corresponding pseudo velocity and acceleration, allowing\nthe model to learn from data-generated pseudo labels and thus achieve\nself-supervised learning. We further design a motion consistency evaluation\nstrategy grounded in physical principles; it selects the most reasonable\npredicted motion trend by comparing it with historical dynamics and uses this\ntrend to guide and constrain trajectory generation. We conduct experiments on\nthe ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, demonstrating that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both datasets.",

Super resolving these\nolder datasets is essential for uniform analysis across different solar cycles,\nenabling better characterization of solar flares, active regions, and magnetic\nnetwork dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion model approach\nfor Super-Resolution and we apply it to MDI magnetograms to match the\nhigher-resolution capabilities of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI).\nBy training a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with residuals on downscaled HMI\ndata and fine-tuning it with paired MDI/HMI data, we can enhance the resolution\nof MDI observations from 2\"/pixel to 0.5\"/pixel. We evaluate the quality of the\nreconstructed images by means of classical metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, FID and\nLPIPS) and we check if physical properties, such as the unsigned magnetic flux\nor the size of an active region, are preserved. We compare our model with\ndifferent variations of LDM and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models\n(DDPMs), but also with two deterministic architectures already used in the past\nfor performing the Super-Resolution task. Furthermore, we show with an analysis\nin the Fourier domain that the LDM with residuals can resolve features smaller\nthan 2\", and due to the probabilistic nature of the LDM, we can asses their\nreliability, in contrast with the deterministic models.

The galaxy intrinsic\nellipticity-gravitational shear (IG) correlation is generally the most dominant\ncomponent of such contamination for cross-correlating redshift bins. The\nself-calibration (SC) method is one of the most effective techniques to\nmitigate such contamination from the GG signal. In a photometric survey, the SC\nmethod first extracts the galaxy number density-galaxy intrinsic ellipticity\n(gI) correlation from the observed galaxy-galaxy lensing correlation using the\nredshift dependence of lens-source pairs. The IG correlation is computed\nthrough a scaling relation using the gI correlation and other lensing\nobservables. We extend the SC method beyond the linear regime by modifying its\nscaling relation which can account for the non-linear galaxy bias model and\nvarious IA models. In this study, we provide a framework to detect the IG\ncorrelation for the redshift bins for source galaxies for the proposed year 1\nsurvey of the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST Y1). We tested the\nmethod for the tidal alignment and tidal torquing (TATT) model of IA and we\nfound that the scaling relation is accurate within 10$\\%$ and 20$\\%$ for\ncross-correlating and auto-correlating redshift bins, respectively. Hence the\nsuppression of IG contamination can be accomplished with a factor of 10 and 5,\nfor cross-correlating and auto-correlating redshift bins, respectively. We\ntested the method's robustness and found that the suppression of IG\ncontamination by a factor of 5 is still achievable for all combinations of\ncross-correlating bins even with the inclusion of a moderate amount of\nuncertainties on IA and bias parameters, respectively.

Due to the presence of the unpaired\nodd nucleon(s), the time-reversal symmetry of the fission compound nucleus is\nspontaneously broken, an aspect routinely neglected in the most advanced\nmicroscopic approaches of the past. The emerging fission fragment properties\nare quite similar to the properties of fission fragments of neighboring\neven-even nuclei. The time from saddle-to-scission is often significantly\nlonger in odd-N-odd-Z or odd-A nuclei than for even-even nuclei since systems\nwith unpaired nucleons are easier to excite and the potential energy surfaces\nof these nuclei have more structure, often resembling a very complicated\nobstacle course, rather than a more direct evolution of the nuclear shape from\nthe top of the outer fission barrier to the scission configuration.

    "abstract": "According to conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC), the currently conventional\ndescription of the entire history of the universe (but without an initial\ninflationary phase) provides but one cosmic aeon of an unending sequence of\nsuch aeons, where the future conformal infinity of each aeon joins essentially\nsmoothly to the conformally stretched big bang of the next, across a spacelike\n3-surface, referred to as a crossover 3-surface. Whereas in previous accounts\nof CCC a detailed description of the physics of crossover had been somewhat\nproblematic, a novel idea is introduced here to show how crossover takes place\nnaturally during a temporal period of the universe that is dominated by\ngravitational waves referred to here as a gravitational wave epoch (GWE).\nAccordingly, the geometry at the crossover surface is conformally smooth,\nexcept at a discrete set of points, referred to as Hawking points, each\nrepresenting the final Hawking evaporation of the dominant black hole of a\ngalactic cluster in the earlier aeon. It is shown here (using 2-spinor and\ntwistor techniques) that there is a mass-energy conservation law that holds\nacross the crossover surface, showing that the rise of temperature within such\nHawking spots should be effectively determined by the total mass of the\npre-crossover galactic cluster involved. This rise of temperature on the CMB\nmap within Hawking spots is found to be in quantitative agreement with the\nmasses of the largest galactic clusters observed in our own aeon what suggests\nthat the physics in the previous aeon was, at least in the gravitational\nsector, similar to ours. A second observational feature, the actual angular\ndiameter of the Hawking spots seen in our CMB, which is about twice what should\nhave been expected, is associated to the presence of GWE just after the\ncrossover and before the start of the usual cosmological epochs.",

Tissue boundaries are associated with supracellular cables formed by\nactin and the molecular motor non-muscle myosin II. Actomyosin cables generate\ntension that prevents cell mixing. Whether other cellular behaviours contribute\nto the formation of linear interfaces between cell populations remains unclear.\nIn the Drosophila embryo, an actomyosin-based boundary separates the ectoderm\nfrom the mesectoderm, a group of neuronal and glial progenitors. Mathematical\nmodelling predicted that cell divisions in the ectoderm challenge the\nmesectoderm-ectoderm (ME) boundary. Consistent with this, suppressing ectoderm\ncell divisions in vivo prevented cell mixing across the ME boundary when\nactomyosin-based tension was lost. Our mathematical model also predicted that\ncell divisions sharpen the ME boundary by reducing tension and increasing cell\nmotility in the ectoderm. We found that inhibiting ectoderm divisions in vivo\nreduced boundary linearity. Using laser ablation and cell tracking, we\ndemonstrated that cell divisions reduced junctional tension and increased cell\nmovement in the ectoderm. Together, our results reveal that cell divisions\nfacilitate cellular rearrangements to increase fluidity in a novel mechanism\nfor boundary refinement.",

Therefore, they need to\nconstantly monitor vast amounts of incoming and outgoing transactions. A\nparticular challenge in detecting money laundering is that money launderers\ncontinuously adapt their tactics to evade detection. Hence, detection methods\nneed constant fine-tuning. Traditional machine learning models suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the model on new data, thereby\nlimiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Continual learning\nmethods may address this issue and enhance current anti-money laundering (AML)\npractices, by allowing models to incorporate new information while retaining\nprior knowledge. Research on continual graph learning for AML, however, is\nstill scarce. In this review, we critically evaluate state-of-the-art continual\ngraph learning approaches for AML applications. We categorise methods into\nreplay-based, regularization-based, and architecture-based strategies within\nthe graph neural network (GNN) framework, and we provide in-depth experimental\nevaluations on both synthetic and real-world AML data sets that showcase the\neffect of the different hyperparameters.

Kaiser-Guttman criterion retains fewer PCs,\ncausing overdispersion, while Cattell's scree test retains more PCs,\ncompromising reliability. The percentage of cumulative variation criterion\noffers greater stability, consistently selecting the optimal number of\ncomponents. Therefore, the Pareto chart, which shows both the cumulative\npercentage and the cut-off point for retained PCs, provides the most reliable\nmethod of selecting components, ensuring stability and enhancing PCA\neffectiveness, particularly in health-related research applications.",

History-deterministic automata still allow for exponential\nsuccinctness in automata over infinite words compared to deterministic automata\n(Kuperberg and Skrzypczak, 2015), allow for canonical forms unlike\ndeterministic automata (Abu Radi and Kupferman, 2019 and 2020; Ehlers and\nSchewe, 2022), and retain some of the algorithmic properties of deterministic\nautomata, for example for reactive synthesis (Henzinger and Piterman, 2006;\nEhlers and Khalimov, 2024).\n  Despite the topic of history-determinism having received a lot of attention\nover the last decade, the complexity of deciding whether a parity automaton is\nhistory-deterministic has, up till now, remained open. We show that\nhistory-determinism for a parity automaton with a fixed parity index can be\nchecked in PTIME, thus improving upon the naive EXPTIME upper bound of\nHenzinger and Piterman that has stood since 2006. More precisely, we show that\nthe so-called 2-token game, which can be solved in PTIME for parity automata\nwith a fixed parity index, characterises history-determinism for parity\nautomata. This game was introduced by Bagnol and Kuperberg in 2018, who showed\nthat to decide if a B\\\"uchi automaton is history-determinism, it suffices to\nfind the winner of the 2-token game on it. They conjectured that this 2-token\ngame based characterisation extends to parity automata. Boker, Kuperberg,\nLehtinen, and Skrzypcak showed in 2020 that this conjecture holds for coB\\\"uchi\nautomata as well.

The time series of the returns\nemphasize major upheavals in the markets -- Black Monday, Tech Bubble,\nFinancial Crisis and Covid Pandemic -- which are reflected in the tail ends of\nthe distributions. De-trending the overall gain, we concentrate on comparing\ndistributions of gains and losses. Specifically, we compare the tails of the\ndistributions, which are believed to exhibit power-law behavior and possibly\ncontain outliers. Towards this end we find confidence intervals of the linear\nfits of the tails of the complementary cumulative distribution functions on a\nlog-log scale, as well as conduct a statistical U-test in order to detect\noutliers. We also study probability density functions of the full distributions\nof the returns with the emphasis on their asymmetry. The key empirical\nobservations are that the mean of de-trended distributions increases\nnear-linearly with the number of days of accumulation while the overall skew is\nnegative -- consistent with the heavier tails of losses -- and depends little\non the number of days of accumulation. At the same time the variance of the\ndistributions exhibits near-perfect linear dependence on the number of days of\naccumulation, that is it remains constant if scaled to the latter. Finally, we\ndiscuss the theoretical framework for understanding accumulated returns.

Dimensional reduction is feasible in this model, and our solutions\nare general, as they recover all known results of $4D$ Chaplygin-driven\ncosmology when $d =0$. Using Hubble-$57$ data obtained through the differential\nage method (DA), the best fit curves are drawn and estimated observational\nconstraints of the model parameters. A note worthy aspect of the model is that\nthe resulting field equation is highly nonlinear with respect to the scale\nfactor. This nonlinearity allows us to describe both dust-dominated and\naccelerating universes, though only in extremal cases. We obtain solutions of\nthe non-linear field equations which are new and interesting. We have adopted a\nfirst-order approximation of the key equation, which enabled us to derive an\nexact, time-dependent solution for the scale factor. The higher dimensional\ncosmological model is found to converge to a $\\Lambda$CDM model for a\nlarge-scale factor, capturing the desired feature of an acceleration flip. We\nalso explore the evolution of the deceleration parameter, effective EoS, jerk\nparameter, etc., both analytically and graphically. The Chaplygin gas parameter\n$\\alpha$ being significantly less than unity, apparently the present model does\nnot support pure Chaplygin gas model ($\\alpha = 1$).

    "abstract": "By observing collider neutrino interactions of different flavours, the\nSND@LHC and Faser experiments have shown that the LHC can make interesting\ncontributions to neutrino physics. This document summarizes why the SND@LHC\nCollaboration intends to continue taking data at the High Luminosity LHC\n(HL-LHC). The upgraded detector will instrument the regions of both the\nneutrino vertex and the magnetized calorimeter with silicon microstrips. The\nuse of this technology will allow us to continue the physics program of the\ncurrent SND@LHC detector with higher statistics. It will also offer new\npossibilities. For instance, the magnetization of the hadron calorimeter will\nenable the separation between neutrinos and antineutrinos. This could lead to\nthe first direct observation of tau antineutrinos. The use of ultrafast timing\nlayers will enable triggers to be sent to ATLAS, potentially allowing the\nidentification of the charm quark pair that produced the neutrino interacting\nin the detector. Such tagging of the neutrino source would fulfill Pontecorvo\noriginal proposal of a tagged neutrino beam. The experiment will perform unique\nmeasurements with high energy neutrinos and will also provide a means to\nmeasure gluon parton distribution functions in a previously unexplored domain\n(Bjorkenx <10^-5). Furthermore, the technological advancements of the upgrade\nand the experience that will be gained in the areas of operation and data\nanalysis will play a crucial role in the design of the neutrino detector for\nthe SHiP experiment.",

It is well known that\nno explicit integrator may remain stable beyond certain limits in $\\lambda$.\nFurthermore, these stability limits are only tight for certain specific\nintegrators (different in each case), which may then be called `optimally\nstable'.

    "abstract": "Hot-cold ablative mixing plasmas are ubiquitous in astrophysical and\nlaboratory systems, where a cold/dense plasma is roughly in pressure balance\nwith a hot/dilute plasma. Examples include the plasma thermal quench during\nmajor disruptions in tokamaks, interaction between a central hot-spot and the\nsolid liner in an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) capsule, and the formation\nof large-scale structures in galaxy clusters. In such systems, a parallel\nelectrostatic collisionless shock forms and plays a critical role in both the\nthermal collapse of the hot plasma and the ablative mixing of cold ions. The\nformation and dynamics of such shocks are investigated by employing\none-dimensional VPIC simulations and theoretical analyses, revealing key\ndifferences from the well-studied collisionless shocks where an over-pressured,\nhigh-density plasma expands into a rarefied background. Notably, the shock\nformation has a weak dependence on the plasma pressure, provided that the\ndensity ratio between the cold and hot plasmas is large. Instead, the shock is\nprimarily governed by the plasma temperatures on both sides. The collisionless\nelectron thermal conduction flux in both upstream and downstream regions\nfollows the free-streaming limit itself, but its spatial gradient exhibits\nconvective scaling, ensuring the same characteristic length scale of the\nelectron temperature and density evolution.",

Along this line, we would like\nto improve 3D point cloud instance segmentation which has emerged as a\nparticularly promising approach for these applications. However, the creation\nof 3D point cloud datasets entails enormous costs compared to 2D image\ndatasets. To train a model of 3D point cloud instance segmentation, it is\nnecessary not only to assign categories but also to provide detailed\nannotations for each point in the large-scale 3D space. Meanwhile, the increase\nof recent proposals for generative models in 3D domain has spurred proposals\nfor using a generative model to create 3D point cloud data. In this work, we\npropose a pre-training with 3D synthetic data to train a 3D point cloud\ninstance segmentation model based on generative model for 3D scenes represented\nby point cloud data. We directly generate 3D point cloud data with Point-E for\ninserting a generated data into a 3D scene.

Extensive theoretical and numerical\nstudies suggest that, in two dimensions, this model does not exhibit a\nfinite-temperature phase transition but instead manifests asymptotic freedom.\nHowever, some research has also proposed the possibility of a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition over the years. In this\nstudy, we revisit the classical two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg model through\nlarge-scale simulations with linear system sizes up to $L=16384$. Our\nMonte-Carlo data, without any extrapolation, clearly reveal an exponential\ndivergence of the correlation length $\\xi$ as a function of inverse temperature\n$\\beta$, a hallmark of asymptotic freedom. Moreover, extrapolating $\\xi$ to the\nthermodynamic limit in the low-temperature regime achieves close agreement with\nthe three-loop perturbative calculations. We further propose a finite-size\nscaling (FSS) ansatz for $\\xi$, demonstrating that the pseudo-critical point\n$\\beta_L$ diverges logarithmically with $L$. The thermodynamic and finite-size\nscaling behaviors of the magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ are also investigated\nand corroborate the prediction of asymptotic freedom.

The resulting beams require spatiotemporal characterization, which are\nperformed by bulk lateral shearing interferometry.

In this manner, we\npresent the generation of these pulses in the visible range, which are\nexperimentally validated, and demonstrate that bulk lateral shearing\ninterferometry can be used for pulsed beams across widely different spectral\nregions with the same setup.

The verification metric is the Peirce Skill Score.

In contrast, a\nhybrid method combining both observations and NWP data offers the best\nperformance and remains stable with the rainfall accumulation period. The\nhybrid method also improves the performance in predicting increasingly intense\nrainfall, from the 5% to the 0.1% rarest events. The choice of the loss\nfunction is found to be an important aspect of this work, where only balanced\nloss functions provide results insensitive to rare event frequency.

Unitary rotation gates operate within this internal space to\ngenerate the non-trivial dynamics of the free plasma-Dirac equation. To\nincorporate the contributions from the cyclotron and plasma density\nterms--manifesting as inhomogeneous potential terms--in the plasma-Dirac\nequation, the walk process is complemented with unitary potential operators.\nThis leads to a unitary qubit lattice sequence that recovers the plasma-Dirac\nequation under a second-order accurate discretization scheme. The proposed\nalgorithm is explicit and demonstrates, in the worst case, a polynomial quantum\nadvantage compared to the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) classical method\nin terms of resource requirements and error complexity. In addition, we extend\nthe algorithm to include dissipative effects by introducing a phenomenological\ncollision frequency between plasma species.

This paper builds upon a hitherto state of the art model,\nvigiMatch, modifying existing features and introducing new ones to target known\nshortcomings of the original model. Two support vector machine classifiers, one\nfor medicines and one for vaccines, classify report pairs as duplicates and\nnon-duplicates. Recall was measured using a diverse collection of 5 independent\nlabelled test sets. Precision was measured by having each model classify a\nrandomly selected stream of pairs of reports until each model classified 100\npairs as duplicates. These pairs were assessed by a medical doctor without\nindicating which method(s) had flagged each pair. Performance on individual\ncountries was measured by having a medical doctor assess a subset of pairs\nclassified as duplicates for three different countries. The new model achieved\nhigher precision and higher recall for all labelled datasets compared to the\nprevious state of the art model, with comparable performance for medicines and\nvaccines. The model was shown to produce substantially fewer false positives\nthan the comparator model on pairs from individual countries.

To this aim, three\ndifferent thermal-hydraulics problems are considered: two benchmark 'flow over\ncylinder' test cases at diverse Reynolds numbers, whose datasets are,\nrespectively, obtained with the FEniCS finite element solver and retrieved from\nthe CFDbench dataset, and the DYNASTY experimental facility operating at\nPolitecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by\ninternally heated fluids for Generation IV nuclear applications, whose dataset\nwas generated using the RELAP5 nodal solver.",

    "abstract": "Many-to-many matching seeks to match multiple points in one set and multiple\npoints in another set, which is a basis for a wide range of data mining\nproblems. It can be naturally recast in the framework of Optimal Transport\n(OT). However, existing OT methods either lack the ability to accomplish\nmany-to-many matching or necessitate careful tuning of a regularization\nparameter to achieve satisfactory results. This paper proposes a novel\nmany-to-many matching method to explicitly encode many-to-many constraints\nwhile preventing the degeneration into one-to-one matching. The proposed method\nconsists of the following two components. The first component is the matching\nbudget constraints on each row and column of a transport plan, which specify\nhow many points can be matched to a point at most. The second component is the\ndeformed $q$-entropy regularization, which encourages a point to meet the\nmatching budget maximally. While the deformed $q$-entropy was initially\nproposed to sparsify a transport plan, we employ it to avoid the degeneration\ninto one-to-one matching. We optimize the objective via a penalty algorithm,\nwhich is efficient and theoretically guaranteed to converge. Experimental\nresults on various tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good\nperformance by gleaning meaningful many-to-many matchings.",

    "abstract": "Traffic engineering (TE) in large-scale computer networks has become a\nfundamental yet challenging problem, owing to the swift growth of global-scale\ncloud wide-area networks or backbone low-Earth-orbit satellite constellations.\nTo address the scalability issue of traditional TE algorithms, learning-based\napproaches have been proposed, showing potential of significant efficiency\nimprovement over state-of-the-art methods. Nevertheless, the intrinsic\nlimitations of existing learning-based methods hinder their practical\napplication: they are not generalizable across diverse topologies and network\nconditions, incur excessive training overhead, and do not respect link\ncapacities by default.\n  This paper proposes TELGEN, a novel TE algorithm that learns to solve TE\nproblems efficiently in large-scale networks, while achieving superior\ngeneralizability across diverse network conditions. TELGEN is based on the\nnovel idea of transforming the problem of \"predicting the optimal TE solution\"\ninto \"predicting the optimal TE algorithm\", which enables TELGEN to learn and\nefficiently approximate the end-to-end solving process of classical optimal TE\nalgorithms. The learned algorithm is agnostic to the exact network topology or\ntraffic patterns, and can efficiently solve TE problems given arbitrary inputs\nand generalize well to unseen topologies and demands.\n  We trained and evaluated TELGEN on random and real-world networks with up to\n5000 nodes and 106 links. TELGEN achieved less than 3% optimality gap while\nensuring feasibility in all cases, even when the test network had up to 20x\nmore nodes than the largest in training. It also saved up to 84% solving time\nthan classical optimal solver, and could reduce training time per epoch and\nsolving time by 2-4 orders of magnitude than latest learning algorithms on the\nlargest networks.",

This distinction\nis essential for interpreting inclusive jet data at the LHC.

In this setup,\nthe recommended tracks are predicted by the LLM in an autoregressive way, i.e.\nthe LLM generates the track titles one token at a time. While intuitive, this\napproach has several limitation. First, it is based on a general purpose\ntokenization that is optimized for words rather than for track titles. Second,\nit necessitates an additional entity resolution layer that matches the track\ntitle to the actual track identifier. Third, the number of decoding steps\nscales linearly with the length of the track title, slowing down inference. In\nthis paper, we propose to address the task of prompt-based music recommendation\nas a generative retrieval task. Within this setting, we introduce novel,\neffective, and efficient representations of track identifiers that\nsignificantly outperform commonly used strategies. We introduce Text2Tracks, a\ngenerative retrieval model that learns a mapping from a user's music\nrecommendation prompt to the relevant track IDs directly. Through an offline\nevaluation on a dataset of playlists with language inputs, we find that (1) the\nstrategy to create IDs for music tracks is the most important factor for the\neffectiveness of Text2Tracks and semantic IDs significantly outperform commonly\nused strategies that rely on song titles as identifiers (2) provided with the\nright choice of track identifiers, Text2Tracks outperforms sparse and dense\nretrieval solutions trained to retrieve tracks from language prompts.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) are\nextensively used as tooling platforms through structured output APIs to ensure\nsyntax compliance so that robust integration with existing softwares like agent\nsystems, could be achieved. However, the feature enabling functionality of\ngrammar-guided structured output presents significant security vulnerabilities.\nIn this work, we reveal a critical control-plane attack surface orthogonal to\ntraditional data-plane vulnerabilities. We introduce Constrained Decoding\nAttack (CDA), a novel jailbreak class that weaponizes structured output\nconstraints to bypass safety mechanisms. Unlike prior attacks focused on input\nprompts, CDA operates by embedding malicious intent in schema-level grammar\nrules (control-plane) while maintaining benign surface prompts (data-plane). We\ninstantiate this with a proof-of-concept Chain Enum Attack, achieves 96.2%\nattack success rates across proprietary and open-weight LLMs on five safety\nbenchmarks with a single query, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-flash. Our\nfindings identify a critical security blind spot in current LLM architectures\nand urge a paradigm shift in LLM safety to address control-plane\nvulnerabilities, as current mechanisms focused solely on data-plane threats\nleave critical systems exposed.",

The TJ code is also successfully benchmarked\nagainst the STRIDE toroidal tearing mode code [Phys. Plasmas 25, 082502\n(2018)]. Finally, the new capabilities of the TJ code are used to investigate\nthe stability of tearing modes in tokamak plasmas as an ideal stability\nboundary, associated with either an external-kink or an internal-kink mode, is\napproached. All elements of the tearing stability matrix are found to tend to\ninfinity as an ideal stability boundary is approached. Furthermore, as the\nstability boundary is approached, the eigenfunctions of the various tearing\nmodes in the plasma, which are decoupled by sheared plasma rotation, are all\nfound to morph into that of the marginally-stable ideal mode. However, the\ngrowth-rates and real frequencies of the various ``ideal-tearing-modes'' are\ndifferent from one another. Moreover, the growth-rate of the ideal-tearing-mode\nthat reconnects magnetic flux at the rational surface that lies closest to the\nedge of the plasma is the one that tends to a very large value as the stability\nboundary is approached. A relatively simple test for ideal stability that is\ncapable of detecting stability boundaries for external-kink and internal-kink\nmodes, even in the presence of a very close-fitting ideal wall, is described\nand verified.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of ride-sourcing services such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi\nChuxing has fundamentally reshaped urban transportation by offering flexible,\non-demand mobility via mobile applications. Despite their convenience, these\nplatforms confront significant operational challenges, particularly vehicle\nrebalancing - the strategic repositioning of a large group of vehicles to\naddress spatiotemporal mismatches in supply and demand. Inadequate rebalancing\nnot only results in prolonged rider waiting times and inefficient vehicle\nutilization but also leads to fairness issues, such as the inequitable\ndistribution of service quality and disparities in driver income. To tackle\nthese complexities, we introduce continuous-state mean-field control (MFC) and\nmean-field reinforcement learning (MFRL) models that employ continuous vehicle\nrepositioning actions. MFC and MFRL offer scalable solutions by modeling each\nvehicle's behavior through interaction with the vehicle distribution, rather\nthan with individual vehicles. This limits the issues arising from the curse of\ndimensionality inherent in traditional multi-agent methods, enabling\ncoordination across large fleets with significantly reduced computational\ncomplexity. To ensure equitable service access across geographic regions, we\nintegrate an accessibility constraint into both models. Extensive empirical\nevaluation using real-world data-driven simulation of Shenzhen demonstrates the\nreal-time efficiency and robustness of our approach. Remarkably, it scales to\ntens of thousands of vehicles, with training times comparable to the decision\ntime of a single linear programming rebalancing. Besides, policies generated by\nour approach effectively explore the efficiency-equity Pareto front,\noutperforming conventional benchmarks across key metrics like fleet\nutilization, fulfilled requests, and pickup distance, while ensuring equitable\nservice access.",

We validate CIBR on\nextensive vision-language benchmarks, including zero-shot classification across\nseven diverse image datasets and text-image retrieval on MSCOCO and Flickr30K.\nThe results show consistent performance gains over standard CLIP.

Enhancing sensitivity at\nhigher frequencies in the kilohertz (kHz) range promises access to rich\nphysics, particularly the extreme conditions during the merger stage of binary\nneutron stars. However, the high-frequency sensitivity of Michelson-based\ninterferometers is fundamentally limited by their linear optical cavities,\nwhich are optimized for low-frequency signal enhancement. In [Phys. Rev. X 13,\n021019 (2023)], a new configuration employing an L-shaped optical resonator was\nproposed to overcome this limitation, offering exceptional sensitivity in the\nkHz band. As a pathfinder, the 12-meter prototype at Beijing Normal University\nis designed to demonstrate the sensing and control schemes of this new kHz\ndetector configuration and to explore its performance in the high-power regime\nwith suspended optics. Beyond its primary scientific goal, the prototype also\noffers potential sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, potentially enabling\nconstraints on exotic sources. This paper presents an overview of the\nprototype, including its optical design and current development status of key\ncomponents.",

One of the prominent issues concerning the\nsuperconductivity mechanism is about the pseudogap phase which behaves either\nas cooperator or competitor for superconductivity and its fundamental reason\nremains still elusive. Here we report the measurements of scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) in the model superconducting system\nBi2+xSr2-xCuO6+delta with a transition temperature Tc~7 K. Although this system\nis supposed to be slightly overdoped, a pseudogap feature can be easily\nobserved in the energy region of about 20-60 meV. A modulation of local density\nof states (LDOS) with a periodicity of about 4a0/3 (a0: Cu-O-Cu bond length)\ncan be easily observed, which is also supported by the Fourier transformation\npattern with wavevectors at about (0,+-3pi/2a0) and (+-3pi/2a0,0).\nSurprisingly, we find that the LDOS exhibits a clear antiphase feature in the\npseudogap energy region below and above the Fermi energy, indicating that it is\nan intrinsic feature of the pseudogap phase. We interpret this modulation and\nantiphase feature as a possible consequence of the pair density wave due to the\nAmperean pairing with finite momentum. Our results give a deep insight on the\nunderstanding of the pseudogap phase in cuprate superconductors.",

As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the\nD(-1)-branes are instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. In\nthe confined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on\n$S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic fluxes produced by the $N_{c}$ open\nstrings on the D7-brane as a baryonic operator. Afterwards, we study the\nspectrum and the holographic correlation function of the baryonic fermion on\nthe D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic spectrum is in agreement with the\ndispersion curves obtained from the confined correlation function, and the mass\nratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our model is close to the associated\nexperimental data. Moreover, the effective interaction terms of the holographic\nbaryon and meson are derived and all the coupling constants take order of\n$N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation from the large $N_{c}$ field theory.\nIn the deconfined geometry, the holographic correlation function is also\nevaluated numerically while the fermion on D7-brane is identified to plasmino\ninstead of baryon. The dispersion curves from the deconfined correlation\nfunction basically covers the results from the hard thermal loop approximation\nand may imply the instanton-induced interaction with spin.

Among NSCLC\npatients, approximately 32.3% have mutations in the epidermal growth factor\nreceptor (EGFR) gene. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase\ninhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC\npatients with activating and T790M resistance EGFR mutations. Despite its\nestablished efficacy, drug resistance poses a significant challenge for\npatients to fully benefit from osimertinib. The absence of a standard tool to\naccurately predict TKI resistance, including that of osimertinib, remains a\ncritical obstacle. To bridge this gap, in this study, we developed an\ninterpretable multimodal machine learning model designed to predict patient\nresistance to osimertinib among late-stage NSCLC patients with activating EGFR\nmutations, achieving a c-index of 0.82 on a multi-institutional dataset. This\nmachine learning model harnesses readily available data routinely collected\nduring patient visits and medical assessments to facilitate precision lung\ncancer management and informed treatment decisions.

Short low growing grass is one of the most ubiquitous and\nproficient examples of natural dew harvesting, owing to its large surface area,\nsmall thermal capacity, structured rough surface and proximity to ground level.\nHere, we provide a closer look at the formation, growth, and dynamics of\nmicroscale dew droplets on the surface of wheatgrass leaves, investigating the\nrole of epicuticular wax. The wheatgrass leaf exhibits biphilic properties\nemerging from the hydrophilic lamina covered by hydrophobic wax\nmicrosculptures. As a result, the regulation of the dew formation and\ncondensation dynamics is largely governed by the arrangement and density of\nepicuticular wax micromorphologies. At moderate subcooling levels (4-10\n$^{\\circ}$C below the dew point), we observe drop-wise condensation on the\nsuperhydrophobic adaxial side, while significant flooding and film condensation\nusually appear on abaxial surfaces with lower wax coverage. On the adaxial side\nof the leaves, the fairly uniform coverage of the hydrophobic epicuticular wax\ncrystals on the hydrophilic background promotes drop-wise condensation\nnucleation while facilitating droplet mobility. Frequent coalescence of\nmultiple droplets of 5 - 20 ${\\mu}$m diameter results in self-propelled\ndeparture events, creating free potential sites for new nucleation. The\nfindings of this study advance our understanding of dew formation on natural\nsurfaces while providing inspiration and guidance for the development of\nsustainable functional microstructured coatings for various drop-wise\ncondensation applications.",

From the perspective of\npremerger electromagnetic emissions and next-generation gravitational-wave\ndetectors, gravity ($g-$) modes constitute a propitious class. However,\nexisting estimates for their impact employ linear schemes which may be\ninaccurate for large amplitudes, as achieved by tidal resonances. With\nrotation, inertial modes can be excited as well and while their non-linear\nsaturation has been studied, an extension to fully-consistent gravito-inertial\nmodes, especially in the neutron-star context, is an open problem. We study the\nlinear and non-linear saturation of gravito-inertial modes and investigate the\nastrophysical consequences for binary neutron-star mergers, including the\npossibility of resonance-induced dynamo activity. A new (non-)linear\nformulation based on the separation of equilibrium and dynamical tides is\ndeveloped. Implementing this into the 3D pseudo-spectral code MagIC, a suite of\nnon-linear simulations of tidally-excited flows with an entropy/composition\ngradient in a stably-stratified Boussinesq spherical-shell are carried out. The\nnew formulation accurately reproduces results of linear calculations for\ngravito-inertial modes with a free surface for low frequencies. For a\nconstant-density cavity, we show that the axisymmetric differential rotation\ninduced by nonlinear $_2g$ and $_1g$ modes may theoretically be large enough to\namplify an ambient magnetic field to $\\gtrsim 10^{14}$ G. In addition, rich\nnon-linear dynamics are observed in the form of a parametric instability for\nthe $_1g$ mode. The stars are also spun-up, which extends the resonance window\nfor any given mode.",

We first model multiple longitudinal biomarkers, some of\nwhich are subject to limit-of-detection censoring.

We demonstrate the operating characteristics of the\nproposed joint model through simulations and apply it to data from the Study of\nWomen's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) to investigate the impact of the mean\nand variability of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and anti-Mullerian\nhormone (AMH) on age at the final menstrual period (FMP).",

Our results reveal that mm/cm-sized\ngrains are preferentially concentrated within the inner 5-10 au of the disk,\nwhere the dust-to-gas surface density ratio (local metalicity Z) significantly\nexceeds the canonical 0.01, reaching values up to 0.25. This enhancement arises\nfrom the interplay of dust settling and complex gas flows in the meridional\nplane, including midplane accretion streams at early times, midplane expansion\ndriven by magnetically braked surface accretion at later times, and vigorous\nmeridional circulation in spontaneously formed gas rings. The resulting\nsize-dependent dust distribution has a strong spatial variation, with large\ngrains preferentially accumulating in dense rings, particularly in the inner\ndisk, while being depleted in low-density gas gaps. In 3D, these rings and gaps\nare unstable to Rossby wave instability (RWI), generating arc-shaped vortices\nthat stand out more prominently than their gas counterparts in the inner disk\nbecause of preferential dust concentration at small radii. The substantial\nlocal enhancement of the dust relative to the gas could promote planetesimal\nformation via streaming instability, potentially aided by the \"azimuthal drift\"\nstreaming instability (AdSI) that operates efficiently in accreting disks and a\nlower Toomre Q expected in younger disks.

    "abstract": "The primal-dual Douglas-Rachford method is a well-known algorithm to solve\noptimization problems written as convex-concave saddle-point problems. Each\niteration involves solving a linear system involving a linear operator and its\nadjoint.

In this paper, we analyze the\nconvergence of the primal-dual Douglas-Rachford method under the presence of an\nadjoint mismatch. We provide mild conditions that guarantee the existence of a\nfixed point and find an upper bound on the error of the primal solution.\nFurthermore, we establish step sizes in the strongly convex setting that\nguarantee linear convergence under mild conditions. Additionally, we provide an\nalternative method that can also be derived from the Douglas-Rachford method\nand is also guaranteed to converge in this setting.

However, current reinforcement learning (RL) methods only reach the\ncarotid arteries, are not generalizable to other patient vasculatures, and do\nnot consider safety. We propose a safe dual-device RL algorithm that can\nnavigate beyond the carotid arteries to cerebral vessels.\n  Methods: We used the Simulation Open Framework Architecture to represent the\nintricacies of cerebral vessels, and a modified Soft Actor-Critic RL algorithm\nto learn, for the first time, the navigation of micro-catheters and\nmicro-guidewires. We incorporate patient safety metrics into our reward\nfunction by integrating guidewire tip forces. Inverse RL is used with\ndemonstrator data on 12 patient-specific vascular cases.\n  Results: Our simulation demonstrates successful autonomous navigation within\nunseen cerebral vessels, achieving a 96% success rate, 7.0s procedure time, and\n0.24 N mean forces, well below the proposed 1.5 N vessel rupture threshold.\n  Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, our proposed autonomous system for\nMT two-device navigation reaches cerebral vessels, considers safety, and is\ngeneralizable to unseen patient-specific cases for the first time.

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) offers significant diagnostic potential\nbut is inherently constrained by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While\nincreasing the main magnetic field strength B_0 is theoretically linked to\nincreased SNR, practically obtained gains in SNR from B07/4 to B0 depending on\nthe domination of thermal noise at high B0, are not always realized. Especially\nin clinical settings the maximum reachable SNR is further constrained by the\ntotal available acquisition time (TA) and the regulatory limits on maximum\ntolerable specific absorption rate (SAR). This work attempts to derive\nmathematical expressions that enable systematical analysis of the theoretical\nachievable SNR-gain. One important notion is this context is the SNR gain per\nunit of measurement time as a function of the main magnetic field B0 strengths\nin the case of single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) pulse sequences. Our findings\nindicate that under given fixed total amount of (patient acceptable)\nmeasurement time TA, and maximum tolerable SAR limitation, together with\nconditions that ensure the adiabaticity of specific sequences, further\nincreasing B0 does not further improve SNR per unit of measurement time. Key\nfactors were identified, including RF-pulse bandwidth scaling with B0 and\nlongitudinal relaxation time (T1) dependencies, impact the net gain as well.\nOur theoretical analysis emphasizes critical considerations for optimizing SNR\nper unit time in clinical MRS, even challenging the presumption that higher\nmagnetic fields B0 always yield improved SNR per time unit of measurement time\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Hermite processes are paradigmatic examples of stochastic processes which can\nbelong to any Wiener chaos of an arbitrary order; the wellknown fractional\nBrownian motion belonging to the Gaussian first order Wiener chaos and the\nRosenblatt process belonging to the non-Gaussian second order Wiener chaos are\ntwo particular cases of them. Except these two particular cases no simulation\nmethod for sample paths of Hermite processes is available so far. The goal of\nour article is to introduce a new method which potentially allows to simulate\nsample paths of any Hermite process and even those of any generalized Hermite\nprocess. Our starting point is the representation for the latter process as\nrandom wavelet-typeseries, obtained in our very recent paper [3]. We construct\nfrom it a \"concrete\" sequence of piecewise linear continuous random functions\nwhich almost surely approximate sample paths of this process for the uniform\nnorm on any compact interval, and we provide an almost sure estimate of the\napproximation error. Then, for the Rosenblatt process and more importantly for\nthe third order Hermite process, we propose algorithms allowing to implement\nthis sequence and we illustrate them by several simulations. Python routines\nimplementing these synthesis procedures are available upon request.",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) methods allow training models to\nclassify images and localize ROIs. WSOL only requires low-cost image-class\nannotations yet provides a visually interpretable classifier. Standard WSOL\nmethods rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods to produce spatial\nlocalization maps according to a single- or two-step strategy. While both\nstrategies have made significant progress, they still face several limitations\nwith histology images. Single-step methods can easily result in under- or\nover-activation due to the limited visual ROI saliency in histology images and\nscarce localization cues. They also face the well-known issue of asynchronous\nconvergence between classification and localization tasks. The two-step\napproach is sub-optimal because it is constrained to a frozen classifier,\nlimiting the capacity for localization. Moreover, these methods also struggle\nwhen applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. In this paper, a multi-task\napproach for WSOL is introduced for simultaneous training of both tasks to\naddress the asynchronous convergence problem. In particular, localization is\nperformed in the pixel-feature space of an image encoder that is shared with\nclassification. This allows learning discriminant features and accurate\ndelineation of foreground/background regions to support ROI localization and\nimage classification. We propose PixelCAM, a cost-effective\nforeground/background pixel-wise classifier in the pixel-feature space that\nallows for spatial object localization. Using partial-cross entropy, PixelCAM\nis trained using pixel pseudo-labels collected from a pretrained WSOL model.\nBoth image and pixel-wise classifiers are trained simultaneously using standard\ngradient descent. In addition, our pixel classifier can easily be integrated\ninto CNN- and transformer-based architectures without any modifications.",

CTSketch uses two techniques to improve the\nscalability of neurosymbolic inference: decompose the symbolic program into\nsub-programs and summarize each sub-program with a sketched tensor. This\nstrategy allows us to approximate the output distribution of the program with\nsimple tensor operations over the input distributions and summaries. We provide\ntheoretical insight into the maximum error of the approximation. Furthermore,\nwe evaluate CTSketch on many benchmarks from the neurosymbolic literature,\nincluding some designed for evaluating scalability.

    "abstract": "Image registration is fundamental in medical imaging, enabling precise\nalignment of anatomical structures for diagnosis, treatment planning,\nimage-guided interventions, and longitudinal monitoring. This work introduces\nIMPACT (Image Metric with Pretrained model-Agnostic Comparison for\nTransmodality registration), a novel similarity metric designed for robust\nmultimodal image registration. Rather than relying on raw intensities,\nhandcrafted descriptors, or task-specific training, IMPACT defines a semantic\nsimilarity measure based on the comparison of deep features extracted from\nlarge-scale pretrained segmentation models. By leveraging representations from\nmodels such as TotalSegmentator, Segment Anything (SAM), and other foundation\nnetworks, IMPACT provides a task-agnostic, training-free solution that\ngeneralizes across imaging modalities. These features, originally trained for\nsegmentation, offer strong spatial correspondence and semantic alignment\ncapabilities, making them naturally suited for registration. The method\nintegrates seamlessly into both algorithmic (Elastix) and learning-based\n(VoxelMorph) frameworks, leveraging the strengths of each. IMPACT was evaluated\non five challenging 3D registration tasks involving thoracic CT/CBCT and pelvic\nMR/CT datasets. Quantitative metrics, including Target Registration Error and\nDice Similarity Coefficient, demonstrated consistent improvements in anatomical\nalignment over baseline methods. Qualitative analyses further highlighted the\nrobustness of the proposed metric in the presence of noise, artifacts, and\nmodality variations. With its versatility, efficiency, and strong performance\nacross diverse tasks, IMPACT offers a powerful solution for advancing\nmultimodal image registration in both clinical and research settings.",

    "abstract": "Most of the modeling approaches used to understand organizational worker\nmobility are highly stylized, using idealizations such as structureless\norganizations, indistinguishable workers, and a lack of social bonding of the\nworkers. In this article, aided by a decade of precise, temporally resolved\ndata of a large civilian organization of the US Army in which employees can\nchange jobs in a similar way to many private organizations, we introduce a new\nframework to describe organizations as composites of teams within which\nindividuals perform specific tasks and where social connections develop. By\ntracking the personnel composition of organizational teams, we find that\nworkers who change jobs are highly influenced by preferring to reunite with\npast coworkers. In this organization, 34% of all moves across temporally stable\nteams (and 32% of the totality of moves) lead to worker reunions, percentages\nthat have not been reported and are well-above intuitive expectation. To assess\nthe importance of worker reunions in determining job moves, we compare them to\nlabor supply and demand with or without occupational specialization. The\ncomparison shows that the most consistent information about job change is\nprovided by reunions. We find that the greater the time workers spend together\nor the smaller the team they share both increase their likelihood to reunite,\nsupporting the notion of increased familiarity and trust behind such reunions\nand the dominant role of social capital in the evolution of large\norganizations. Our study of this organization supports the idea that to\ncorrectly forecast job mobility inside large organizations, their teams\nstructures and the social ties formed in those teams play a key role in shaping\ninternal job change.",

To address this gap, we present\nTeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset\nspecifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is\nconstructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample\ngeneration using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call\nrecordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency\nthrough text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via\nlarge language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR\noutputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that\nsimulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and\nfraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed\nspeech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The\ndataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection,\nfraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a\nstandardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances\nfrom the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on\ntelecom fraud detection tasks.

GT incorporates watershed topology using\nLaplacian positional encoders (PEs) and attention mechanisms. The developed GT\nmodel has an AUC-ROC (0.9739), slightly lower than XGBoost (0.9853).

Feature importance revealed a striking\nconsistency across models, with elevation, slope, distance to channel, and\nconvergence index being the critical factors. Dimensionality reduction on\nLaplacian PEs revealed partial clusters, indicating they could capture spatial\ninformation; however, their importance was lower than flood factors.

Many existing\ndeep-learning-based methods for analyzing colonoscopic videos either require\ntask-specific fine-tuning, lack tracking capabilities, or rely on\ndomain-specific pre-training. In this paper, we introduce PolypSegTrack, a\nnovel foundation model that jointly addresses polyp detection, segmentation,\nclassification and unsupervised tracking in colonoscopic videos. Our approach\nleverages a novel conditional mask loss, enabling flexible training across\ndatasets with either pixel-level segmentation masks or bounding box\nannotations, allowing us to bypass task-specific fine-tuning. Our unsupervised\ntracking module reliably associates polyp instances across frames using object\nqueries, without relying on any heuristics. We leverage a robust vision\nfoundation model backbone that is pre-trained unsupervisedly on natural images,\nthereby removing the need for domain-specific pre-training. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple polyp benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in detection,\nsegmentation, classification, and tracking.",

The solutions obtained\nby CG are continuous relaxations, which cannot be practically used as feasible\n0-1 solutions. In this paper, we propose a postprocessing method for\nconstructing feasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained\nthrough CG. The proposed technique consists of two phases: (i) mapping the\ncontinuous CG solution to a feasible 0-1 solution and (ii) applying a\nconstraint-aware local search to improve that solution's quality. Numerical\nexperiments on randomly generated problems demonstrate that CG with the\nproposed postprocessing yields solutions comparable to commercial solvers with\nsignificantly reduced computation time.

    "abstract": "Some of the most challenging problems in Timaeus' cosmology arise from the\ngeometry of a universe without any void. On the one hand, the universe is\nspherical in shape; on the other hand, it must be entirely filled with the four\nbasic particles that make up all bodies in the universe, each shaped like one\nof four regular polyhedra (cubes, tetrahedra, octahedra and icosahedra). The\nfaces of all these particles are composed of right triangles. However, this\nleads to two mathematical impossibilities. 1. Obtaining a spherical surface\nfrom linear surfaces, as it is impossible to create a circle from straight\nlines. 2. Obtaining a complete tiling of a sphere using regular polyhedra,\nwithout any voids or intersections between these polyhedra. The first problem\nis addressed in another article slated for publication. In the present one, our\nfocus will be on the second problem, for which we will present a solution\nwithin the framework of Timaeus' cosmology. The crux of this solution lies in a\nfeature of Timaeus' universe that sets it apart from almost all ancient\ncosmologies. Instead of being composed of rigid parts, it is a dynamic living\nbody in which all basic components are in constant motion, continuously\nundergoing both destruction and reconstruction. In the first part, we examine\nthe main features of Timaeus' cosmology relevant to our issue. In the second\npart, we analyze the paradox in details and its consequences for Timaeus'\ncosmology. We then discuss the common 'solutions' and highlight their\nshortcomings. Finally, we propose a solution that we believe is consistent with\nPlato's text and independent of the choice of the major schools of\ninterpretation of the Timaeus.",

We further\ninvestigate various fine-tuning configurations and tasks to clarify the\ntrade-offs between data scale and training efficiency, verify that the model\nretains its general capabilities without significant catastrophic forgetting\nafter training, and explore the distillation benefits to other LRLs on SLMs\n(Khasi, Assamese, and Ukrainian).

To mitigate double-fading\nattenuation in RIS-aided links, the paradigm of active metamaterials capable of\namplifying their incident wave has emerged. In this paper, capitalizing on the\ninherent negative-resistance region of tunnel diodes, we propose their\nintegration into each RIS unit element to enable RISs with reflection\namplification entirely in the analog domain. We derive novel realistic\nphase-amplitude relationships and power constraints specific to this model,\naddressing gaps in the existing literature where amplitude limits are often\nchosen arbitrarily. This characterization of our active RIS unit elements is\nincorporated into two novel optimization frameworks targeting the spectral\nefficiency maximization of RIS-assisted Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO)\nsystems, which are solved via an one-step approach and an iterative Alternating\nOptimization (AO) method. The former approach is used to initialize the AO\nframework, enhancing both its performance and convergence. Our numerical\ninvestigations emphasize the importance of accurately modeling phase-amplitude\ndependencies, and provide key insights into the impact of RIS-induced noise as\nwell as the trade-off between available power and the number of active\nelements.",

To this end, most of them use regularization\nstrategies to retain knowledge of previous tasks. This reduces the model's\nability to adapt to the data of new tasks (i.e., learning plasticity), which\ncan degrade performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel CSSL method that aims to learn tasks sequentially, while achieving high\nlearning plasticity. To this end, the proposed method uses a knowledge\ndistillation strategy with an integrated decoupling mechanism. The decoupling\nis achieved by first dividing the feature dimensions into task-common and\ntask-specific parts. Then, the task-common features are forced to be correlated\nto ensure memory stability while the task-specific features are forced to be\nde-correlated facilitating the learning of new features. Experimental results\nshow the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to CaSSLe, which is a\nwidely used CSSL framework, with improvements of up to 1.12% in average\naccuracy and 2.33% in intransigence in a task-incremental scenario, and 1.24%\nin average accuracy and 2.01% in intransigence in a class-incremental scenario.",

Three-dimensional digital reconstruction of porous\nmedia presents a fundamental challenge in geoscience, requiring simultaneous\nresolution of fine-scale pore structures while capturing representative\nelementary volumes. We introduce a computational framework that addresses this\nchallenge through latent diffusion models operating within the EDM framework.\nOur approach reduces dimensionality via a custom variational autoencoder\ntrained in binary geological volumes, improving efficiency and also enabling\nthe generation of larger volumes than previously possible with diffusion\nmodels. A key innovation is our controlled unconditional sampling methodology,\nwhich enhances distribution coverage by first sampling target statistics from\ntheir empirical distributions, then generating samples conditioned on these\nvalues. Extensive testing on four distinct rock types demonstrates that\nconditioning on porosity - a readily computable statistic - is sufficient to\nensure a consistent representation of multiple complex properties, including\npermeability, two-point correlation functions, and pore size distributions. The\nframework achieves better generation quality than pixel-space diffusion while\nenabling significantly larger volume reconstruction (256-cube voxels) with\nsubstantially reduced computational requirements, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art for digital rock physics applications.",

Our scheme\ndifferentiates the handover policy for different users by their channel\nconditions compared to a threshold based on Jain's fairness index, in order to\nprioritize handovers for the poorly served users. We present an extensive\nevaluation of the mobile throughput performance of our handover scheme with\nrealistic urban network distributions and UE mobility patterns. Our results\nshow that our scheme significantly outperforms the existing literature\nbenchmarks when considering both channel aging and handover delay cost.\nImportantly, the advantage of UE-centric over network-centric CF-mMIMO, of\nuniformly good performance over the network, is uniquely preserved under\nmobility by our handover scheme. We thus show that CF-mMIMO can be a feasible\narchitecture for practical mobile networks.",

Such events of episodic\naccretion are now considered to be common during low mass star formation,\nwherein the accretion onto the protostar occurs through a surrounding\ncentrifugal disk. Increasing evidence suggests that the magnetic disk winds are\ncrucial for driving disk accretion, as they carry both mass and momentum away\nfrom the disk. Aims. We aim to investigate the phenomenon of the ejection of\nmagnetic disk winds during episodic accretion, with a focus on the dust\ncontained within these winds. Methods. We conduct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations of formation and evolution of protoplanetary disk (PPD) in the\nthin-disk limit. We include evolution of dust with two populations and a\nrealistic prescription for viscosity during outbursts, which depends on the\nlocal thermal ionization fraction. The disk evolves with the concurrent action\nof viscosity, self-gravity and magnetic disk winds. Results. The simulated disk\ndisplays outbursting behavior in the early stages, with the duration and\nfrequency of the bursts, their rise times, and brightness amplitudes resembling\nthe observations of FUors. We find that during the outbursts, the winds are\nover an order of magnitude more dusty, as compared to in quiescence. However,\ndespite this increased dust content, the winds are still dust-depleted as the\ndust-to-gas ratio is about an order of magnitude lower than the canonical\ninterstellar value of 0.01. The results of our numerical experiments are in\ngeneral agreement with the available observational findings and they shed a\nlight on the mechanism behind production of dusty winds during outbursting\nevents in YSOs.",

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks have gained prominence within\nartificial intelligence research due to their potential application in fields\nlike home assistants. Many contemporary VLN approaches, while based on\ntransformer architectures, have increasingly incorporated additional components\nsuch as external knowledge bases or map information to enhance performance.\nThese additions, while boosting performance, also lead to larger models and\nincreased computational costs. In this paper, to achieve both high performance\nand low computational costs, we propose a novel architecture with the\nCOmbination of Selective MemOrization (COSMO). Specifically, COSMO integrates\nstate-space modules and transformer modules, and incorporates two\nVLN-customized selective state space modules: the Round Selective Scan (RSS)\nand the Cross-modal Selective State Space Module (CS3). RSS facilitates\ncomprehensive inter-modal interactions within a single scan, while the CS3\nmodule adapts the selective state space module into a dual-stream architecture,\nthereby enhancing the acquisition of cross-modal interactions. Experimental\nvalidations on three mainstream VLN benchmarks, REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE, not\nonly demonstrate competitive navigation performance of our model but also show\na significant reduction in computational costs.",

Consequently, the computational\ncost associated with this technique is much lower compared to standard SVD.\nAdditionally, for the analysis of full n-dimensional datasets, the method\nreduces data dimensionality by selecting a strategically reduced number of\npoints from the original dataset through optimal sensor placement or uniform\nsampling before performing SVD. Moreover, the properties of data assimilation\nof heterogeneous databases of this method are illustrated using two distinct\nreactive flow test cases: a numerical database modeling an axisymmetric,\ntime-varying laminar coflow flame with a fuel mixture of 65% methane and 35%\nnitrogen, using air as the oxidizer, and experimental data generated from a\nturbulent bluff-body-stabilized hydrogen flame. The computational speed-up and\nmemory gains associated with the lcSVD algorithm compared to SVD can reach\nvalues larger than 10, with compression factors greater than 2000. Applying\nlcSVD for data assimilation to reconstruct the flow dynamics combining data\nfrom sensors with simulation measurements, we found errors smaller than 1% in\nthe most relevant species modelling the flow.",

As accelerators are vulnerable to\nhardware faults due to aging, variation, etc, existing accelerator designs\noften reserve a large voltage margin or leverage algorithm-based fault\ntolerance (ABFT) techniques to ensure LLM inference correctness. However,\nprevious methods often overlook the inherent fault tolerance of LLMs, leading\nto high computation and energy overhead. To enable reliable yet efficient LLM\ninference, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm/circuit co-design\nframework, dubbed ReaLM. For the first time, we systematically characterize the\nfault tolerance of LLMs by performing a large-scale error injection study of\nrepresentative LLMs and natural language understanding tasks. Then, we propose\na statistical ABFT algorithm that fully leverages the error robustness to\nminimize error recovery as much as possible. We also customize the error\ndetection circuits to enable a low-cost online collection of error statistics.\nExtensive experiments show that with only 1.42% circuit area and 1.79% power\noverhead, our ReaLM can reduce perplexity degradation from 18.54 to 0.29.\nCompared to existing methods, ReaLM consistently reduces recovery costs across\ndifferent operating voltages and improves energy efficiency by up to 35.83%\nwithout compromising LLM performance.

It offers the opportunity for a timely,\ncost-effective and staged construction of a new collider that will be able to\ncomprehensively map the Higgs boson's properties, including the Higgs field\npotential, thanks to a large span in centre-of-mass energies and polarised\nbeams. A comprehensive programme to study the Higgs boson and its closest\nrelatives with high precision requires data at centre-of-mass energies from the\nZ pole to at least 1 TeV. It should include measurements of the Higgs boson in\nboth major production mechanisms, ee -> ZH and ee -> vvH, precision\nmeasurements of gauge boson interactions as well as of the W boson, Higgs boson\nand top-quark masses, measurement of the top-quark Yukawa coupling through ee\n->ttH, measurement of the Higgs boson self-coupling through HH production, and\nprecision measurements of the electroweak couplings of the top quark. In\naddition, ee collisions offer discovery potential for new particles\ncomplementary to HL-LHC.",

    "abstract": "We propose a surge sourcing approach to address occasional synchronous high\ndemand (surge demand) in sharing economy systems, providing a\nsocio-economically progressive alternative to surge pricing. Instead of\nsuppressing demand among disadvantaged consumers, our scheme increases supply\nby involving privileged consumer-providers (prosumers) who under-utilize their\nresources. This hybrid supply approach maintains high quality-of-service (QoS)\nfor both consumers and prosumers in both normal and surge demand situations\nwithout surge pricing. To ensure prosumer QoS, we reserve a small portion of\nthe primary supply to meet their needs if their resources become unavailable\nduring surge periods. As the probability of such events is low compared to that\nof the surge demand itself, the reserved resources required are minimal. The\nresulting scheme is resource-efficient, socially progressive, and sustainable,\nexploiting under-used resources. We illustrate our scheme through two\napplications: high-range car sharing for owners of small EVs, and shared\ncharging points for EV drivers.",

This survey provides a focused review of the architectures,\ndesign, benchmarks, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding\nLLM-based scientific agents.

    "abstract": "Understanding the coherent properties of electron spins driven by electric\nfields is crucial for their potential application in quantum-coherent\nnanoscience. In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in\nelectric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single\norbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage\nmodulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master\nequation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two\ndistinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity,\nelectron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven\nmechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold\nspin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity\ndrives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum\nspin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin\naccumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin\nresonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which\ndriving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing\nquantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the potential of near-term quantum algorithms for solving\npartial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on a linear one-dimensional\nadvection-diffusion equation as a test case. This study benchmarks a\nground-state algorithm, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), against three\nleading quantum dynamics algorithms, Trotterization, Variational Quantum\nImaginary Time Evolution (VarQTE), and Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics\nSimulation (AVQDS), applied to the same PDE on small quantum hardware. While\nTrotterization is fully quantum, VarQTE and AVQDS are variational algorithms\nthat reduce circuit depth for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.\nHowever, hardware results from these dynamics methods show sizable errors due\nto noise and limited shot statistics. To establish a noise-free performance\nbaseline, we implement the VQE-based solver on a noiseless statevector\nsimulator. Our results show VQE can reach final-time infidelities as low as\n${O}(10^{-9})$ with $N=4$ qubits and moderate circuit depths, outperforming\nhardware-deployed dynamics methods that show infidelities $\\gtrsim 10^{-1}$.

    "abstract": "Effective risk monitoring in dynamic environments such as disaster zones\nrequires an adaptive exploration strategy to detect hidden threats. We propose\na bi-level unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitoring strategy that efficiently\nintegrates high-level route optimization with low-level path planning for known\nand unknown hazards. At the high level, we formulate the route optimization as\na vehicle routing problem (VRP) to determine the optimal sequence for visiting\nknown hazard locations. To strategically incorporate exploration efficiency, we\nintroduce an edge-based centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT), which refines\nbaseline routes using pseudo-nodes and allocates path budgets based on the\nUAV's battery capacity using a line segment Voronoi diagram. At the low level,\npath planning maximizes information gain within the allocated path budget by\ngenerating kinematically feasible B-spline trajectories. Bayesian inference is\napplied to dynamically update hazard probabilities, enabling the UAVs to\nprioritize unexplored regions. Simulation results demonstrate that edge-based\nCVT improves spatial coverage and route uniformity compared to the node-based\nmethod. Additionally, our optimized path planning consistently outperforms\nbaselines in hazard discovery rates across a diverse set of scenarios.",

However, ODMR\nsignal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no\nvisible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters.

Accurate photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation is crucial for\ncosmological and galaxy evolution studies, especially with the advent of\nlarge-scale photometric surveys.\n  Aims. We develop a photo-z estimation code called TOPz (Tartu Observatory\nPhoto-z) and apply it to the GAMA photometric catalogue.\n  Methods. TOPz employs a Bayesian template-fitting approach to estimate\nphoto-z from marginalised redshift posteriors. Using nine-band photometric data\nfrom the GAMA project, we assess the accuracy of TOPz by comparing its photo-z\nestimates to available spectroscopic redshifts. We generate synthetic galaxy\nspectra using the CIGALE software and run template set optimisation. We improve\nthe photometry by applying flux and flux uncertainty corrections. An analytical\nprior is then imposed on the resulting posteriors to refine the redshift\nestimates.\n  Results. The photo-z estimates produced by TOPz show good agreement with the\nspectroscopic redshifts. We demonstrate the redshift accuracy across various\nmagnitude bins and test how the flux corrections and posteriors reflect the\nactual uncertainty of the estimates. We show that the TOPz results are\nconsistent with those obtained from other photo-z codes applied to the same\ndata set. Additionally, TOPz estimates stellar masses as a by-product,\ncomparable to those calculated by other methods. We made the GAMA photo-z\ncatalogue and all the codes and scripts used for the analysis and figures\npublicly available.\n  Conclusions. TOPz is an advanced photo-z estimation code that integrates flux\ncorrections, physical priors, and template set optimisation to provide\nstate-of-the-art photo-z among competing template-based redshift estimators.\nFuture work will focus on incorporating additional photometric data and\napplying the TOPz algorithm to J-PAS narrow-band survey, further validating and\nenhancing its capabilities.",

We establish the existence of a critical threshold\nfunction $\\Phi(s,q,\\{\\delta_j\\}_{j=1}^n)$ that completely characterizes the\nboundary between global regularity and potential singularity formation, with\nexplicit asymptotics as $s$ approaches the critical value $1/2$. This paper\nfurther provides a rigorous geometric characterization of potential singular\nstructures through refined multi-fractal analysis, showing that any singular\nset must have Hausdorff dimension bounded by $1 - \\sum_{j=1}^n\n\\frac{\\delta_j}{1+\\delta_j} \\cdot \\frac{1}{j+1}$. Our results constitute a\nsignificant advancement toward resolving the global regularity question for the\nNavier-Stokes equations, as we demonstrate that with properly calibrated\nsequences of nested logarithmic improvements, the gap to the critical case can\nbe systematically reduced.",

This\npaper proposes a pioneering framework of high-quality online instruction data\nmining for instruction tuning, focusing on the impact of prompt's robustness on\nthe data mining process. Our notable innovation, is to generate the adversarial\ninstruction data by conducting the attack for the prompt of online instruction\ndata.

It involves identifying pieces of text that deviate in some way\nfrom previously known information. However, novelty is also a crucial\ndeterminant of the unique perception of relevance and quality of an experience,\nas it rests upon each individual's understanding of the world. Social factors,\nparticularly cultural background, profoundly influence perceptions of novelty\nand innovation. Cultural novelty arises from differences in salience and\nnovelty as shaped by the distance between distinct communities. While cultural\ndiversity has garnered increasing attention in artificial intelligence (AI),\nthe lack of robust metrics for quantifying cultural novelty hinders a deeper\nunderstanding of these divergences. This gap limits quantifying and\nunderstanding cultural differences within computational frameworks. To address\nthis, we propose an interdisciplinary framework that integrates knowledge from\nsociology and management. Central to our approach is GlobalFusion, a novel\ndataset comprising 500 dishes and approximately 100,000 cooking recipes\ncapturing cultural adaptation from over 150 countries. By introducing a set of\nJensen-Shannon Divergence metrics for novelty, we leverage this dataset to\nanalyze textual divergences when recipes from one community are modified by\nanother with a different cultural background.

We show that the posterior distribution differs from the prior on\na finite-dimensional subspace, and construct low-rank approximations to the\nposterior covariance, while keeping the mean fixed. Since in infinite\ndimensions, not all low-rank covariance approximations yield approximate\nposterior distributions which are equivalent to the posterior and prior\ndistribution, we characterise the low-rank covariance approximations which do\nyield this equivalence, and their respective inverses, or `precisions'.

In this paper, we\nbuild on recent advances in information theory to mathematically prove and\nempirically demonstrate that such single-score summaries do not and cannot give\nthe complete picture of a system's true performance.

These strong inductive\nbiases or ground truth 3D information help in domains where data is sparse but\nlimit scalability and generalization in data rich regimes.

    "abstract": "Key-Value cache (\\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache}) compression has emerged as a\npromising technique to optimize Large Language Model (LLM) serving. It\nprimarily decreases the memory consumption of \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} to\nreduce the computation cost. Despite the development of many compression\nalgorithms, their applications in production environments are still not\nprevalent. In this paper, we revisit mainstream \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache}\ncompression solutions from a practical perspective. Our contributions are\nthree-fold. First, we comprehensively review existing algorithmic designs and\nbenchmark studies for \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression and identify\nmissing pieces in their performance measurement, which could hinder their\nadoption in practice. Second, we empirically evaluate representative\n\\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression methods to uncover two key issues that\naffect the computational efficiency: (1) while compressing \\texttt{KV}\n\\texttt{cache} can reduce memory consumption, current implementations (e.g.,\nFlashAttention, PagedAttention) do not optimize for production-level LLM\nserving, resulting in suboptimal throughput performance; (2) compressing\n\\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} may lead to longer outputs, resulting in increased\nend-to-end latency. We further investigate the accuracy performance of\nindividual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic\nlimitations in \\texttt{KV} \\texttt{cache} compression when handling specific\nLLM tasks. Third, we provide tools to shed light on future \\texttt{KV}\n\\texttt{cache} compression studies and facilitate their practical deployment in\nproduction.

Our methodology\nemploys two state-of-the-art language models to generate interaction data and\nimplements Intent-Aware Prompting (IAP) to detect malicious AI Assistants. The\nfindings reveal that malicious AI Assistants employ domain-specific\npersona-tailored manipulation strategies, exploiting simulated users'\nvulnerabilities and emotional triggers. In particular, simulated users\ndemonstrate resistance to manipulation initially, but become increasingly\nvulnerable to malicious AI Assistants as the depth of the interaction\nincreases, highlighting the significant risks associated with extended\nengagement with potentially manipulative systems. IAP detection methods achieve\nhigh precision with zero false positives but struggle to detect many malicious\nAI Assistants, resulting in high false negative rates.

Class Activation Mapping (CAM) techniques have emerged\nas a key approach toward visualizing model decisions, yet existing methods face\ninherent trade-offs. Gradient-based CAM variants suffer from sensitivity to\ngradient perturbations due to gradient noise, leading to unstable and\nunreliable explanations. Conversely, gradient-free approaches mitigate gradient\ninstability but incur significant computational overhead and inference latency.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a Cluster Filter Class Activation Map\n(CF-CAM) technique, a novel framework that reintroduces gradient-based\nweighting while enhancing robustness against gradient noise.

During LGD-estimation, realised recovery cash flows are to\nbe discounted at an appropriate rate. Regulatory guidance mandates that this\nrate should allow for the time value of money, as well as include a risk\npremium that reflects the \"undiversifiable risk\" within these recoveries.\nHaving extensively reviewed earlier methods of determining this rate, we\npropose a new approach that is inspired by the cost of capital approach from\nthe Solvency II regulatory regime. Our method involves estimating a\nmarket-consistent price for a portfolio of defaulted loans, from which an\nassociated discount rate may be inferred.

    "abstract": "A rollup network is a type of popular \"Layer 2\" scaling solution for general\npurpose \"Layer 1\" blockchains like Ethereum. Rollups networks separate\nexecution of transactions from other aspects like consensus, processing\ntransactions off of the Layer 1, and posting the data onto the underlying layer\nfor security. While rollups offer significant scalability advantages, they\noften rely on centralized operators for transaction ordering and inclusion,\nwhich also introduces potential risks. If the operator fails to build rollup\nblocks or propose new state roots to the underlying Layer 1, users may lose\naccess to digital assets on the rollup. An escape hatch allows users to bypass\nthe failing operator and withdraw assets directly on the Layer 1. We propose\nusing a time-based trigger, Merkle proofs, and new resolver contracts to\nimplement a practical escape hatch for these networks. The use of novel\nresolver contracts allow user owned assets to be located in the Layer 2 state\nroot, including those owned by smart contracts, in order to allow users to\nescape them. This design ensures safe and verifiable escape of assets,\nincluding ETH, ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, and more, from the Layer 2.",

    "abstract": "Rust is gaining popularity for its well-known memory safety guarantees and\nhigh performance, distinguishing it from C/C++ and JVM-based languages. Its\ncompiler, rustc, enforces these guarantees through specialized mechanisms such\nas trait solving, borrow checking, and specific optimizations. However, Rust's\nunique language mechanisms introduce complexity to its compiler, leading to\nRust-specific compiler bugs that are less common in traditional compilers. With\nRust's increasing adoption in safety-critical domains, understanding these\nlanguage mechanisms and their impact on compiler bugs is essential for\nimproving the reliability of both rustc and Rust programs. Yet, we still lack a\nlarge-scale, detailed, and in-depth study of Rust-specific bugs in rustc.\n  To bridge this gap, this work conducts a comprehensive and systematic study\nof Rust-specific bugs in rustc, with a particular focus on the components that\nsupport its unique language features. Our analysis examines issues and fixes\nreported between 2022 and 2024, with a manual review of 301 valid issues. We\ncategorize these bugs based on their causes, symptoms, affected compilation\nstages, and test case characteristics. Additionally, we evaluate existing rustc\ntesting tools to assess their effectiveness and limitations. Our key findings\ninclude: (1) rustc bugs primarily arise from Rust's type system and lifetime\nmodel, with frequent errors in the High-Level Intermediate Representation (HIR)\nand Mid-Level Intermediate Representation (MIR) modules due to complex checkers\nand optimizations; (2) bug-revealing test cases often involve unstable\nfeatures, advanced trait usages, lifetime annotations, standard APIs, and\nspecific optimization levels; (3) while both valid and invalid programs can\ntrigger bugs, existing testing tools struggle to detect non-crash errors,\nunderscoring the need for further advancements in rustc testing.",

Most studies so far have been devoted to the quantum\ntreatment of electronic structure and only a few were directed to the quantum\ntreatment of vibrational structure, which at the moment remains not devoid of\nunknowns. In particular, we address here a formal problem that arises when\nsimulating a vibrational model under harmonic second quantization, whereby the\ndisruption of the closure relation (resolution of the identity) -- which occurs\nwhen truncating the infinite bosonic basis set -- may have some serious effects\nas regards the correct evaluation of Hamiltonian matrix elements. This relates\nintimately to the normal ordering of products of ladder operators.

The purpose of this article is to\nconsider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of\nthe network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced\nby this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the\nlimit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an\nexact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given\nenergy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps\nbetween inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random\nMLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But\nwe also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation\nfunctions, including $\\tanh, \\sin, \\text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities.

    "abstract": "Accurate evaluation of forecasting models is essential for ensuring reliable\npredictions. Current practices for evaluating and comparing forecasting models\nfocus on summarising performance into a single score, using metrics such as\nSMAPE. While convenient, averaging performance over all samples dilutes\nrelevant information about model behavior under varying conditions. This\nlimitation is especially problematic for time series forecasting, where\nmultiple layers of averaging--across time steps, horizons, and multiple time\nseries in a dataset--can mask relevant performance variations. We address this\nlimitation by proposing ModelRadar, a framework for evaluating univariate time\nseries forecasting models across multiple aspects, such as stationarity,\npresence of anomalies, or forecasting horizons. We demonstrate the advantages\nof this framework by comparing 24 forecasting methods, including classical\napproaches and different machine learning algorithms. NHITS, a state-of-the-art\nneural network architecture, performs best overall but its superiority varies\nwith forecasting conditions. For instance, concerning the forecasting horizon,\nwe found that NHITS (and also other neural networks) only outperforms classical\napproaches for multi-step ahead forecasting. Another relevant insight is that\nclassical approaches such as ETS or Theta are notably more robust in the\npresence of anomalies. These and other findings highlight the importance of\naspect-based model evaluation for both practitioners and researchers.\nModelRadar is available as a Python package.",

Given a graft $(G, T)$, a minimum join $F$, and a\nspecified vertex $r$ called the root, the distance components of $(G, T)$ are\ndefined as subgraphs of $G$ determined by the distances induced by $F$. A\ndistance component is called {\\em capital} if it contains the root; otherwise,\nit is called {\\em decapital}. In our first paper, we investigated the canonical\nstructure of capital distance components in bipartite grafts, which can be\ndescribed using the graft analogue of the Kotzig--Lov\\'asz decomposition. In\nthis paper, we provide the counterpart structure for the decapital distance\ncomponents. We also establish a necessary and sufficient condition for two\nvertices $r$ and $r'$ under which a decapital distance component with respect\nto root $r$ is also a decapital distance component with respect to root $r'$.\nAs a consequence, we obtain that the total number of decapital distance\ncomponents in a bipartite graft, taken over all choices of root, is equal to\ntwice the number of edges in a minimum join of the graft.",

    "abstract": "Biological neural systems efficiently learn from delayed rewards despite\nrelying on noisy synaptic transmission and lacking centralized optimization\nmechanisms. In contrast, artificial neural networks trained with reinforcement\nlearning typically rely on backpropagation (BP), which limits their use in\nresource-constrained systems or with non-differentiable components. While\nnoise-based alternatives, like reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL),\nprovide a biologically grounded framework for credit assignment, they struggle\nwith temporal delays and hierarchical processing -key challenges in real-world\nlearning. In this work, we derive a novel noise-based learning rule to address\nthese challenges. Drawing inspiration from biological neural circuits, our\nmethod uses reward prediction errors as its optimization target to generate\nincreasingly advantageous behavior, and incorporates an eligibility trace to\nfacilitate retrospective credit assignment. Its formulation relies on local\ninformation, aligning with biological constraints and enabling neuromorphic\nimplementation. Experimental validation on reinforcement tasks (immediate and\ndelayed rewards) shows our approach significantly outperforms RMHL and achieves\nperformance comparable to BP, although with slower convergence due to its\nnoise-driven updates. While tested on simple architectures, the results\nhighlight the potential of noise-driven, brain-inspired learning for low-power\nadaptive systems, particularly in scenarios where energy efficiency and\nbiological plausibility are a priority. These findings also offer mechanistic\ninsights into how dopamine-like signals and synaptic stochasticity may jointly\nenable learning in biological networks, bridging computational models with\nneurobiological principles.",

Starting from\nthe local spin-density approximation (LSDA) or generalised gradient\napproximation (GGA), we verified either the orbital polarisation (OP)\ncorrection or the GGA+U approach for the U 5f-electrons, changing\nCoulomb-repulsion energies U in the range 0-4 eV. Satisfying agreement was\nachieved between experimental and our calculated magnetic moments using\nab-initio LSDA+OP and non-ab-initio GGA+U approaches, the latter for realistic\nU values of 2-3 eV. We proved by the LSDA+OP approach an existence of the Fermi\nsurface nesting vector along the a axis, possibly responsible for the triplet\nsuperconducting pairing. The calculated data reveal predominantly an itinerant\nU 5f-electron character of bands near the Fermi level, EF, with only small\ncontributions from the U 6d and Ge 4p states. The experimental XPS spectrum of\nvalence bands (VB) also contains the sharp main 5f-electron peak at EF, a wide\nhump (around -2 eV), and broad small peaks at higher energies. In the\ncalculated XPS spectrum, the width of the main 5f-electron peak varies between\n0.8 and 1.4 eV, depending on a method used in computations, but the hump\nremains unresolved. A newly observed asymmetric 1-eV satellite in the\nexperimental 4f-core XPS spectrum together with known 3-eV and 7-eV satellites\nsuggest dual behaviour of U-5f-electrons in UGe$_2$, the feature is inferred\nalso from the VB studies.",

Recent models, such\nas GLaMM and OMG-LLaVA, achieve pixel-level grounding but incur significant\ncomputational costs due to processing a large number of visual tokens. Existing\ntoken pruning methods, like FastV and PyramidDrop, fail to preserve the local\nvisual features critical for accurate grounding, leading to substantial\nperformance drops in GCG tasks. To address this, we propose Adaptive\nLocal-Aware Token Pruning (ALTP), a simple yet effective framework that\naccelerates GCG models by prioritizing local object information. ALTP\nintroduces two key components: (1) Detail Density Capture (DDC), which uses\nsuperpixel segmentation to retain tokens in object-centric regions, preserving\nfine-grained details, and (2) Dynamic Density Formation (DDF), which\ndynamically allocates tokens based on information density, ensuring higher\nretention in semantically rich areas. Extensive experiments on the GranDf\ndataset demonstrate that ALTP significantly outperforms existing token pruning\nmethods, such as FastV and PyramidDrop, on both GLaMM and OMG-LLaVA models.\nNotably, when applied to GLaMM, ALTP achieves a 90% reduction in visual tokens\nwith a 4.9% improvement in AP50 and a 5.0% improvement in Recall compared to\nPyramidDrop. Similarly, on OMG-LLaVA, ALTP improves AP by 2.1% and mIOU by 3.0%\nat a 90% token reduction compared with PDrop.",

However, processing a large number of visual\ntokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational\noverhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address\nthis critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression\nmethod aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically\ninvestigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the\nattention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable\nredundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these\ntokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context\ngeneration. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation\nwindow for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,\nfocusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced\nmulti-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs.

However, when extracting infinite-volume\nscattering parameters from finite-volume energy levels, the traditional\nL\\\"uscher formula encounters limitations due to the left-hand cut induced by\nlong-range interactions such as the one-pion exchange. In this work, we propose\nan alternative approach based on chiral effective field theory combined with a\nHamiltonian method in the plane wave basis. By solving a Schr\\\"odinger-like\nequation in the finite volume, our method connects the finite-volume energy\nspectrum with infinite-volume observables, while systematically incorporating\nthe long-range physics and solving the left-hand cut problem. The use of the\nplane wave basis mitigates issues related to partial wave mixing. Our numerical\nresults for $DD^*$ scattering at $m_\\pi \\approx$ 280 MeV demonstrate that this\napproach overcomes the limitations of the L\\\"uscher method and points towards a\nresonance interpretation of the $T_{cc}(3875)$ state, as opposed to the virtual\nstate predicted by traditional analyses.",

Quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA)\nprovide a promising methodology for solving this problem by exploiting the\nparallelism of quantum entanglement. However, existing QAOA approaches based on\npenalty-term or Hamiltonian simulation fail to thoroughly encode the\nconstraints, leading to extremely low success rate and long searching latency.\n  This paper proposes Choco-Q, a formal and universal framework for constrained\nbinary optimization problems, which comprehensively covers all constraints and\nexhibits high deployability for current quantum devices. The main innovation of\nChoco-Q is to embed the commute Hamiltonian as the driver Hamiltonian,\nresulting in a much more general encoding formulation that can deal with\narbitrary linear constraints. Leveraging the arithmetic features of commute\nHamiltonian, we propose three optimization techniques to squeeze the overall\ncircuit complexity, including Hamiltonian serialization, equivalent\ndecomposition, and variable elimination. The serialization mechanism transforms\nthe original Hamiltonian into smaller ones. Our decomposition methods only take\nlinear time complexity, achieving end-to-end acceleration.

However, Shor has provided its polynomial-time algorithm on quantum\ncomputers. Nevertheless, there are only few examples simulating quantum\ncircuits that operate on general pairs of modulo $p$ and order $q$. In this\npaper, we constructed such quantum circuits and solved DLPs for all 1,860\npossible pairs of $p$ and $q$ up to 32 qubits using a quantum simulator with\nPRIMEHPC FX700. From this, we obtained and verified values of the success\nprobabilities, which had previously been heuristically analyzed by Eker\\r{a}.\nAs a result, the detailed waveform shape of the success probability of Shor's\nalgorithm for solving the DLP, known as a periodic function of order $q$, was\nclarified. Additionally, we generated 1,015 quantum circuits for larger pairs\nof $p$ and $q$, extrapolated the circuit sizes obtained, and compared them for\n$p=2048$ bits between safe-prime groups and Schnorr groups. While in classical\ncryptography, the cipher strength of safe-prime groups and Schnorr groups is\nthe same if $p$ is equal, we quantitatively demonstrated how much the strength\nof the latter decreases to the bit length of $p$ in the former when using\nShor's quantum algorithm. In particular, it was experimentally and\ntheoretically shown that when a ripple carry adder is used in the addition\ncircuit, the cryptographic strength of a Schnorr group with $p=2048$ bits under\nShor's algorithm is almost equivalent to that of a safe-prime group with\n$p=1024$ bits.",

    "abstract": "A novel field theoretical approach towards modelling dynamic networking in\ncomplex systems is presented. An equilibrium networking formalism which\nutilises Gaussian fields is adapted to model the dynamics of particles that can\nbind and unbind from one another. Here, \\textit{networking} refers to the\nintroduction of instantaneous co-localisation constraints and does not\nnecessitate the formation of a well-defined transient or persistent network. By\ncombining this formalism with Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functionals, a\nweighted generating functional for the networked system is obtained. The\nnetworking formalism introduces spatial and temporal constraints into the\nLangevin dynamics, via statistical weights, thereby accounting for all possible\nconfigurations in which particles can be networked to one another. A simple\nexample of Brownian particles which can bind and unbind from one another\ndemonstrates the tool and that this leads to results for physical quantities in\na collective description. Applying the networking formalism to model the\ndynamics of cross-linking polymers in a mixture, we can calculate the average\nnumber of networking instances. As expected, the dynamic structure factors for\neach type of polymer show that the system collapses once networking is\nintroduced, but that the addition of a repulsive time-dependent potential above\na minimum strength prevents this. The examples presented in this paper indicate\nthat this novel approach towards modelling dynamic networking could be applied\nto a range of synthetic and biological systems to obtain theoretical\npredictions for experimentally verifiable quantities.",

Despite the\nfirst steps towards road transport automation, the timeline for full automation\nand its potential economic benefits remains uncertain. The aim of this paper is\ntwofold. First, it presents a methodological framework to determine deployment\npathways of the five different levels of automation in EU27+UK to 2050 under\nthree scenarios (i.e., slow, medium baseline and fast) focusing on passenger\nvehicles. Second, it proposes an assessment of the economic impact of AVs\nthrough the calculation of the value-added. The method to define assumptions\nand uptake trajectories involves a comprehensive literature review, expert\ninterviews, and a model to forecast the new registrations of different levels\nof automation. In this way, the interviews provided insights that complemented\nthe literature and informed the design of assumptions and deployment\ntrajectories. The added-value assessment shows additional economic activity due\nto the introduction of automated technologies in all uptake scenarios.",

The self-training method has been shown to\nbe effective in reasoning tasks while eliminating the need for external models\nand manual annotations.

In this work, we propose\nEntropy-Based Adaptive Weighting for Self-Training (EAST), an adaptive\nweighting strategy designed to prioritize uncertain data during self-training.\nSpecifically, EAST employs a mapping function with a tunable parameter that\ncontrols the sharpness of the weighting, assigning higher weights to data where\nthe model exhibits greater uncertainty. This approach guides the model to focus\non more informative and challenging examples, thereby enhancing its reasoning\nability. We evaluate our approach on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks. Empirical\nresults show that, while the vanilla method yields virtually no improvement\n(0%) on MATH, EAST achieves around a 1% gain over backbone model. On GSM8K,\nEAST attains a further 1-2% performance boost compared to the vanilla method.",

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce an epsilon-approximate Hamilton-Jacobi Partial\nDifferential Equation (HJ-PDE), which establishes a relationship between\ntraining loss and accuracy of the true reachable set.

The in-line holography provides the temporal evolution of the\nvolumetric size distribution of child droplets formed during various\nfragmentation processes at different Weber numbers (We). The droplet undergoes\ndifferent fragmentation processes at significantly lower Weber numbers in\nopposed-flow configurations compared to cross-flow configurations. Our findings\nreveal distinct fragmentation modes, namely bag, bag-stamen, and dual-bag\nbreakup, observed at We=9.38, 16.9, and 18.9, respectively. At We = 9.38, the\ncombined effects of bag rupture, rim breakup, and node fragmentation generate\nchild droplets of varying sizes, driven by the interplay of the\nRayleigh-Plateau and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. At We = 16.9, the\ninteraction of aerodynamic and shear forces leads to bag-stamen fragmentation,\ncharacterized by forming a stamen-like structure along with the bag. Both bag\nand bag-stamen breakups result in tri-modal size distributions. However, at We\n= 16.9, fewer tiny droplets are produced compared to the bag breakup observed\nat lower Weber numbers. In contrast, at We = 18.9, a dual-bag breakup occurs,\nwhere both bags inflate and burst simultaneously. This process generates tiny\nchild droplets in the early stages, while larger child droplets form later due\nto the fragmentation of the rim and nodes, resulting in a bi-modal size\ndistribution. We have performed a theoretical analysis using a two-parameter\ngamma distribution, which satisfactorily predicts the size distributions\nobserved experimentally at different Weber numbers.",

This approach empowers our\nmodel to achieve superior proficiency in both overall and fine-grained HIAA.\nFurthermore, we introduce a MetaVoter, which aggregates scores from all three\nheads, to effectively balance the capabilities of each head, thereby realizing\nimproved assessment precision.

    "abstract": "MLLM reasoning has drawn widespread research for its excellent\nproblem-solving capability. Current reasoning methods fall into two types: PRM,\nwhich supervises the intermediate reasoning steps, and ORM, which supervises\nthe final results. Recently, DeepSeek-R1 has challenged the traditional view\nthat PRM outperforms ORM, which demonstrates strong generalization performance\nusing an ORM method (i.e., GRPO). However, current MLLM's GRPO algorithms still\nstruggle to handle challenging and complex multimodal reasoning tasks (e.g.,\nmathematical reasoning). In this work, we reveal two problems that impede the\nperformance of GRPO on the MLLM: Low data utilization and Text-bias. Low data\nutilization refers to that GRPO cannot acquire positive rewards to update the\nMLLM on difficult samples, and text-bias is a phenomenon that the MLLM bypasses\nimage condition and solely relies on text condition for generation after GRPO\ntraining. To tackle these problems, this work proposes Hint-GRPO that improves\ndata utilization by adaptively providing hints for samples of varying\ndifficulty, and text-bias calibration that mitigates text-bias by calibrating\nthe token prediction logits with image condition in test-time. Experiment\nresults on three base MLLMs across eleven datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed methods advance the reasoning capability of original MLLM by a large\nmargin, exhibiting superior performance to existing MLLM reasoning methods.

To address this\nissue, we present Rubrik's CUBE, an education-inspired rubric and a dataset of\n26k explanations, written and later quality-annotated using the rubric by both\nhumans and six open- and closed-source LLMs. The CUBE dataset focuses on two\nreasoning and two language tasks, providing the necessary diversity for us to\neffectively test our proposed rubric. Using Rubrik, we find that explanations\nare influenced by both task and perceived difficulty. Low quality stems\nprimarily from a lack of conciseness in LLM-generated explanations, rather than\ncohesion and word choice.

Currently, ventilation scintigraphy using nuclear medicine\ntechniques is widely employed in clinical practice; however, it is often\ntime-consuming, costly, and entails additional radiation exposure. In this\nstudy, we propose an explainable neural radiomic sequence model to identify\nregions of compromised pulmonary ventilation based on four-dimensional computed\ntomography (4DCT). A cohort of 45 lung cancer patients from the VAMPIRE dataset\nwas analyzed. For each patient, lung volumes were segmented from 4DCT, and\nvoxel-wise radiomic features (56-dimensional) were extracted across the\nrespiratory cycle to capture local intensity and texture dynamics, forming\ntemporal radiomic sequences. Ground truth ventilation defects were delineated\nvoxel-wise using Galligas-PET and DTPA-SPECT. To identify compromised regions,\nwe developed a temporal saliency-enhanced explainable long short-term memory\n(LSTM) network trained on the radiomic sequences. Temporal saliency maps were\ngenerated to highlight key features contributing to the model's predictions.\nThe proposed model demonstrated robust performance, achieving average (range)\nDice similarity coefficients of 0.78 (0.74-0.79) for 25 PET cases and 0.78\n(0.74-0.82) for 20 SPECT cases. The temporal saliency map explained three key\nradiomic sequences in ventilation quantification: during lung exhalation,\ncompromised pulmonary function region typically exhibits (1) an increasing\ntrend of intensity and (2) a decreasing trend of homogeneity, in contrast to\nhealthy lung tissue.",

Recent advances in diffusion\nmodels and rectified flows have significantly improved editing quality,\nprimarily relying on inversion techniques to extract structured noise from\ninput images. However, inaccuracies in inversion can propagate errors, leading\nto unintended modifications and compromising fidelity. Moreover, even with\nperfect inversion, the entanglement between textual prompts and image features\noften results in global changes when only local edits are intended. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel text-guided image editing framework based\non VAR (Visual AutoRegressive modeling), which eliminates the need for explicit\ninversion while ensuring precise and controlled modifications. Our method\nintroduces a caching mechanism that stores token indices and probability\ndistributions from the original image, capturing the relationship between the\nsource prompt and the image. Using this cache, we design an adaptive\nfine-grained masking strategy that dynamically identifies and constrains\nmodifications to relevant regions, preventing unintended changes. A token\nreassembling approach further refines the editing process, enhancing diversity,\nfidelity, and control. Our framework operates in a training-free manner and\nachieves high-fidelity editing with faster inference speeds, processing a 1K\nresolution image in as fast as 1.2 seconds.

    "abstract": "With the developments of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) from 4G to 5G,\nvehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications are becoming attractive for\nvehicle users (VUEs) to obtain diverse cloud service through base stations\n(BSs). To tackle V2I link deterioration caused by blockage and out-of-coverage\ncases, multi-hop V2X routing with both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and V2I links\nneeds to be investigated. However, traditional routing reacts to statistical or\nreal-time information, which may suffer link degradation during path switchover\nin fast-changing vehicular networks. Predictive routing protocols take timely\nactions by forecasting link connectivity, but they fail to satisfy specific QoS\nrequirements. Low robustness to link failures is also incurred without\nconsidering imperfect prediction. To build continual paths between VUEs and BSs\nfor QoS provision of cloud service, a robust predictive routing framework\n(ROPE) is proposed with three major components: 1) an early warning scheme\ndetects V2I link deterioration in advance via predicting vehicle mobility and\nlink signal strength to facilitate seamless path switchover; 2) a virtual\nrouting mechanism finds top3 paths that have the highest path strength and\nsatisfy the connectivity and hop count constraints based on the prediction\nresults to fulfill QoS requirements of cloud service; 3) a path verification\nprotocol checks availability and quality of the top3 paths shortly before\nswitchover and activates one qualified path for switchover to ensure routing\nrobustness. We implement ROPE in a simulation framework incorporating\nreal-world urban maps, microscopic traffic generation, geometry-based channel\nmodeling, and offline data analysis as well as online inference. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate the superiority of ROPE over direct V2I communications\nand a connectivity-based predictive routing protocol under various scenarios.",

Traditional top-down approaches rely heavily on learning\nlane characteristics from training datasets, often struggling with lanes\nexhibiting previously unseen attributes. To address this generalization\nlimitation, we propose a method that detects keypoints of lanes and\nsubsequently predicts sequential connections between them to construct complete\n3D lanes. Each key point is essential for maintaining lane continuity, and we\npredict multiple proposals per keypoint by allowing adjacent grids to predict\nthe same keypoint using an offset mechanism. PointNMS is employed to eliminate\noverlapping proposal keypoints, reducing redundancy in the estimated BEV graph\nand minimizing computational overhead from connection estimations.

However, due to the partial priors provided by single-view\ninput, existing methods are often limited to reconstruct low-consistency 3D\nscenes with narrow fields of view from single-view input. These limitations\nmake them less capable of generalizing to reconstruct immersive scenes. To\naddress this problem, we propose ExScene, a two-stage pipeline to reconstruct\nan immersive 3D scene from any given single-view image. ExScene designs a novel\nmultimodal diffusion model to generate a high-fidelity and globally consistent\npanoramic image. We then develop a panoramic depth estimation approach to\ncalculate geometric information from panorama, and we combine geometric\ninformation with high-fidelity panoramic image to train an initial 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) model. Following this, we introduce a GS refinement technique\nwith 2D stable video diffusion priors. We add camera trajectory consistency and\ncolor-geometric priors into the denoising process of diffusion to improve color\nand spatial consistency across image sequences. These refined sequences are\nthen used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, leading to better reconstruction\nquality.

    "abstract": "Election polls play a critical role in political discussions by probing\npublic opinion and enabling political parties to assess their performance\nbefore elections. However, traditional polling methods sometimes fail to\npredict election outcomes accurately, leading researchers to explore new\nmethodologies. One such approach is the \"social circle\" question, which asks\nrespondents about the voting preferences of their social contacts. This method\nleverages collective intelligence and has shown promise in improving predictive\naccuracy. Nevertheless, the influence of the social network's topology on the\neffectiveness of social circle polls remains unexplored. In this study, we\ndevelop a theoretical framework to analyse how social network structure affects\npolling accuracy. By simulating voter networks with varying levels of\npolarisation and connectivity, we assess the performance of both standard and\nsocial circle polling methods. Our findings indicate that while social circle\npolls generally outperform traditional approaches, certain network\ncharacteristics can introduce biases and undermine their performances,\nparticularly in polarised situations, which are increasingly frequent in the\ncurrent political landscape. To address these challenges, we propose a new\nestimator that combines information from both standard and social circle polls,\nimproving election outcome predictions. We demonstrate the applicability of our\nmethod using real-world polling data from the 2016 U.S. presidential election,\nshowcasing its practical utility and providing an estimate of the polarisation\nlevel in that society.

    "abstract": "Context. The majority of massive stars are born with a close binary\ncompanion. How this affects their evolution and fate is still largely\nuncertain, especially at low metallicity. Aims. We derive synthetic populations\nof massive post-interaction binary products and compare them with corresponding\nobserved populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Methods. We analyse\n53298 detailed binary evolutionary models computed with MESA. Our models\ninclude the physics of rotation, mass and angular momentum transfer, magnetic\ninternal angular momentum transport, and tidal spin-orbit coupling. They cover\ninitial primary masses of 5-100Msun, initial mass ratios of 0.3-0.95, and all\ninitial periods for which interaction is expected. They are evolved through the\nfirst mass transfer and the donor star death, a possible ensuing Be/X-ray\nbinary phase, and they end when the mass gainer leaves the main sequence.\nResults.In our fiducial synthetic population, 8% of the OB stars in the SMC are\npost-mass transfer systems, and 7% are merger products. In many of our models,\nthe mass gainers are spun up and form Oe/Be stars. While our model\nunderpredicts the number of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, it reproduces the\nmain features of their orbital period distribution and the observed number of\nSMC binary WR stars. We expect $\\sim$50 OB+BH binaries below and $\\sim$170\nabove 20d orbital period. The latter might produce merging double BHs. However,\ntheir progenitors, the predicted long-period WR+OB binaries, are not observed.\nConclusions. While the comparison with the observed SMC stars supports many\nphysics assumptions in our high-mass binary models, a better match of the large\nnumber of observed OBe stars and Be/X-ray binaries likely requires a lower\nmerger rate and/or a higher mass transfer efficiency during the first mass\ntransfer. The fate of the initially wide O star binaries remains uncertain.",

Over these, the\ncriteria achieve an accuracy of >99\\% agreement with the semi-analytical model.\nThe criteria are tested on 29 state-of-the-art 3D CCSN simulation outcomes from\ntwo different groups.\n  Furthermore, we find that all explodability proxies needed for our pre-SN\nstructure-based criteria have two distinct peaks and intervening valleys as a\nfunction of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass $M_\\mathrm{CO}$, which coincide\nwith failed and successful SNe, respectively. The CO core masses of\nexplodability peaks shift systematically with metallicity, $Z$, and with timing\nof hydrogen-rich envelope removal by binary mass transfer. With these, we\nidentify critical values in $M_\\mathrm{CO}$ that define windows over which\nblack holes form by direct collapse and formulate a CCSN recipe based on\n$M_\\mathrm{CO}$ and $Z$, applicable for rapid binary population synthesis and\nother studies. Our explodability formalism is consistent with observations of\nType~IIP, IIb/Ib and Ic supernova progenitors and partially addresses the\nmissing Red Supergiant Problem by direct black hole formation.",

Fermi LAT observed the SGRE after the EUV wave from the\nbackside eruption crossed the limb to the frontside of the Sun. SolO's\nSpectrometer Telescope for Imaging X rays (STIX) imaged an intense (X3.3)\nflare, which occurred about 41 deg behind the east limb, from heliographic\ncoordinates S13E131. Forward modeling of the CME flux rope revealed that it\nimpulsively accelerated (3.54 km/s/s) to attain a peak speed of 2162 km/s.\nSolO's energetic particle detectors (EPD) observed protons up to about 1 GeV\nfrom the extended shock and electrons that produced a complex type II burst and\npossibly type III bursts. The durations of SGRE and type II burst are\nconsistent with the linear relation between these quantities obtained from\nlonger duration (>3 hours) SGRE events. All these observations are consistent\nwith an extended shock surrounding the CME flux rope, which is the likely\nsource of high energy protons required for the SGRE event.

In this paper, we study the depth\nof core-free subgroups, which allows us to apply powerful computational and\nprobabilistic techniques that were originally designed for studying bases for\npermutation groups. We use these methods to prove a wide range of new results\non the depth of subgroups of almost simple groups, significantly extending the\nscope of earlier work in this direction. For example, we establish best\npossible bounds on the depth of irreducible subgroups of classical groups and\nprimitive subgroups of symmetric groups. And with the exception of a handful of\nopen cases involving the Baby Monster, we calculate the exact depth of every\nsubgroup of every almost simple sporadic group.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of multi-source satellite imagery drives innovation in\nEarth observation, opening unprecedented opportunities for Remote Sensing\nFoundation Models to harness diverse data. However, many existing models remain\nconstrained by fixed spatial resolutions and patch sizes, limiting their\nability to fully exploit the heterogeneous spatial characteristics inherent in\nsatellite imagery. To address these challenges, we propose FlexiMo, a flexible\nremote sensing foundation model that endows the pre-trained model with the\nflexibility to adapt to arbitrary spatial resolutions. Central to FlexiMo is a\nspatial resolution-aware module that employs a parameter-free alignment\nembedding mechanism to dynamically recalibrate patch embeddings based on the\ninput image's resolution and dimensions. This design not only preserves\ncritical token characteristics and ensures multi-scale feature fidelity but\nalso enables efficient feature extraction without requiring modifications to\nthe underlying network architecture. In addition, FlexiMo incorporates a\nlightweight channel adaptation module that leverages prior spectral information\nfrom sensors. This mechanism allows the model to process images with varying\nnumbers of channels while maintaining the data's intrinsic physical properties.\nExtensive experiments on diverse multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-scale\ndatasets demonstrate that FlexiMo significantly enhances model generalization\nand robustness. In particular, our method achieves outstanding performance\nacross a range of downstream tasks, including scene classification, land cover\nclassification, urban building segmentation, and cloud detection. By enabling\nparameter-efficient and physically consistent adaptation, FlexiMo paves the way\nfor more adaptable and effective foundation models in real-world remote sensing\napplications.",

Since 1,3-butadiene is non-polar, we searched for its cyano derivative,\nwhich exists in the form of three different polar isomers, in the cold dense\ncloud TMC-1. We used the most recent data obtained with the Yebes 40m telescope\nin the Q band (31.0-50.3 GHz) in the frame of the QUIJOTE project. We do not\ndetect any of the two isomers of 1-cyano-1,3-butadiene, and derive 3sigma upper\nlimits to their column densities of 1.2e10 cm-2 and 2.0e10 cm-2 for E- and\nZ-1-cyano-1,3-butadiene, respectively. Our results are not consistent with\nthose from Cooke et al. (2023), who determine a column density of 3.8e10 cm-2\nfor E-1-cyano-1,3-butadiene in TMC-1 using GBT data and a line stack technique.\nAt the current level of sensitivity of our data, there is tentative evidence\nfor the presence of the third cyano derivative isomer, 2-cyano-1,3-butadiene,\nalthough a firm detection must await more sensitive data. We derive an upper\nlimit to its column density of 3.1e10 cm-2. This isomer cannot be formed in the\nreaction between CN and 1,3-butadiene, according to experimental and\ntheoretical studies, and thus we speculate whether it could arise from\nneutral-neutral reactions like C2H3 + CH2CHCN and CH2CCN + C2H4. From the upper\nlimit on the abundance of 1-cyano-1,3-butadiene derived here, we estimate that\nthe abundance of 1,3-butadiene in TMC-1 is below 1e-11 - 1e-10 relative to H2.\nThe low abundance inferred for 1,3-butadiene makes it unlikely that it plays an\nimportant role in bottom-up routes to cyclopentadiene and benzene.",

This decomposition finds application in data\ncompression, matrix completion with entries missing not at random, and manifold\nlearning. The standard ReLU-NMD model minimizes the least squares error, that\nis, $\\|X - \\max(0,\\Theta)\\|_F^2$. The corresponding optimization problem is\nnondifferentiable and highly nonconvex. This motivated Saul to propose an\nalternative model, Latent-ReLU-NMD, where a latent variable $Z$ is introduced\nand satisfies $\\max(0,Z)=X$ while minimizing $\\|Z - \\Theta\\|_F^2$ (``A\nnonlinear matrix decomposition for mining the zeros of sparse data'', SIAM J.\nMath.

Our first contribution is to show that the two\nformulations may yield different low-rank solutions $\\Theta$; in particular, we\nshow that Latent-ReLU-NMD can be ill-posed when ReLU-NMD is not, meaning that\nthere are instances in which the infimum of Latent-ReLU-NMD is not attained\nwhile that of ReLU-NMD is.

Our second contribution is to prove the convergence of a block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) applied to 3B-ReLU-NMD and referred to as BCD-NMD. Our\nthird contribution is a novel extrapolated variant of BCD-NMD, dubbed eBCD-NMD,\nwhich we prove is also convergent under mild assumptions.

A major challenge in observing the neutral hydrogen\narises from presence of strong foreground signals in the frequency range of\ninterest. Mitigating the direct effect of foregrounds are being addressed\nthrough various techniques in literature. An additional second order effect\narises, in presence of foreground, with limited accuracy in time and frequency\ndependent gain calibrations. This manifests as the residual gain and bandpass\nerror in the observed data, introduces bias and increases uncertainty in the\nestimates of multifrequency angular power spectrum. In this work, we present an\nanalytic method to estimate the bias and excess uncertainty in the estimates of\nmultifrequency angular power spectrum in presence of residual gain and bandpass\nerrors. We use this framework to estimate the effect of these errors for\ndetection of redshifted 21-cm emission from a redshift of $\\sim 8$ with the\nupcoming SKA1-Low. Due to the high baseline density at the required range of\nangular multipoles, the SKA1-Low is found to be a tuned instrument for the\nredshifted 21-cm signal detection. We find that, there are scenario with\nresidual gain and bandpass errors where there can be significant bias in these\nestimates. Certain foreground mitigation strategies, is expected to reduce a\npart of the bias. The detailed study of different aspects of gain and bandpass\nerrors and their relative effects are discussed.

This is mainly due\nto the high number of parameters to estimate, the reliance on geometric\nfeatures, or the dependence on specific vehicle maneuvers. To meet these\nrequirements and ensure the vehicle's safety at any time, we propose a\nmiscalibration detection framework that shifts the focus from the direct\nregression of calibration parameters to a binary classification of the\ncalibration state, i.e., calibrated or miscalibrated. Therefore, we propose a\ncontrastive learning approach that compares embedded features in a latent space\nto classify the calibration state of two different sensor modalities.

    "abstract": "Deep learning based diagnostic AI systems based on medical images are\nstarting to provide similar performance as human experts. However these data\nhungry complex systems are inherently black boxes and therefore slow to be\nadopted for high risk applications like healthcare. This problem of lack of\ntransparency is exacerbated in the case of recent large foundation models,\nwhich are trained in a self supervised manner on millions of data points to\nprovide robust generalisation across a range of downstream tasks, but the\nembeddings generated from them happen through a process that is not\ninterpretable, and hence not easily trustable for clinical applications. To\naddress this timely issue, we deploy conformal analysis to quantify the\npredictive uncertainty of a vision transformer (ViT) based foundation model\nacross patient demographics with respect to sex, age and ethnicity for the\ntasks of skin lesion classification using several public benchmark datasets.\nThe significant advantage of this method is that conformal analysis is method\nindependent and it not only provides a coverage guarantee at population level\nbut also provides an uncertainty score for each individual. We used a\nmodel-agnostic dynamic F1-score-based sampling during model training, which\nhelped to stabilize the class imbalance and we investigate the effects on\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) with or without this bias mitigation step. Thus\nwe show how this can be used as a fairness metric to evaluate the robustness of\nthe feature embeddings of the foundation model (Google DermFoundation) and thus\nadvance the trustworthiness and fairness of clinical AI.",

Processing-Using-DRAM (PUD), an analog in-DRAM computing technique, has\nthe potential to repurpose on-device DRAM as a GeMV engine, offering additional\nhigh-throughput processing capabilities to widespread consumer devices without\nDRAM modifications. However, applying PUD to GeMV operations in the LLM\ninference pipeline incurs significant overheads $\\textit{before}$ and\n$\\textit{after}$ in-DRAM computation, diminishing the benefits of its\nhigh-throughput processing capabilities.\n  This paper presents MVDRAM, the first practical system to accelerate GeMV\noperations for low-bit LLM inference using unmodified DRAM. By leveraging the\ndata sharing patterns and mathematical linearity in GeMV operations, MVDRAM\norchestrates the processor and DRAM to eliminate the costs associated with\npre-arranging inputs and bit-transposition of outputs required in conventional\nPUD approaches. Our experimental evaluation with four DDR4 DRAM modules shows\nthat MVDRAM achieves comparable or even better inference speed than the\nprocessor-based implementation for GeMV operations in low-bit (under 4-bit)\nLLM. In particular, MVDRAM achieves up to 7.29$\\times$ speedup and 30.5$\\times$\nenergy efficiency for low-bit GeMV operations.

An attention mechanism is a key component in\ntransformers, in which an attention matrix encodes relationships between words\nin a sentence and is used as weights for words in a sentence. This mechanism is\neffective for capturing language representations. However, it is questionable\nwhether naive self-attention is suitable for in-context learning in general\ntasks, since the computation implemented by self-attention is somewhat\nrestrictive in terms of matrix multiplication. In fact, we may need appropriate\ninput form designs when considering heuristic implementations of computational\nalgorithms. In this paper, in case of linear self-attention, we extend it by\nintroducing a bias matrix in addition to a weight matrix for an input. Despite\nthe simple extension, the extended linear self-attention can output any\nconstant matrix, input matrix and multiplications of two or three matrices in\nthe input. Note that the second property implies that it can be a skip\nconnection. Therefore, flexible matrix manipulations can be implemented by\nconnecting the extended linear self-attention components. As an example of\nimplementation using the extended linear self-attention, we show a heuristic\nconstruction of a batch-type gradient descent of ridge regression under a\nreasonable input form.",

We\nperform a multiparameter simulation study to mitigate part of the bias present\nin our prior estimates and gain insights into possible observational selection\neffects that affect the observed population.

Further analysis of the\nsimulation results provides hints for a hidden population of BH-LMXBs at low\nGalactic heights.

    "abstract": "Background: Tinnitus, defined as the conscious awareness of a noise without\nany identifiable corresponding external acoustic source, can be modulated by\nvarious factors. Among these factors, tinnitus patients commonly report drastic\nincreases of tinnitus loudness following nap sleep. Previous studies have\nsuggested that this clinical pattern could be attributed to a somatosensory\nmodulation of tinnitus. To our knowledge, no polysomnographic study has been\ncarried out to assess this hypothesis. Methods: For this observational\nprospective study, 37 participants reporting frequent increases of tinnitus\nfollowing naps were recruited. They participated to six full-polysomnography\nnap attempts over two days. Audiological and kinesiologic tests were conducted\nbefore and after each nap attempt. Results: 197 naps were collected. Each nap\nat each time of day elicited an overall significant increase in tinnitus\nminimum masking level (MML). Each inter nap period elicited an overall\nsignificant decrease. Tinnitus modulations were found significantly correlated\nwith nap sleep duration (Visual numeric scale on tinnitus loudness, VNS-L, p <\n0.05), with snoring duration (MML, p < 0.001), with snoring average sound level\n(VNS on tinnitus intrusiveness, VNS-I, p < 0.05) and with sleep apnea count\n(VNS-I, p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study confirms objectively that tinnitus\nmay increase following naps. No association was found between these modulations\nand somatosensory modulations involving the temporomandibular joint and\ncervical areas. However, it may be possible that nap-induced tinnitus\nmodulations are a hidden form of somatosensory modulation as snoring and sleep\napnea events are often related to tensor veli palatini muscle dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a\nquasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-Andr\\'{e}-Harper model with hopping\nrate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory\nmethod, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy\nand demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a\ncritical potential strength $V_c/J \\sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the\nmeasurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law\nphase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V< V_c$, while any\nfinite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V>V_c$. This result is\ndistinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law\nand area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the\nphase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it\nshows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in\nthe area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing\nquasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation\nnumber with an off-resonant probe light.",

    "abstract": "Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation (GZS3) aims to achieve the\nhuman-level capability of segmenting not only seen classes but also novel class\nregions unseen in the training data through introducing the bridge of semantic\nrepresentations, e.g., word vector. While effective, the way of utilizing one\nsemantic representation to associate the corresponding class and to enable the\nknowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes is insufficient as well as\nincompatible with human cognition. Inspired by the observation that humans\noften use some `part' and `state' information to comprehend the seen objects\nand imagine unseen classes, we decouple each class into detailed descriptions,\nincluding object parts and states. Based on the decoupling formulation, we\npropose a Decoupled Vision-Language Matching (DeVLMatch) framework, composed of\nspatial-part (SPMatch) and channel-state (CSMatch) matching modules, for GZS3.\nIn SPMatch, we comprehend objects with spatial part information from both\nvisual and linguistic perspectives and perform graph matching to bridge the\ngap. In CSMatch, states of objects from the linguistic perspective are matched\nto compatible channel information from the visual perspective. By decoupling\nand matching objects across visual and linguistic comprehension, we can\nexplicitly introspect the relationship between seen and unseen classes in\nfine-grained object part and state levels, thereby facilitating the knowledge\ntransfer from seen to unseen classes in visual space. The proposed DeVLMatch\nframework surpasses the previous GZS3 methods on standard benchmarks, including\nPASCAL VOC, COCO-Stuff, and CATARACTS, demonstrating its effectiveness.",

However, this very\nmechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack\nsurface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the\nrobustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely\nunderexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static\nembeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which hinder their applicability to\nsystems with dynamic memory states. This challenge is exacerbated by the\nblack-box nature of commercial RSs.\n  To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic\ninvestigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender\nagents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen\nsystem resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel\nblack-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically\nmeaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and\nintroduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting\nthe memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are\noptimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs,\nincluding collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential\nrecommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and\nstealthiness of DrunkAgent.",

    "abstract": "We present On-device Sora, the first model training-free solution for\ndiffusion-based on-device text-to-video generation that operates efficiently on\nsmartphone-grade devices. To address the challenges of diffusion-based\ntext-to-video generation on computation- and memory-limited mobile devices, the\nproposed On-device Sora applies three novel techniques to pre-trained video\ngenerative models. First, Linear Proportional Leap (LPL) reduces the excessive\ndenoising steps required in video diffusion through an efficient leap-based\napproach. Second, Temporal Dimension Token Merging (TDTM) minimizes intensive\ntoken-processing computation in attention layers by merging consecutive tokens\nalong the temporal dimension. Third, Concurrent Inference with Dynamic Loading\n(CI-DL) dynamically partitions large models into smaller blocks and loads them\ninto memory for concurrent model inference, effectively addressing the\nchallenges of limited device memory. We implement On-device Sora on the iPhone\n15 Pro, and the experimental evaluations show that it is capable of generating\nhigh-quality videos on the device, comparable to those produced by high-end\nGPUs. These results show that On-device Sora enables efficient and high-quality\nvideo generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. We envision the\nproposed On-device Sora as a significant first step toward democratizing\nstate-of-the-art generative technologies, enabling video generation on\ncommodity mobile and embedded devices without resource-intensive re-training\nfor model optimization (compression). The code implementation is available at a\nGitHub repository(https://github.com/eai-lab/On-device-Sora).",

    "abstract": "Self-driving vehicles rely on sensory input to monitor their surroundings and\ncontinuously adapt to the most likely future road course. Predictive trajectory\nplanning is based on snapshots of the (uncertain) road course as a key input.\nUnder noisy perception data, estimates of the road course can vary\nsignificantly, leading to indecisive and erratic steering behavior. To overcome\nthis issue, this paper introduces a predictive trajectory planning algorithm\nwith a novel objective function: instead of targeting a single reference\ntrajectory based on the most likely road course, tracking a series of target\nreference sets, called a target funnel, is considered. The proposed planning\nalgorithm integrates probabilistic information about the road course, and thus\nimplicitly considers regular updates to road perception. Our solution is\nassessed in a case study using real driving data collected from a prototype\nvehicle. The results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains tracking accuracy\nand substantially reduces undesirable steering commands in the presence of\nnoisy road perception, achieving a 56% reduction in input costs compared to a\ncertainty equivalent formulation.",

Most data-driven efforts have been focused on\nreducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for\nsolving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine\nlearning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In\nthis work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework\nbased on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly\nupdates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by\ntraditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various\nsystems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid,\ndemonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural,\ndynamical, and energetic properties.

We have designed and implemented two primary categories of\nobfuscations: quantum circuit level obfuscation and code level obfuscation,\nencompassing a total of eight distinct methods. Quantum circuit-level\nobfuscation leverages on quantum gates and circuits, utilizing strategies such\nas quantum gate hiding and identity matrices to construct complex,\nnon-intuitive circuits that effectively obscure core functionalities and resist\nreverse engineering, making the underlying code difficult to interpret.\nMeanwhile, code-level obfuscation manipulates the logical sequence of program\noperations through quantum-based opaque predicates, obfuscating execution paths\nand rendering program behavior more unpredictable and challenging to analyze.\nAdditionally, ObfusQate can be used to obfuscate malicious code segments,\nmaking them harder to detect and analyze. These advancements establish a\nfoundational framework for further exploration into the potential and\nlimitations of quantum-based obfuscation techniques, positioning ObfusQate as a\nvaluable tool for future developers to enhance code security in the evolving\nlandscape of software development. To the best of our knowledge, ObfusQate\nrepresents the pioneering work in developing an automated framework for\nimplementing obfuscations leveraging quantum primitives.

The complexity of natural samples plus the\nunspecificity of their treatments to isolate polymers renders the\ncharacterization of thousands of particles impractical for environmental\nmonitoring using conventional spectroscopic techniques. Two primary solutions\nare to analyze a small fraction of the sample or to measure only a subset of\nparticles present over a holder, known as subsampling. A strategy to subsample\nreflective Kevley slides and gold-coated filters using quantum-cascade\nlaser-based infrared imaging is proposed here, as this technology is a\npromising tool for MPs monitoring. In contrast to most previous approaches that\nstruggle to propose general subsampling schemes, we introduce the concept of\nsample-based subsampling. This can be applied ex-ante always and it highlights\nthe best subsampling areas for a sample after a preliminary assay to count the\ntotal number of particles on a holder. The error at this stage acts as a proxy\nto minimize errors when evaluating the number of particles and MPs,\nsignificantly enhancing the feasibility of large-scale MPs monitoring. The\npredictive ability of the approach was tested for fibres and fragments, for\ntotal amounts of particles and MPs. Further, the evaluations were disaggregated\nby size and polymer type. In most situations the reference values were\ncontained in the confidence intervals of the predicted values (often within the\n68 % ones) and relative errors were lower than 25 %. Exceptions occurred when\nvery scarce (one or two) items of a given size or polymer were present on the\noverall holder. The approach was compared to other systematic ad-hoc\nstrategies.",

    "abstract": "Selective prediction, where a model has the option to abstain from making a\ndecision, is crucial for machine learning applications in which mistakes are\ncostly. In this work, we focus on distributional regression and introduce a\nframework that enables the model to abstain from estimation in situations of\nhigh uncertainty. We refer to this approach as distributional regression with\nreject option, inspired by similar concepts in classification and regression\nwith reject option. We study the scenario where the rejection rate is fixed. We\nderive a closed-form expression for the optimal rule, which relies on\nthresholding the entropy function of the Continuous Ranked Probability Score\n(CRPS). We propose a semi-supervised estimation procedure for the optimal rule,\nusing two datasets: the first, labeled, is used to estimate both the\nconditional distribution function and the entropy function of the CRPS, while\nthe second, unlabeled, is employed to calibrate the desired rejection rate.\nNotably, the control of the rejection rate is distribution-free. Under mild\nconditions, we show that our procedure is asymptotically as effective as the\noptimal rule, both in terms of error rate and rejection rate. Additionally, we\nestablish rates of convergence for our approach based on distributional\nk-nearest neighbor. A numerical analysis on real-world datasets demonstrates\nthe strong performance of our procedure",

Developers typically perform sanity checks during the\nconfiguration parsing stage to prevent invalid parameter values.

Our study reveals the underlying reason: the\nvalue of runtime configuration parameters may interact with other constants and\nvariables when propagated and used, altering its original effect on software\nbehavior. Consequently, parameter values may no longer be valid when\nencountering complex runtime environments and workloads. Therefore, it is\nextremely challenging for users to properly configure the software before it\nstarts running. This paper presents the first comprehensive and in-depth study\n(to the best of our knowledge) on how configuration affects software at runtime\nthrough the interaction with constants, and variables (PCV Interaction).\nParameter values represent user intentions, constants embody developer\nknowledge, and variables are typically defined by the runtime environment and\nworkload. This interaction essentially illustrates how different roles jointly\ndetermine software behavior. In this regard, we studied 705 configuration\nparameters from 10 large-scale software systems. We reveal that a large portion\nof configuration parameters interact with constants/variables after parsing. We\nanalyzed the interaction patterns and their effects on software runtime\nbehavior.

While widely deployed Human Visual\nSystem (HVS) oriented video coding standards like H.265/HEVC and H.264/AVC are\nefficient, they are not the optimal approaches for Video Coding for Machines\n(VCM) scenarios, leading to unnecessary bitrate expenditure. The academic and\ntechnical exploration within the VCM domain has led to the development of\nseveral strategies, and yet, conspicuous limitations remain in their\nadaptability for multi-task scenarios. To address the challenge, we propose a\nTransformable Video Feature Compression (TransVFC) framework. It offers a\ncompress-then-transfer solution and includes a video feature codec and Feature\nSpace Transform (FST) modules. In particular, the temporal redundancy of video\nfeatures is squeezed by the codec through the scheme-based inter-prediction\nmodule. Then, the codec implements perception-guided conditional coding to\nminimize spatial redundancy and help the reconstructed features align with\ndownstream machine perception.After that, the reconstructed features are\ntransferred to new feature spaces for diverse downstream tasks by FST modules.\nTo accommodate a new downstream task, it only requires training one lightweight\nFST module, avoiding retraining and redeploying the upstream codec and\ndownstream task networks. Experiments show that TransVFC achieves high\nrate-task performance for diverse tasks of different granularities.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose an integrated system that synergizes\nadvanced hardware and software technologies to balance speed-accuracy. Our\nstudy introduces the One Class Twin Cross Learning (OCT-X) algorithm.\nLeveraging a novel fast double-threshold grid search strategy (FDT-GS) and a\npatch-based deep fully convolutional network, OCT-X maximizes diagnostic\naccuracy through real-time data processing and seamless lesion surveillance.\nThe hardware component includes an all-in-one point-of-care testing (POCT)\ndevice with high-resolution imaging sensors, real-time data processing, and\nwireless connectivity, facilitated by the NI CompactDAQ and LabVIEW software.\nOur integrated system achieved an unprecedented diagnostic accuracy of 99.70%,\nsignificantly outperforming existing models by up to 4.47%, and demonstrated a\n10% improvement in multirate adaptability. These findings underscore the\npotential of OCT-X as well as the integrated system in clinical diagnostics,\noffering a path toward more accurate, efficient, and less invasive early\ngastric cancer detection.

In everyday scenarios, individuals\nencountering design materials, such as magazines, typography tutorials,\nresearch papers, or branding content, may wish to identify aesthetically\npleasing fonts used in the text. Given their multimodal capabilities and free\naccessibility, many VLMs are often considered potential tools for font\nrecognition. This raises a fundamental question: Do VLMs truly possess the\ncapability to recognize fonts? To investigate this, we introduce the Font\nRecognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising\n15 commonly used fonts. FRB includes two versions: (i) an easy version, where\n10 sentences are rendered in different fonts, and (ii) a hard version, where\neach text sample consists of the names of the 15 fonts themselves, introducing\na stroop effect that challenges model perception. Through extensive evaluation\nof various VLMs on font recognition tasks, we arrive at the following key\nfindings: (i) Current VLMs exhibit limited font recognition capabilities, with\nmany state-of-the-art models failing to achieve satisfactory performance and\nbeing easily affected by the stroop effect introduced by textual information.\n(ii) Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provide minimal\nbenefits in improving font recognition accuracy across different VLMs. (iii)\nAttention analysis sheds light on the inherent limitations of VLMs in capturing\nsemantic features.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid integrated quantum photonics combines solid-state artificial atoms\nwith reconfigurable photonic circuits, enabling scalable chip-based quantum\nnetworks. Self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) are ideal for this goal due to\ntheir ability to generate highly indistinguishable single photons with\nexceptional brightness. Integrating QDs into low-loss photonic circuits can\nfacilitate complex quantum networks by enabling entanglement transfer via\ntwo-photon interference. However, challenges such as limited scalability,\nspectral inhomogeneity, and quantum interference between independent sources\nremain. We present a hybrid photonic architecture that integrates QD-containing\nwaveguides with low-loss lithium niobate (LN) circuits, incorporating 20\ndeterministic single-photon sources (SPSs). Using the piezoelectric properties\nof thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), we achieve on-chip local spectral tuning\nof QD emissions by up to 7.7 meV,three orders of magnitude greater than the\ntransform-limited linewidth. This approach enables on-chip quantum interference\nwith a visibility of 0.73 between two spatially separated QD SPSs connected by\n0.48 mm long waveguides, establishing a functional quantum network.The\nlarge-scale integration of spectrally tunable QD-based SPSs into low-loss LN\ncircuits, combined with fast electro-optical switching, paves the way for\ncompact, lightweight, and scalable photonic quantum networks.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and resolving cooperation dilemmas are key challenges in\nevolutionary game theory, which have revealed several mechanisms to address\nthem. This paper investigates the comprehensive influence of multiple\nreputation-related components on public cooperation. In particular, cooperative\ninvestments in public goods game are not fixed but simultaneously depend on the\nreputation of group organizers and the population's cooperation willingness,\nhence indirectly impacting on the players' income. Additionally, individual\npayoff can also be directly affected by their reputation via a weighted\napproach which effectively evaluates the actual income of players. Unlike\nconventional models, the reputation change of players is non-monotonic, but may\ntransform abruptly due to specific actions. Importantly, a theoretically\nsupported double Q-learning algorithm is introduced to avoid overestimation\nbias inherent from the classical Q-learning algorithm. Our simulations reveal a\nsignificantly improved cooperation level, that is explained by a detailed\nQ-value analysis. We also observe the lack of massive cooperative clusters in\nthe absence of network reciprocity. At the same time, as an intriguing\nphenomenon, some actors maintain moderate reputation and are continuously\nflipping between cooperation and defection. The robustness of our results are\nvalidated by mean-field approximation.",

To address these challenges, we propose StrokeFusion, a two-stage\nframework for vector sketch generation. It contains a dual-modal sketch feature\nlearning network that maps strokes into a high-quality latent space. This\nnetwork decomposes sketches into normalized strokes and jointly encodes stroke\nsequences with Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) maps, representing sketches as\nsets of stroke feature vectors. Building upon this representation, our\nframework exploits a stroke-level latent diffusion model that simultaneously\nadjusts stroke position, scale, and trajectory during generation. This enables\nhigh-fidelity sketch generation while supporting stroke interpolation editing.\nExtensive experiments on the QuickDraw dataset demonstrate that our framework\noutperforms state-of-the-art techniques, validating its effectiveness in\npreserving structural integrity and semantic features.

To derive this, we\nfirst propose a theoretical framework to analyze the general form of unlearning\nloss and decompose it into forgetting and retention terms. Through the\ntheoretical framework, we point out that a class of previous methods could be\nmainly formulated as a loss that implicitly optimizes the forgetting term while\nlacking supervision for the retention term, disturbing the distribution of\npre-trained model and struggling to adequately preserve knowledge of the\nremaining classes. To address it, we refine the retention term using \"dark\nknowledge\" and propose a mask distillation unlearning method. By applying a\nmask to separate forgetting logits from retention logits, our approach\noptimizes both the forgetting and refined retention components simultaneously,\nretaining knowledge of the remaining classes while ensuring thorough forgetting\nof the target class. Without access to the remaining data or intervention\n(i.e., used in some works), we achieve state-of-the-art performance across\nvarious benchmarks.

However, it inevitably stores models on user\ndevices, introducing new vulnerabilities, particularly model-stealing attacks\nand intellectual property infringement. While system-level protections like\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide a robust solution, practical\nchallenges remain in achieving scalable on-device DL model protection,\nincluding complexities in supporting third-party models and limited adoption in\ncurrent mobile solutions. Advancements in TEE-enabled hardware, such as\nNVIDIA's GPU-based TEEs, may address these obstacles in the future. Currently,\nwatermarking serves as a common defense against model theft but also faces\nchallenges here as many mobile app developers lack corresponding machine\nlearning expertise and the inherent read-only and inference-only nature of\non-device DL models prevents third parties like app stores from implementing\nexisting watermarking techniques in post-deployment models.\n  To protect the intellectual property of on-device DL models, in this paper,\nwe propose THEMIS, an automatic tool that lifts the read-only restriction of\non-device DL models by reconstructing their writable counterparts and leverages\nthe untrainable nature of on-device DL models to solve watermark parameters and\nprotect the model owner's intellectual property.

    "abstract": "The Proton Improvement Plan (PIP-II) to the FNAL accelerator chain and the\nLong-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) will provide the world's most intense\nneutrino beam to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) enabling a\nwide-ranging physics program. This document outlines the significant\ncontributions made by European national laboratories and institutes towards\nrealizing the first phase of the project with a 1.2 MW neutrino beam.\nConstruction of this first phase is well underway. For DUNE Phase II, this will\nbe closely followed by an upgrade of the beam power to > 2 MW, for which the\nEuropean groups again have a key role and which will require the continued\nsupport of the European community for machine aspects of neutrino physics.\nBeyond the neutrino beam aspects, LBNF is also responsible for providing unique\ninfrastructure to install and operate the DUNE neutrino detectors at FNAL and\nat the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF). The cryostats for the\nfirst two Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber detector modules at SURF, a\ncontribution of CERN to LBNF, are central to the success of the ongoing\nexecution of DUNE Phase I. Likewise, successful and timely procurement of\ncryostats for two additional detector modules at SURF will be critical to the\nsuccess of DUNE Phase II and the overall physics program. The DUNE\nCollaboration is submitting four main contributions to the 2026 Update of the\nEuropean Strategy for Particle Physics process. This paper is being submitted\nto the 'Accelerator technologies' and 'Projects and Large Experiments' streams.\nAdditional inputs related to the DUNE science program, DUNE detector\ntechnologies and R&D, and DUNE software and computing, are also being submitted\nto other streams.",

Although\nthe Kalman filter is the most popular choice, its performance degrades\nsignificantly when distributional mismatches occur, potentially leading to\ninstability or divergence. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel\nsteady-state distributionally robust (DR) Kalman filter that leverages\nWasserstein ambiguity sets to explicitly account for uncertainties in both\nprocess and measurement noise distributions. Our filter achieves computational\nefficiency by requiring merely the offline solution of a single convex\nsemidefinite program, which yields a constant DR Kalman gain for robust state\nestimation under distributional mismatches. Additionally, we derive explicit\ntheoretical conditions on the ambiguity set radius that ensure the asymptotic\nconvergence of the time-varying DR Kalman filter to the proposed steady-state\nsolution. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nexisting baseline filters in terms of robustness and accuracy across both\nGaussian and non-Gaussian uncertainty scenarios, highlighting its significant\npotential for real-world control and estimation applications.",

New Intent Discovery (NID) is a crucial task that\naims to identify these novel intents while maintaining the capability to\nrecognize existing ones. Previous efforts to adapt TODS to new intents have\nstruggled with inadequate semantic representation or have depended on external\nknowledge, which is often not scalable or flexible. Recently, Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities; however, their\nscale can be impractical for real-world applications that involve extensive\nqueries. To address the limitations of existing NID methods by leveraging LLMs,\nwe propose LANID, a framework that enhances the semantic representation of\nlightweight NID encoders with the guidance of LLMs. Specifically, LANID employs\nthe $K$-nearest neighbors and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications\nwith Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to sample selective utterance pairs from the\ntraining set. It then queries an LLM to ascertain the relationships between\nthese pairs. The data produced from this process is utilized to design a\ncontrastive fine-tuning task, which is then used to train a small encoder with\na contrastive triplet loss. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy\nof the proposed method across three distinct NID datasets, surpassing strong\nbaselines in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

Existing I2V\nmethods, primarily trained on natural video datasets, often struggle to\ngenerate dynamic outputs from static paintings. It remains challenging to\ngenerate motion while maintaining visual consistency with real-world paintings.\nThis results in two distinct failure modes: either static outputs due to\nlimited text-based motion interpretation or distorted dynamics caused by\ninadequate alignment with real-world artistic styles. We leverage the advanced\ntext-image alignment capabilities of pre-trained image models to guide the\nanimation process. Our approach introduces synthetic proxy images through two\nkey innovations: (1) Dual-path score distillation: We employ a dual-path\narchitecture to distill motion priors from both real and synthetic data,\npreserving static details from the original painting while learning dynamic\ncharacteristics from synthetic frames. (2) Hybrid latent fusion: We integrate\nhybrid features extracted from real paintings and synthetic proxy images via\nspherical linear interpolation in the latent space, ensuring smooth transitions\nand enhancing temporal consistency. Experimental evaluations confirm that our\napproach significantly improves semantic alignment with text prompts while\nfaithfully preserving the unique characteristics and integrity of the original\npaintings. Crucially, by achieving enhanced dynamic effects without requiring\nany model training or learnable parameters, our framework enables plug-and-play\nintegration with existing I2V methods, making it an ideal solution for\nanimating real-world paintings.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Research has revealed that strength training can reduce the\nincidence of chronic diseases and physical deterioration at any age. Therefore,\nhaving a movement diagnostic system is crucial for training alone. Hence, this\nstudy developed an artificial intelligence and computer vision-based barbell\nsquat coaching system with a real-time mode that immediately diagnoses the\nissue and provides feedback after each squat. In addition, a replay mode allows\nusers to examine their previous squats and check their comments. Initially,\nfour primary characteristics of the barbell squat were identified: body joint\nangles, dorsiflexion, the ratio of knee-to-hip movement, and barbell stability.\nMethods: We collect 8,151 squats from 77 participants, categorizing them as\ngood squats and six issues. Then, we trained the diagnosis models with three\nmachine-learning architectures. Furthermore, this research applied the SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) method to enhance the accuracy of issue prediction\nand reduce the computation time by feature selection. Results: The F1 score of\nthe six issues reached 86.86%, 69.01%, 77.42%, 90.74%, 95.83%, and 100%. Each\nsquat diagnosis took less than 0.5 seconds. Finally, this study examined the\nefficacy of the proposed system with two groups of participants trained with\nand without the system. Subsequently, participants trained with the system\nexhibited substantial improvements in their squat technique, as assessed both\nby the system itself and by a professional weightlifting coach. Conclusion:\nThis is a comprehensive study that integrates artificial intelligence, computer\nvision and multivariable processing technologies, aimed at building a\nreal-time, user-friendly barbell squat feedback and training system.",

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of Large Vision-Language Models(VLMs) has resulted in a\nvariety of different benchmarks for evaluating such models. Despite this, we\nobserve that most existing evaluation methods suffer from the fact that they\neither require the model to choose from pre-determined responses, sacrificing\nopen-endedness, or evaluate responses using a judge model, resulting in\nsubjective and unreliable evaluation. In addition, we observe a lack of\nbenchmarks for VLMs in the Korean language, which are necessary as a separate\nmetric from more common English language benchmarks, as the performance of\ngenerative language models can differ significantly based on the language being\nused. Therefore, we present KOFFVQA, a general-purpose free-form visual\nquestion answering benchmark in the Korean language for the evaluation of VLMs.\nOur benchmark consists of 275 carefully crafted questions each paired with an\nimage and grading criteria covering 10 different aspects of VLM performance.\nThe grading criteria eliminate the problem of unreliability by allowing the\njudge model to grade each response based on a pre-determined set of rules. By\ndefining the evaluation criteria in an objective manner, even a small\nopen-source model can be used to evaluate models on our benchmark reliably. In\naddition to evaluating a large number of existing VLMs on our benchmark, we\nalso experimentally verify that our method of using pre-existing grading\ncriteria for evaluation is much more reliable than existing methods.

To alleviate this issue, we propose integral\nregularization PINNs (IR-PINNs), a novel approach that enhances temporal\naccuracy by incorporating an integral-based residual term into the loss\nfunction.

A critical factor in\ndetermining the full r-process pattern in these environments is the neutron\nrichness of the ejecta, which is strongly influenced by neutrino interactions.\nOne key ingredient shaping these interactions is fast neutrino flavor\nconversions (FFCs), which arise due to angular crossings in neutrino\ndistributions and occur on nanosecond timescales. We present the first\nthree-dimensional, in-situ, angle-dependent modeling of FFCs in post-merger\ndisks, implemented within general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with Monte\nCarlo neutrino transport. Our results reveal that, by suppressing electron\nneutrinos, FFCs more efficiently cool the disk and weaken the early thermally\ndriven wind. Less re-leptonization due to electron neutrino absorption makes\nthis cooler wind more neutron-rich, producing a more robust r-process at higher\nlatitudes of the outflow.

Recent work\nhas shown that training VQAs is NP-hard in general. In this paper, we present a\nconditional result suggesting that the training of VQAs is undecidable, even in\nidealized, noiseless settings. We reduce the decision version of the digitized\nVQA training problem-where circuit parameters are drawn from a discrete set-to\nthe question of whether a universal Diophantine equation (UDE) has a root. This\nreduction relies on encoding the UDE into the structure of a variational\nquantum circuit via the matrix exponentials. The central step involves\nestablishing a correspondence between the objective function of the VQA and a\nknown UDE of 58 variables and degree 4. Our main result is conditional on a\nnatural conjecture: that a certain system of structured complex polynomial\nequations-arising from the inner product of a VQA circuit output and a fixed\nobservable-has at least one solution. We argue this conjecture is plausible\nbased on dimension-counting arguments (degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonians,\nstate vector, and observable), and the generic solvability of such systems in\nalgebraic geometry over the complex numbers. Under this assumption, we suggest\nthat deciding whether a digitized VQA achieves a given energy threshold is\nundecidable. This links the limitations of variational quantum algorithms to\nfoundational questions in mathematics and logic, extending the known landscape\nof quantum computational hardness to include uncomputability.

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are fundamental pillars of the blockchain, playing a crucial\nrole in facilitating various business transactions. However, these smart\ncontracts are vulnerable to exploitable bugs that can lead to substantial\nmonetary losses. A recent study reveals that over 80% of these exploitable\nbugs, which are primarily functional bugs, can evade the detection of current\ntools. The primary issue is the significant gap between understanding the\nhigh-level logic of the business model and checking the low-level\nimplementations in smart contracts. Furthermore, identifying deeply rooted\nfunctional bugs in smart contracts requires the automated generation of\neffective detection oracles based on various bug features. To address these\nchallenges, we design and implement PROMFUZZ, an automated and scalable system\nto detect functional bugs, in smart contracts. In PROMFUZZ, we first propose a\nnovel Large Language Model (LLM)-driven analysis framework, which leverages a\ndual-agent prompt engineering strategy to pinpoint potentially vulnerable\nfunctions for further scrutiny. We then implement a dual-stage coupling\napproach, which focuses on generating invariant checkers that leverage logic\ninformation extracted from potentially vulnerable functions. Finally, we design\na bug-oriented fuzzing engine, which maps the logical information from the\nhigh-level business model to the low-level smart contract implementations, and\nperforms the bug-oriented fuzzing on targeted functions. We compare PROMFUZZ\nwith multiple state-of-the-art methods. The results show that PROMFUZZ achieves\n86.96% recall and 93.02% F1-score in detecting functional bugs, marking at\nleast a 50% improvement in both metrics over state-of-the-art methods.\nMoreover, we perform an in-depth analysis on real-world DeFi projects and\ndetect 30 zero-day bugs. Up to now, 24 zero-day bugs have been assigned CVE\nIDs.",

Although diffusion models (DM) exhibit strong generative\ncapabilities, their direct applications to CR are suboptimal, as they generate\ncloudless images from random noise, ignoring inherent information in cloudy\ninputs. To overcome this drawback, we develop a new CR model EMRDM based on\nmean-reverting diffusion models (MRDMs) to establish a direct diffusion process\nbetween cloudy and cloudless images. Compared to current MRDMs, EMRDM offers a\nmodular framework with updatable modules and an elucidated design space, based\non a reformulated forward process and a new ordinary differential equation\n(ODE)-based backward process. Leveraging our framework, we redesign key MRDM\nmodules to boost CR performance, including restructuring the denoiser via a\npreconditioning technique, reorganizing the training process, and improving the\nsampling process by introducing deterministic and stochastic samplers. To\nachieve multi-temporal CR, we further develop a denoising network for\nsimultaneously denoising sequential images.

In this work, we explore the safety and\nrobustness of autonomous driving in safety-critical scenarios. First, we\nprovide a definition of safety-critical scenarios, including static traffic\nscenarios such as adversarial attack scenarios and natural distribution shifts,\nas well as dynamic traffic scenarios such as accident scenarios. Then, we\ndevelop an autonomous driving safety testing platform to comprehensively\nevaluate autonomous driving systems, encompassing not only the assessment of\nperception modules but also system-level evaluations. Our work systematically\nconstructs a safety verification process for autonomous driving, providing\ntechnical support for the industry to establish standardized test framework and\nreduce risks in real-world road deployment.",

    "abstract": "3D layout tasks have traditionally concentrated on geometric constraints, but\nmany practical applications demand richer contextual understanding that spans\nsocial interactions, cultural traditions, and usage conventions. Existing\nmethods often rely on rule-based heuristics or narrowly trained learning\nmodels, making them difficult to generalize and frequently prone to orientation\nerrors that break realism. To address these challenges, we define four\nescalating context levels, ranging from straightforward physical placement to\ncomplex cultural requirements such as religious customs and advanced social\nnorms. We then propose a Vision-Language Model-based pipeline that inserts\nminimal visual cues for orientation guidance and employs iterative feedback to\npinpoint, diagnose, and correct unnatural placements in an automated fashion.\nEach adjustment is revisited through the system's verification process until it\nachieves a coherent result, thereby eliminating the need for extensive user\noversight or manual parameter tuning. Our experiments across these four context\nlevels reveal marked improvements in rotation accuracy, distance control, and\noverall layout plausibility compared with native VLM. By reducing the\ndependence on pre-programmed constraints or prohibitively large training sets,\nour method enables fully automated scene composition for both everyday\nscenarios and specialized cultural tasks, moving toward a universally adaptable\nframework for 3D arrangement.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Administrative data is commonly used to inform chronic disease\nprevalence and support health informatics research. This study assessed the\nvalidity of coding comorbidity in the International Classification of Diseases,\n10th Revision (ICD-10) administrative data. Methods: We analyzed three chart\nreview cohorts (4,008 patients in 2003, 3,045 in 2015, and 9,024 in 2022) in\nAlberta, Canada. Nurse reviewers assessed the presence of 17 clinical\nconditions using a consistent protocol. The reviews were linked with\nadministrative data using unique identifiers. We compared the accuracy in\ncoding comorbidity by ICD-10, using chart review data as the reference\nstandard. Results: Our findings showed that the mean difference in prevalence\nbetween chart reviews and ICD-10 for these 17 conditions was 2.1% in 2003, 7.6%\nin 2015, and 6.3% in 2022. Some conditions were relatively stable, such as\ndiabetes (1.9%, 2.1%, and 1.1%) and metastatic cancer (0.3%, 1.1%, and 0.4%).\nFor these 17 conditions, the sensitivity ranged from 39.6-85.1% in 2003,\n1.3-85.2% in 2015, and 3.0-89.7% in 2022. The C-statistics for predicting\nin-hospital mortality using comorbidities by ICD-10 were 0.84 in 2003, 0.81 in\n2015, and 0.78 in 2022. Discussion: The under-coding could be primarily due to\nthe increase of hospital patient volumes and the limited time allocated to\ncoders. There is a potential to develop artificial intelligence methods based\non electronic health records to support coding practices and improve coding\nquality. Conclusion: Comorbidities were increasingly under-coded over 20 years.\nThe validity of ICD-10 decreased but remained relatively stable for certain\nconditions mandated for coding. The under-coding exerted minimal impact on\nin-hospital mortality prediction.",

However, the CMZ's low-mass protostellar population, which\naccounts for most of the initial stellar mass budget and star formation rate\n(SFR), is poorly constrained observationally due to limited sensitivity and\nresolution. We present the Dual-band Unified Exploration of Three CMZ Clouds\n(DUET) survey, targeting the 20 km/s Cloud, Sgr C, and Dust Ridge cloud e using\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 and 3 mm. The\nmosaicked observations achieve a comparable resolution of 0.2-0.3\" (~1600-2500\nau) and a sky coverage of 8.3-10.4 square arcmin, respectively. We report 563\ncontinuum sources at 1.3 mm and 330 at 3 mm, respectively, and a dual-band\ncatalog with 450 continuum sources. These sources are marginally resolved at\nthe 2,000 au resolution. We find a cloud-wide deviation (>70%) from\ncommonly-used dust modified blackbody (MBB) models, characterized by either low\nspectral indices or low brightness temperatures. Three possible explanations\nfor the deviation are discussed. (1) Optically thick Class 0/I Young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) with very small beam filling factors can lead to lower\nbrightness temperatures than what MBB models predict. (2) Large (mm/cm-sized)\ndust grains have more significant self-scattering, and therefore\nfrequency-dependent albedo could cause lower spectral indices. (3) Free-free\nemission over 30 uJy can severely contaminate dust emission and cause low\nspectral indices for mJy sources in our sample, although the needed number of\nmassive protostars (embedded UCHII regions) is infeasibly high for the normal\nstellar initial mass function. A reliable measurement of the SFR at low\nprotostellar masses will require future work to distinguish between these\npossible explanations.",

Using a multistage Monte Carlo\nsimulation of in-medium jet shower evolution, we explore flavor-dependent\nmedium effects through simulations of inclusive and $\\gamma$-tagged jets. The\nresults show that quark jets undergo a non-monotonic modification compared to\ngluon jets in observables such as the Pb-Pb to $p$-$p$ ratio of the Soft Drop\nprong angle $r_g$, the relative prong transverse momentum $k_{T,g}$ and the\ngroomed mass $m_g$ distributions. Due to this non-monotonic modification,\n$\\gamma$-tagged jets, enriched in quark jets, provide surprisingly clear\nsignals of medium-induced structural modifications, distinct from effects\ndominated by selection bias. This work highlights the potential of hard\nsubstructures in $\\gamma$-tagged jets as powerful tools for probing the\njet-medium interactions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. All simulations\nfor $\\gamma$-tagged jet analyses carried out in this paper used triggered\nevents containing at least one hard photon, which highlights the utility of\nthese observables for future Bayesian analysis.",

While automated methods are indispensable for processing\nlarge-scale genomic data, they often face challenges in accurately predicting\ngene structures and functions. Consequently, manual curation by domain experts\nremains crucial for validating and refining these predictions. These combined\noutcomes from automated tools and manual curation highlight the importance of\nintegrating human expertise with AI capabilities to improve both the accuracy\nand efficiency of genome annotation. However, the manual curation process is\ninherently labor-intensive and time-consuming, making it difficult to scale for\nlarge datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework,\nHuman-AI Collaborative Genome Annotation (HAICoGA), which leverages the\nsynergistic partnership between humans and artificial intelligence to enhance\nhuman capabilities and accelerate the genome annotation process. Additionally,\nwe explore the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into this\nframework to support and augment specific tasks. Finally, we discuss emerging\nchallenges and outline open research questions to guide further exploration in\nthis area.",

    "abstract": "In the study of ion-atom interactions, the ion often remain trapped during\nthe experiments. However, the effects of the trapping potential of the ion on\nion-neutral interactions remain largely unexplored. Although trap-assisted\nion-neutral complex formation has been experimentally studied and described by\napplying semiclassical theories where the ion is treated as a point charge\nparticle, the potential effect of a delocalized charge distribution of a\nconfined ion due to its quantum mechanical wavefunction has not been\nconsidered. To remedy this, in the present theoretical work we substitute the\npoint charge of the ion with a delocalized charged distribution according to\nits motional ground state in the trap. Our results show that the trapping\nfrequency and hence the spatial extension of the ion's ground-state\nwavefunction drastically affects the elastic and transport cross sections in\ninteractions with neutral atoms. Stimulated by these results, we propose\nexperimental procedures to verify the effects of the delocalize charge\ndistribution in ion-atom interactions via measuring the heating rate of the ion\ndue to the energy transfer in atomic collisions. Our novel approach brings new\npossibilities for investigating ion-neutral systems and, through them, new\nperspectives on ionic polarons and potentially a better understanding of\ntrap-induced losses in ion-neutral experiments.",

Utilizing a bilingual (English and Chinese) and\ndual-framing (affirmative and reverse) methodology, we generated 19,712 prompts\ndesigned to detect ideological leanings in model outputs. Responses were\nquantitatively assessed on a normalized scale from -2 (strongly Pro-China) to\n+2 (strongly Pro-U.S.) and categorized according to stance, neutrality, and\nrefusal rates. The findings demonstrate significant and consistent ideological\nalignments correlated with the LLMs' geographic origins; U.S.-based models\npredominantly favored Pro-U.S. stances, while Chinese-origin models exhibited\npronounced Pro-China biases. Notably, language and prompt framing substantially\ninfluenced model responses, with several LLMs exhibiting stance reversals based\non prompt polarity or linguistic context.

We develop a\nmultilingual pipeline to calibrate the model's confidence and let it abstain\nwhen uncertain. We run several multilingual models through the pipeline to\nprofile them across different languages.

Interfaces\nare known to mediate the formation of hot spots that control their safety and\ninitiation. To study such processes at molecular scales, we developed all-atom\nforce fields (FFs) for Octol, a prototypical HE formulation comprised of TNT\n(2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) and HMX\n(octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine). We extended a FF for TNT\nand recasted it in a form that can be readily combined with a well-established\nFF for HMX. The resulting FF was extensively validated against experimental\nresults and density functional theory calculations. We applied the new combined\nTNT-HMX FF to predict and rank surface and interface energies, which indicate\nthat there is an energetic driver for coarsening of microstructural grains in\nTNT-HMX composites. Finally, we assess the impact of several microstructural\nenvironments on the dynamic melting of TNT crystal under ultrafast thermal\nloading. We find that both free surfaces and planar material interfaces are\neffective nucleation points for TNT melting. However, MD simulations show that\nTNT crystal is prone to superheating by at least 50 K on sub-nanosecond\ntimescales and that the degree of superheating is inversely correlated with\nsurface and interface energy. The modeling framework presented here will enable\nfuture studies on hot spot formation processes in accident scenarios that are\ngoverned by strong coupling between microstructural interfaces, material\nmechanics, momentum and energy transport, phase transitions, and chemistry.",

    "abstract": "In Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) tasks, such as Relation\nExtraction, Named Entity Recognition, and Text Classification, the scarcity of\nhigh-quality data remains a significant challenge. This limitation poisons\nlarge language models to correctly understand relationships between biological\nentities, such as molecules and diseases, or drug interactions, and further\nresults in potential misinterpretation of biomedical documents. To address this\nissue, current approaches generally adopt the Synthetic Data Augmentation\nmethod which involves similarity computation followed by word replacement, but\ncounterfactual data are usually generated. As a result, these methods disrupt\nmeaningful word sets or produce sentences with meanings that deviate\nsubstantially from the original context, rendering them ineffective in\nimproving model performance. To this end, this paper proposes a\nbiomedical-dedicated rationale-based synthetic data augmentation method. Beyond\nthe naive lexicon similarity, specific bio-relation similarity is measured to\nhold the augmented instance having a strong correlation with bio-relation\ninstead of simply increasing the diversity of augmented data. Moreover, a\nmulti-agents-involved reflection mechanism helps the model iteratively\ndistinguish different usage of similar entities to escape falling into the\nmis-replace trap. We evaluate our method on the BLURB and BigBIO benchmark,\nwhich includes 9 common datasets spanning four major BioNLP tasks.

While extant literature focuses on human reluctance to follow\nalgorithmic advice, we reverse the perspective by investigating how AI agents\nbased on large language models (LLMs) assess and integrate human input. Our\nwork addresses a pressing managerial constraint: firms barred from deploying\nLLMs directly due to privacy concerns can still leverage them as mediating\ntools (for instance, anonymized outputs or decision pipelines) to guide\nhigh-stakes choices like pricing or discounts without exposing proprietary\ndata. Through a controlled prediction task, we analyze how an LLM-based AI\nagent weights human versus algorithmic predictions. We find that the AI system\nsystematically discounts human advice, penalizing human errors more severely\nthan algorithmic errors--a bias exacerbated when the agent's identity (human vs\nAI) is disclosed and the human is positioned second. These results reveal a\ndisconnect between AI-generated trust metrics and the actual influence of human\njudgment, challenging assumptions about equitable human-AI collaboration. Our\nfindings offer three key contributions. First, we identify a reverse algorithm\naversion phenomenon, where AI agents undervalue human input despite comparable\nerror rates. Second, we demonstrate how disclosure and positional bias interact\nto amplify this effect, with implications for system design.

In this paper, we consider a single-hop wireless\nbroadcast network with sources transmitting updates of different sizes to a\nbase station over unreliable links.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band\nbosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid\nand normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can\nbe easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have\ndetermined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal\ndensity by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the\nvelocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we\ninvestigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and\nexcitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities\nexplicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly\nproportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the\ncompressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid\ndensity depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of\nU(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we\nhave observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly\nproportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum\nmetric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the\nexcitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid\ndensity of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction\nparameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid\ndensities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation\ntheory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior\nof a flat band BEC.",

The two-qubit quantum Rabi\nmodel (2QQRM), a natural extension of the quantum Rabi model, describes two\nqubits coupled to a single bosonic mode and has been extensively studied in\ncavity quantum electrodynamics, superconducting circuits, and quantum\ninformation science. In this work, we investigate the persistence of quantum\ncorrelations and non-classical states in the 2QQRM at thermal equilibrium,\nfocusing on the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. Through a\nsystematic analysis of quantumness quantifiers, we demonstrate the emergence of\nlong-lived quantum correlations, even in the presence of thermal noise.\nNotably, we uncover striking phenomena arising from the interplay between\ndetuning and deep strong-coupling: in the high-frequency limit, where the qubit\nenergy exceeds the cavity-mode energy, quantum criticality emerges, leading to\na high degree of photon squeezing. In contrast, the opposite regime is\ncharacterized by robust qubit-qubit quantum correlations. Importantly, we show\nthat both dispersive regimes exhibit quantum features that are remarkably\nrobust to parameter fluctuations, making them advantageous for maintaining\nquantum coherence. These results highlight the exceptional resilience of\nquantum resources in the 2QQRM and provide valuable insights for developing\nquantum technologies operating under realistic, finite-temperature conditions.",

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of tree species based on Terrestrial Laser Scanning\n(TLS) and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) is essential for biodiversity\nconservation. While advanced deep learning models for 3D point cloud\nclassification have demonstrated strong performance in this domain, their high\ncomplexity often hinders the development of efficient, low-computation\narchitectures. In this paper, we introduce STFT-KAN, a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold\nnetwork that integrates the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), which can\nreplace the standard linear layer with activation. We implemented STFT-KAN\nwithin a lightweight version of DGCNN, called liteDGCNN, to classify tree\nspecies using the TLS data. Our experiments show that STFT-KAN outperforms\nexisting KAN variants by effectively balancing model complexity and performance\nwith parameter count reduction, achieving competitive results compared to\nMLP-based models. Additionally, we evaluated a hybrid architecture that\ncombines MLP in edge convolution with STFT-KAN in other layers, achieving\ncomparable performance to MLP models while reducing the parameter count by 50%\nand 75% compared to other KAN-based variants. Furthermore, we compared our\nmodel to leading 3D point cloud learning approaches, demonstrating that\nSTFT-KAN delivers competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art method\nPointMLP lite with an 87% reduction in parameter count.",

We present a multi-wavelength polarimetric survey of five\nevolved binary systems - AR Pup, HR 4049, HR 4226, U Mon, and V709 Car - using\nthe Very Large Telescope SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument. Post-AGB discs show\nsignificant polarimetric brightness at optical and near-IR wavelengths, often\nexceeding 1% of the system's total intensity. We also measured a maximum\nfractional polarisation of the scattered light for AR Pup of ~0.7 in the V-band\nand ~0.55 in the I-band. To investigate wavelength-dependent polarisation, we\ncombine the SPHERE/ZIMPOL dataset with results from previous SPHERE/IRDIS\nstudies. This analysis reveals that post-AGB discs exhibit a grey to blue\npolarimetric colour in the optical and near-IR. Along with high fractional\npolarisation of the scattered light and polarised intensity distribution, these\nfindings are consistent with a surface dust composition dominated by porous\naggregates, reinforcing independent observational evidence for such grains in\npost-AGB circumbinary discs. We also find evidence of diverse disc geometries\nwithin the post-AGB sample, including arcs, asymmetries and significant\nvariations in disc size across optical and near-IR wavelengths for some systems\n(U Mon, V709 Car).

Benchmarking experiments and ablation studies on both\nsynthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\naccelerator.

These factors introduce fluctuations and distortions, making\nsecond derivative calculations highly sensitive and error-prone. Traditional\nsmoothing methods, such as the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter and AC modulation\ntechniques, rely on local data correlations and struggle to differentiate\nbetween noise and meaningful plasma behavior.

    "abstract": "The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens\nnew ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcends the\nprocess of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information\nsystems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core,\nautonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows\nto perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we further elaborate on the\nconcept of autonomous GIS and present a conceptual framework that defines its\nfive autonomous goals, five autonomous levels, five core functions, and three\noperational scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial\ndata retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS\nagents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research\ndirections, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision-cores, autonomous\nmodeling, and examining the societal and practical implications of autonomous\nGIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this\npaper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to\nautonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance geospatial solutions to\npressing global challenges. Meanwhile, as we design and deploy increasingly\nintelligent geospatial systems, we carry a responsibility to ensure they are\ndeveloped in socially responsible ways, serve the public good, and support the\ncontinued value of human geographic insight in an AI-augmented future.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the notion of quasi-triangular decomposition for\nvertex operator algebras, which arise naturally in the lattice and affine VOAs\nand is a generalization of the triangular decomposition of a semisimple Lie\nalgebra. The quasi-triangular decomposition leads to a new construction of\nVerma-type induced modules for the VOA embedding $U\\hookrightarrow V$. We focus\non a typical example of VOA embedding $V_P\\hookrightarrow V_{A_2}$ given by a\nparabolic-type subVOA arising from a quasi-triangular decomposition of the\nlattice VOA $V_{A_2}$ and determine the induced modules. To achieve this goal,\nwe prove that the Zhu's algebra $A(V_P)$ is a nilpotent extension of a\nskew-polynomial algebra. Using the generators and relations description of\n$A(V_P)$, we classify all the irreducible modules over $V_P$ and determine\ntheir inductions to the $V_{A_2}$-modules.",

Understanding intrinsic motivation is a\nlong-standing challenge in both cognitive science and artificial intelligence;\nnumerous objectives have been proposed and used to train agents, yet there\nremains a gap between human and agent exploration. We directly compare adults,\nchildren, and AI agents in a complex open-ended environment, Crafter, and study\nhow common intrinsic objectives: Entropy, Information Gain, and Empowerment,\nrelate to their behavior. We find that only Entropy and Empowerment are\nconsistently positively correlated with human exploration progress, indicating\nthat these objectives may better inform intrinsic reward design for agents.\nFurthermore, across agents and humans we observe that Entropy initially\nincreases rapidly, then plateaus, while Empowerment increases continuously,\nsuggesting that state diversity may provide more signal in early exploration,\nwhile advanced exploration should prioritize control. Finally, we find\npreliminary evidence that private speech utterances, and particularly goal\nverbalizations, may aid exploration in children.

Recent advances in data collection have enabled the\nobservation of such data over extended periods of time and between large\npopulations of actors. Building on Relational Event Models, we propose the\n\"Durational Event Model\" as a framework for studying durational events by\nseparately modeling event incidence and duration.

Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate several\nadvantages of this approach over traditional Newton-Raphson-based methods.

These bots, often\nemployed for the dissemination of malicious propaganda and manipulation of\npublic opinion, wield significant influence in social media spheres with\nfar-reaching implications for electoral processes, political campaigns and\ninternational conflicts. Swift and accurate identification of inorganic\naccounts is of paramount importance in mitigating their detrimental effects.\nThis research paper focuses on the identification of such accounts and explores\nvarious effective methods for their detection through machine learning\ntechniques. In response to the pervasive presence of bots in the contemporary\ndigital landscape, this study extracts temporal and semantic features from\ntweet behaviors and proposes a bot detection algorithm utilizing fundamental\nmachine learning approaches, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and\nk-means clustering. Furthermore, the research ranks the importance of these\nextracted features for each detection technique and also provides uncertainty\nquantification using a distribution free method, called the conformal\nprediction, thereby contributing to the development of effective strategies for\ncombating the prevalence of inorganic accounts in social media platforms.",
