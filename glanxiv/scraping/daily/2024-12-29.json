    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance\nin complex multimodal tasks. However, these models still suffer from\nhallucinations, particularly when required to implicitly recognize or infer\ndiverse visual entities from images for complex vision-language tasks. To\naddress this challenge, we propose HALLUCINOGEN, a novel visual question\nanswering (VQA) benchmark that employs contextual reasoning prompts as\nhallucination attacks to evaluate the extent of hallucination in\nstate-of-the-art LVLMs. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive study of the\nimplicit reasoning capabilities of these models by first categorizing visual\nentities based on the ease of recognition in an image as either salient\n(prominent, visibly recognizable objects such as a car) or latent entities\n(such as identifying a disease from a chest X-ray), which are not readily\nvisible and require domain knowledge or contextual reasoning for accurate\ninference. Next, we design hallucination attacks for both types of entities to\nassess hallucinations in LVLMs while performing various vision-language tasks,\nsuch as locating or reasoning about specific entities within an image, where\nmodels must perform implicit reasoning by verifying the existence of the\nqueried entity within the image before generating responses. Finally, our\nextensive evaluations of eleven LVLMs, including powerful open-source models\n(like LLaMA-3.2 and DeepSeek-V2), commercial models like Gemini, and two\nhallucination mitigation strategies across multiple datasets, demonstrate that\ncurrent LVLMs remain susceptible to hallucination attacks.",

The\npolygenic risk score (PRS) is an example of such a scenario, where many genetic\nvariants are used as predictors for complex traits, each contributing only a\nsmall amount of information. Although PRS has been a standard tool in genetic\npredictions, its uncertainty remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim\nto establish the asymptotic normality of PRS in high-dimensional predictions\nwithout sparsity constraints. We investigate the popular marginal and\nridge-type estimators in PRS applications, developing central limit theorems\nfor both individual-level predicted values (e.g., genetically predicted human\nheight) and cohort-level prediction accuracy measures (e.g., overall predictive\n$R$-squared in the testing dataset). Our results demonstrate that ignoring the\nprediction-induced uncertainty can lead to substantial underestimation of the\ntrue variance of PRS-based estimators, which in turn may cause overconfidence\nin the accuracy of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. These findings\nprovide key insights omitted by existing first-order asymptotic studies of\nhigh-dimensional sparsity-free predictions, which often focus solely on the\npoint limits of predictive risks. We develop novel and flexible second-order\nrandom matrix theory results to assess the asymptotic normality of functionals\nwith a general covariance matrix, without assuming Gaussian distributions for\nthe data.

    "abstract": "While conventional computer vision emphasizes pixel-level and feature-based\nobjectives, medical image analysis of intricate biological structures\nnecessitates explicit representation of their complex topological properties.\nDespite their successes, deep learning models often struggle to accurately\ncapture the connectivity and continuity of fine, sometimes pixel-thin, yet\ncritical structures due to their reliance on implicit learning from data. Such\nshortcomings can significantly impact the reliability of analysis results and\nhinder clinical decision-making. To address this challenge, we introduce\nConformable Convolution, a novel convolutional layer designed to explicitly\nenforce topological consistency. Conformable Convolution learns adaptive kernel\noffsets that preferentially focus on regions of high topological significance\nwithin an image. This prioritization is guided by our proposed Topological\nPosterior Generator (TPG) module, which leverages persistent homology. The TPG\nmodule identifies key topological features and guides the convolutional layers\nby applying persistent homology to feature maps transformed into cubical\ncomplexes. Our proposed modules are architecture-agnostic, enabling them to be\nintegrated seamlessly into various architectures. We showcase the effectiveness\nof our framework in the segmentation task, where preserving the\ninterconnectedness of structures is critical. Experimental results on three\ndiverse datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively preserves the\ntopology in the segmentation downstream task, both quantitatively and\nqualitatively.",

We conducted extensive simulations which\nfound that LEARNER often outperforms the benchmark approach that only uses the\ntarget population data, especially as the signal-to-noise ratio in the source\npopulation increases. We also performed an illustrative application and\nempirical comparison of LEARNER and benchmark approaches in a re-analysis of\nsummary statistics from a genome-wide association study in the BioBank Japan\ncohort.

    "abstract": "In recent years, it has become popular to tackle image restoration tasks with\na single pretrained diffusion model (DM) and data-fidelity guidance, instead of\ntraining a dedicated deep neural network per task. However, such \"zero-shot\"\nrestoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs)\nfor performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the\noriginal generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs\nhave been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models\n(CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works\nthat use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning\nof the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during\nthe fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot\nrestoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It\nis based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization,\nback-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We\ndemonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution,\ndeblurring and inpainting.

One effective method involves estimating the\ncoarse-grained phase-space density (PSD) of the galactic DM component. By\ncomparing this PSD with that of DM particles produced in the early Universe, it\nis possible to establish lower bounds on the DM particle mass. These\nconstraints are particularly relevant for models of warm DM, such as those\ninvolving sterile neutrinos. Utilizing the GravSphere code, we obtain a fit of\nthe DM PSD based on the latest reliable stellar dynamics data for twenty of the\ndarkest dSphs, refining earlier lower bounds on sterile neutrino masses in\nnon-resonant production scenarios. Additionally, we introduce an alternative\napproach involving the Excess Mass Function (EMF), which yields even tighter\nconstraints. Specifically, using the maximum PSD, we derive a lower bound of\n$m>1.02\\,$keV at 95% confidence level, while the EMF method provides a stronger\nlimit of $m>1.98\\,$keV at 95% CL. For the general thermal relic fermion dark\nmatter mass the limits translate into $m>0.28\\,$keV and $m>0.49\\,$keV,\nrespectively. Both methods are versatile and can be extended to more complex DM\nproduction mechanisms in the early Universe.

Unlike low-resource\nlanguages, which rely on limited but existent corpora, no-resource languages\noften have fewer than 100 sentences available for training. This work explores\nthe problem of no-resource translation through three distinct workflows:\nfine-tuning of translation-specific models, in-context learning with large\nlanguage models (LLMs) using chain-of-reasoning prompting, and direct prompting\nwithout reasoning. Using Owens Valley Paiute as a case study, we demonstrate\nthat no-resource translation demands fundamentally different approaches from\nlow-resource scenarios, as traditional approaches to machine translation, such\nas those that work for low-resource languages, fail. Empirical results reveal\nthat, although traditional approaches fail, the in-context learning\ncapabilities of general-purpose large language models enable no-resource\nlanguage translation that outperforms low-resource translation approaches and\nrivals human translations (BLEU 0.45-0.6); specifically, chain-of-reasoning\nprompting outperforms other methods for larger corpora, while direct prompting\nexhibits advantages in smaller datasets. As these approaches are\nlanguage-agnostic, they have potential to be generalized to translation tasks\nfrom a wide variety of no-resource languages without expert input.

The design of the methods\nfollows a novel training approach based on two key principles: (a) the discrete\nloss is designed using a time-discrete framework, and (b) the final loss\nformulation incorporates Runge--Kutta or time-Galerkin discretization in a\ncarefully structured manner. We then demonstrate that the resulting methods\ninherit the stability properties of the Runge--Kutta or time-Galerkin schemes,\nand furthermore, their computational behavior aligns with that of the original\ntime discrete method used in their formulation. In our analysis, we focus on\nlinear parabolic equations, demonstrating both the stability of the methods and\nthe convergence of the discrete minimizers to solutions of the underlying\nevolution PDE. An important novel aspect of our work is the derivation of\nmaximal regularity (MR) estimates for B-stable Runge--Kutta schemes and both\ncontinuous and discontinuous Galerkin time discretizations. This allows us to\nprovide new energy-based proofs for maximal regularity estimates previously\nestablished by Kov\\'acs, Li, and Lubich, now in the Hilbert space setting and\nwith the flexibility of variable time steps.",

    "abstract": "This work in the field of developmental cognitive robotics aims to devise a\nnew domain bridging between reinforcement learning and imitation learning, with\na model of the intrinsic motivation for learning agents to learn with guidance\nfrom tutors multiple tasks, including sequential tasks. The main contribution\nhas been to propose a common formulation of intrinsic motivation based on\nempirical progress for a learning agent to choose automatically its learning\ncurriculum by actively choosing its learning strategy for simple or sequential\ntasks: which task to learn, between autonomous exploration or imitation\nlearning, between low-level actions or task decomposition, between several\ntutors. The originality is to design a learner that benefits not only passively\nfrom data provided by tutors, but to actively choose when to request tutoring\nand what and whom to ask. The learner is thus more robust to the quality of the\ntutoring and learns faster with fewer demonstrations. We developed the\nframework of socially guided intrinsic motivation with machine learning\nalgorithms to learn multiple tasks by taking advantage of the generalisability\nproperties of human demonstrations in a passive manner or in an active manner\nthrough requests of demonstrations from the best tutor for simple and composing\nsubtasks. The latter relies on a representation of subtask composition proposed\nfor a construction process, which should be refined by representations used for\nobservational processes of analysing human movements and activities of daily\nliving. With the outlook of a language-like communication with the tutor, we\ninvestigated the emergence of a symbolic representation of the continuous\nsensorimotor space and of tasks using intrinsic motivation. We proposed within\nthe reinforcement learning framework, a reward function for interacting with\ntutors for automatic curriculum learning in multi-task learning.",

Specifically, we investigate three memory-based dispersal scenarios:\ngradient-based movement, where individuals respond to environmental gradients;\nenvironment matching, which promotes uniform distribution within a population;\nand location-based movement, where decisions rely solely on local suitability.\nThese scenarios correspond to diffusion advection, Fickian diffusion, and\nFokker-Planck diffusion models, respectively. We focus on the derivation of\nthese memory-based movement models using three approaches: spatial and temporal\ndiscretization, patch models in continuous time, and discrete-velocity jump\nprocess. These derivations highlight how different ways of using memory lead to\ndistinct mathematical models. Numerical simulations reveal that the three\ndispersal scenarios exhibit distinct behaviors under memory-induced repulsive\nand attractive conditions. The diffusion advection and Fokker-Planck models\ndisplay wiggle patterns and aggregation phenomena, while simulations of the\nFickian diffusion model consistently stabilize to uniform constant states.",

Recent research has explored learning the worst-case\ndistribution using neural network-based generative models to address these\ncomputational challenges but lacks algorithmic convergence guarantees. This\npaper bridges this theoretical gap by presenting an iterative algorithm to\nsolve such a minimax problem, achieving global convergence under mild\nassumptions and leveraging technical tools from vector space minimax\noptimization and convex analysis in the space of continuous probability\ndensities. In particular, leveraging Brenier's theorem, we represent the\nworst-case distribution as a transport map applied to a continuous reference\nmeasure and reformulate the regularized discrepancy-based DRO as a minimax\nproblem in the Wasserstein space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\nworst-case distribution can be efficiently computed using a modified\nJordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme with sufficiently large regularization\nparameters for commonly used discrepancy functions, linked to the radius of the\nambiguity set. Additionally, we derive the global convergence rate and quantify\nthe total number of subgradient and inexact modified JKO iterations required to\nobtain approximate stationary points.

However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their\nability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining\nsemantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we\nprovide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what\nthe pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in\naccordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take\ninspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy\n\"graph tracing\" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts\nseen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the\ngraph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given\nexemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze\nintermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of\ncontext is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic\nrepresentations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure.\nFurther, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their\nsemantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure\nis still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the\npretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy\nminimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an\nimplicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall,\nour findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model\nrepresentations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.",

We flow to this theory from pure $\\mathscr{N}=2$ SUSY Yang-Mills\ntheory with the same gauge group, by giving a SUSY-breaking mass $M$ to the\nscalars in the $\\mathscr{N} = 2$ vector multiplet. This flow can be analyzed\nrigorously at small $M$, where it leads to a deconfined vacuum at the origin of\nthe $\\mathscr{N}=2$ Coulomb branch. The analysis can be extended to all $M$\nusing an Abelian dual description that arises from the $N$ multi-monopole\npoints of the $\\mathscr{N} = 2$ theory. At each such point, there are $N-1$\nhypermultiplet Higgs fields $h_m^{i = 1, 2}$, which are $SU(2)_R$ doublets. We\nprovide a detailed study of the phase diagram as a function of $M$, by\nanalyzing the semi-classical phases of the dual using a combination of analytic\nand numerical techniques. The result is a cascade of first-order phase\ntransitions, along which the Higgs fields $h_m^i$ successively turn on, and\nwhich interpolates between the Coulomb branch at small $M$, where all $h_m^i =\n0$, and a maximal Higgs branch, where all $h_m^i \\neq 0$, at sufficiently large\n$M$. We show that this maximal Higgs branch precisely matches the confining and\nchiral symmetry breaking phase of two-flavor adjoint QCD, including its broken\nand unbroken symmetries, its massless spectrum, and the expected large-$N$\nscaling of various observables. The spontaneous breaking pattern $SU(2)_R \\to\nU(1)_R$, consistent with the Vafa-Witten theorem, is ensured by an intricate\nalignment mechanism for the $h_m^i$ in the dual, and leads to a\n$\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^1$ sigma model of increasing radius along the cascade.",

    "abstract": "The growing demand for efficient cloud storage solutions has led to the\nwidespread adoption of Solid-State Drives (SSDs) for caching in cloud block\nstorage systems. The management of data writes to SSD caches plays a crucial\nrole in improving overall system performance, reducing latency, and extending\nthe lifespan of storage devices. A critical challenge arises from the large\nvolume of write-only data, which significantly impacts the performance of SSD\ncaches when handled inefficiently. Specifically, writes that have not been read\nfor a certain period may introduce unnecessary write traffic to the SSD cache\nwithout offering substantial benefits for cache performance. This paper\nproposes a novel approach to mitigate this issue by leveraging machine learning\ntechniques to dynamically optimize the write policy in cloud-based storage\nsystems. The proposed method identifies write-only data and selectively filters\nit out in real-time, thereby minimizing the number of unnecessary write\noperations and improving the overall performance of the cache system.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed machine learning-based\npolicy significantly outperforms traditional approaches by reducing the number\nof harmful writes and optimizing cache utilization. This solution is\nparticularly suitable for cloud environments with varying and unpredictable\nworkloads, where traditional cache management strategies often fall short.",

To mitigate this\nissue, improvements have been made by pruning unnecessary Gaussians, either\nthrough a hand-crafted criterion or by using learned masks. However, these\nmethods deterministically remove Gaussians based on a snapshot of the pruning\nmoment, leading to sub-optimized reconstruction performance from a long-term\nperspective. To address this issue, we introduce MaskGaussian, which models\nGaussians as probabilistic entities rather than permanently removing them, and\nutilize them according to their probability of existence. To achieve this, we\npropose a masked-rasterization technique that enables unused yet\nprobabilistically existing Gaussians to receive gradients, allowing for dynamic\nassessment of their contribution to the evolving scene and adjustment of their\nprobability of existence. Hence, the importance of Gaussians iteratively\nchanges and the pruned Gaussians are selected diversely. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving better\nrendering quality with fewer Gaussians than previous pruning methods, pruning\nover 60% of Gaussians on average with only a 0.02 PSNR decline.

The ontology endorsed by the View from\nEverywhere, termed Relality, is inherently fragmented, yet not solipsistic:\ninter-translatability between distinct, frame-dependent realities is possible.\nThe paper challenges perspectivalist metaphysics and critiques the reliance on\nframe-free structures, arguing they obscure both empirical content and physical\ninformation. Central to the discussion is the challenge of providing a\nperspicuous and parsimonious characterisation of the gauge-invariant content of\nthe theory.",

However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally\nfails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address\ndatasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce\nGoal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned\ndiffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging\nrecent advancements in generative modelling, GODA incorporates a novel\nreturn-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically,\nwe introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based\nguidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution\nrepresentation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with\nselectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited\noptimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated\nconditioning method for processing noisy inputs and conditions, enhancing the\ncapture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark\nand real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to\ndemonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across\nvarious offline RL algorithms.",

To date, many custom-built\nBrillouin Microscopes suffer from temporal instabilities that impact their\nperformances, showing drifts in the acquired spectra during time that may lead\nto inconsistencies between data acquired at different days. A further challenge\nfor standard Brillouin Microscopes is the calibration of the spectrometer: the\ncurrently accepted protocol in literature uses known Brillouin shifts of water\nand methanol to reconstruct the dispersion curve, but this approach is highly\ninfluenced by external factors that are unrelated to spectrometer's\nperformances. Manual and frequent realignments of the spectrometer and repeated\ncalibrations with standard materials are thus needed to address these issues.\nHere, we show an innovative method to remove temporal instabilities of a\nstandard Brillouin Microscope by inserting an Electro-Optic Modulator (EOM)\nthat can be used: i) as a reference signal during measurements; ii) as a\ncalibrator, allowing the reconstruction of the spectrometer dispersion curve\nwith high precision, in an automatic pipeline and without the need for\nreference samples; iii) as a tool to detect and compensate for temporal drifts\nthrough a feedback control in a closed loop. We here show that our Brillouin\nMicroscope, equipped with an EOM and a tuneable laser, is able to automatically\nacquire data for more than 2 days without the need to realign the spectrometer;\nretrieved Brillouin shifts and widths showed superior stability in time than\nstandard Brillouin Microscopes.",

In dense prediction settings, target signal maps\nand input images are pixel-wise aligned.

Diffusion bridge models, which support\ndata-to-data generation between two general data distributions, offer a\npromising alternative, but they typically fail to exploit the rich visual\npriors embedded in large pretrained foundation models.

    "abstract": "Urban regeneration presents significant challenges within the context of\nurbanization, requiring adaptive approaches to tackle evolving needs.\nLeveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we propose Cyclical\nUrban Planning (CUP), a new paradigm that continuously generates, evaluates,\nand refines urban plans in a closed-loop. Specifically, our multi-agent\nLLM-based framework consists of three key components: (1) Planning, where LLM\nagents generate and refine urban plans based on contextual data; (2) Living,\nwhere agents simulate the behaviors and interactions of residents, modeling\nlife in the urban environment; and (3) Judging, which involves evaluating plan\neffectiveness and providing iterative feedback for improvement. The cyclical\nprocess enables a dynamic and responsive planning approach. Experiments on the\nreal-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as a\ncontinuous and adaptive planning process.",

To address this, we propose $\\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a\ntraining-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly\nreduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video\ncompression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect\nidentifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs'\nlearned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress\nnon-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe\nenables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming\nsimilar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME,\nMLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench.

    "abstract": "Efficient parallelization of Large Language Models (LLMs) with long sequences\nis essential but challenging due to their significant computational and memory\ndemands, particularly stemming from communication bottlenecks in attention\nmechanisms. While sequence parallelism (SP) has been introduced as a potential\nsolution, existing methods often suffer from limited scalability or\ninefficiency, rendering their effectiveness.\n  Ring-Attention demonstrates the potential for scaling sequence processing but\nfaces significant limitations due to its reliance on peer-to-peer (P2P)\ncommunication and inefficient utilization of network resources. As the degree\nof SP increases, the quadratic decrease in computation time per step contrasts\nsharply with the linear reduction in communication volume, exacerbating\ncommunication bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose TokenRing, a\nfine-grained parallel framework that leverages bidirectional P2P communication\nto effectively overlap computation and data transmission. By partitioning the\nattention block and concurrently transmitting Query and block outputs (i.e.,\n$block\\_out$ and $block\\_lse$) within a fully connected mesh topology,\nTokenRing achieves significant reductions in communication overhead and better\nload balancing. These innovations improve the scalability and efficiency of\ndistributed Transformer models, particularly for long-context sequences.\nExperimental results demonstrate that TokenRing enhances throughput and reduces\ncommunication latency. Moreover, its design adapts seamlessly to various\nmulti-GPU interconnect solutions, such as Huawei Ascend, ensuring broad\ncompatibility and cost-effectiveness for distributed LLM inference and\ntraining.

Primordial gas structures to evolve galactic bulges are supposed to be\nformed at $z \\sim$ 10 and the core region, called the nuclear region (NR) here,\nis considered to be a place for a MBH to grow to the SMBH. The down-sizing\nbehavior requires the MBH to significantly increase the mass in a time $\\sim$ 1\nGyr. The rapid mass increase is discussed to be realized only when the MBH\nstays in a very high density region such as a core of a molecular cloud\nthroughout the period $\\sim$ 1 Gyr. According to these arguments, the MBHs\nformed from the population III stars born in the mini halos at $z \\sim$ 20 - 30\nare excluded from the candidates for the seed black hole to the SMBH and only\nthe MBHs from the population II stars born in the core of the central molecular\ncloud (CMC) in the NR remain as them. The MBHs in the dense core of the CMC\nstarted increasing the mass through mass-accretion and the most massive black\nhole (MMBH) got the most rapid evolution, possibly restraining relatively slow\nevolutions of the less massive black holes. Dynamical interactions of the MMBH\nwith the ambient MCs induced the wandering motion and the further\nmass-increase. However, when the MMBH mass exceeded a boundary mass, the\ndynamical friction with the field stars brakes the MMBH wandering and the mass\naccretion. This scenario can semi-quantitatively reproduce both the down-sizing\nbehavior and the SMBH mass - bulge mass correlation with reasonable parameter\nvalues.",

    "abstract": "Realistic metric spaces (such as road/transportation networks) tend to be\nmuch more algorithmically tractable than general metrics. In an attempt to\nformalize this intuition, Abraham et al. (SODA 2010, JACM 2016) introduced the\nnotion of highway dimension. A weighted graph $G$ has highway dimension $h$ if\nfor every ball $B$ of radius $\\approx 4r$ there is a hitting set of size $h$\nhitting all the shortest paths of length $>r$ in $B$. Unfortunately, this\ndefinition fails to incorporate some very natural metric spaces such as the\ngrid graph, and the Euclidean plane.\n  We relax the definition of highway dimension by demanding to hit only\napproximate shortest paths. In addition to generalizing the original\ndefinition, this new definition also incorporates all doubling spaces (in\nparticular the grid graph and the Euclidean plane). We then construct a PTAS\nfor TSP under this new definition (improving a QPTAS w.r.t. the original more\nrestrictive definition of Feldmann et al. (SICOMP 2018)). Finally, we develop a\nbasic metric toolkit for spaces with small highway dimension by constructing\npadded decompositions, sparse covers/partitions, and tree covers.

The formation\nunder consideration includes $N$ under-actuated deputy satellites and an\nuncontrolled virtual or physical chief spacecraft. The guidance problem is\nformulated as a trajectory optimization problem that incorporates typical\ndynamical and physical constraints, alongside a minimum acceleration threshold.\nThis latter constraint arises from the physical limitations of the adopted\nlow-thrust technology, which is commonly employed for precise, close-range\nrelative orbital maneuvers. The guidance and control problem is addressed in\ntwo frameworks: centralized and distributed. The centralized approach provides\na fuel-optimal solution, but it is practical only for formations with a small\nnumber of deputies. The distributed approach is more scalable but yields\nsub-optimal solutions. In the centralized framework, the chief is a physical\nsatellite responsible for all calculations, while in the distributed framework,\nthe chief is treated as a virtual point mass orbiting the Earth, and each\ndeputy performs its own guidance and control calculations onboard. The study\nemphasizes the spaceborne implementation of the closed-loop control system,\naiming for a reliable and automated solution to the optimal control problem. To\nthis end, the risk of infeasibility is mitigated through first identifying the\nconstraints that pose a potential threat of infeasibility, then properly\nsoftening them.

Math.\nSoc., 147(11):4733--4744, 2019], there has been a recent growing body of\nliterature connecting repeated differentiation of polynomials to free additive\nconvolution semigroups in free probability. Roughly, this connection states\nthat in the large degree limit the empirical measure of the roots after many\nderivatives is, up to a rescaling, the original empirical measure of the roots\nraised to a free additive convolution power. If the original real roots satisfy\nsome bounds and the number of derivatives is such that the remaining degree is\nfixed, then these high derivatives converge to the Hermite polynomials. In the\ncontext of convolution semigroups and finite free probability these results\nhave a natural interpretation as a central limit theorem for repeated\ndifferentiation. We consider the case when these root bounds are removed and\nidentify the potential limits of repeated differentiation as the real rooted\nAppell sequences. We prove that a sequence of polynomials is in the domain of\nattraction of an Appell sequence exactly when the empirical measures of the\nroots are, up to a rescaling, in the domain of attraction of a free infinitely\ndivisible distribution naturally associated to the Appell sequence. We\nadditionally extend these notions of infinite divisibility and fractional\nconvolution semigroups to rectangular finite free probability. Our approach is\nbased on the finite free R-transform of the polynomials, providing a step\ntowards an analytic theory of finite free probability. These transforms provide\na clear connection between Appell polynomials and free infinitely divisible\ndistributions, where the finite free R-transform of a real rooted Appell\npolynomial is a truncated version of the R-transform of an infinitely divisible\ndistribution.",

Recently, there has been growing interest in learning\ngenerative models, in particular variational autoencoder (VAE), to for\nmultimodal representation learning especially in the case of missing\nmodalities. The primary goal of these models is to learn a modality-invariant\nand modality-specific representation that characterizes information across\nmultiple modalities. Previous attempts at multimodal VAEs approach this mainly\nthrough the lens of experts, aggregating unimodal inference distributions with\na product of experts (PoE), a mixture of experts (MoE), or a combination of\nboth. In this paper, we provide an alternative generic and theoretical\nformulation of multimodal VAE through the lens of barycenter. We first show\nthat PoE and MoE are specific instances of barycenters, derived by minimizing\nthe asymmetric weighted KL divergence to unimodal inference distributions. Our\nnovel formulation extends these two barycenters to a more flexible choice by\nconsidering different types of divergences. In particular, we explore the\nWasserstein barycenter defined by the 2-Wasserstein distance, which better\npreserves the geometry of unimodal distributions by capturing both\nmodality-specific and modality-invariant representations compared to KL\ndivergence. Empirical studies on three multimodal benchmarks demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

The set-valued objective mapping under consideration\nis given by a finite number of vector-valued functions that are twice\ncontinuously differentiable. To find the necessary optimality condition for\nweak minimal points with the help of the proposed quasi-Newton method, we use\nthe concept of partition and formulate a family of vector optimization\nproblems. The evaluation of necessary optimality condition for finding the\nweakly minimal points involves the computation of the approximate Hessian of\nevery objective function, which is done by a quasi-Newton scheme for vector\noptimization problems. In the proposed quasi-Newton method, we derive a\nsequence of iterative points that exhibits convergence to a point which\nsatisfies the derived necessary optimality condition for weakly minimal points.\nAfter that, we find a descent direction for a suitably chosen vector\noptimization problem from this family of vector optimization problems and\nupdate from the current iterate to the next iterate. The proposed quasi-Newton\nmethod for set optimization problems is not a direct extension of that for\nvector optimization problems, as the selected vector optimization problem\nvaries across the iterates.

    "abstract": "Current fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) architectures utilize several\nencoding techniques to enable reliable logical operations with restricted qubit\nconnectivity. However, such logical operations demand additional memory\noverhead to ensure fault tolerance. Since the main obstacle to practical\nquantum computing is the limited qubit count, our primary mission is to design\nfloorplans that can reduce memory overhead without compromising computational\ncapability. Despite extensive efforts to explore FTQC architectures, even the\ncurrent state-of-the-art floorplan strategy devotes 50% of memory space to this\noverhead, not to data storage, to ensure unit-time random access to all logical\nqubits.\n  In this paper, we propose an FTQC architecture based on a novel floorplan\nstrategy, Load/Store Quantum Computer Architecture (LSQCA), which can achieve\nalmost 100% memory density. The idea behind our architecture is to separate all\nmemory regions into small computational space called Computational Registers\n(CR) and space-efficient memory space called Scan-Access Memory (SAM). We\ndefine an instruction set for these abstract structures and provide concrete\ndesigns named point-SAM and line-SAM architectures. With this design, we can\nimprove the memory density by allowing variable-latency memory access while\nconcealing the latency with other bottlenecks. We also propose optimization\ntechniques to exploit properties of quantum programs observed in our static\nanalysis, such as access locality in memory reference timestamps. Our numerical\nresults indicate that LSQCA successfully leverages this idea. In a\nresource-restricted situation, a specific benchmark shows that we can achieve\nabout 90% memory density with 5% increase in the execution time compared to a\nconventional floorplan, which achieves at most 50% memory density for unit-time\nrandom access.

Consequently, public\ndatasets from open-source platforms like HuggingFace have become popular,\nposing significant risks of data poisoning attacks. Existing backdoor defenses\nin NLP primarily focus on identifying and removing poisoned samples; however,\npurifying a backdoored model with these sample-cleaning approaches typically\nrequires expensive retraining. Therefore, we propose Greedy Module Substitution\n(GMS), which identifies and substitutes ''deadwood'' modules (i.e., components\ncritical to backdoor pathways) in a backdoored model to purify it. Our method\nrelaxes the common dependency of prior model purification methods on clean\ndatasets or clean auxiliary models. When applied to RoBERTa-large under\nbackdoor attacks, GMS demonstrates strong effectiveness across various\nsettings, particularly against widely recognized challenging attacks like LWS,\nachieving a post-purification attack success rate (ASR) of 9.7% on SST-2\ncompared to 58.8% for the best baseline approach.",

    "abstract": "Low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication networks have evolved into\nmega-constellations with hundreds to thousands of satellites inter-connecting\nwith inter-satellite links (ISLs). Network planning, which plans for network\nresources and architecture to improve the network performance and save\noperational costs, is crucial for satellite network management. However, due to\nthe large scale of mega-constellations, high dynamics of satellites, and\ncomplex distribution of real-world traffic, it is extremely challenging to\nconduct scalable network planning on mega-constellations with high performance.\nIn this paper, we propose SatFlow, a distributed and hierarchical network\nplanning framework to plan for the network topology, traffic allocation, and\nfine-grained ISL terminal power allocation for mega-constellations. To tackle\nthe hardness of the original problem, we decompose the grand problem into two\nhierarchical sub-problems, tackled by two-tier modules. A multi-agent\nreinforcement learning approach is proposed for the upper-level module so that\nthe overall laser energy consumption and ISL operational costs can be\nminimized; A distributed alternating step algorithm is proposed for the\nlower-level module so that the laser energy consumption could be minimized with\nlow time complexity for a given topology. Extensive simulations on various\nmega-constellations validate SatFlow's scalability on the constellation size,\nreducing the flow violation ratio by up to 21.0% and reducing the total costs\nby up to 89.4%, compared with various state-of-the-art benchmarks.",

The current study aims to evaluate and improve the accuracy of\npredicting children's externalizing problems with mother-child interaction\ndynamics. Method: This study used mother-child interaction dynamics during a\nchallenging puzzle task to predict children's externalizing problems six months\nlater (N=101, 46 boys, Mage=57.41 months, SD=6.58). Performance of the Residual\nDynamic Structural Equation Model (RDSEM) was compared with the Attention-based\nSequential Behavior Interaction Modeling (ASBIM) model, developed using the\ndeep learning techniques. Results: The RDSEM revealed that children whose\nmothers provided more autonomy support after increases of child defeat had\nlower levels of externalizing problems.

Previous studies used\nmeta-classifier-based membership inference attacks~(MIAs) with multi-layer\nperceptrons~(MLPs) to estimate privacy risks in location data, including when\nprotected by differential privacy (DP). In this work, however, we show that a\nsignificant gap exists between the expected attack accuracy given by DP and the\nempirical attack accuracy even with informed attackers (also known as DP\nattackers), indicating a potential underestimation of the privacy risk. To\nexplore the potential causes for the observed gap, we first propose two new\nmetric-based MIAs: the one-threshold attack and the two-threshold attack. We\nevaluate their performances on real-world location data and find that different\ndata distributions require different attack strategies for optimal performance:\nthe one-threshold attack is more effective with Gaussian DP noise, while the\ntwo-threshold attack performs better with Laplace DP noise. Comparing their\nperformance with one of the MLP-based attack models in previous works shows\nthat the MLP only learns the one-threshold rule, leading to a suboptimal\nperformance under the Laplace DP noise and an underestimation of the privacy\nrisk. Second, we theoretically prove that MLPs can encode complex rules~(\\eg,\nthe two-threshold attack rule), which can be learned when given a substantial\namount of training data. We conclude by discussing the implications of our\nfindings in practice, including broader applications extending beyond location\naggregates to any differentially private datasets containing multiple\nobservations per individual and how techniques such as synthetic data\ngeneration and pre-training might enable MLP to learn more complex optimal\nrules.",

This prompts an important question:\ncan robot models achieve better performance in multi-task , complex\nenvironments by reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific\nreasoning to guide action prediction? In this paper, we introduce\nChain-of-Affordance (CoA-VLA) , a novel approach to scaling robot models by\nincorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to\nfacilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the\nfollowing four types of affordances before taking action: (1) object affordance\n- what object to manipulate and where it is ; (2) grasp affordance - the\nspecific object part to grasp ; (3) spatial affordance - the optimal space to\nplace the object ; and (4) movement affordance-the collision - free path for\nmovement. We further transform each affordance into two prompting formats:\nvisual affordance and textual affordance. We introduce a novel vision-language\nco-injection module that integrates this knowledge into the policy network.\nThis allows the robot to leverage essential contextual information during\naction inference, resulting in improved precision and robustness. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that CoA-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art robot\nfoundation models, including OpenVLA and Octo, on a variety of tasks.\nFurthermore, CoA-VLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities, including\nrecognizing unseen object poses, identifying free space, and avoiding obstacles\nin novel environments.",

In this study, we explore a\nlead-free Samarium-based double perovskite oxide Sm$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (SNMO), as the\nactive absorber layer in an innovative inverted HTL-free PSC architecture.\nUsing SCAPS-1D simulations, we optimized the device configuration to achieve a\npower conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.93% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC)\nof 0.8 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.46 mA/cm2, and a fill\nfactor (FF) of 82.14%.

    "abstract": "The Bitcoin Network is a sophisticated accounting system that allows its\nunderlying cryptocurrency to be trusted even in the absence of a reliable\nfinancial authority. Given its undeniable success, the technology, generally\nreferred to as blockchain, has also been proposed as a means to improve legacy\naccounting systems. Accounting for real-world data, however, requires the\nintervention of a third party known as an Oracle, which, having not the same\ncharacteristics as a blockchain, could potentially reduce the expected\nintegration benefit. Through a systematic review of the literature, this study\naims to investigate whether the papers concerning blockchain integration in\naccounting consider and address the limitations posed by oracles. A broad\noverview of the limitations that emerged in the literature is provided and\ndistinguished according to the specific accounting integration. Results support\nthe view that although research on the subject counts numerous articles, actual\nstudies considering oracle limitations are lacking. Interestingly, despite the\nscarce production of papers addressing oracles in various accounting sectors,\nreporting for ESG already shows interesting workarounds for oracle limitations,\nwith permissioned chains envisioned as a valid support for the safe storage of\nsustainability data.",

    "abstract": "Explaining the results of clustering pipelines by unraveling the\ncharacteristics of each cluster is a challenging task, often addressed manually\nthrough visualizations and queries. Existing solutions from the domain of\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are largely ineffective for cluster\nexplanations, and interpretable-by-design clustering algorithms may be\nunsuitable when the clustering algorithm does not fit the data properties.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce Cluster-Explorer, a novel explainability\ntool for black-box clustering pipelines. Our approach formulates the\nexplanation of clusters as the identification of concise conjunctions of\npredicates that maximize the coverage of the cluster's data points while\nminimizing separation from other clusters. We achieve this by reducing the\nproblem to generalized frequent-itemsets mining (gFIM), where items correspond\nto explanation predicates, and itemset frequency indicates coverage. To enhance\nefficiency, we leverage inherent problem properties and implement attribute\nselection to further reduce computational costs. Experimental evaluations on a\nbenchmark collection of 98 clustering results, as well as a user study,\ndemonstrate the superiority of Cluster-Explorer in both explanation quality and\nexecution times compared to XAI baselines.",

    "abstract": "The increasing cybersecurity threats to critical manufacturing infrastructure\nnecessitate proactive strategies for vulnerability identification,\nclassification, and assessment. Traditional approaches, which define\nvulnerabilities as weaknesses in computational logic or information systems,\noften overlook the physical and cyber-physical dimensions critical to\nmanufacturing systems, comprising intertwined cyber, physical, and human\nelements. As a result, existing solutions fall short in addressing the complex,\ndomain-specific vulnerabilities of manufacturing environments. To bridge this\ngap, this work redefines vulnerabilities in the manufacturing context by\nintroducing a novel characterization based on the duality between\nvulnerabilities and defenses. Vulnerabilities are conceptualized as exploitable\ngaps within various defense layers, enabling a structured investigation of\nmanufacturing systems. This paper presents a manufacturing-specific\ncyber-physical defense-in-depth model, highlighting how security-aware\npersonnel, post-production inspection systems, and process monitoring\napproaches can complement traditional cyber defenses to enhance system\nresilience. Leveraging this model, we systematically identify and classify\nvulnerabilities across the manufacturing cyberspace, human element,\npost-production inspection systems, production process monitoring, and\norganizational policies and procedures. This comprehensive classification\nintroduces the first taxonomy of cyber-physical vulnerabilities in smart\nmanufacturing systems, providing practitioners with a structured framework for\naddressing vulnerabilities at both the system and process levels. Finally, the\neffectiveness of the proposed model and framework is demonstrated through an\nillustrative smart manufacturing system and its corresponding threat model.",

    "abstract": "Extracting information about a system's metastable ground state energy\nemploying functional methods usually hinges on utilizing the late-time behavior\nof the Euclidean propagator, practically impeding the possibility of\ndetermining decay widths of excited states. We demonstrate that such obstacles\ncan be surmounted by working with bounded time intervals, adapting the standard\ninstanton formalism to compute a finite-time amplitude corresponding to excited\nstate decay. This is achieved by projecting out the desired resonant energies\nutilizing carefully chosen approximations to the excited state wave functions\nin the false vacuum region. To carry out the calculation, we employ\nunconventional path integral techniques by considering the emerging amplitude\nas a single composite functional integral that includes fluctuations at the\nendpoints of the trajectories. This way, we explicitly compute the sought-after\ndecay widths, including their leading quantum corrections, for arbitrary\npotentials, demonstrating accordance with traditional WKB results. While the\ninitial starting point of weighting Euclidean propagator contributions\naccording to their endpoints using false vacuum states has been proposed\nearlier, we find several flaws in the published evaluation of the relevant\namplitudes. Although we show that the previous proposition of employing a\nsequential calculation scheme -- where the functional integral is evaluated\naround extremal trajectories with fixed endpoints, weighted only at a\nsubsequent stage -- can lead to the desired goal, the novel composite approach\nis found to be more concise and transparent.",

Most analytical placement models often rely on smooth\napproximations, thereby sacrificing the accuracy of wirelength estimation. To\nmitigate these inaccuracies, this paper introduces a novel approach that\ndirectly optimizes the original nonsmooth wirelength and proposes an innovative\npenalty model tailored for the global placement problem. Specifically, we\ntransform the non-overlapping constraints into rectified linear penalty\nfunctions, allowing for a more precise formulation of the problem.

To enhance the algorithm's performance, several\nadvanced techniques are further introduced, leading to significant improvements\nin both efficiency and solution quality.

However, dark energy--radiation equivalence may correspond to\na \\emph{cosmographic bound} since it strongly depends on how dark energy\nevolves. Accordingly, a possible model-independent bound on this time would\ngive hints on how dark energy evolves in time. In this respect, gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) may be used, in fact, as tracers to obtain cosmic constraints on\nthis equivalence. Consequently, based on observed GR data from the $E_{\\rm\np}$--$E_{\\rm iso}$ correlation, we here go beyond by simulating additional GRB\ndata points and investigating two distinct equivalence epochs: 1) dark\nenergy--radiation, and 2) dark energy--radiation with matter. We thus extract\nconstraints on the corresponding two redshifts adopting Monte Carlo Markov\nchain simulations by means of two methods: the first performing the GRB\ncalibration and the cosmological fit steps independently, and the second\nperforming these steps simultaneously by resorting a hierarchical Bayesian\nregression. To keep the analysis model-independent, we consider a generic dark\nenergy model, with the unique constraint to reduce to the $\\Lambda$CDM at\n$z=0$. Our findings are thus compared to theoretical predictions, indicating\nthat the $\\Lambda$CDM model is statistically favored to predict such an\nequivalence time, though a slow evolution with time cannot be fully excluded.\nFinally, we critically re-examine the Hubble constant tension in view of our\noutcomes.",

While one project-based company derived no benefit,\nothers achieved superior forecasts compared to naive estimators.\n  Our findings suggest that no single model is universally superior.

The findings reveal that MobileNet outperforms the other two models in\nterms of accuracy, achieving a validation accuracy of 95.94% and validation\nloss of 0.129. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the implementation\nprocess using MobileNet and discusses the implications of the findings.\n  The use of OCR for character recognition is of significant importance in the\nfield of epigraphy, specifically for the preservation and digitization of\nancient scripts. The results of this research paper demonstrate the\neffectiveness of using pre-trained CNNs for the recognition of Ashokan Brahmi\ncharacters.",

This method employs an\nApproximate Non-Local Total Variation algorithm to smooth the generated data, a\nbandpass filtering method based on Fourier Transform to eliminate noise, and\nDenoising Diffusion Implicit Models to accelerate sampling speed.

This behavior is attributed to strain-induced\nchanges in exchange splitting, which shift the minority spin density of states\nnear the Fermi level, thereby affecting both magnetostriction and damping\nthrough spin-conserving transitions. Additionally, the presence of locally\ndegenerate orbitals plays a crucial role in determining magnetostriction. These\nfindings suggest that magnetization dynamics and magnetostriction can be\nintrinsically controlled, facilitating the design of magnetic materials for\napplications such as flexible spintronics.",

While significant\nbreakthroughs have been made in AI language ability, artificial visual\nintelligence, especially the ability to generate and simulate the world we see,\nis far lagging behind. To facilitate the development and accessibility of\nartificial visual intelligence, we created Open-Sora, an open-source video\ngeneration model designed to produce high-fidelity video content.

This paper presents a general formulation of a larege-scale two-sided\nCSD matching problem, considering demand/supply elasticity, heterogeneous\npreferences of both shippers and drivers, and task-bundling. We propose a set\nof methodologies to solve this problem. First, we reveal that the\nfluid-particle decomposition approach of Akamatsu and Oyama (2024) can be\nextended to our general formulation. This approach decomposes the original\nlarge-scale matching problem into a fluidly-approximated task partition problem\n(master problem) and small-scale particle matching problems (sub-problems). We\npropose to introduce a truthful auction mechanism to sub-problems, which\nenables the observation of privately perceived costs for each shipper/driver.\nFurthermore, by finding a theoretical link between auction problems and\nparturbed utility theory, we succeed in accurately reflecting the information\ncollected from auctions to the master problem. This reduces the master problem\nto a smooth convex optimization problem, theoretically guaranteeing the\ncomputational efficiency and solution accuracy of the fluid approximation.\nSecond, we transform the master problem into a traffic assignment problem (TAP)\nbased on a task-chain network. This transformation overcomes the difficulty in\nenumerating task bundles. Finally, we formulate the dual problem of the TAP,\nwhose decision variable is only a price/reward pattern at market equilibrium,\nand develop an efficient accelerated gradient descent method. The numerical\nexperiments clarify that our approach drastically reduces the computational\ncost of the matching problem (~700 times faster than a naive method) without\nsacrificing accuracy of the optimal solution (mostly within 0.5% errors).",

However, the existence of\ncarbyne has been debated due to its instability caused by Peierls distortion,\nwhich limits its practical development. The only successful synthesis of\ncarbyne has been achieved inside CNTs, resulting in a form known as confined\ncarbyne (CC). However, CC can only be synthesized inside multi-walled CNTs,\nlimiting its property-tuning capabilities to the inner tubes of the CNTs. Here,\nwe present a universal method for synthesizing CC inside single-walled carbon\nnanotubes (SWCNTs) with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm. Aromatic hydrocarbon molecules\nare filled inside SWCNTs and subsequently transformed into CC under\nlow-temperature annealing. A variety of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are\nconfirmed as effective precursors for formation of CC, with Raman frequencies\ncentered around 1861 cm-1. Enriched (6,5) and (7,6) SWCNTs with diameters less\nthan 0.8 nm are less effective than the SWCNTs with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm for\nCC formation. Furthermore, resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals that optical\nband gap of the CC at 1861 cm-1 is 2.353 eV, which is consistent with the\nresult obtained using a linear relationship between the Raman signal and\noptical band gap. This newly developed approach provides a versatile route for\nsynthesizing CC from various precursor molecules inside diverse templates,\nwhich is not limited to SWCNTs but could extend to any templates with\nappropriate size, including molecular sieves, zeolites, boron nitride\nnanotubes, and metal-organic frameworks.",

In this paper, we reveal that CLIP's vulnerabilities primarily stem\nfrom its tendency to encode features beyond in-dataset predictive patterns,\ncompromising its visual feature resistivity to input perturbations. This makes\nits encoded features highly susceptible to being reshaped by backdoor triggers.\nTo address this challenge, we propose Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning (RVPT), a\nnovel defense approach that employs deep visual prompt tuning with a specially\ndesigned feature-repelling loss. Specifically, RVPT adversarially repels the\nencoded features from deeper layers while optimizing the standard cross-entropy\nloss, ensuring that only predictive features in downstream tasks are encoded,\nthereby enhancing CLIP's visual feature resistivity against input perturbations\nand mitigating its susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Unlike existing\nmultimodal backdoor defense methods that typically require the availability of\npoisoned data or involve fine-tuning the entire model, RVPT leverages few-shot\ndownstream clean samples and only tunes a small number of parameters. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that RVPT tunes only 0.27\\% of the parameters in CLIP, yet\nit significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods, reducing the\nattack success rate from 89.70\\% to 2.76\\% against the most advanced multimodal\nattacks on ImageNet and effectively generalizes its defensive capabilities\nacross multiple datasets.",

However, in monocular depth estimation, the absence\nof a natural definition of class poses challenges in the leveraging of deep\nmetric learning. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces MetricDepth, a\nnovel method that integrates deep metric learning to enhance the performance of\nmonocular depth estimation. To overcome the inapplicability of the class-based\nsample identification in previous deep metric learning methods to monocular\ndepth estimation task, we design the differential-based sample identification.\nThis innovative approach identifies feature samples as different sample types\nby their depth differentials relative to anchor, laying a foundation for\nfeature regularizing in monocular depth estimation models. Building upon this\nadvancement, we then address another critical problem caused by the vast range\nand the continuity of depth annotations in monocular depth estimation. The\nextensive and continuous annotations lead to the diverse differentials of\nnegative samples to anchor feature, representing the varied impact of negative\nsamples during feature regularizing. Recognizing the inadequacy of the uniform\nstrategy in previous deep metric learning methods for handling negative samples\nin monocular depth estimation task, we propose the multi-range strategy.\nThrough further distinction on negative samples according to depth differential\nranges and implementation of diverse regularizing, our multi-range strategy\nfacilitates differentiated regularization interactions between anchor feature\nand its negative samples. Experiments across various datasets and model types\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of MetricDepth,confirming its\npotential for performance enhancement in monocular depth estimation task.",

Our analysis reveals that\nthe fixed token access order in Visual Mamba introduces unique quantization\nchallenges, which we categorize into three main issues: 1) token-wise variance,\n2) channel-wise outliers, and 3) a long tail of activations.

However,\nintegrating polarization into rendering is challenging and increases\ncomputational costs significantly. The primary difficulty lies in efficiently\nmodeling and computing the complex reflection phenomena associated with\npolarized light. Specifically, frequency-domain analysis, essential for\nefficient environment lighting and storage of complex light interactions, is\nlacking. To efficiently simulate and reproduce polarized light interactions\nusing frequency-domain techniques, we address the challenge of maintaining\ncontinuity in polarized light transport represented by Stokes vectors within\nangular domains. The conventional spherical harmonics method cannot effectively\nhandle continuity and rotation invariance for Stokes vectors. To overcome this,\nwe develop a new method called polarized spherical harmonics (PSH) based on the\nspin-weighted spherical harmonics theory. Our method provides a\nrotation-invariant representation of Stokes vector fields. Furthermore, we\nintroduce frequency domain formulations of polarized rendering equations and\nspherical convolution based on PSH. We first define spherical convolution on\nStokes vector fields in the angular domain, and it also provides efficient\ncomputation of polarized light transport, nearly on an entry-wise product in\nthe frequency domain. Our frequency domain formulation, including spherical\nconvolution, led to the development of the first real-time polarization\nrendering technique under polarized environmental illumination, named\nprecomputed polarized radiance transfer, using our polarized spherical\nharmonics.

In this paper, focusing on fine-tuning tasks in specific domains\nwith limited data, we introduce Natural Language Fine-Tuning (NLFT), which\nutilizes natural language for fine-tuning for the first time. By leveraging the\nstrong language comprehension capability of the target LM, NLFT attaches the\nguidance of natural language to the token-level outputs. Then, saliency tokens\nare identified with calculated probabilities. Since linguistic information is\neffectively utilized in NLFT, our proposed method significantly reduces\ntraining costs. It markedly enhances training efficiency, comprehensively\noutperforming reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms in accuracy, time-saving,\nand resource conservation. Additionally, on the macro level, NLFT can be viewed\nas a token-level fine-grained optimization of SFT, thereby efficiently\nreplacing the SFT process without the need for warm-up (as opposed to ReFT\nrequiring multiple rounds of warm-up with SFT). Compared to SFT, NLFT does not\nincrease the algorithmic complexity, maintaining O(n).

However,\ndue to the irregular nature of the graph structure, existing distributed\napproaches suffer from unbalanced workloads and high overhead in managing\ncross-worker vertex dependencies. In this paper, we leverage tensor parallelism\nfor distributed GNN training. GNN tensor parallelism eliminates cross-worker\nvertex dependencies by partitioning features instead of graph structures.\nDifferent workers are assigned training tasks on different feature slices with\nthe same dimensional size, leading to a complete load balance. We achieve\nefficient GNN tensor parallelism through two critical functions.

    "abstract": "Navigating dynamic and unstructured environments poses significant challenges\nfor autonomous robots, particularly due to the uncertainty introduced by\noccluded areas. Conventional sensing methods often fail to detect obstacles\nhidden behind occlusions until they are dangerously close, especially in\ncrowded spaces where human movement and physical barriers frequently obstruct\nthe robot's view. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for\nocclusion-aware obstacle prediction using people as sensors, that infers the\npresence of para-occluded obstacles by analyzing human behavioral patterns. Our\napproach integrates sensor fusion, historical trajectory data, and predictive\nmodeling to estimate the likelihood of obstacle presence and occupancy in\noccluded regions. By leveraging the natural tendency of humans to avoid certain\nareas, the system enables robots to proactively adapt their navigation\nstrategies in real time. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances obstacle\nprediction accuracy, reduces collision risks, and improves navigation\nefficiency. These findings underscore the potential of occlusion-aware obstacle\nprediction systems to improve the safety and adaptability of autonomous robots\nin complex, dynamic environments.",

By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the\nfactor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to\nestimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity,\nwe design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation\nalgorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the\npositions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data\nfusion across multiple base stations (BSs).

To date, many object detection approaches have\nbeen proposed. However, accurate object detection of pre-made dishes is\nextremely difficult because of overlapping occlusion of ingredients, similarity\nof ingredients, and insufficient light in the processing environment. As a\nresult, the recognition scene is relatively complex and thus leads to poor\nobject detection by a single model. To address this issue, this paper proposes\na Differential Evolution Integrated Hybrid Deep Learning (DEIHDL) model. The\nmain idea of DEIHDL is three-fold: 1) three YOLO-based and transformer-based\nbase models are developed respectively to increase diversity for detecting\nobjects of pre-made dishes, 2) the three base models are integrated by\ndifferential evolution optimized self-adjusting weights, and 3) weighted boxes\nfusion strategy is employed to score the confidence of the three base models\nduring the integration. As such, DEIHDL possesses the multi-performance\noriginating from the three base models to achieve accurate object detection in\ncomplex pre-made dish scenes. Extensive experiments on real datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed DEIHDL model significantly outperforms the base\nmodels in detecting objects of pre-made dishes.",

In this paper, we propose regularizing emotion\nintensity in the diffusion-based EVC framework to generate precise speech of\nthe target emotion. Traditional approaches control the intensity of an\nemotional state in the utterance via emotion class probabilities or intensity\nlabels that often lead to inept style manipulations and degradations in\nquality. On the contrary, we aim to regulate emotion intensity using\nself-supervised learning-based feature representations and unsupervised\ndirectional latent vector modeling (DVM) in the emotional embedding space\nwithin a diffusion-based framework. These emotion embeddings can be modified\nbased on the given target emotion intensity and the corresponding direction\nvector.

Extensive experiments\nvalidate the efficacy of these proposed methods, demonstrating that the merging\nof structurally heterogeneous models can achieve performance levels comparable\nto those of homogeneous merging, across both vision and NLP tasks.

    "abstract": "As an emerging technology, cooperative bi-static integrated sensing and\ncommunication (ISAC) is promising to achieve high-precision sensing, high-rate\ncommunication as well as self-interference (SI) avoidance. This paper\ninvestigates the two-timescale design for access point (AP) mode selection to\nrealize the full potential of the cooperative bi-static ISAC network with low\nsystem overhead, where the beamforming at the APs is adapted to the\nrapidly-changing instantaneous channel state information (CSI), while the AP\nmode is adapted to the slowly-changing statistical CSI. We first apply the\nminimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator to estimate the channel between the\nAPs and the channels from the APs to the user equipments (UEs). Then we adopt\nthe low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming and the maximum\nratio combining (MRC) detector, and derive the closed-form expressions of the\ncommunication rate and the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio\n(SINR). We formulate a non-convex integer optimization problem to maximize the\nminimum sensing SINR under the communication quality of service (QoS)\nconstraints. McCormick envelope relaxation and successive convex approximation\n(SCA) techniques are applied to solve the challenging non-convex integer\noptimization problem.

As energy\ndemands grow, larger turbines are required to optimize power generation and\nreduce the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE), which represents the average cost\nof electricity over a project's lifetime. However, upscaling turbines\nintroduces engineering challenges, particularly in the design of supporting\nstructures, especially towers. These towers must support increased loads while\nmaintaining structural integrity, cost-efficiency, and transportability, making\nthem essential to offshore wind projects' success. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive review of the latest advancements, challenges, and future\ndirections driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the design optimization of\nOffshore Wind Turbine (OWT) structures, with a focus on towers. It provides an\nin-depth background on key areas such as design types, load types, analysis\nmethods, design processes, monitoring systems, Digital Twin (DT), software,\nstandards, reference turbines, economic factors, and optimization techniques.\nAdditionally, it includes a state-of-the-art review of optimization studies\nrelated to tower design optimization, presenting a detailed examination of\nturbine, software, loads, optimization method, design variables and\nconstraints, analysis, and findings, motivating future research to refine\ndesign approaches for effective turbine upscaling and improved efficiency.\nLastly, the paper explores future directions where AI can revolutionize tower\ndesign optimization, enabling the development of efficient, scalable, and\nsustainable structures.

    "abstract": "By evaluating angular momentum directions of open cluster (OC) samples across\nvarious Galactocentric radii, we assessed their orbital plane inclinations. Our\nfindings reveal that, without considering the local tilt of the Galactic disk\nnear the sun, our results are consistent with previous studies on Classical\nCepheids (CCs). Notably, the warp precession derived from OCs closely mirror\nthose of CCs. Nonetheless, we observed a systematic deviation between the\ngeometric and dynamic warps, attributable to the tilt of the local disk. We\nidentified a systematic vertical motion in the local region, associated with\nthe warping feature near the solar vicinity. Ignoring this motion leads to\nunderestimates of orbital plane inclinations compared to those derived from\ngeometric positions. Our study indicates consistency between the inclinations\nderived from orbital dynamics and geometric positions at a vertical velocity of\nthe sun relative to the Galactic mid-plane of Vz_sun = 9.4(0.2) km/s. This\nvalue is approximately 2 km/s higher than the historically estimated solar\npeculiar motion, W_sun, primarily due to an approximately 0.6-degree tilt of\nthe local plane. Analysis suggests that previous estimates of the Galactic\ndisk's warping precession rate may have been overestimated due to local warping\ninfluences. The findings indicate that the precession oscillates around zero\nand that the Galactic warp is progressively flattening. Additionally, the line\nof nodes tends to become consistent across various Galactocentric radii over a\ntimescale of 100-200 million years.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies focused primarily on wind stress being proportional to wind\nvelocity relative to the ocean velocity, which induces a curl in wind stress\nwith polarity opposite to the ocean mesoscale vorticity, resulting in net\nnegative wind work. However, there remains a fundamental gap in understanding\nhow wind work on the ocean is related to the ocean's vortical and straining\nmotions. While it is possible to derive budgets for ocean vorticity and strain,\nthese do not provide the energy channeled into vortical and straining motions\nby wind stress. An occasional misconception is that a Helmholtz decomposition\ncan separate vorticity from strain, with the latter mistakenly regarded as\nbeing solely due to the potential flow accounting for divergent motions. In\nfact, strain is also an essential constituent of divergence-free (or\nsolenoidal) flows, including the oceanic mesoscales in geostrophic balance\nwhere strain-dominated regions account for approximately half the KE. There is\nno existing fluid dynamics framework that relates the injection of kinetic\nenergy by a force to how this energy is deposited into vortical and straining\nmotions. Here, we show that winds, on average, are just as effective at damping\nstraining motions as they are at damping vortical motions. This happens because\noceanic strain induces a straining wind stress gradient (WSG), which is\nanalogous to ocean vorticity inducing a curl in wind stress. Ocean-induced WSGs\nalone, whether straining or vortical, always damp ocean currents. However, our\ntheory also reveals that a significant contribution to wind work comes from\ninherent wind gradients, a main component of which is due to prevailing winds\nof the general atmospheric circulation. We find that inherent WSGs lead to\nasymmetric energization of ocean weather based on the polarity of vortical and\nstraining ocean flows.",

The\nprimary objective of most review scenarios is to generate desired review\ncomments (DRCs) that explicitly identify issues to trigger code fixes. However,\nexisting LLM-based solutions are not so effective in generating DRCs for\nvarious reasons such as hallucination. To enhance their code review ability,\nthey need to be fine-tuned with a customized dataset that is ideally full of\nDRCs. Nevertheless, such a dataset is not yet available, while manual\nannotation of DRCs is too laborious to be practical. In this paper, we propose\na dataset distillation method, Desiview, which can automatically construct a\ndistilled dataset by identifying DRCs from a code review dataset. Experiments\non the CodeReviewer dataset comprising more than 150K review entries show that\nDesiview achieves an impressive performance of 88.93%, 80.37%, 86.67%, and\n84.44% in terms of Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1, respectively,\nsurpassing state-of-the-art methods. To validate the effect of such a distilled\ndataset on enhancing LLMs' code review ability, we first fine-tune the latest\nLLaMA series (i.e., LLaMA 3 and LLaMA 3.1) to build model Desiview4FT. We then\nenhance the model training effect through KTO alignment by feeding those review\ncomments identified as non-DRCs to the LLMs, resulting in model Desiview4FA.\nVerification results indicate that Desiview4FA slightly outperforms\nDesiview4FT, while both models have significantly improved against the base\nmodels in terms of generating DRCs. Human evaluation confirms that both models\nidentify issues more accurately and tend to generate review comments that\nbetter describe the issues contained in the code than the base LLMs do.",

In this problem, the\ngradient of the objective function cannot be obtained explicitly because the\ndecision-dependent distribution is unknown. Therefore, several zeroth-order\nmethods have been proposed, which obtain noisy objective values by sampling and\nupdate the iterates. Although these existing methods have theoretical\nconvergence for optimization problems with decision-dependent uncertainty, they\nrequire strong assumptions about the function and distribution or exhibit large\nvariances in their gradient estimators. To overcome these issues, we propose\ntwo zeroth-order methods under mild assumptions. First, we develop a\nzeroth-order method with a new one-point gradient estimator including a\nvariance reduction parameter. The proposed method updates the decision\nvariables while adjusting the variance reduction parameter. Second, we develop\na zeroth-order method with a two-point gradient estimator. There are situations\nwhere only one-point estimators can be used, but if both one-point and\ntwo-point estimators are available, it is more practical to use the two-point\nestimator. As theoretical results, we show the convergence of our methods to\nstationary points and provide the worst-case iteration and sample complexity\nanalysis.

However, both\nalgorithms suffer from twist problems and are computationally expensive per\niteration, which makes achieving high-quality visualizations for large-scale\ngraphs challenging. In this research, we propose a new initial placement based\non the stochastic coordinate descent to accelerate the optimization process. We\nfirst reformulate the problem as a discrete optimization problem using a\nhexagonal lattice and then iteratively update a randomly selected vertex along\nthe coordinate Newton direction. We can use the FR or L-BFGS algorithms to\nobtain the final placement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\napproach through experiments, highlighting the potential of coordinate descent\nmethods for graph drawing tasks.

Traditional methods often fail to address\nthe challenges posed by spatial correlation and heterogeneity, leading to\nunreliable conclusions. The proposed test integrates kernel smoothing with\nspatially weighted cumulative distribution function (CDF) estimation to ensure\nrobustness against outliers and deviations from distributional assumptions. A\ntest statistic is derived by aggregating squared differences between smoothed\nCDFs, and its asymptotic properties are established under the null hypothesis,\ndemonstrating convergence to a weighted sum of chi-squared random variables.\nPractical implementation relies on resampling techniques such as permutation\ntests and spatial bootstrap methods to approximate the null distribution. The\ntest is consistent under alternatives, making it an effective tool for\nanalyzing spatially dependent data in fields such as environmental monitoring\nand agricultural research. Extensions to multivariate and spatio-temporal\napplications are suggested for future work.",

    "abstract": "Future 6G networks are expected to empower communication systems by\nintegrating sensing capabilities, resulting in integrated sensing and\ncommunication (ISAC) systems. However, this integration may exacerbate the data\ntraffic congestion in existing communication systems due to limited resources.\nTherefore, the resources of ISAC systems must be carefully allocated to ensure\nhigh performance. Given the increasing demands for both sensing and\ncommunication services, current methods are inadequate for tracking targets\nfrequently in every frame while simultaneously communicating with users. To\naddress this gap, this work formulates an optimization problem that jointly\nallocates resources in the time, frequency, power, and spatial domains for\ntargets and users, accounting for the movement of targets and time-varying\ncommunication channels. Specifically, we minimize the trace of posterior\nCram\\'er-Rao bound for target tracking subject to communication throughput and\nresource allocation constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a\nblock coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty method,\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA), and one-dimensional search.

    "abstract": "For an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, the existence of\na meromorphic general solution is equivalent to the Painlev\\'e property, which\nis widely used to detect integrability. We find all meromorphic solutions of a\nmulti-parameter three-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system. Some cases correspond\nto particular choices of the parameters for which only some solutions are\nmeromorphic, while the general solution is branched. The main difficulty is to\nprove that all meromorphic solutions have been found. The proof relies on a\ndetailed study of local series expansions combined with value distribution\nresults from Nevanlinna theory.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates scalar perturbations and quasinormal modes (QNMs)\nassociated with cylindrical black holes constructed within the frameworks of\n$f(\\mathcal{R})$-gravity and Ricci-Inverse ($\\mathcal{RI}$) gravity. Moreover,\nwe study the modified Hawking radiation in these black hole solutions and\nanalyze the effects of coupling constants. These modified theories, which\nextend general relativity by introducing higher-order curvature corrections and\nadditional geometric terms, provide a rich platform for exploring deviations\nfrom standard gravitational physics. The study begins by revisiting the\ncylindrical black holes in these modified gravity theories, where the effective\ncosmological constants respectively, are represented by\n$\\Lambda_m^{f(\\mathcal{R})}$ and $\\Lambda_m^{\\mathcal{RI}}$ related to the\ncoupling constants unique to each framework. Afterwards, the QNMs, intrinsic\ndamped oscillations of the black hole space-time, are analyzed to probe the\nstability of the system, with the effective potential $V$ revealing the impact\nof the modified gravity parameters. Additionally, the thermodynamic properties\nof the black holes are examined through the lens of the Generalized Uncertainty\nPrinciple (GUP), which introduces quantum corrections to Hawking radiation. The\nGUP-modified Hawking temperature and entropy are derived, demonstrating\nsignificant deviations from classical results and highlighting the quantum\ngravitational effects in these modified frameworks. By linking QNMs,\nthermodynamics, and quantum corrections, this work not only deepens the\nunderstanding of modified gravity theories but also offers potential\nobservational pathways to test their validity.",

The LNO:Pr,Bi,Sm phosphor exhibits quadruplet\nluminescence, including polychrome photoluminescence, PersL, and\nphoto/thermo-stimulated luminescence (PSL/TSL). Particularly, the enhanced TSL\ncan carry remote subjective information independent of the phosphor itself by\ncontrolling the temperature.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces EXAdam ($\\textbf{EX}$tended $\\textbf{Adam}$), a novel\noptimization algorithm that builds upon the widely-used Adam optimizer. EXAdam\nincorporates two key enhancements: (1) new debiasing terms for improved moment\nestimation and (2) a gradient-based acceleration mechanism for increased\nresponsiveness to the current loss landscape. These innovations work\nsynergistically to address limitations of the original Adam algorithm,\npotentially offering improved convergence properties, enhanced ability to\nescape saddle points, and potentially greater robustness to hyperparameter\nchoices, though this requires further investigation. We provide a theoretical\nanalysis of EXAdam's components and their interactions, highlighting the\nalgorithm's potential advantages in navigating complex optimization landscapes.\nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate EXAdam's superiority over Adam, achieving\n38.46% faster convergence and yielding improvements of 1.96%, 2.17%, and 1.17%\nin training, validation, and testing accuracies, respectively, when applied to\na CNN trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. While these results are promising,\nfurther empirical validation across diverse tasks is essential to fully gauge\nEXAdam's efficacy. Nevertheless, EXAdam represents a significant advancement in\nadaptive optimization techniques, with promising implications for a wide range\nof machine learning applications. This work aims to contribute to the ongoing\ndevelopment of more efficient, adaptive, and universally applicable\noptimization methods in the field of machine learning and artificial\nintelligence.",

    "abstract": "Linear algebraic operations are ubiquitous in engineering applications, and\narise often in a variety of fields including statistical signal processing and\nmachine learning. With contemporary large datasets, to perform linear algebraic\nmethods and regression tasks, it is necessary to resort to both distributed\ncomputations as well as data compression. In this paper, we study\n\\textit{distributed} $\\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, a common technique used to\nefficiently perform linear regression. In our setting, data is distributed\nacross multiple computing nodes and a goal is to minimize communication between\nthe nodes and the coordinator in the distributed centralized network, while\nmaintaining the geometry of the dataset. Furthermore, there is also the concern\nof keeping the data private and secure from potential adversaries. In this\nwork, we address these issues through randomized sketching, where the key idea\nis to apply distinct sketching matrices on the local datasets. A novelty of\nthis work is that we also consider \\textit{hybrid sketching}, \\textit{i.e.} a\nsecond sketch is applied on the aggregated locally sketched datasets, for\nenhanced embedding results. One of the main takeaways of this work is that by\nhybrid sketching, we can interpolate between the trade-offs that arise in\noff-the-shelf sketching matrices. That is, we can obtain gains in terms of\nembedding dimension or multiplication time. Our embedding arguments are also\njustified numerically.",
