To the best of our\nknowledge, previous work has not incorporated Markovian dependencies in this\nsetting. This framework is particularly relevant to applications such as data\nor computation driven algorithm design, where exploration of future models\nincurs cost.\n  We present optimal fully adaptive strategies where the associated graph forms\na forest. Under static transition, we introduce a strategy that achieves a near\noptimal expected payoff in multi line graphs and a 1/2 approximation in\nforest-structured graphs. Notably, this algorithm provides a significant\nspeedup over the exact solution, with the improvement becoming more pronounced\nas the graph size increases. Our findings deepen the understanding of\nsequential exploration under Markovian correlations in graph-based\ndecision-making.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a single-life reinforcement learning (SLRL) approach to\nadaptively select the dimension of the Krylov subspace during the generalized\nminimal residual (GMRES) iteration. GMRES is an iterative algorithm for solving\nlarge and sparse linear systems of equations in the form of \\(Ax = b\\) which\nare mainly derived from partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed\nframework uses RL to adjust the Krylov subspace dimension (m) in the GMRES (m)\nalgorithm. This research demonstrates that altering the dimension of the Krylov\nsubspace in an online setup using SLRL can accelerate the convergence of the\nGMRES algorithm by more than an order of magnitude. A comparison of different\nmatrix sizes and sparsity levels is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof adaptive Krylov subspace exploration using single-life RL (AK-SLRL). We\ncompare AK-SLRL with constant-restart GMRES by applying the highest restart\nvalue used in AK-SLRL to the GMRES method. The results show that using an\nadjustable restart parameter with single-life soft-actor critic (SLSAC) and an\nexperience replay buffer sized to half the matrix dimension converges\nsignificantly faster than the constant restart GMRES with higher values. Higher\nvalues of the restart parameter are equivalent to a higher number of Arnoldi\niterations to construct an orthonormal basis for the Krylov subspace $ K_m(A,\nr_0) $. This process includes constructing $m$ orthonormal vectors and updating\nthe Hessenberg matrix $H$. Therefore, lower values of $m$ result in reduced\ncomputation needed in GMRES minimization to solve the least-squares problem in\nthe smaller Hessenberg matrix. The robustness of the result is validated\nthrough a wide range of matrix dimensions and sparsity. This paper contributes\nto the series of RL combinations with numerical solvers to achieve accelerated\nscientific computing.",

    "abstract": "Behavioural conformances -- e.g. behavioural equivalences, distances,\npreorders -- on a wide range of system types (non-deterministic, probabilistic,\nweighted etc.) can be dealt with uniformly in the paradigm of universal\ncoalgebra. One of the most commonly used constructions for defining behavioural\ndistances on coalgebras arises as a generalization of the well-known\nWasserstein metric. In this construction, couplings of probability\ndistributions are replaced with couplings of more general objects, depending on\nthe functor describing the system type. In many cases, however, the set of\ncouplings of two functor elements is empty, which causes such elements to have\ninfinite distance even in situations where this is not desirable. We propose an\napproach to defining behavioural distances and preorders based on a more\nliberal notion of coupling where the coupled elements are matched laxly rather\nthan on-the-nose. We thereby substantially broaden the range of behavioural\nconformances expressible in terms of couplings, covering, e.g., refinement of\nmodal transition systems and behavioural distance on metric labelled Markov\nchains.",

With this change in perspective, we gain robustness against\npervasive challenges in system identification including noise, chaos, and slow\nsampling. In the first half of this paper, we pose the system identification\ntask as a partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization problem,\nin which synthetic stationary solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation, obtained\nas fixed points of a finite-volume discretization, are compared to physical\ninvariant measures extracted from observed trajectory data. In the latter half\nof the paper, we improve upon this approach in two crucial directions. First,\nwe develop a Galerkin-inspired modification to the finite-volume surrogate\nmodel, based on data-adaptive unstructured meshes and Monte-Carlo integration,\nenabling the approach to efficiently scale to high-dimensional problems.\nSecond, we leverage Takens' seminal time-delay embedding theory to introduce a\ncritical data-dependent coordinate transformation which can guarantee unique\nsystem identifiability from the invariant measure alone. This contribution\nresolves a major challenge of system identification through invariant measures,\nas systems exhibiting distinct transient behaviors may still share the same\ntime-invariant statistics in their state-coordinates.

Experimental results from\nfine-tuning transformers in both NLP and vision domains validate our\ntheoretical analyses. This study provides insights into the optimization\nchallenges of transformers and offers guidance for designing future\noptimization algorithms.

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in formal theorem proving by LLMs is the lack of\nhigh-quality training data. Although reinforcement learning or expert iteration\npartially mitigates this issue by alternating between LLM generating proofs and\nfinetuning them on correctly generated ones, performance quickly plateaus due\nto the scarcity of correct proofs (sparse rewards). To keep improving the\nmodels with limited data, we draw inspiration from mathematicians, who\ncontinuously develop new results, partly by proposing novel conjectures or\nexercises (which are often variants of known results) and attempting to solve\nthem. We design the Self-play Theorem Prover (STP) that simultaneously takes on\ntwo roles, conjecturer and prover, each providing training signals to the\nother. The conjecturer is trained iteratively on previously generated\nconjectures that are barely provable by the current prover, which incentivizes\nit to generate increasingly challenging conjectures over time. The prover\nattempts to prove the conjectures with standard expert iteration. We evaluate\nSTP with both Lean and Isabelle formal versifiers. With 51.3 billion tokens\ngenerated during the training in Lean, STP proves 28.5% of the statements in\nthe LeanWorkbook dataset, doubling the previous best result of 13.2% achieved\nthrough expert iteration. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance\namong whole-proof generation methods on miniF2F-test (65.0%, pass@3200),\nProofnet-test (23.9%, pass@3200) and PutnamBench (8/644, pass@3200).

In\nparticular, this approach is in principle compatible with other settings where\nstronger horizon instabilities are expected, such as nonlinear charged scalar\nfields on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om, or nonlinear waves on extremal Kerr.\nWe also sketch how our proof applies to semilinear problems on spacetimes\nsettling down to extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om, such as those constructed in\nour joint work with Kehle (arXiv:2410.16234, 2024).",

The key is to\ndetermine the best way of representing a particular dataset, based on the\ndataset itself. In this work, we propose to investigate this problem by\ncombining text distortion and algorithmic clustering based on string\ncompression. Specifically, a distortion technique previously developed by the\nauthors is applied to destroy text structure progressively. Following this, a\nclustering algorithm based on string compression is used to analyze the effects\nof the distortion on the information contained in the texts. Several\nexperiments are carried out on text datasets and artificially-generated\ndatasets. The results show that in strongly structural datasets the clustering\nresults worsen as text structure is progressively destroyed. Besides, they show\nthat using a compressor which enables the choice of the size of the\nleft-context symbols helps to determine the nature of the datasets.

    "abstract": "Training data is the backbone of large language models (LLMs), yet today's\ndata markets often operate under exploitative pricing -- sourcing data from\nmarginalized groups with little pay or recognition. This paper introduces a\ntheoretical framework for LLM data markets, modeling the strategic interactions\nbetween buyers (LLM builders) and sellers (human annotators). We begin with\ntheoretical and empirical analysis showing how exploitative pricing drives\nhigh-quality sellers out of the market, degrading data quality and long-term\nmodel performance. Then we introduce fairshare, a pricing mechanism grounded in\ndata valuation that quantifies each data's contribution. It aligns incentives\nby sustaining seller participation and optimizing utility for both buyers and\nsellers. Theoretically, we show that fairshare yields mutually optimal\noutcomes: maximizing long-term buyer utility and seller profit while sustaining\nmarket participation. Empirically when training open-source LLMs on complex NLP\ntasks, including math problems, medical diagnosis, and physical reasoning,\nfairshare boosts seller earnings and ensures a stable supply of high-quality\ndata, while improving buyers' performance-per-dollar and long-term welfare. Our\nfindings offer a concrete path toward fair, transparent, and economically\nsustainable data markets for LLM. Our code will be open sourced.",

    "abstract": "The notion of generalization has moved away from the classical one defined in\nstatistical learning theory towards an emphasis on out-of-domain generalization\n(OODG). There has been a growing focus on generalization from easy to hard,\nwhere a progression of difficulty implicitly governs the direction of domain\nshifts. This emerging regime has appeared in the literature under different\nnames, such as length/logical/algorithmic extrapolation, but a formal\ndefinition is lacking. We argue that the unifying theme is induction -- based\non finite samples observed in training, a learner should infer an inductive\nprinciple that applies in an unbounded manner. This work formalizes the notion\nof inductive generalization along a difficulty progression and argues that our\npath ahead lies in transforming the learning paradigm. We attempt to make\ninroads by proposing a novel learning paradigm, Inductive Learning, which\ninvolves a central concept called model successors. We outline practical steps\nto adapt well-established techniques towards learning model successors. This\nwork calls for restructuring of the research discussion around induction and\ngeneralization from fragmented task-centric communities to a more unified\neffort, focused on universal properties of learning and computation.",

This\nstudy introduces a censor-aware semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework that\nintegrates clinical and imaging data, addressing biases in traditional models\nhandling censored data. Methods: We analyzed clinical, PET and CT data from 199\nlung cancer patients from public and local data respositories, focusing on\noverall survival (OS) time as the primary outcome. Handcrafted (HRF) and Deep\nRadiomics features (DRF) were extracted after preprocessing using ViSERA\nsoftware and were combined with clinical features (CF). Feature dimensions were\noptimized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by the application\nof supervised learning (SL) and SSL. SSL incorporated pseudo-labeling of\ncensored data to improve performance. Seven regressors and three hazard ratio\nsurvival analysis (HRSA) algorithms were optimized using five-fold\ncross-validation, grid search and external test bootstrapping. Results: For PET\nHRFs, SSL reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) by 26.5%, achieving 1.55 years\nwith PCA+decision tree regression, compared to SL's 2.11 years with PCA+KNNR\n(p<0.05). Combining HRFs (CT_HRF) and DRFs from CT images using SSL+PCA+KNNR\nachieved an MAE of 2.08 years, outperforming SL's 2.26 years by 7.96% (p<0.05).\nIn HRSA, CT_HRF applied to PCA+Component Wise Gradient Boosting Survival\nAnalysis achieved an external c-index of 0.65, effectively differentiating\nhigh- and low-risk groups. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the SSL strategy\nsignificantly outperforms SL across PET, CT, and CF. As such, censor-aware SSL\napplied to HRFs from PET images significantly improved survival prediction\nperformance by 26.5% compared to the SL approach.",

    "abstract": "Railroad bridges are a crucial component of the U.S. freight rail system,\nwhich moves over 40 percent of the nation's freight and plays a critical role\nin the economy. However, aging bridge infrastructure and increasing train\ntraffic pose significant safety hazards and risk service disruptions. The U.S.\nrail network includes over 100,000 railroad bridges, averaging one every 1.4\nmiles of track, with steel bridges comprising over 50% of the network's total\nbridge length. Early identification and assessment of damage in these bridges\nremain challenging tasks. This study proposes a physics-informed neural network\n(PINN) based approach for damage identification in steel truss railroad\nbridges. The proposed approach employs an unsupervised learning approach,\neliminating the need for large datasets typically required by supervised\nmethods. The approach utilizes train wheel load data and bridge response during\ntrain crossing events as inputs for damage identification. The PINN model\nexplicitly incorporates the governing differential equations of the linear\ntime-varying (LTV) bridge-train system. Herein, this model employs a recurrent\nneural network (RNN) based architecture incorporating a custom Runge-Kutta (RK)\nintegrator cell, designed for gradient-based learning. The proposed approach\nupdates the bridge finite element model while also quantifying damage severity\nand localizing the affected structural members. A case study on the Calumet\nBridge in Chicago, Illinois, with simulated damage scenarios, is used to\ndemonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying damage while maintaining\nlow false-positive rates. Furthermore, the damage identification pipeline is\ndesigned to seamlessly integrate prior knowledge from inspections and drone\nsurveys, also enabling context-aware updating and assessment of bridge's\ncondition.",

    "abstract": "Implementing correct distributed systems is an error-prone task. Runtime\nVerification (RV) offers a lightweight formal method to improve reliability by\nmonitoring system executions against correctness properties. However, applying\nRV in distributed settings - where no process has global knowledge - poses\nfundamental challenges, particularly under full asynchrony and fault tolerance.\nThis paper addresses the Distributed Runtime Verification (DRV) problem under\nsuch conditions. In our model, each process in a distributed monitor receives a\nfragment of the input word describing system behavior and must decide whether\nthis word belongs to the language representing the correctness property being\nverified. Hence, the goal is to decide languages in a distributed\nfault-tolerant manner. We propose several decidability definitions, study the\nrelations among them, and prove possibility and impossibility results. One of\nour main results is a characterization of the correctness properties that can\nbe decided asynchronously. Remarkably, it applies to any language decidability\ndefinition. Intuitively, the characterization is that only properties with no\nreal-time order constraints can be decided in asynchronous fault-tolerant\nsettings. These results expose the expressive limits of DRV in realistic\nsystems, as several properties of practical interest rely on reasoning about\nreal-time order of events in executions. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce a weaker model where the system under inspection is verified\nindirectly. Under this weaker model we define predictive decidability, a\ndecidability definition that turn some real-time sensitive correctness\nproperties verifiable. Our framework unifies and extends existing DRV theory\nand sharpens the boundary of runtime monitorability under different\nassumptions.",

To avoid the smearing associated with the\ndistribution of molecular final states in the T-He molecule, the next\ngeneration of these experiments will need to employ atomic (T) rather than\nmolecular (T$_{2}$) tritium sources, at currents of at least 10$^{15}$ atoms\nper second. Following production, atomic T can be trapped in gravitational\nand/or magnetic bottles for beta spectrum experiments, if and only if it can\nfirst be cooled to millikelvin temperatures.

The Project 8 collaboration is\ndeveloping a technique based on magnetic evaporative cooling along a beamline\n(MECB) for the purpose of cooling T to feed a magneto-gravitational trap that\nalso serves as a cyclotron radiation emission spectroscope. Initial tests of\nthe approach are planned in a pathfinder apparatus using atomic Li. This paper\npresents a method for analyzing the dynamics of the MECB technique, and applies\nthese calculations to the design of systems for cooling and slowing of atomic\nLi and T.

The simulations have been performed within the ASTRA framework,\nusing the quasi-linear model TGLF SAT2, including electromagnetic effects, for\nthe core transport, and a neural network trained on EPED simulations to predict\nthe pedestal height and width self-consistently. The database has been\ndeveloped starting from two SPARC H-mode discharges (12.2 T, i.e. Primary\nReference Discharge or PRD, and 8 T, i.e. reduced field) and permuting 4 input\nparameters (W concentration, DT mixture concentration, temperature ratio at top\nof pedestal and deviation of pedestal pressure from the EPED prediction), to\nperform a sensitivity study. For the PRD a scan of auxiliary input power (ion\ncyclotron heating) has been performed up to 25MW, to keep highly radiative\nplasmas above the LH power threshold as predicted by Martin and Schmidtmayr\npower scalings. A scan of pedestal density has then been performed for both PRD\nand 8T databases. ptop/pEPED and Ti/Te at top of pedestal showed the biggest\nimpact on the fusion gain. Significant variation is observed across the\ndatabase, highlighting the importance of sensitivity studies. Below a certain W\nconcentration, the 12T database shows that Q > 5 is consistently achieved for\nfull-field H-modes with 11 MW of auxiliary power, and values of Q > 2 are\nassured when increasing the input power to keep the plasma in H-mode. The 8T\ndatabase demonstrates that SPARC can access a Q > 1 operational window with low\nW concentration, making it a potentially interesting scenario for obtaining\nbreakeven conditions.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have demonstrated great success in numerous domains including\nnatural language processing and bioinformatics. This success stems from the use\nof the attention mechanism by these models in order to represent and propagate\npairwise interactions between individual tokens of sequential data. However,\nthe primary limitation of this operation is its quadratic memory and time\ncomplexity in relation to the input's context length - the length of a sequence\nover which the interactions need to be captured. This significantly limits the\nlength of sequences that can be inferred upon by these models. Extensive\nresearch has been conducted to reduce the number of pairwise interactions to\nsub-quadratic in relation to the context length by introducing sparsity into\nthe attention mechanism through the development of sparse attention masks.\nHowever, efficient implementations that achieve \"true sparsity\" are lacking.\n  In this work, we address this issue by proposing a graph computing view of\nattention where tokens are perceived as nodes of the graph and the attention\nmask determines the edges of the graph. Using this view, we develop graph\nprocessing algorithms to implement the attention mechanism. Both theoretically\nand empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms only perform the needed\ncomputations, i.e., they are work optimal. We also perform extensive\nexperimentation using popular attention masks to explore the impact of sparsity\non execution time and achievable context length. Our experiments demonstrate\nsignificant speedups in execution times compared to state-of-the-art attention\nimplementations such as FlashAttention for large sequence lengths. We also\ndemonstrate that our algorithms are able to achieve extremely long sequence\nlengths of as high as 160 million on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU (SXM4 80GB).",

The threat field is estimated using pointwise noisy measurements from a\nmobile sensor network. For this problem, we present a new information gain\nmeasure for optimal sensor placement that quantifies reduction in uncertainty\nin the path cost rather than the environment state. This measure, which we call\nthe context-relevant mutual information (CRMI), couples the sensor placement\nand path-planning problem. We propose an iterative coupled sensor configuration\nand path-planning (CSCP) algorithm. At each iteration, this algorithm places\nsensors to maximize CRMI, updates the threat estimate using new measurements,\nand recalculates the path with minimum expected exposure to the threat. The\niterations converge when the path cost variance, which is an indicator of risk,\nreduces below a desired threshold. We show that CRMI is submodular, and\ntherefore, greedy optimization provides near-optimal sensor placements while\nmaintaining computational efficiency of the CSCP algorithm. Distance-based\nsensor reconfiguration costs are introduced in a modified CRMI measure, which\nwe also show to be submodular.

While many methods have been proposed to address this\nissue, their underlying mechanisms are often viewed from different\nperspectives. Through a comprehensive investigation from gradient descent to\nFL, and from IID to non-IID data settings, we find that inconsistencies in\nclient loss landscapes primarily cause performance degradation in non-IID\nscenarios.

Our 3D\ninstance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM\n(alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2,\ndirectly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as\n2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing\nit to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is\nnot only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it\nis also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS\nfields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians.\nFurthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D\nsemantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining\nflexibility and efficiency.

    "abstract": "We study ``selective'' or ``conditional'' classification problems under an\nagnostic setting. Classification tasks commonly focus on modeling the\nrelationship between features and categories that captures the vast majority of\ndata.

Most work on conditional classification either\nsolves the problem in a realizable setting or does not guarantee the error is\nbounded compared to an optimal solution. In this work, we consider\nselective/conditional classification by sparse linear classifiers for subsets\ndefined by halfspaces, and give both positive as well as negative results for\nGaussian feature distributions. On the positive side, we present the first\nPAC-learning algorithm for homogeneous halfspace selectors with error guarantee\n$\\bigO*{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{opt}}}$, where $\\mathrm{opt}$ is the smallest conditional\nclassification error over the given class of classifiers and homogeneous\nhalfspaces. On the negative side, we find that, under cryptographic\nassumptions, approximating the conditional classification loss within a small\nadditive error is computationally hard even under Gaussian distribution. We\nprove that approximating conditional classification is at least as hard as\napproximating agnostic classification in both additive and multiplicative form.",

A significant proportion of global deaths, particularly in low-\nand middle-income countries (LMICs), do not have medically certified causes\nassigned. In such settings, verbal autopsy (VA) is a widely adopted approach to\nestimate disease burdens by interviewing caregivers of the deceased. Recently,\nlatent class models have been developed to model the joint distribution of\nsymptoms and perform probabilistic cause-of-death assignment. A large number of\nlatent classes are usually needed in order to characterize the complex\ndependence among symptoms, making the estimated symptom profiles challenging to\nsummarize and interpret. In this paper, we propose a flexible Bayesian tensor\ndecomposition framework that balances the predictive accuracy of the\ncause-of-death assignment task and the interpretability of the latent\nstructures. The key to our approach is to partition symptoms into groups and\nmodel the joint distributions of group-level symptom sub-profiles.

It is induced by the Fisher information metric, a\ntool widely used for understanding neural representations. Despite its\ntheoretical and pratical appeal, Fisher-Rao distances between classes have not\nbeen used as a maximization objective in supervised feature learning.

SQFA maximizes distances using first- and second-order\nstatistics, and its features allow for quadratic discriminability (i.e. QDA\nperformance) matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on real-world\ndatasets.

An emerging paradigm suggests that radially\nextended magnetic disk winds may play a crucial role in the disk evolution. We\npropose a global model of magnetic wind-driven accretion for evolution of\nprotoplanetary disks, based on the insights gained from local shearing box\nsimulations. Here we develop this model and constrain its parameters with the\nhelp of theoretical expectations and comparison with observations.

We\nincorporate the disk winds self-consistently in the code FEOSAD and study\nformation and long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks. We include disk\nself-gravity and an adaptive turbulent alpha, while the co-evolution of dust is\nalso considered. Synthetic observations are obtained via radiation\nthermo-chemical code ProDiMo. The models with inclusion of disk winds satisfy\ngeneral expectations from both theory and observations.

Building upon previous efforts to\nposition water within the triboelectric series, we investigate the charge on\nindividual, millimetric water drops falling through air. Our experiments\nmeasured the charge and mass of each drop using a Faraday cup mounted on a mass\nbalance, and connected to an electrometer. For pure water in a glass syringe\nwith a grounded metal tip, we find the charge per drop ($\\Delta q/\\Delta m$)\nwas approximately -5 pC/g to -1 pC/g. This was independent of the release\nheight of the drop, tip diameter and length, tip cleaning preparation, and\nwhether the experiment was shielded with a Faraday cage. Biasing the tip to\ndifferent voltages allowed for linear control of the drop charge, and the\nresults were consistent with known electrochemical effects, namely the Volta\npotential expected between most metals and bulk water ($\\approx$ -0.5 V).\nIntroducing insulating plastic materials into the experiment (from the syringe\nbody or tip) imparted large amounts of charge on the drops with systematic\ncharge evolution. Together these results show that the flow electrification of\nwater is more complex than previously reported, and is driven by\nmaterial-dependent electrostatic processes.",

Updating LLMs involves two key tasks simultaneously:\nunlearning to remove unwanted knowledge and editing to incorporate new\ninformation. Existing methods face two major challenges: ineffective knowledge\nstorage (either too sparse or too dense) and task conflicts between editing and\nunlearning, as validated through our theoretical and experimental results. To\naddress these issues, we propose LOKA, a conflict-free framework for LLM\nupdating based on a knowledge codebook. During training, updated knowledge is\nstored in multiple codebook memories. To optimize knowledge storage, a\nsimilarity-aware knowledge mapping ensures that related knowledge pieces are\nclustered and allocated to the same memory. Additionally, LOKA resolves task\nconflicts by employing task-specific and multi-task memories guided by a\nconflict score. In the inference stage, LOKA retrieves the most relevant memory\nfrom the codebook and plugs it into the original LLM to apply the updated\nknowledge. A learning-based router controls codebook activation to further\nimprove knowledge utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of LOKA in LLM knowledge updating tasks.",

    "abstract": "A new statistical definition for the mean turbulent boundary layer thickness\nis introduced, based on identification of the point where the streamwise\nvelocity skewness changes sign, from negative to positive, in the outermost\nregion of the boundary layer. Importantly, this definition is independent of\narbitrary thresholds, and broadly applicable, including to past single-point\nmeasurements. Further, this definition is motivated by the phenomenology of\nstreamwise velocity fluctuations near the turbulent/non-turbulent interface,\nwhose local characteristics are shown to be universal for turbulent boundary\nlayers under low freestream turbulence conditions (i.e., with or without\npressure gradients, surface roughness, etc.) through large-scale experiments,\nsimulations and coherent structure-based modelling. The new approach yields a\nturbulent boundary layer thickness that is consistent with previous\ndefinitions, such as those based on Reynolds shear stress or `composite' mean\nvelocity profiles, and which can be used practically e.g., to calculate\nintegral thicknesses. Two methods are proposed for estimating the turbulent\nboundary layer thickness using this definition: one based on simple linear\ninterpolation and the other on fitting a generalised Fourier model to the outer\nskewness profile. The robustness and limitations of these methods are\ndemonstrated through analysis of several published experimental and numerical\ndatasets, which cover a range of canonical and non-canonical turbulent boundary\nlayers. These datasets also vary in key characteristics such as wall-normal\nresolution and measurement noise, particularly in the critical\nturbulent/non-turbulent interface region.",

    "abstract": "Bias in machine learning models can lead to unfair decision making, and while\nit has been well-studied in the image and text domains, it remains\nunderexplored in action recognition. Action recognition models often suffer\nfrom background bias (i.e., inferring actions based on background cues) and\nforeground bias (i.e., relying on subject appearance), which can be detrimental\nto real-life applications such as autonomous vehicles or assisted living\nmonitoring. While prior approaches have mainly focused on mitigating background\nbias using specialized augmentations, we thoroughly study both foreground and\nbackground bias. We propose ALBAR, a novel adversarial training method that\nmitigates foreground and background biases without requiring specialized\nknowledge of the bias attributes. Our framework applies an adversarial\ncross-entropy loss to the sampled static clip (where all the frames are the\nsame) and aims to make its class probabilities uniform using a proposed entropy\nmaximization loss. Additionally, we introduce a gradient penalty loss for\nregularization against the debiasing process. We evaluate our method on\nestablished background and foreground bias protocols, setting a new\nstate-of-the-art and strongly improving combined debiasing performance by over\n12% absolute on HMDB51. Furthermore, we identify an issue of background leakage\nin the existing UCF101 protocol for bias evaluation which provides a shortcut\nto predict actions and does not provide an accurate measure of the debiasing\ncapability of a model. We address this issue by proposing more fine-grained\nsegmentation boundaries for the actor, where our method also outperforms\nexisting approaches.

Large Language Models (LLMs) can help\nstreamline the labor-intensive human sentiment analysis process. This study\nexamined the accuracy of LLMs in replicating human sentiment evaluation of\nsocial media messages about heated tobacco products (HTPs).\n  The research used GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Turbo to classify 500 Facebook and 500\nTwitter messages, including anti-HTPs, pro-HTPs, and neutral messages. The\nmodels evaluated each message up to 20 times, and their majority label was\ncompared to human evaluators.\n  Results showed that GPT-3.5 accurately replicated human sentiment 61.2% of\nthe time for Facebook messages and 57.0% for Twitter messages. GPT-4 Turbo\nperformed better, with 81.7% accuracy for Facebook and 77.0% for Twitter. Using\nthree response instances, GPT-4 Turbo achieved 99% of the accuracy of twenty\ninstances. GPT-4 Turbo also had higher accuracy for anti- and pro-HTPs messages\ncompared to neutral ones. Misclassifications by GPT-3.5 often involved anti- or\npro-HTPs messages being labeled as neutral or irrelevant, while GPT-4 Turbo\nshowed improvements across all categories.\n  In conclusion, LLMs can be used for sentiment analysis of HTP-related social\nmedia messages, with GPT-4 Turbo reaching around 80% accuracy compared to human\nexperts.

    "abstract": "Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a prominent problem-modeling and solving\nframework, whose solutions are called answer sets. Epistemic logic programs\n(ELP) extend ASP to reason about all or some answer sets. Solutions to an ELP\ncan be seen as consequences over multiple collections of answer sets, known as\nworld views. While the complexity of propositional programs is well studied,\nthe non-ground case remains open. This paper establishes the complexity of\nnon-ground ELPs. We provide a comprehensive picture for well-known program\nfragments, which turns out to be complete for the class NEXPTIME with access to\noracles up to \\Sigma^P_2. In the quantitative setting, we establish complexity\nresults for counting complexity beyond #EXP. To mitigate high complexity, we\nestablish results in case of bounded predicate arity, reaching up to the fourth\nlevel of the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we provide ETH-tight runtime\nresults for the parameter treewidth, which has applications in quantitative\nreasoning, where we reason on (marginal) probabilities of epistemic literals.",

In this work we use the recent observations by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA\n(LVK) collaborations to set direct limits on stellar-mass range PBHs. We\nevaluate the merger rates of PBH binaries. Those type of interactions\ncontribute to what is a minimum of PBH merger rates at low redshifts detectable\nby LVK. Thus, they allow us to derive what is the most conservative upper\nlimits on the presence of merging PBH binaries in the gravitational-wave\nobservations. We study the cases where PBHs have a monochromatic\nmass-distribution and the case case with a distribution described by a\nlog-normal function. To derive limits on PBHs, we simulate binaries with masses\nfollowing the relevant mass-distributions and merger rates as a function of\nredshift, up to $z\\sim 0.8$, relevant for the current LVK observations. In\nthose simulations we also take into account that the LVK observatories measure\nthe detected black hole binaries' masses with a finite resolution. In comparing\nto the LVK observations, we combine the simulated PBH binaries with the\nbinaries following a power-law mass- and redshift-distribution. The latter\nbinaries dominate the observed population of LVK detections. Our derived limits\non the mass fraction of dark matter composed of PBHs is in the range of\n$10^{-3}$ to O(1), depending on the exact assumptions relating to the PBH\nbinaries properties. For reasonable assumptions on those PBH binaries'\nproperties before their evolution inside dark matter halos, we get that\nfraction to be in the range of $5\\times 10^{-3} - 0.1$, for PBH masses of 5-80\n$M_{\\odot}$. Our limits even with a conservative choice on evaluating the\nlow-redshift merger rates provide some of the most competitive limits in the\nmass range of 5-40 $M_{\\odot}$. [abridged]",

Efficient resource allocation\nis crucial for RAN slicing, as each service has specific quality of service\n(QoS) requirements, and a balance between different services must be\nmaintained. Although heuristic and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have\nbeen explored to achieve efficient resource allocation, these approaches face\nnotable limitations: heuristic algorithms face complexity issues that limit\ntheir effectiveness in large networks, RL solutions are constrained by their\ndependency on training data and struggle to adapt to new scenarios and\nenvironments.

Cuneiform\nsigns have a complex internal structure which is the subject of expert\npaleographic analysis, as variations in sign shapes bear witness to historical\ndevelopments and transmission of writing and culture over time. However, prior\nautomated techniques mostly treat sign types as categorical and do not\nexplicitly model their highly varied internal configurations. In this work, we\npresent an unsupervised approach for recovering the fine-grained internal\nconfiguration of cuneiform signs by leveraging powerful generative models and\nthe appearance and structure of prototype font images as priors. Our approach,\nProtoSnap, enforces structural consistency on matches found with deep image\nfeatures to estimate the diverse configurations of cuneiform characters,\nsnapping a skeleton-based template to photographed cuneiform signs. We provide\na new benchmark of expert annotations and evaluate our method on this task. Our\nevaluation shows that our approach succeeds in aligning prototype skeletons to\na wide variety of cuneiform signs. Moreover, we show that conditioning on\nstructures produced by our method allows for generating synthetic data with\ncorrect structural configurations, significantly boosting the performance of\ncuneiform sign recognition beyond existing techniques, in particular over rare\nsigns.

    "abstract": "This work introduces an extension of the iterated moving average filter,\ncalled the Extended Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (EKZ) filter for time series and\nspatio-temporal analysis. The iterated application of a central simple moving\naverage (SMA) filter, also known as a Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter, is a\nlow-pass filter defined by the length of the moving average window and the\nnumber of iterations. These two arguments determine the filter properties such\nas the energy transfer function and cut-off frequency. However, the existing KZ\nfilter is only defined for positive odd integer widow lengths. Therefore, for\nany finite time series dataset there is only a relatively small selection of\npossible window lengths, determined by the length of the dataset, with which to\napply a KZ filter. This inflexibility impedes use of KZ filters for a wide\nvariety of applications such as time series component separation, filtration,\nsignal reconstruction, energy transfer function design, modeling, and\nforecasting. The proposed EKZ filter extends the KZ and SMA filters by\npermitting a widened range of argument selection for the filter window length\nproviding the choice of an infinite number of filters that may be applied to a\ndataset, affording enhanced control over the filter characteristics and greater\npractical application.

In contrast to existing Bayesian decision-theoretic formulation\nchiefly reliant upon the symmetric 0-1 loss, the new method -- which we call\nBayesian Decoupling -- employs a family of penalized loss functions indexed by\na sparsity-tuning parameter. We propose a class of reweighted l1 penalties,\nwith two specific instances that achieve simultaneous bias reduction and\nconvexity. The design of the penalties incorporates considerations of signal\nsizes, as enabled by the Bayesian paradigm. The tuning parameter is selected\nusing a posterior benchmarking criterion, which quantifies the drop in\npredictive power relative to the posterior mean which is the optimal Bayes\nestimator under the squared error loss. Additionally, in contrast to the widely\nused median probability model technique which selects variables by thresholding\nposterior inclusion probabilities at the fixed threshold of 1/2, Bayesian\nDecoupling enables the use of a data-driven threshold which automatically\nadapts to estimated signal sizes and offers far better performance in\nhigh-dimensional settings with highly correlated predictors. Our numerical\nresults in such settings show that certain combinations of priors and loss\nfunctions significantly improve the solution path compared to existing methods,\nprioritizing true signals early along the path before false signals are\nselected. Consequently, Bayesian Decoupling produces estimates with better\nprediction and selection performance. Finally, a real data application\nillustrates the practical advantages of our approaches which select sparser\nmodels with larger coefficient estimates.",

In this paper, we introduce the causal effect on the\nnumber of life years lost due to a specific event, and we give assumptions\nunder which the average treatment effect (ATE) and the conditional average\ntreatment effect (CATE) are identified from the observed data. Semiparametric\nestimators for ATE and a partially linear projection of CATE, serving as a\nvariable importance measure, are proposed. These estimators leverage machine\nlearning for nuisance parameters and are model-agnostic, asymptotically normal,\nand efficient. We give conditions under which the estimators are asymptotically\nnormal, and their performance are investigated in a simulation study. Lastly,\nthe methods are implemented in a study concerning the response to different\nantidepressants using data from the Danish national registers.",

    "abstract": "Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) lie deep within the largest gravitationally\nbound structures in existence. Though some cluster finding techniques identify\nthe position of the BCG and use it as the cluster center, other techniques may\nnot automatically include these coordinates. This can make studying BCGs in\nsuch surveys difficult, forcing researchers to either adopt oversimplified\nalgorithms or perform cumbersome visual identification. For large surveys,\nthere is a need for a fast and reliable way of obtaining BCG coordinates. We\npropose machine learning to accomplish this task and train a neural network to\nidentify positions of candidate BCGs given no more information than multiband\nphotometric images. We use both mock observations from The Three Hundred\nproject and real ones from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and we quantify\nthe performance. Training on simulations yields a squared correlation\ncoefficient, R$^2$, between predictions and ground truth of R$^2 \\approx 0.94$\nwhen testing on simulations, which decreases to R$^2 \\approx 0.60$ when testing\non real data due to discrepancies between datasets. Limiting the application of\nthis method to real clusters more representative of the training data, such\nthose with a BCG r-band magnitude $r_{\\text{BCG}} \\leq 16.5$, yields R$^2\n\\approx 0.99$. The method performs well up to a redshift of at least $z\\approx\n0.6$. We find this technique to be a promising method to automate and\naccelerate the identification of BCGs in large datasets.",

The predicted spatial and kinematic\ndistributions of simulated HVSs are remarkably similar to the observed\ndistributions. In particular, we reproduce the conspicuous angular clustering\nof HVSs around the constellation Leo. This clustering occurs because HVSs from\nthe LMC are boosted by $\\sim300\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ by the orbital motion of the\nLMC, and stars launched parallel to this motion are preferentially selected as\nHVS candidates.

Typically starting from\nmean-field calculations, this framework allows for the calculation of one- and\ntwo-electron interactions, and the parametrization of a many-body Hamiltonian\nrepresenting the active space of interest. The subsequent solution of such\nHamiltonians can provide insights into the physics of strongly-correlated\nmaterials. While phonons can substantially screen electron-electron\ninteractions, electron-phonon coupling has been commonly ignored within ab\ninitio downfolding, and when considered this is done only for short-range\ninteractions. Here we propose a theory of ab initio downfolding that accounts\nfor all mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling on equal footing, regardless of\nthe range of the interactions. Our practical computational implementation is\nreadily compatible with current downfolding approaches. We apply our approach\nto polar materials MgO and GeTe, and we reveal the importance of both\nshort-range and long-range electron-phonon coupling in determining the\nmagnitude of electron-electron interactions. Our results show that in the\nstatic limit, phonons reduce the on-site repulsion between electrons by 40% for\nMgO, and by 79% for GeTe.

We performed a\nsuite of bench-top and on-sky tests to characterize this sensor and analyze its\nsuitability for use in astronomical instruments. This paper presents\nmeasurements of linearity, conversion gain, read noise, dark current, quantum\nefficiency, image lag, and crosstalk. We found that the sensor exhibits\nnonlinear response below 5% of saturation. This nonlinearity is plausibly\nattributable to the trapping of electrons in each pixel. We developed and\nimplemented a pixel-by-pixel nonlinearity correction, enabling accurate\nphotometric measurements across the dynamic range. After implementing this\ncorrection, operating in the correlated multi-sampling mode, the sensor\nachieved an effective read noise of $2.9 e^-$ and dark current of $0.12\ne^-/pix/s$ at $-25^\\circ C$. The quantum efficiency exceeded 50% from 250 nm to\n800 nm, peaking at 89% at 600 nm. We observed significant optical crosstalk\nbetween the pixels, likely caused by photoelectron diffusion. To demonstrate\nthe sensor's astronomical performance, we mounted it on the WINTER 1m telescope\nat Palomar Observatory. These tests confirmed that the linearity calibration\nenables accurate stellar photometry and validated our measured noise levels.\nOverall, the COSMOS-66 delivers similar noise performance to large-format CCDs,\nwith higher frame rates and relaxed cooling requirements. If pixel design\nimprovements are made to mitigate the nonlinearity and crosstalk, then the\ncamera may combine the advantages of low-noise CMOS image sensors with the\nintegration simplicity of large-format CCDs, broadening its utility to a host\nof astronomical science cases.",

Here, we\nshow that this no-go theorem can be circumvented if we constrain atom losses to\na single spin component.

Transformer-based language models rely\non Softmax to compute attention scores, causing the attention distribution to\nflatten as the context size grows. This reduces the model's ability to\nprioritize key information effectively and potentially limits its length\ngeneralization. To address this problem, we propose Scalable-Softmax (SSMax),\nwhich replaces Softmax in scenarios where the input vector size varies. SSMax\ncan be seamlessly integrated into existing Transformer-based architectures.\nExperimental results in language modeling show that models using SSMax not only\nachieve faster loss reduction during pretraining but also significantly improve\nperformance in long contexts and key information retrieval. Furthermore, an\nanalysis of attention scores reveals that SSMax enables the model to focus\nattention on key information even in long contexts. Additionally, although\nmodels that use SSMax from the beginning of pretraining achieve better length\ngeneralization, those that have already started pretraining can still gain some\nof this ability by replacing Softmax in the attention layers with SSMax, either\nduring or after pretraining.",

    "abstract": "Large language model-based (LLM-based) agents have become common in settings\nthat include non-cooperative parties. In such settings, agents' decision-making\nneeds to conceal information from their adversaries, reveal information to\ntheir cooperators, and infer information to identify the other agents'\ncharacteristics. To investigate whether LLMs have these information control and\ndecision-making capabilities, we make LLM agents play the language-based\nhidden-identity game, The Chameleon. In the game, a group of non-chameleon\nagents who do not know each other aim to identify the chameleon agent without\nrevealing a secret. The game requires the aforementioned information control\ncapabilities both as a chameleon and a non-chameleon. The empirical results\nshow that while non-chameleon LLM agents identify the chameleon, they fail to\nconceal the secret from the chameleon, and their winning probability is far\nfrom the levels of even trivial strategies. To formally explain this behavior,\nwe give a theoretical analysis for a spectrum of strategies, from concealing to\nrevealing, and provide bounds on the non-chameleons' winning probability. Based\non the empirical results and theoretical analysis of different strategies, we\ndeduce that LLM-based non-chameleon agents reveal excessive information to\nagents of unknown identities.

Recent works have fused low-rank adaptation (LoRA) techniques with\nfederated fine-tuning to mitigate challenges associated with device model sizes\nand data scarcity. Still, the heterogeneity of resources remains a critical\nbottleneck: while higher-rank modules generally enhance performance, varying\ndevice capabilities constrain LoRA's feasible rank range. Existing approaches\nattempting to resolve this issue either lack analytical justification or impose\nadditional computational overhead, leaving a wide gap for efficient and\ntheoretically-grounded solutions. To address these challenges, we propose\nfederated sketching LoRA (FSLoRA), which leverages a sketching mechanism to\nenable devices to selectively update submatrices of global LoRA modules\nmaintained by the server. By adjusting the sketching ratios, which determine\nthe ranks of the submatrices on the devices, FSLoRA flexibly adapts to\ndevice-specific communication and computational constraints. We provide a\nrigorous convergence analysis of FSLoRA that characterizes how the sketching\nratios affect the convergence rate. Through comprehensive experiments on\nmultiple datasets and LLM models, we demonstrate FSLoRA's performance\nimprovements compared to various baselines.

In that goal, we study multi-agent sequential decision-making by\nconsidering principal-agent interactions in a tree structure. In this problem,\nthe reward of a player is influenced by the actions of her children, who are\nall self-interested and non-cooperative, hence the complexity of making good\ndecisions. Our main finding is that it is possible to steer all the players\ntowards the globally optimal set of actions by simply allowing single-step\ntransfers between them. A transfer is established between a principal and one\nof her agents: the principal actually offers the proposed payment if the agent\npicks the recommended action. The analysis poses specific challenges due to the\nintricate interactions between the nodes of the tree and the propagation of the\nregret within this tree. Considering a bandit setup, we propose algorithmic\nsolutions for the players to end up being no-regret with respect to the optimal\npair of actions and incentives. In the long run, allowing transfers between\nplayers makes them act as if they were collaborating together, although they\nremain self-interested non-cooperative: transfers restore efficiency.",

The\nIO employs complete task-specific information to compute test statistics for\nmaking inference decisions and performs optimally in signal detection tasks.\nHowever, the IO test statistic typically depends non-linearly on the image data\nand cannot be analytically determined. The ideal linear observer, known as the\nHotelling observer (HO), can sometimes be used as a surrogate for the IO.\nHowever, when image data are high dimensional, HO computation can be difficult.\nEfficient channels that can extract task-relevant features have been\ninvestigated to reduce the dimensionality of image data to approximate IO and\nHO performance. This work proposes a novel method for generating efficient\nchannels by use of the gradient of a Lagrangian-based loss function that was\ndesigned to learn the HO. The generated channels are referred to as the\nLagrangian-gradient (L-grad) channels. Numerical studies are conducted that\nconsider binary signal detection tasks involving various backgrounds and\nsignals.

    "abstract": "Artificial Kitaev chains based on arrays of quantum dots are promising\nplatforms for realizing Majorana Bound States (MBSs). In a two-site Kitaev\nchain, it is possible to find these non-Abelian zero-energy excitations at\ncertain points in parameter space (sweet spots). These states, commonly\nreferred to as Poor man's Majorana bound states (PMMs), are challenging to find\nand stabilize experimentally. In this work, we investigate the evolution of the\nsweet spots as we increase the number of sites of the Kitaev chain. To this\nend, we use the Bogoliubov-de Gennes representation to study the excitations of\nthe system, and the scattering matrix and Green functions formalisms to\ncalculate the zero-bias conductance. Our results show that the sweet spots\nevolve into a region that grows bigger and becomes gradually more protected as\nthe number of sites $N$ increases. Due to the protection of the MBSs, we refer\nto this region as a topological island. We obtain similar results by\nconsidering a realistic spinful model with finite magnetic fields in a chain of\nnormal-superconducting quantum dots. For long chains, $N \\geq 20$, we show the\nemergence of strictly zero-energy plateaus robust against disorder. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the topological islands can be observed by performing\nconductance measurements via a quantum dot side-coupled to the Kitaev chain.\nOur work shows that the fine-tuning required to create and detect PMMs in a\n2-site Kitaev chain is significantly relaxed as the length of the chain\nincreases and details how PMMs evolve into MBSs. Our results are consistent\nwith experimental reports for 2 and 3-site chains.",

    "abstract": "We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum\nlow-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there\nexist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for\nall qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the\nFreedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building\nmanifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the\nTanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a\nproduct manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its\ntriangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or\nmore generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological,\nand hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically\ncorresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field\ntheory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained\nfrom the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the\nfirst non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with\nconstant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\\Theta(N)$, and\npolynomial distance $D=\\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product\ncodes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC\ncodes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\\Omega(\\sqrt{N})$ exceeding\nthe $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\\\"onig bound for\nconventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply\nnative logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject\nhigh-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the\ndistillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain\ncan inject $\\Theta(\\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.",

    "abstract": "Numerous machine learning and industrial problems can be modeled as the\nminimization of a sum of $N$ so-called clipped convex functions (SCC), i.e.\neach term of the sum stems as the pointwise minimum between a constant and a\nconvex function. In this work, we extend this framework to capture more\nproblems of interest. Specifically, we allow each term of the sum to be a\npointwise minimum of an arbitrary number of convex functions, called\ncomponents, turning the objective into a sum of pointwise minima of convex\nfunctions (SMC).\n  Problem (SCC) is NP-hard, highlighting an appeal for scalable local\nheuristics. In this spirit, one can express (SMC) objectives as the difference\nbetween two convex functions to leverage the possibility to apply (DC)\nalgorithms to compute critical points of the problem. Our approach relies on a\nbi-convex reformulation of the problem. From there, we derive a family of local\nmethods, dubbed as relaxed alternating minimization (r-AM) methods, that\ninclude classical alternating minimization (AM) as a special case. We prove\nthat every accumulation point of r-AM is critical. In addition, we show the\nempirical superiority of r-AM, compared to traditional AM and (DC) approaches,\non piecewise-linear regression and restricted facility location problems.\n  Under mild assumptions, (SCC) can be cast as a mixed-integer convex program\n(MICP) using perspective functions. This approach can be generalized to (SMC)\nbut introduces many copies of the primal variable. In contrast, we suggest a\ncompact big-M based (MICP) equivalent formulation of (SMC), free of these extra\nvariables. Finally, we showcase practical examples where solving our (MICP),\nrestricted to a neighbourhood of a given candidate (i.e. output iterate of a\nlocal method), will either certify the candidate's optimality on that\nneighbourhood or providing a new point, strictly better, to restart the local\nmethod.",

A\nspectrum-wide analysis of power requires attention to the fundamental\nprinciples that constrain these processes. In the social realm, the acquisition\nand maintenance of power is intertwined with both social interactions and\ncognitive processing capacity: socially-facilitated empowerment grants agents\nmore information-processing capacities and opportunities, either by relying on\nothers to bring about desired policies or ultimately outcomes, and/or by\nenjoying more information-processing possibilities as a result of relying on\nothers for the reproduction of (material) tasks. The effects of social\nempowerment thus imply an increased ability to harness computation toward\ndesired ends, thereby augmenting the evolution of a specific state space.\nEmpowered individuals attract the attention of others, who contribute to\nincreasing the scale of their access to various policies effectuating these\nstate spaces. The presented argument posits that social power, in the context\nof active inference, is a function of several variables. As a result of its\npower-amplifying effects, this extended computational ability also buffers\nagainst possible vulnerabilities. We propose that individuals wield power not\nonly by associating with others possessing desirable policies, but also by\nenhancing their ability to intake and compute information effectively.

    "abstract": "Numerous powerful large language models (LLMs) are now available for use as\nwriting support tools, idea generators, and beyond. Although these LLMs are\nmarketed as helpful creative assistants, several works have shown that using an\nLLM as a creative partner results in a narrower set of creative outputs.\nHowever, these studies only consider the effects of interacting with a single\nLLM, begging the question of whether such narrowed creativity stems from using\na particular LLM -- which arguably has a limited range of outputs -- or from\nusing LLMs in general as creative assistants. To study this question, we elicit\ncreative responses from humans and a broad set of LLMs using standardized\ncreativity tests and compare the population-level diversity of responses. We\nfind that LLM responses are much more similar to other LLM responses than human\nresponses are to each other, even after controlling for response structure and\nother key variables. This finding of significant homogeneity in creative\noutputs across the LLMs we evaluate adds a new dimension to the ongoing\nconversation about creativity and LLMs. If today's LLMs behave similarly, using\nthem as a creative partners -- regardless of the model used -- may drive all\nusers towards a limited set of \"creative\" outputs.",

However, when testing multiple hypotheses\nsimultaneously, current $e$-value based multiple testing methods such as e-BH\nare not invariant to the order in which data are gathered for the different\n$e$-processes. This can lead to undesirable situations, e.g., where a\nhypothesis rejected at time $t$ is no longer rejected at time $t+1$ after\nchoosing to gather more data for one or more $e$-processes unrelated to that\nhypothesis. We argue that multiple testing methods should always work with\nsuprema of $e$-processes. We provide an example to illustrate that e-BH does\nnot control the FDR, at level $\\alpha$ when applied to suprema of\n$e$-processes. From the same example we see that the FWER is not controlled\nwith averaging, and also closed e-BH does not control the FDR.

The meninges are often oversimplified in current\nfinite element (FE) head models due to their complex anatomy and\nspatially-variant mechanical behavior. This study performed a systematic review\n(SR) on the mechanical properties of each individual layer of the meninges to\nobtain benchmark data for FE modeling and to identify gaps in the current\nliterature. Relevant studies were filtered through three stages: a broad\ninitial search filter, a large language model classifier, and manual\nverification by a human reviewer. Out of over 25,000 studies initially\nconsidered, this review ultimately included 47 studies on the dura mater, 8 on\nthe arachnoid mater, and 7 on the pia mater, representing the largest and most\ncomprehensive SR on the mechanical properties of the meninges. Each layer was\nfound to exhibit nonlinear rate dependence that varies with species, age,\nlocation, and orientation. This study revealed that the elastic modulus of pia\nmater most often used in simplified linear elastic FE models is likely\nunderestimated by an order of magnitude and fails to consider directional\ndependence. Future studies investigating the mechanical properties of the\nmeninges should focus on a wider range of loading rates as well as age effects\nfor the arachnoid mater and pia mater, as these features are relatively\nunderstudied and expected to affect the fidelity of FE predictions.",

Specifically,\nenergy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually\nincreases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss\ncharacterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a\ntheoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased\nenergy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a\ncritical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically\nindicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this\nissue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the\nincrease in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to\nprevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We\ntheoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an\nentropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its\neffectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate\nthe commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of\nEPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.",

    "abstract": "We present an all-digital programmable machine learning accelerator chip for\nimage classification, underpinning on the Tsetlin machine (TM) principles. The\nTM is an emerging machine learning algorithm founded on propositional logic,\nutilizing sub-pattern recognition expressions called clauses. The accelerator\nimplements the coalesced TM version with convolution, and classifies\nbooleanized images of 28$\\times$28 pixels with 10 categories. A configuration\nwith 128 clauses is used in a highly parallel architecture. Fast clause\nevaluation is achieved by keeping all clause weights and Tsetlin automata (TA)\naction signals in registers. The chip is implemented in a 65 nm low-leakage\nCMOS technology, and occupies an active area of 2.7 mm$^2$. At a clock\nfrequency of 27.8 MHz, the accelerator achieves 60.3k classifications per\nsecond, and consumes 8.6 nJ per classification. This demonstrates the\nenergy-efficiency of the TM, which was the main motivation for developing this\nchip. The latency for classifying a single image is 25.4 $\\mu$s which includes\nsystem timing overhead. The accelerator achieves 97.42%, 84.54% and 82.55% test\naccuracies for the datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and Kuzushiji-MNIST,\nrespectively, matching the TM software models.",

    "abstract": "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays a pivotal role in fluid mechanics,\nenabling precise simulations of fluid behavior through partial differential\nequations (PDEs). However, traditional CFD methods are resource-intensive,\nparticularly for high-fidelity simulations of complex flows, which are further\ncomplicated by high dimensionality, inherent stochasticity, and limited data\navailability. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a data-driven\napproach that leverages a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) to\nencode high-dimensional scientific data into low-dimensional, physically\nmeaningful representations. The GMVAE learns a structured latent space where\ndata can be categorized based on physical properties such as the Reynolds\nnumber while maintaining global physical consistency. To assess the\ninterpretability of the learned representations, we introduce a novel metric\nbased on graph spectral theory, quantifying the smoothness of physical\nquantities along the latent manifold. We validate our approach using 2D\nNavier-Stokes simulations of flow past a cylinder over a range of Reynolds\nnumbers. Our results demonstrate that the GMVAE provides improved clustering,\nmeaningful latent structure, and robust generative capabilities compared to\nbaseline dimensionality reduction methods. This framework offers a promising\ndirection for data-driven turbulence modeling and broader applications in\ncomputational fluid dynamics and engineering systems.",

Traditional approaches often seek a single\nPareto-optimal set that balances trade-offs among all objectives. In this work,\nwe consider a problem setting that departs from this paradigm: finding a small\nset of K < T solutions, that collectively \"covers\" the T objectives. A set of\nsolutions is defined as \"covering\" if, for each objective $f_1$, ..., $f_T$,\nthere is at least one good solution. A motivating example for this problem\nsetting occurs in drug design. For example, we may have T pathogens and aim to\nidentify a set of K < T antibiotics such that at least one antibiotic can be\nused to treat each pathogen. To address this problem, we propose\nMulti-Objective Coverage Bayesian Optimization (MOCOBO), a principled algorithm\ndesigned to efficiently find a covering set.

For example, to interpret an action as an\nintervention on a treatment variable, the action will presumably have to a)\nchange the distribution of treatment in a way that corresponds to the\nintervention, and b) not change other aspects, such as how the outcome depends\non the treatment; while the marginal distributions of some variables may change\nas an effect. We introduce a formal framework to make such requirements for\ndifferent interpretations of actions as interventions precise. We prove that\nthe seemingly natural interpretation of actions as interventions is circular:\nUnder this interpretation, every causal Bayesian network that correctly models\nthe observational distribution is trivially also interventionally valid, and no\naction yields empirical data that could possibly falsify such a model.

    "abstract": "Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) constitute a key population of bright\nstar-forming galaxies at high redshift. These galaxies challenge galaxy\nformation models, particularly in reproducing their observed number counts and\nredshift distributions. Furthermore, although SMGs contribute significantly to\nthe cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), their precise role remains\nuncertain. Upcoming surveys, such as the Ultra Deep Survey with the TolTEC\ncamera, are expected to offer valuable insights into SMG properties and their\nbroader impact. Robust modeling of SMGs in a cosmologically representative\nvolume is necessary to investigate their nature in preparation for\nnext-generation submillimeter surveys. We implement and test parametric\nrelations derived from radiative transfer calculations across three\ncosmological simulations: EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and FLAMINGO. Particular\nemphasis is placed on the FLAMINGO due to their large volume and robust\nstatistical sampling of SMGs. Based on the model that best reproduces\nobservations, we forecast submillimeter fluxes within the simulations, analyze\nthe properties of SMGs, and evaluate their evolution over cosmic time. Our\nresults show that the FLAMINGO reproduces the observed redshift distribution\nand source number counts of SMGs without requiring a top-heavy initial mass\nfunction. On the other hand, the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG show a deficit of\nbright SMGs. We find that SMGs with S850 > 1 mJy contribute up to 27% of the\nSFRD at z=2.6 in the FLAMINGO, consistent with recent observations. Flux\ndensity functions reveal a rise in SMG abundance from z = 6 to 2.5, followed by\na sharp decline in the number of brighter SMGs from z = 2.5 to 0. Leveraging\nthe SMG population in FLAMINGO, we forecast that the TolTEC UDS will detect\n80,000 sources over 0.8 deg^2 at 1.1 mm (at the 4{\\sigma} detection limit),\ncapturing about 50% of the cosmic SFRD at z=2.5.",

After introducing persistent homology, one of\nthe main tools in Topological Data Analysis, we shall discuss how this concept\ncan be used to quantitatively analyse the behaviour of monopoles across the\ndeconfinement phase transition. Our approach is first demonstrated for Compact\n$U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory, which is known to have a zero-temperature\ndeconfinement phase transition driven by the restoration of the symmetry\nassociated with the conservation of the magnetic charge. For this system, we\nperform a finite-size scaling analysis of observables capturing the homology of\nmagnetic current loops, showing that the expected value of the deconfinement\ncritical coupling is reproduced by our analysis. We then extend our method to\n$SU(3)$ gauge theory, in which Abelian magnetic monopoles are identified after\nprojection in the Maximal Abelian Gauge. A finite-size scaling of our\nhomological observables of Abelian magnetic current loops at temporal size $N_t\n= 4$ provides the expected value of the critical coupling with an accuracy that\nis generally higher than that obtained with conventional thermodynamic\napproaches at comparable statistics, hinting towards the relevance of\ntopological properties of monopole currents for confinement.",

Simply incorporating SLAM and 3DGS leads to mismatches between\nthe reconstructed frames. In this work, we present Endo-2DTAM, a real-time\nendoscopic SLAM system with 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) to address these\nchallenges. Endo-2DTAM incorporates a surface normal-aware pipeline, which\nconsists of tracking, mapping, and bundle adjustment modules for geometrically\naccurate reconstruction. Our robust tracking module combines point-to-point and\npoint-to-plane distance metrics, while the mapping module utilizes normal\nconsistency and depth distortion to enhance surface reconstruction quality. We\nalso introduce a pose-consistent strategy for efficient and geometrically\ncoherent keyframe sampling. Extensive experiments on public endoscopic datasets\ndemonstrate that Endo-2DTAM achieves an RMSE of $1.87\\pm 0.63$ mm for depth\nreconstruction of surgical scenes while maintaining computationally efficient\ntracking, high-quality visual appearance, and real-time rendering.

    "abstract": "Large language models exhibit a remarkable capacity in language generation\nand comprehension. These advances enable AI systems to produce more human-like\nand emotionally engaging text. However, these models rely on a large number of\nparameters, requiring significant computational resources for training and\ninference. In some scenarios, accessing these resources can be challenging\n(e.g., budget or hardware limitations). Techniques like reducing precision bits\ncan make models more memory-efficient, reducing the computational resources\nneeded, at the cost of reduced accuracy. This paper addresses the trade-off\nbetween different quantization values, GPU RAM utilization, and text quality in\naffective text generation (e.g., \"I really enjoy running in the snow-covered\nforest\"). To evaluate, we use an emotion classifier and ten seed prompts to\ngenerate affective text. We test three setups of precision bits (8, 16, and 32)\nacross five open-weight language models from two different families. Our\nfindings demonstrate that bit reductions lead to memory savings, achieving a\nreduction of 76%. However, this optimization comes with a trade-off, leading to\na decrease of up to 10 pp in F1 score for larger models and an increase of 10\npp for smaller models, along with roughly double the inference time. In terms\nof text quality, larger models at lower quantization levels generally\noutperform smaller, higher-precision models -- while requiring similar memory.",

While this approach guarantees to reproduce the target output, it\nincurs a substantial penalty: many high-quality draft tokens are rejected, even\nwhen they represent objectively valid continuations. Indeed, we show that even\npowerful draft models such as GPT-4o, as well as human text cannot achieve high\nacceptance rates under the standard verification scheme. This severely limits\nthe speedup potential of current speculative decoding methods, as an early\nrejection becomes overwhelmingly likely when solely relying on alignment of\ndraft and target.\n  We thus ask the following question: Can we adapt verification to recognize\ncorrect, but non-aligned replies?

In this analysis, we compare LLM's ability to elicit\nrequirements of a software system, as compared to that of a human expert in a\ntime-boxed and prompt-boxed study. We found LLM-generated requirements were\nevaluated as more aligned (+1.12) than human-generated requirements with a\ntrend of being more complete (+10.2%).

This is saturated by an\ninfinite tower of axial vector mesons, and their numerical contribution to the\nmuon $g-2$ in AdS/QCD models agrees rather well with a recent dispersive\nanalysis and alternative approaches. However, the longitudinal short-distance\nconstraint where all virtualities are large turns out to be matched only at the\nlevel of 81\\%. In this Letter we show that tensor mesons, whose contribution to\nthe muon $g-2$ has recently been found to be underestimated, can fill this gap,\nbecause in holographic QCD their infinite tower of excited mesons only\ncontributes to the symmetric longitudinal short-distance constraint.\nNumerically, they give rise to a sizeable positive contribution from the\nlow-energy region below 1.5 GeV, a small one from the mixed region, and a\nnegligible one from the high-energy region, which could explain the remaining\ngap between the most recent dispersive and lattice results for the complete\nhadronic light-by-light contribution.",

In root of unity cases\nwith $\\alpha=2$, the $(h,v)$ modular covariant partition functions are also\nexpressed as sesquilinear forms in affine $u(1)$ characters involving\ngeneralized Bezout conjugates. These also give the modular covariant partition\nfunctions for the 6-vertex and Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex models in the\ncorresponding regimes.",

    "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) has shown promising improvement in downstream task\nadaptation of LLMs by augmenting prompts with relevant input-output examples\n(demonstrations). However, the ICL demonstrations can contain privacy-sensitive\ninformation, which can be leaked and/or regurgitated by the LLM output.\nDifferential Privacy (DP), a widely adopted privacy safeguard, has emerged to\nmitigate this privacy leakage, with recent work demonstrating strong\nprivacy-utility tradeoffs in classification tasks for ICL. However, generation\ntasks for ICL are challenging due to the high-dimensional output space of\nopen-ended generation. To this end, we propose $\\texttt{dps-mozo}$,\nDifferentially Private Sampling by Mixing One-shot with Zero-shot Outputs, a\ndecoding framework that generates DP text by sampling from the product of\nmultiple one-shot outputs mixed with a zero-shot output. This mixing\neffectively reduces the amount of information that can be leaked by each\ndemonstration. By utilizing the inherent randomness in sampling from the mixed\ndistributions, we can achieve DP without adding noise, thereby improving the\nprivacy-utility tradeoff. Our experimental evaluations show $\\texttt{dps-mozo}$\ncan achieve a strong privacy guarantee, $\\epsilon=2$, with minimal utility\ndegradation compared to non-private few-shot learning, $\\textbf{0.3}$% ROUGE-L\nF1 score decrease on the SAMSum dataset with Gemma 2 2B.",

Recent\nadvances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that they can be used to\nsynthesize high-quality natural language text and code that conforms to the\ngrammar of a given input format. Nevertheless, LLMs are often incapable or too\ncostly to generate non-textual outputs, such as images, videos, and PDF files.\nThis limitation hinders the application of LLMs in grammar-aware fuzzing.\n  We present a novel approach to enabling grammar-aware fuzzing over\nnon-textual inputs. We employ LLMs to synthesize and also mutate input\ngenerators, in the form of Python scripts, that generate data conforming to the\ngrammar of a given input format. Then, non-textual data yielded by the input\ngenerators are further mutated by traditional fuzzers (AFL++) to explore the\nsoftware input space effectively. Our approach, namely G2FUZZ, features a\nhybrid strategy that combines a holistic search driven by LLMs and a local\nsearch driven by industrial quality fuzzers. Two key advantages are: (1) LLMs\nare good at synthesizing and mutating input generators and enabling jumping out\nof local optima, thus achieving a synergistic effect when combined with\nmutation-based fuzzers; (2) LLMs are less frequently invoked unless really\nneeded, thus significantly reducing the cost of LLM usage. We have evaluated\nG2FUZZ on a variety of input formats, including TIFF images, MP4 audios, and\nPDF files. The results show that G2FUZZ outperforms SOTA tools such as AFL++,\nFuzztruction, and FormatFuzzer in terms of code coverage and bug finding across\nmost programs tested on three platforms: UNIFUZZ, FuzzBench, and MAGMA.",

Yet their internal processes remain elusive, frequently\ndescribed as \"black boxes.\" While performance can be refined experimentally,\nachieving a fundamental grasp of their inner workings is still a challenge.\n  Statistical Mechanics has long tackled computational problems, and this\nthesis applies physics-based insights to understand DNNs via three\ncomplementary approaches.\n  First, by averaging over data, we derive an asymptotic bound on\ngeneralization that depends solely on the size of the last layer, rather than\non the total number of parameters -- revealing how deep architectures process\ninformation differently across layers.\n  Second, adopting a data-dependent viewpoint, we explore a finite-width\nthermodynamic limit beyond the infinite-width regime. This leads to: (i) a\nclosed-form expression for the generalization error in a finite-width\none-hidden-layer network (regression task); (ii) an approximate partition\nfunction for deeper architectures; and (iii) a link between deep networks in\nthis thermodynamic limit and Student's t-processes.\n  Finally, from a task-explicit perspective, we present a preliminary analysis\nof how DNNs interact with a controlled dataset, investigating whether they\ntruly internalize its structure -- collapsing to the teacher -- or merely\nmemorize it. By understanding when a network must learn data structure rather\nthan just memorize, it sheds light on fostering meaningful internal\nrepresentations.\n  In essence, this thesis leverages the synergy between Statistical Physics and\nMachine Learning to illuminate the inner behavior of DNNs.",

    "abstract": "Learning discrete distributions from i.i.d. samples is a well-understood\nproblem. However, advances in generative machine learning prompt an interesting\nnew, non-i.i.d. setting: after receiving a certain number of samples, an\nestimated distribution is fixed, and samples from this estimate are drawn and\nintroduced into the sample corpus, undifferentiated from real samples.\nSubsequent generations of estimators now face contaminated environments, a\nscenario referred to in the machine learning literature as self-consumption.\nEmpirically, it has been observed that models in fully synthetic self-consuming\nloops collapse -- their performance deteriorates with each batch of training --\nbut accumulating data has been shown to prevent complete degeneration. This, in\nturn, begs the question: What happens when fresh real samples \\textit{are}\nadded at every stage? In this paper, we study the minimax loss of\nself-consuming discrete distribution estimation in such loops. We show that\neven when model collapse is consciously averted, the ratios between the minimax\nlosses with and without source information can grow unbounded as the batch size\nincreases. In the data accumulation setting, where all batches of samples are\navailable for estimation, we provide minimax lower bounds and upper bounds that\nare order-optimal under mild conditions for the expected $\\ell_2^2$ and\n$\\ell_1$ losses at every stage. We provide conditions for regimes where there\nis a strict gap in the convergence rates compared to the corresponding\noracle-assisted minimax loss where real and synthetic samples are\ndifferentiated, and provide examples where this gap is easily observed. We also\nprovide a lower bound on the minimax loss in the data replacement setting,\nwhere only the latest batch of samples is available, and use it to find a lower\nbound for the worst-case loss for bounded estimate trajectories.",

By\nanalyzing real data and a simple model, we show that neural oscillations play a\nkey role in the appearance of this toroidal topology. To quantitatively monitor\nhow changes in spike trains influence the topology of the data, we first define\na robust measure for the degree of toroidality of a dataset. Using this\nmeasure, we find that small perturbations ($\\sim$ 100 ms) of spike times have\nlittle influence on both the toroidality and the hexagonality of the ratemaps.\nJittering spikes by $\\sim$ 100-500 ms, however, destroys the toroidal topology,\nwhile still having little impact on grid scores. These critical jittering time\nscales fall in the range of the periods of oscillations between the theta and\neta bands. We thus hypothesized that these oscillatory modulations of neuronal\nspiking play a key role in the appearance and robustness of toroidal topology\nand the hexagonal spatial selectivity is not sufficient. We confirmed this\nhypothesis using a simple model for the activity of grid cells, consisting of\nan ensemble of independent rate-modulated Poisson processes. When these rates\nwere modulated by oscillations, the network behaved similarly to the real data\nin exhibiting toroidal topology, even when the position of the fields were\nperturbed. In the absence of oscillations, this similarity was substantially\nlower. Furthermore, we find that the experimentally recorded spike trains\nindeed exhibit temporal modulations at the eta and theta bands, and that the\nratio of the power in the eta band to that of the theta band,\n$A_{\\eta}/A_{\\theta}$, correlates with the critical jittering time at which the\ntoroidal topology disappears.",

    "abstract": "The integration of human-intuitive interactions into autonomous systems has\nbeen limited. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle\nwith context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot\ninteraction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ntransformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication\nthrough speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and\nrobotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central\nfocus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly\nbeing leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation\nalgorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid\ndecision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while\neffective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption\nand latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic\nvision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks\n(SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency\nnavigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these\nsystems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In\nthis work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework\nimplemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural\nlanguage processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level\nplanning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based\nneuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its\ncapabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and\nadapting to human instructions in real-time.",

Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we\nsteer the output of diffusion models based on some quantity on the goodness of\nthe content. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual\nquality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should\noptimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper,\nwe propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can\nselect a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward, at\ninference time. We then point out that the improvement of perceptual video\nquality considering the alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by\nweighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language\nmodels evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of\nvideo do not always correlate with evaluation. We demonstrate that our method\nimproves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and\nhuman assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best\ngeneration compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more\nefficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is\nbeneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline\nthat we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into lookahead\nsteps for reward estimation over search budget or denoising steps.",

However, its study provides constraints on\nthe phase diagram at the physical point. In this work, we investigate how the\norder of the chiral phase transition depends on the number of light quark\nflavours. To approach the lattice chiral limit, we map out and extrapolate the\nchiral critical surface that separates the first-order region from the\ncrossover region in an extended parameter space, which includes the gauge\ncoupling, the number of quark flavours, their masses, and the lattice spacing.\nLattice simulations with standard staggered quarks reveal that for each $N_f <\n8$, there exists a tricritical lattice spacing $a^\\text{tric}(N_f)$, at which\nthe chiral transition changes from first order ($a>a^\\text{tric}$) to second\norder ($a<a^\\text{tric}$). Thus, the first-order region is merely a lattice\nartifact and not connected to the continuum. By determining the associated\ntemperatures $T(N_f^\\text{tric},a ^\\text{tric})$ at these tricritical points,\nwe confirm the expected decrease in the critical temperature as the number of\nflavours increases. The obtained temperatures define a tricritical line which\nis connected to the continuum and terminates at a physical $\nN_f^\\text{tric}(a=0) $.

    "abstract": "We numerically study the extreme-value statistics of the Schmidt eigenvalues\nof reduced density matrices obtained from the ergodic eigenstates. We start by\nexploring the extreme value statistics of the ultrametric random matrices and\nthen the related Quantum Sun Model, which is also a toy model of avalanche\ntheory. It is expected that these ergodic eigenstates are purely random and\nthus possess random matrix theory-like features, and the corresponding\neigenvalue density should follow the universal Marchenko-Pastur law.\nNonetheless, we find deviations, specifically near the tail in both cases.\nSimilarly, the distribution of maximum eigenvalue, after appropriate centering\nand scaling, should follow the Tracy-Widom distribution. However, our results\nshow that, for both the ultrametric random matrix and the Quantum Sun model, it\ncan be better described using the extreme value distribution. As the extreme\nvalue distribution is associated with uncorrelated or weakly correlated random\nvariables, the results hence indicate that the Schmidt eigenvalues exhibit much\nweaker correlations compared to the strong correlations typically observed in\nWishart matrices. Similar deviations are observed for the case of minimum\nSchmidt eigenvalues as well . Despite the spectral statistics, such as nearest\nneighbor spacing ratios, aligning with the random matrix theory predictions,\nour findings reveal that randomness is still not fully achieved. This suggests\nthat deviations in extreme-value statistics offer a stringent test to probe the\nrandomness of ergodic eigenstates and can provide deeper insights into the\nunderlying structure and correlations in ergodic systems.",

To address this, we propose a novel semantic\nbias-aware framework that enhances LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain\nalignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we\nintroduce a generalization loss that aligns the embeddings of items across\ndomains (inter-domain compactness), while preserving the unique characteristics\nof each item within its own domain (intra-domain diversity). This ensures that\nitem embeddings can be transferred effectively between domains without\ncollapsing into overly generic or uniform representations. At the sequential\nlevel, we develop a method to transfer user behavioral patterns by clustering\nsource domain user sequences and applying attention-based aggregation during\ntarget domain inference. We dynamically adapt user embeddings to unseen\ndomains, enabling effective zero-shot recommendations without requiring\ntarget-domain interactions...",

    "abstract": "Fair access to healthcare facilities is fundamental to achieving social\nequity. Traditional travel time-based accessibility measures often overlook the\ndynamic nature of travel times resulting from different departure times, which\ncompromises the accuracy of these measures in reflecting the true accessibility\nexperienced by individuals. This study examines public transport-based\naccessibility to healthcare facilities across England from the perspective of\ntravel time variability (TTV). Using comprehensive bus timetable data from the\nBus Open Data Service (BODS), we calculated hourly travel times from each Lower\nLayer Super Output Area (LSOA) to the nearest hospitals and general practices\nand developed a TTV metric for each LSOA and analysed its geographical\ninequalities across various spatial scales. Our analysis reveals notable\nspatial-temporal patterns of TTV and average travel times, including an\nurban-rural divide, clustering of high and low TTV regions, and distinct\noutliers. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between TTV and\ndeprivation, categorising LSOAs into four groups based on their unique\ncharacteristics, which provides valuable insights for designing targeted\ninterventions. Our study also highlights the limitations of using theoretical\nTTV derived from timetable data and emphasises the potential of using real-time\noperational data to capture more realistic accessibility measures. By offering\na more dynamic perspective on accessibility, our findings complement existing\ntravel time-based metrics and pave way for future research on TTV-based\naccessibility using real-time data. This evidence-based approach can inform\nefforts to \"level up\" public transport services, addressing geographical\ninequalities and promoting equitable access to essential healthcare services.",

Furthermore,\nmanual labelling is only applied to the most difficult and uncertain areas in\nunlabelled data, where insufficient information prevents the PLAR module from\nmaking a decision.

    "abstract": "The matrix recovery (completion) problem, a central problem in data science\nand theoretical computer science, is to recover a matrix $A$ from a relatively\nsmall sample of entries.\n  While such a task is impossible in general, it has been shown that one can\nrecover $A$ exactly in polynomial time, with high probability, from a random\nsubset of entries, under three (basic and necessary) assumptions: (1) the rank\nof $A$ is very small compared to its dimensions (low rank), (2) $A$ has\ndelocalized singular vectors (incoherence), and (3) the sample size is\nsufficiently large.\n  There are many different algorithms for the task, including convex\noptimization by Candes, Tao and Recht (2009), alternating projection by Hardt\nand Wooters (2014) and low rank approximation with gradient descent by\nKeshavan, Montanari and Oh (2009, 2010).\n  In applications, it is more realistic to assume that data is noisy. In this\ncase, these approaches provide an approximate recovery with small root mean\nsquare error. However, it is hard to transform such an approximate recovery to\nan exact one.\n  Recently, results by Abbe et al. (2017) and Bhardwaj et al. (2023) concerning\napproximation in the infinity norm showed that we can achieve exact recovery\neven in the noisy case, given that the ground matrix has bounded precision.\nBeyond the three basic assumptions above, they required either the condition\nnumber of $A$ is small (Abbe et al.) or the gap between consecutive singular\nvalues is large (Bhardwaj et al.).\n  In this paper, we remove these extra spectral assumptions. As a result, we\nobtain a simple algorithm for exact recovery in the noisy case, under only the\nthree basic assumptions. This is the first such algorithm.

In this variant, all agents initially find their shortest paths\ndisregarding the presence of others. This is done using A*. Then an\nintersection graph (IG) is constructed; each agent is a node and two nodes have\nan edge between them if the paths of corresponding agents collide. Thereafter,\nan independent set is extracted with the aid of an approximation algorithm for\nthe maximum independent set problem. The paths for the agents belonging to\nindependent set are fixed. The rest of agents now again find their shortest\npaths, this time ensuring no collision with the prior agents. Space-time A*,\nwhich is a crucial component of HCA*, is used here. These iterations continue\nuntil no agents are left. Since the tasks of finding shortest paths for the\nagents in any iteration are independent of each other, the proposed algorithm\ncan be parallelized to a large extent. In addition to this, the task of\ndetermining the IG can also be done in parallel by dividing the map into\nsections and with each agent focusing on a particular section. The parallelism\ndoes come at a cost of communication between the agents and the server. This is\naccounted for in the simulations.

The second and third tasks\naddress compositionality-based reasoning: one is composition of functions (Peng\net al., 2024) and the other is composition of binary relations. We formally\nprove the inability of one-layer softmax Transformers to solve any of these\ntasks. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we introduce Strassen\nattention and prove that with this mechanism a one-layer Transformer can in\nprinciple solve all these tasks. We also show that it enjoys sub-cubic\nrunning-time complexity, making it more scalable than similar previously\nproposed mechanisms, such as higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023). To\ncomplement our theoretical findings, we experimentally studied Strassen\nattention and compared it against standard (Vaswani et al, 2017), higher-order\nattention (Sanford et al., 2023) and triangular attention (Bergen et al. 2021).\nOur results help to disentangle all these attention mechanisms, highlighting\ntheir strengths and limitations.

    "abstract": "Many real-world problems, such as those with fairness constraints, involve\ncomplex expectation constraints and large datasets, necessitating the design of\nefficient stochastic methods to solve them. Most existing research focuses on\ncases with no {constraint} or easy-to-project constraints or deterministic\nconstraints. In this paper, we consider nonconvex nonsmooth stochastic\noptimization problems with expectation constraints, for which we build a novel\nexact penalty model. We first show the relationship between the penalty model\nand the original problem. Then on solving the penalty problem, we present a\nsingle-loop SPIDER-type stochastic subgradient method, which utilizes the\nsubgradients of both the objective and constraint functions, as well as the\nconstraint function value at each iteration. Under certain regularity\nconditions (weaker than Slater-type constraint qualification or strong\nfeasibility assumed in existing works), we establish an iteration complexity\nresult of $O(\\epsilon^{-4})$ to reach a near-$\\epsilon$ stationary point of the\npenalized problem in expectation, matching the lower bound for such tasks.\nBuilding on the exact penalization, an $(\\epsilon,\\epsilon)$-KKT point of the\noriginal problem is obtained. For a few scenarios, our complexity of either the\n{objective} sample subgradient or the constraint sample function values can be\nlower than the state-of-the-art results by a factor of $\\epsilon^{-2}$.\nMoreover, on solving two fairness-constrained problems and a multi-class\nNeyman-Pearson classification problem, our method is significantly (up to 466\ntimes) faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms, including switching\nsubgradient method and inexact proximal point methods.",

The optimal repositioning policy under\na general $n$-location network is intractable without knowing the optimal value\nfunction.

In this paper, we present a novel variational\nformulation of the calibration-refinement decomposition that sheds new light on\npost-hoc calibration, and enables rapid estimation of the different terms.\nEquipped with this new perspective, we provide theoretical and empirical\nevidence that calibration and refinement errors are not minimized\nsimultaneously during training.

Besides of\ntheir prebiotic role, iCOMs can be used as a powerful tool to characterize the\nchemical and physical properties of hot corinos. Using ALMA/FAUST data we aim\nto explore the iCOMs emission at < 50 au scale around the Class 0 prototypical\nhot corino IRAS 4A2. We imaged IRAS 4A2 in six abundant, common iCOMs\n(CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$, CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$CH$_2$OH, CH$_2$OHCHO, and NH$_2$CHO),\nand derived their emitting size. The column density and gas temperature for\neach species were derived at 1$\\sigma$ from a multi-line analysis by applying a\nnon-LTE approach for CH$_3$OH, and LTE population or rotational diagram\nanalysis for the other iCOMs. Thanks to the unique estimates of the absorption\nfrom foreground millimeter dust toward IRAS 4A2, we derived for the first time\nunbiased gas temperatures and column densities. We resolved the IRAS 4A2 hot\ncorino finding evidence for a chemical spatial distribution in the inner 50 au,\nwith the outer emitting radius increasing from ~ 22-23 au for NH$_2$CHO and\nCH$_2$OHCHO, followed by CH$_3$CH$_2$OH (~ 27 au), CH$_3$CHO (~ 28 au),\nHCOOCH$_3$ (~ 36 au), and out to ~ 40 au for CH$_3$OH. Combining our estimate\nof the gas temperature probed by each iCOM with their beam-deconvolved emission\nsizes, we inferred the gas temperature profile of the hot corino on scales of\n20-50 au in radius, finding a power-law index $q$ of approximately -1. We\nobserved, for the first time, a chemical segregation in iCOMs of the IRAS 4A2\nhot corino, and derived the gas temperature profile of its inner envelope. The\nderived profile is steeper than when considering a simple spherical collapsing\nand optically-thin envelope, hinting at a partially optically-thick envelope or\na gravitationally unstable disk-like structure.",

We define presentations\nof topological modalities, which act as an internalisation of the notion of a\nGrothendieck topology. A specific presentation of a modality gives access to a\nsurprising amount of computational information, such as explicit methods of\ndetermining membership of the subuniverse via internal sheaf conditions.\nFurthermore, assuming all terms of the presentation satisfy the axiom of\nchoice, we are able to describe generic and powerful computational tools for\nmodalities. This assumption is validated for presentations given by\nrepresentables in presheaf categories. We deduce a local choice principle, and\nan internal reconstruction of Kripke-Joyal style reasoning. We use the local\nchoice principle to show how to relate cohomology between universes, showing\nthat a certain class of abelian groups has cohomolgoy stable between universes.\nWe apply the methods to a prominent example, a type theory axiomatising the\nclassifying topos of an algebraic theory, which specialises to give type\ntheories for synthetic algebraic geometry and synthetic higher category theory.\nWe apply the sheaf conditions to show that several presentations of interest\nare subcanonical, and apply the cohomology methods to show that quasi-coherent\nmodules have cohomology stable between the Zariski, \\'etale and fppf toposes.",

    "abstract": "Visual object counting has recently shifted towards class-agnostic counting\n(CAC), which addresses the challenge of counting objects across arbitrary\ncategories -- a crucial capability for flexible and generalizable counting\nsystems. Unlike humans, who effortlessly identify and count objects from\ndiverse categories without prior knowledge, most existing counting methods are\nrestricted to enumerating instances of known classes, requiring extensive\nlabeled datasets for training and struggling in open-vocabulary settings. In\ncontrast, CAC aims to count objects belonging to classes never seen during\ntraining, operating in a few-shot setting. In this paper, we present the first\ncomprehensive review of CAC methodologies. We propose a taxonomy to categorize\nCAC approaches into three paradigms based on how target object classes can be\nspecified: reference-based, reference-less, and open-world text-guided.\nReference-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance by relying on\nexemplar-guided mechanisms. Reference-less methods eliminate exemplar\ndependency by leveraging inherent image patterns. Finally, open-world\ntext-guided methods use vision-language models, enabling object class\ndescriptions via textual prompts, offering a flexible and promising solution.\nBased on this taxonomy, we provide an overview of the architectures of 29 CAC\napproaches and report their results on gold-standard benchmarks. We compare\ntheir performance and discuss their strengths and limitations. Specifically, we\npresent results on the FSC-147 dataset, setting a leaderboard using\ngold-standard metrics, and on the CARPK dataset to assess generalization\ncapabilities. Finally, we offer a critical discussion of persistent challenges,\nsuch as annotation dependency and generalization, alongside future directions.\nWe believe this survey will be a valuable resource, showcasing CAC advancements\nand guiding future research.",

In this work, we introduce CELEBI (Compressive-Expressive Language\nEmergence through a discrete Bottleneck and Iterated learning), a novel\nself-supervised framework for inducing compositionality in learned\nrepresentations from pre-trained models, through a reconstruction-based\ncommunication game between a sender and a receiver. Building on theories of\nlanguage emergence, we integrate three mechanisms that jointly promote\ncompressibility, expressivity, and efficiency in the emergent language. First,\ninteractive decoding incentivizes intermediate reasoning by requiring the\nreceiver to produce partial reconstructions after each symbol. Second, a\nreconstruction-based imitation phase, inspired by iterated learning, trains\nsuccessive generations of agents to imitate reconstructions rather than\nmessages, enforcing a tighter communication bottleneck. Third, pairwise\ndistance maximization regularizes message diversity by encouraging high\ndistances between messages, with formal links to entropy maximization. Our\nmethod significantly improves both the efficiency and compositionality of the\nlearned messages on the Shapes3D and MPI3D datasets, surpassing prior discrete\ncommunication frameworks in both reconstruction accuracy and topographic\nsimilarity. This work provides new theoretical and empirical evidence for the\nemergence of structured, generalizable communication protocols from\nsimplicity-based inductive biases.",

Nonetheless, its application is restricted due to\nhigher radiation exposure, the use of contrast agents, and limited\naccessibility. As a result, CESM is typically reserved for select cases,\nleaving many patients to rely solely on FFDM despite the superior diagnostic\nperformance of CESM. While biopsy remains the gold standard for definitive\ndiagnosis, it is an invasive procedure that can cause discomfort for patients.\nWe introduce a multimodal, multi-view deep learning approach for virtual\nbiopsy, integrating FFDM and CESM modalities in craniocaudal and mediolateral\noblique views to classify lesions as malignant or benign. To address the\nchallenge of missing CESM data, we leverage generative artificial intelligence\nto impute CESM images from FFDM scans. Experimental results demonstrate that\nincorporating the CESM modality is crucial to enhance the performance of\nvirtual biopsy. When real CESM data is missing, synthetic CESM images proved\neffective, outperforming the use of FFDM alone, particularly in multimodal\nconfigurations that combine FFDM and CESM modalities.

However, existing methods for generative steganography have\nsignificant limitations, particularly in scalability and their dependence on\nretraining diffusion models. We introduce PSyDUCK, a training-free,\nmodel-agnostic steganography framework specifically designed for latent\ndiffusion models. PSyDUCK leverages controlled divergence and local mixing\nwithin the latent denoising process, enabling high-capacity, secure message\nembedding without compromising visual fidelity. Our method dynamically adapts\nembedding strength to balance accuracy and detectability, significantly\nimproving upon existing pixel-space approaches. Crucially, PSyDUCK extends\ngenerative steganography to latent-space video diffusion models, surpassing\nprevious methods in both encoding capacity and robustness. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate PSyDUCK's superiority over state-of-the-art techniques,\nachieving higher transmission accuracy and lower detectability rates across\ndiverse image and video datasets. By overcoming the key challenges associated\nwith latent diffusion model architectures, PSyDUCK sets a new standard for\ngenerative steganography, paving the way for scalable, real-world\nsteganographic applications.",

An essential ingredient for the operation of a\nlarge-scale dynamo is the Coriolis force, which imprints organizing flows on\nthe global convective patterns and inhibits the complete cancellation of\nbipolar magnetic regions. Consequently, it is natural to expect a rotational\nthreshold for large-scale dynamo action and for the efficient angular momentum\nloss that it mediates through magnetic braking. Here we present new\nobservational constraints on magnetic braking for an evolutionary sequence of\nsix early K-type stars. To determine the wind braking torque for each of our\ntargets, we combine spectropolarimetric constraints on the large-scale magnetic\nfield, Ly-alpha or X-ray constraints on the mass-loss rate, as well as uniform\nestimates of the stellar rotation period, mass, and radius. As identified\npreviously from similar observations of hotter stars, we find that the wind\nbraking torque decreases abruptly by more than an order of magnitude at a\ncritical value of the stellar Rossby number. Given that all of the stars in our\nsample exhibit clear activity cycles, we suggest that weakened magnetic braking\nmay coincide with the operation of a subcritical stellar dynamo.",

    "abstract": "The ever-approaching limits of the Earth's biosphere and the potentially\ncatastrophic consequences caused by climate change have begun to call into\nquestion the endless growth of the economy. There is increasing interest in the\nprospects of zero economic growth from the degrowth and post-growth literature.\nIn particular, the question arises as to whether a zero-growth trajectory in a\ncapitalist system with interest-bearing debt can be economically stable. There\nhave been several answers to this question using macroeconomic models; some\nfind a zero-growth trajectory is stable, while other models show an economic\nbreakdown. However, the capitalist system in a period of growth is not\nguaranteed to be stable. Hence, a more appropriate methodology is to compare\nthe relative stability between a growth and zero-growth scenario on the same\nmodel. Such a question has not yet been answered at any disaggregated level.\nIt's important to investigate the consequences of zero-growth on market share\ninstability and concentration, bankruptcy rates, income distribution, and\ncredit network risk. To answer such questions, we develop a macroeconomic\nagent-based model incorporating Minskyan financial dynamics. The growth and\nzero-growth scenarios are accomplished by changing an average productivity\ngrowth parameter for the firms in the model. The model results showed that real\nGDP growth rates were more stable in the zero-growth scenario, there were fewer\neconomic crises, lower unemployment rates, a higher wage share of output for\nworkers, and capital firm and bank market shares were relatively more stable.\nSome of the consequences of zero-growth were a higher rate of inflation than in\nthe growth scenario, increased market concentration for both firms and banks,\nand a higher level of financial risk in the credit network.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new method called Gradual Domain Osmosis, which\naims to solve the problem of smooth knowledge migration from source domain to\ntarget domain in Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA). Traditional Gradual Domain\nAdaptation methods mitigate domain bias by introducing intermediate domains and\nself-training strategies, but often face the challenges of inefficient\nknowledge migration or missing data in intermediate domains. In this paper, we\ndesign an optimisation framework based on the hyperparameter $\\lambda$ by\ndynamically balancing the loss weights of the source and target domains, which\nenables the model to progressively adjust the strength of knowledge migration\n($\\lambda$ incrementing from 0 to 1) during the training process, thus\nachieving cross-domain generalisation more efficiently. Specifically, the\nmethod incorporates self-training to generate pseudo-labels and iteratively\nupdates the model by minimising a weighted loss function to ensure stability\nand robustness during progressive adaptation in the intermediate domain. The\nexperimental part validates the effectiveness of the method on rotated MNIST,\ncolour-shifted MNIST, portrait dataset and forest cover type dataset, and the\nresults show that it outperforms existing baseline methods. The paper further\nanalyses the impact of the dynamic tuning strategy of the hyperparameter\n$\\lambda$ on the performance through ablation experiments, confirming the\nadvantages of progressive domain penetration in mitigating the domain bias and\nenhancing the model generalisation capability. The study provides a theoretical\nsupport and practical framework for asymptotic domain adaptation and expands\nits application potential in dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) communications standard is anticipated\nto provide integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) as a fundamental\nservice. These ISAC systems present unique security challenges because of the\nexposure of information-bearing signals to sensing targets, enabling them to\npotentially eavesdrop on sensitive communication information with the\nassistance of sophisticated receivers. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent\nsurfaces (RISs) have shown promising results in enhancing the physical layer\nsecurity of various wireless communication systems, including ISAC. However,\nthe performance of conventional passive RIS (pRIS)-enabled systems are often\nlimited due to multiplicative fading, which can be alleviated using active RIS\n(aIRS). In this paper, we consider the problem of beampattern gain maximization\nin a secure pRIS/aRIS-enabled ISAC system, subject to\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints at communication receivers,\nand information leakage constraints at an eavesdropping target. For the\nchallenging non-convex problem of joint beamforming design at the base station\nand the pRIS/aRIS, we propose a novel successive convex approximation\n(SCA)-based method. Unlike the conventional alternating optimization (AO)-based\nmethods, in the proposed SCA-based approach, all of the optimization variables\nare updated simultaneously in each iteration. The proposed method shows\nsignificant performance superiority for pRIS-aided ISAC system compared to a\nbenchmark scheme using penalty-based AO method. Moreover, our simulation\nresults also confirm that aRIS-aided system has a notably higher beampattern\ngain at the target compared to that offered by the pRIS-aided system for the\nsame power budget. We also present a detailed complexity analysis and proof of\nconvergence for the proposed SCA-based method.",

In this study, we present the in-operando assessment of\nthermomagnetic performance of three representative Ni,Mn-based Heusler alloys\noptimized for harvesting low-grade waste heat below 373 K. These materials were\ntested under operational conditions using a specially designed laboratory-scale\nprototype of a thermomagnetic motor. The mechanical power output of the motor,\noperated with NiMnIn, NiMnSn and NiMnCuGa alloys, was correlated with the\nmagnetic properties of the materials, highlighting the critical role of the\nmagnetic transition temperature and saturation magnetization in determining the\nefficiency of thermomagnetic energy conversion. Austenitic Heusler alloys were\nconfirmed to be promising thermomagnetic materials due to their highly tunable\nCurie temperature and significant magnetization changes in the 300-360 K\ntemperature range. Among the tested materials, the Ni48Mn36In16 alloy\ndemonstrated the highest thermomagnetic performance, surpassing the benchmark\nmaterial Gd in the 320-340 K range. From an experimental perspective, the\ndeveloped prototype of thermomagnetic motor serves as a flexible test-bench for\nevaluating and comparing the thermomagnetic performance of small amounts (less\nthan 0.3 g) of new materials under variable conditions.

We show that\nour theory can be mapped to the low-energy effective field theory describing\nthe Rank-2 Toric Code (R2TC). This relation between our covariant BF-like\ntheory and the R2TC is a higher-rank generalization of the equivalence between\nthe ordinary 3D BF theory and the Kitaev's Toric Code. In the last part of the\npaper we analyze the case in which the field $B_{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ is a symmetric\ntensor. It turns out that the obtained BF-like action can be cast into the sum\nof two rank-2 Chern-Simons actions, thus generalizing the ordinary abelian\ncase.

On atomically smooth surfaces\ndevoid of defects, contact can be delayed until the droplet rebounds; however,\nabove a critical impact velocity the droplet always contacts the surface. Here\nwe show that for alcohol droplets in a humid atmosphere, the surface of the\ndroplet above the solid develops patterns as a consequence of an instability;\nconsequently, the liquid approaches the surface more closely in some places\nthan others, accelerating contact formation.

    "abstract": "In multi-label learning, leveraging contrastive learning to learn better\nrepresentations faces a key challenge: selecting positive and negative samples\nand effectively utilizing label information. Previous studies selected positive\nand negative samples based on the overlap between labels and used them for\nlabel-wise loss balancing. However, these methods suffer from a complex\nselection process and fail to account for the varying importance of different\nlabels. To address these problems, we propose a novel method that improves\nmulti-label contrastive learning through label distribution. Specifically, when\nselecting positive and negative samples, we only need to consider whether there\nis an intersection between labels. To model the relationships between labels,\nwe introduce two methods to recover label distributions from logical labels,\nbased on Radial Basis Function (RBF) and contrastive loss, respectively. We\nevaluate our method on nine widely used multi-label datasets, including image\nand vector datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in six evaluation metrics.",

In particular, the development of\ntime-varying games has considerably expanded its modeling capabilities.\nHowever, current regret bounds quickly become vacuous when the game undergoes\nsignificant variations over time, even when these variations are easy to\npredict. Intuitively, the ability of players to forecast future payoffs should\nlead to tighter guarantees, yet existing approaches fail to incorporate this\naspect. This work aims to fill this gap by introducing a novel prediction-aware\nframework for time-varying games, where agents can forecast future payoffs and\nadapt their strategies accordingly. In this framework, payoffs depend on an\nunderlying state of nature that agents predict in an online manner. To leverage\nthese predictions, we propose the POWMU algorithm, a contextual extension of\nthe optimistic Multiplicative Weight Update algorithm, for which we establish\ntheoretical guarantees on social welfare and convergence to equilibrium. Our\nresults demonstrate that, under bounded prediction errors, the proposed\nframework achieves performance comparable to the static setting.

These adversarial attacks\nmanifest in two primary forms: deductive illusion, where specific stimuli are\ncrafted based on the victim model's general decision logic, and inductive\nillusion, where the victim model's general decision logic is shaped by specific\nstimuli. The former exploits the model's decision boundaries to create a\nstimulus that, when applied, interferes with its decision-making process. The\nlatter reinforces a conditioned reflex in the model, embedding a backdoor\nduring its learning phase that, when triggered by a stimulus, causes aberrant\nbehaviours. The multifaceted nature of adversarial illusions calls for a\nunified defence framework, addressing vulnerabilities across various forms of\nattack. In this study, we propose a disillusion paradigm based on the concept\nof an imitation game. At the heart of the imitation game lies a multimodal\ngenerative agent, steered by chain-of-thought reasoning, which observes,\ninternalises and reconstructs the semantic essence of a sample, liberated from\nthe classic pursuit of reversing the sample to its original state.

    "abstract": "Multimodal image registration plays a key role in creating digital patient\nmodels by combining data from different imaging techniques into a single\ncoordinate system. This process often involves multiple sequential and\ninterconnected transformations, which must be well-documented to ensure\ntransparency and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the use of\ntransformation trees as a method for structured recording and management of\nthese transformations. This approach has been implemented in the dpVision\nsoftware and uses a dedicated .dpw file format to store hierarchical\nrelationships between images, transformations, and motion data. Transformation\ntrees allow precise tracking of all image processing steps, reduce the need to\nstore multiple copies of the same data, and enable the indirect registration of\nimages that do not share common reference points. This improves the\nreproducibility of the analyses and facilitates later processing and\nintegration of images from different sources. The practical application of this\nmethod is demonstrated with examples from orthodontics, including the\nintegration of 3D face scans, intraoral scans, and CBCT images, as well as the\ndocumentation of mandibular motion. Beyond orthodontics, this method can be\napplied in other fields that require systematic management of image\nregistration processes, such as maxillofacial surgery, oncology, and\nbiomechanical analysis. Maintaining long-term data consistency is essential for\nboth scientific research and clinical practice. It enables easier comparison of\nresults in longitudinal studies, improves retrospective analysis, and supports\nthe development of artificial intelligence algorithms by providing standardized\nand well-documented datasets. The proposed approach enhances data organization,\nallows for efficient analysis, and facilitates the reuse of information in\nfuture studies and diagnostic procedures.",

Our\nwork proposes such a method, inspired by the observation that the duality gap\n(a standard metric for evaluating convergence in min-max optimization problems)\nis a convex function for bilinear zero-sum games. To this end, we analyze a\ndescent-based approach, variants of which have also been used as a subroutine\nin a series of algorithms for approximating Nash equilibria in general\nnon-zero-sum games.

Our main theoretical result is that the derived algorithms\nachieve a geometric decrease in the duality gap and improved complexity bounds\nuntil we reach an approximate equilibrium. Finally, we complement this with an\nexperimental evaluation, which provides promising findings.

    "abstract": "Event-guided imaging has received significant attention due to its potential\nto revolutionize instant imaging systems. However, the prior methods primarily\nfocus on enhancing RGB images in a post-processing manner, neglecting the\nchallenges of image signal processor (ISP) dealing with event sensor and the\nbenefits events provide for reforming the ISP process. To achieve this, we\nconduct the first research on event-guided ISP. First, we present a new\nevent-RAW paired dataset, collected with a novel but still confidential sensor\nthat records pixel-level aligned events and RAW images. This dataset includes\n3373 RAW images with 2248 x 3264 resolution and their corresponding events,\nspanning 24 scenes with 3 exposure modes and 3 lenses. Second, we propose a\nconventional ISP pipeline to generate good RGB frames as reference. This\nconventional ISP pipleline performs basic ISP operations, e.g.demosaicing,\nwhite balancing, denoising and color space transforming, with a ColorChecker as\nreference. Third, we classify the existing learnable ISP methods into 3\nclasses, and select multiple methods to train and evaluate on our new dataset.\nLastly, since there is no prior work for reference, we propose a simple\nevent-guided ISP method and test it on our dataset. We further put forward key\ntechnical challenges and future directions in RGB-Event ISP. In summary, to the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the very first research focusing on event-guided\nISP, and we hope it will inspire the community.

We characterize three distinct learning regimes based on the\nminimum achievable limiting width of any CI as the sample size \\(N_{\\delta} \\to\n\\infty\\) and \\(\\delta \\to 0\\). In the first regime, where \\(N_{\\delta}\\) grows\nslower than \\(\\log(1/\\delta)\\), the limiting width of any CI equals the width\nof the distribution's support, precluding meaningful inference. In the second\nregime, where \\(N_{\\delta}\\) scales as \\(\\log(1/\\delta)\\), we precisely\ncharacterize the minimum limiting width, which depends on the scaling constant.\nIn the third regime, where \\(N_{\\delta}\\) grows faster than \\(\\log(1/\\delta)\\),\ncomplete learning is achievable, and the limiting width of the CI collapses to\nzero, converging to the true mean. We demonstrate that CIs derived from\nconcentration inequalities based on Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergences achieve\nasymptotically optimal performance, attaining the minimum limiting width in\nboth sufficient and complete learning regimes for distributions in two\nfamilies: single-parameter exponential and bounded support. Additionally, these\nresults extend to one-sided CIs, with the width notion adjusted appropriately.\nFinally, we generalize our findings to settings with random per-sample costs,\nmotivated by practical applications such as stochastic simulators and cloud\nservice selection.

Unlike\ngeometric or mass transport methods, which rely on fixed endpoints and are\nunsuitable for unconstrained cycles, our approach simultaneously tunes both\ncycle time and control variations. Applied to a generally damped Brownian\nparticle in a harmonic potential-an experimentally relevant case-our method is\nvalidated in the overdamped regime and extended to arbitrary damping rates. As\ndamping decreases, maximum power vanishes and cycle time diverges; at fixed\ncycle times, efficiency follows a similar trend, with optimal protocols\nexhibiting non-monotonic complexity.

Real-time monitoring\nof the spin precession and the rf Wien filter signal allows the relative phase\nbetween the two to be stabilized at an arbitrary setpoint. The feedback system\ncompensates for deviations in the relative phase by adjusting the frequency\nand/or phase as needed. With this method, a variation in phase relative to the\ndemand phase with a standard deviation of $\\sigma_{\\Delta\\varphi}\\approx\n0.2\\mathrm{rad}$ could be achieved. The system was implemented in two runs\naiming at a first direct measurement of the deuteron electric dipole moment in\n2018 and 2021. In addition, the difference between a single-bunch beam affected\nby the spin rotator and a two-bunch system in which only one bunch is exposed\nto the spin rotator fields is discussed.

Traditional analytical methods for calculating the energy\nconversion rate from barotropic tides to internal waves rely on expanding a\nwave field into discrete eigenmodes. However, this modal expansion becomes\ninadequate when a sheared background current is present, as singular solutions\naccompanied by critical levels emerge. To uncover the distinct roles of regular\neigenmodes and singular solutions in tidal energy conversion, this study\nanalytically investigates wave generation over a localized bottom obstacle in\nthe presence of shear flow under a basic irrotational condition. Using\nhorizontal Fourier and temporal Laplace transforms, we identify regions in the\ntopographic wave number and forcing frequency space where unbounded energy\ngrowth occurs. These regions coincide with the spectrum of an operator\ngoverning free wave propagation and comprise the discrete and continuous parts,\nwhich correspond to regular eigenmodes and singular solutions, respectively.\nAsymptotic evaluation of the Fourier integral reveals that the flow field far\nfrom the obstacle consists of standing wave trains associated with the discrete\nspectrum and evolving wave packets associated with the continuous spectrum.\nAway from the obstacle, the velocity amplitudes of wave packets decay, but\ntheir vertical gradients grow in the horizontal direction--in contrast to a\nsingle-wave number solution attracted towards a particular critical level.\nFinally, we derive a formula for the net barotropic-to-baroclinic energy\nconversion rate, extending the classical one by incorporating the contributions\nfrom both the discrete and continuous spectra.",

The\nCannistraci-Hebb training (CHT) is a brain-inspired method for growing\nconnectivity in DST. CHT leverages a gradient-free, topology-driven link\nregrowth, which has shown ultra-sparse (less than 1% connectivity) advantage\nacross various tasks compared to fully connected networks. Yet, CHT suffers two\nmain drawbacks: (i) its time complexity is $O(Nd^3)$ - N node network size, d\nnode degree - restricting it to ultra-sparse regimes. (ii) it selects top link\nprediction scores, which is inappropriate for the early training epochs, when\nthe network presents unreliable connections. Here, we design the first\nbrain-inspired network model - termed bipartite receptive field (BRF) - to\ninitialize the connectivity of sparse artificial neural networks. We further\nintroduce a GPU-friendly matrix-based approximation of CH link prediction,\nreducing complexity to $O(N^3)$. We introduce the Cannistraci-Hebb training\nsoft rule (CHTs), which adopts a flexible strategy for sampling connections in\nboth link removal and regrowth, balancing the exploration and exploitation of\nnetwork topology. Additionally, we integrate CHTs with a sigmoid gradual\ndensity decay (CHTss). Empirical results show that BRF offers performance\nadvantages over previous network science models. Using 1% of connections, CHTs\noutperforms fully connected networks in MLP architectures on image\nclassification tasks, compressing some networks to less than 30% of the nodes.\nUsing 5% of the connections, CHTss outperforms fully connected networks in two\nTransformer-based machine translation tasks. Finally, at 30% connectivity, both\nCHTs and CHTss outperform other DST methods in language modeling and even\nexceed fully connected baselines in zero-shot tasks.",

Using a pairwise\nmaximum entropy model of task fMRI, we show that even small deviations in stiff\ndimensions-derived through Fisher Information Matrix analysis-govern the\ndynamic interplay of segregation and integration between the default mode\nnetwork (DMN) and a working memory network (WMN). Crucially, separating a\n0-back task (vigilant attention) from a 2-back task (working memory updating)\nuncovers partially distinct stiff dimensions predicting performance in each\ncondition, along with a global DMN-WMN segregation shared across both tasks.\nAltogether, stiff-sloppy analysis challenges the conventional focus on large\nparameter variability by highlighting these subtle yet functionally decisive\nparameter combinations.",

For the setting of real-valued regression with the squared loss,\nrecent work quantitatively characterizes the gain in performance of the strong\nmodel over the weak model in terms of the misfit between the strong and weak\nmodel. We generalize such a characterization to learning tasks whose loss\nfunctions correspond to arbitrary Bregman divergences when the strong class is\nconvex. This extends the misfit-based characterization of performance gain in\nweak-to-strong generalization to classification tasks, as the cross-entropy\nloss can be expressed in terms of a Bregman divergence. In most practical\nscenarios, however, the strong model class may not be convex. We therefore\nweaken this assumption and study weak-to-strong generalization for convex\ncombinations of $k$ strong models in the strong class, in the concrete setting\nof classification. This allows us to obtain a similar misfit-based\ncharacterization of performance gain, upto an additional error term that\nvanishes as $k$ gets large.

    "abstract": "Neural Collapse is a phenomenon where the last-layer representations of a\nwell-trained neural network converge to a highly structured geometry. In this\npaper, we focus on its first (and most basic) property, known as NC1: the\nwithin-class variability vanishes. While prior theoretical studies establish\nthe occurrence of NC1 via the data-agnostic unconstrained features model, our\nwork adopts a data-specific perspective, analyzing NC1 in a three-layer neural\nnetwork, with the first two layers operating in the mean-field regime and\nfollowed by a linear layer. In particular, we establish a fundamental\nconnection between NC1 and the loss landscape: we prove that points with small\nempirical loss and gradient norm (thus, close to being stationary)\napproximately satisfy NC1, and the closeness to NC1 is controlled by the\nresidual loss and gradient norm. We then show that (i) gradient flow on the\nmean squared error converges to NC1 solutions with small empirical loss, and\n(ii) for well-separated data distributions, both NC1 and vanishing test loss\nare achieved simultaneously. This aligns with the empirical observation that\nNC1 emerges during training while models attain near-zero test error. Overall,\nour results demonstrate that NC1 arises from gradient training due to the\nproperties of the loss landscape, and they show the co-occurrence of NC1 and\nsmall test error for certain data distributions.",

Then, we computed TCPs and looked\nfor correlations between metrics measuring the differences between the dose\nrate curves and differences in TCP. Finally, according to these results, we\nestimated the range of tolerable uncertainties in the dose rate curves. The\nstudy was performed for different radiopharmaceuticals and different\nradiosensitive parameters that can affect the dose rate response\n($\\alpha/\\beta$, sub-lethal repair rate).\n  The best correlation between differences in the dose rate curves and TCP was\nfound for a metric that computes averaged linear differences between the\ncurves. With this metric, we quantified differences in dose rate curves that\nwould lead to differences in TCP of 0.02, a parameter denoted $m_{1,\\: 0.02}$\nthat is a surrogate of the dependence of the TCP on the dose rate profile. The\nresults showed that the sensitivity of the TCP to dose rate variations\ndecreases (i.e. larger values of $m_{1,\\: 0.02}$) with increasing\n$\\alpha/\\beta$ and sub-lethal damage repair rate of the tumor cells, and\nincreasing biological half-life of the dose rate curves.\n  The radiobiological effect of a MRT treatment on a tumor depends on the\nabsorbed dose and the dose rate profile.

Stochastic object models (SOMs) that\ncan randomly draw samples from the object distribution can be employed to\ncharacterize object variability. To establish realistic SOMs for task-based IQ\nanalysis, it is desirable to employ experimental image data. However,\nexperimental image data acquired from medical imaging systems are subject to\nmeasurement noise. Previous work investigated the ability of deep generative\nmodels (DGMs) that employ an augmented generative adversarial network (GAN),\nAmbientGAN, for establishing SOMs from noisy measured image data. Recently,\ndenoising diffusion models (DDMs) have emerged as a leading DGM for image\nsynthesis and can produce superior image quality than GANs. However, original\nDDMs possess a slow image-generation process because of the Gaussian assumption\nin the denoising steps. More recently, denoising diffusion GAN (DDGAN) was\nproposed to permit fast image generation while maintain high generated image\nquality that is comparable to the original DDMs. In this work, we propose an\naugmented DDGAN architecture, Ambient DDGAN (ADDGAN), for learning SOMs from\nnoisy image data.

In this paper, we\npropose Pivoting Factorization (PIFA), a novel lossless meta low-rank\nrepresentation that unsupervisedly learns a compact form of any low-rank\nrepresentation, effectively eliminating redundant information. PIFA identifies\npivot rows (linearly independent rows) and expresses non-pivot rows as linear\ncombinations, achieving 24.2% additional memory savings and 24.6% faster\ninference over low-rank layers at rank = 50% of dimension. To mitigate the\nperformance degradation caused by low-rank pruning, we introduce a novel,\nretraining-free reconstruction method that minimizes error accumulation (M).\nMPIFA, combining M and PIFA into an end-to-end framework, significantly\noutperforms existing low-rank pruning methods, and achieves performance\ncomparable to semi-structured pruning, while surpassing it in GPU efficiency\nand compatibility.

    "abstract": "While graph neural networks (GNNs) have allowed researchers to successfully\napply neural networks to non-Euclidean domains, deep GNNs often exhibit lower\npredictive performance than their shallow counterparts. This phenomena has been\nattributed in part to oversmoothing, the tendency of node representations to\nbecome increasingly similar with network depth. In this paper we introduce an\nanalogy between oversmoothing in GNNs and consensus (i.e., perfect agreement)\nin the opinion dynamics literature. We show that the message passing algorithms\nof several GNN models are equivalent to linear opinion dynamics models which\nhave been shown to converge to consensus for all inputs regardless of the graph\nstructure. This new perspective on oversmoothing motivates the use of nonlinear\nopinion dynamics as an inductive bias in GNN models. In our Behavior-Inspired\nMessage Passing (BIMP) GNN, we leverage the nonlinear opinion dynamics model\nwhich is more general than the linear opinion dynamics model, and can be\ndesigned to converge to dissensus for general inputs. Through extensive\nexperiments we show that BIMP resists oversmoothing beyond 100 time steps and\nconsistently outperforms existing architectures even when those architectures\nare amended with oversmoothing mitigation techniques. We also show that BIMP\nhas several desirable properties including well behaved gradients and\nadaptability to homophilic and heterophilic datasets.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the\nfield of automated code generation. LLMs rely on large and diverse datasets to\nlearn syntax, semantics, and usage patterns of programming languages. For\nlow-resource languages (i.e., niche programming languages characterized by the\nscarcity of training data), the limited availability of such data hampers the\nmodels' ability to generalize effectively, resulting in poorer code generation\nperformance as compared to high-resource languages. For this reason, there is a\nquest for techniques able to close this performance gap. We present an\nempirical study investigating the effectiveness of several approaches for\nboosting LLMs' performance on low-resource languages, namely: (i) a classic\nfine-tuning, which is however capped in size by the scarcity of training data;\n(ii) three variants of in-context learning, with prompts crafted to provide the\nLLM with additional information about the low-resource language (e.g., few-shot\nexamples showcasing features of the targeted language); and (iii) a\npre-training objective teaching the model how to translate between high- and\nlow-resource languages. The context of our study are two low-resource languages\n(R and Racket) and six LLMs having different architectures and sizes. Our\nfindings reveal that a fine-tuning is usually the best choice for smaller LLMs,\npossibly due to the fact that even a small dataset is sufficient to train their\nlimited number of parameters. With the increase in size of the models,\nin-context learning becomes more and more effective, representing a safe and\ncheap bet (i.e., it always helps, but with different magnitudes). Differently,\nvery large LLMs may deteriorate their performance on low-resource languages\nwhen fine-tuning is performed, possibly due to the lack of enough data needed\nto effectively update their weights.",

This could be related to the change\nof the energy of the quantum states and also due to the redistribution of\nelectrons between the quantum states, both full and resonant, via quantum\nstatistics partially governed by the Fermi energy level. These effects were\nstudied in the case of nitrogen diffusion over clean and gallium covered\nGa-terminated GaN(0001) surface. For the fractional coverage the density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations show that at the saddle point\nconfiguration the redistribution of electrons between different quantum states\nmay affect the surface diffusion barrier significantly. The other quantum\ninfluence occurs via the change of the minimal energy configuration. Under\nfractional Ga coverage of GaN(0001) surface the nitrogen diffusion energy\nbarrier proceeds from the resonant states governed energy minimal H3 site\nacross the saddle point in the bridge configuration. At this path the barrier\nis affected the electron redistribution between surface quantum states both in\nthe initial and the saddle point. In the case of the full GaN coverage the\ndiffusion path is from on-top N adatom configuration via H3 site that\ncorresponds to maximal energy. Therefore the diffusion barrier is Ebar= 1.18 eV\nfor clean and Ebar= 0.92 eV for (1/6) ML to finally Ebar= 1.23 eV for full Ga\ncoverage. Thus the overall barrier is reduced to Ebar= 0.92 eV due to quantum\nstatistics effects.

We aim to test whether the\ncorrelation between the metallicity of the star and the presence of gas-giant\nplanets found for MS low-mass stars still holds for intermediate-mass stars. In\nparticular, we aim to understand whether or not the planet-metallicity relation\nchanges as stars evolve from the pre-MS to the red giant branch. Our results\nconfirm that pre-MS stars with transitional discs with gaps show lower\nmetallicities than pre-MS with flat discs. We show a tendency of\nintermediate-mass stars in the MS to follow the gas-giant planet-metallicity\ncorrelation, although the differences in metal content between planet and\nnon-planet hosts are rather modest and the strength of the correlation is\nsignificantly lower than for the less massive FGK MS stars. For stars in the\nred giant branch, we find a strong planet-metallicity correlation, compatible\nwith that found for FGK MS stars. We discuss how the evolution of the mass in\nthe convective zone of the star's interior might affect the measured\nmetallicity of the star. The lack of a well-established planet-metallicity\ncorrelation in pre-MS and MS intermediate-mass stars can be explained by a\nscenario in which planet formation leads to an accretion of metal-poor material\non the surface of the star. As intermediate-mass stars are mainly radiative the\nmetallicity of the star does not reflect its bulk composition but the\ncomposition of the accreted material. When the star leaves the MS and develops\na sizeable convective envelope, a strong-planet metallicity correlation is\nrecovered. Thus, our results are in line with core-accretion models of planet\nformation and the idea that the planet-metallicity correlation reflects a bulk\nproperty of the star.",

While current paradigms\nhave made strides, they are still insufficient for fully capturing the nuanced\ncontextual relations among various objects. This paper proposes a comprehensive\nvisual semantic representation module, necessitating the utilization of\npanoptic segmentation to generate coherent fine-grained semantic features.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel Graph Spiking Hybrid Network (GSHN) that\nintegrates the complementary advantages of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and\nGraph Attention Networks (GATs) to encode visual semantic information.\nIntriguingly, the model not only encodes the discrete and continuous latent\nvariables of instances but also adeptly captures both local and global\ncontextual features, thereby significantly enhancing the richness and diversity\nof semantic representations. Leveraging the spatiotemporal properties inherent\nin SNNs, we employ contrastive learning (CL) to enhance the similarity-based\nrepresentation of embeddings. This strategy alleviates the computational\noverhead of the model and enriches meaningful visual representations by\nconstructing positive and negative sample pairs.

Unfortunately, in classification tasks involving\nnon-training classes, known as open-vocabulary setting, fine-tuned VLMs often\noverfit to train classes, resulting in a misalignment between confidence scores\nand actual accuracy on unseen classes, which significantly undermines their\nreliability in real-world deployments. Existing confidence calibration methods\ntypically require training parameters or analyzing features from the training\ndataset, restricting their ability to generalize unseen classes without\ncorresponding train data. Moreover, VLM-specific calibration methods rely\nsolely on text features from train classes as calibration indicators, which\ninherently limits their ability to calibrate train classes. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an effective multimodal calibration method\nContrast-Aware Calibration (CAC). Building on the original CLIP's zero-shot\nadaptability and the conclusion from empirical analysis that poor intra-class\nand inter-class discriminative ability on unseen classes is the root cause, we\ncalculate calibration weights based on the contrastive difference between the\noriginal and fine-tuned CLIP. This method not only adapts to calibrating unseen\nclasses but also overcomes the limitations of previous VLM calibration methods\nthat could not calibrate train classes. In experiments involving 11 datasets\nwith 5 fine-tuning methods, CAC consistently achieved the best calibration\neffect on both train and unseen classes without sacrificing accuracy and\ninference speed.",

In particular, motivated\nby recent advances in multi-task learning and the design of brain-inspired\narchitectures, we consider a neural controller with (smooth) ReLU activation\nfunction. The parameters of the controller are a connectivity matrix and a bias\nvector: although both parameters can be designed, the connectivity matrix is\nconstant while the bias vector can be varied and is used to adapt the\ncontroller across different control tasks. The bias vector determines the\nequilibrium of the neural controller and, consequently, of its linearized\ndynamics. Our multi-task control strategy consists of designing the\nconnectivity matrix and a set of bias vectors in a way that the linearized\ndynamics of the neural controller for the different bias vectors provide a good\napproximation of a set of desired controllers. We show that, by properly\nchoosing the bias vector, the linearized dynamics of the neural controller can\nreplicate the dynamics of any single, linear controller. Further, we design\ngradient-based algorithms to train the parameters of the neural controller, and\nwe provide upper and lower bounds for the performance of our neural controller.\nFinally, we validate our results using different numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses sampling-based trajectory optimization for risk-aware\nnavigation under stochastic dynamics. Typically such approaches operate by\ncomputing $\\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to\nestimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We\nconsider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed\nrollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two\nkey contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical\ninformation from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size\n$N<<\\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$\nrollouts instead of $\\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the\ncollision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information\ncontained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using\ndistribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum\nMean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that\nour MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than\nexisting baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk\nestimate.",

    "abstract": "The development of image time series retrieval (ITSR) methods is a growing\nresearch interest in remote sensing (RS). Given a user-defined image time\nseries (i.e., the query time series), ITSR methods search and retrieve from\nlarge archives the image time series that have similar content to the query\ntime series. Existing ITSR methods in RS are designed for unimodal retrieval\nproblems, relying on an assumption that users always have access to a query\nimage time series in the considered image modality. In operational scenarios,\nthis assumption may not hold. To overcome this issue, as a first time in RS we\nintroduce the task of cross-modal text-image time series retrieval (text-ITSR).\nIn detail, we present a self-supervised cross-modal text-ITSR method that\nenables the retrieval of image time series using text sentences as queries, and\nvice versa. We focus our attention on text-ITSR in pairs of images (i.e.,\nbitemporal images). Our text-ITSR method consists of two key components: 1)\nmodality-specific encoders to model the semantic content of bitemporal images\nand text sentences with discriminative features; and 2) modality-specific\nprojection heads to align textual and image representations in a shared\nembedding space. To effectively model the temporal information in the\nbitemporal images, we exploit two fusion strategies: i) global feature fusion\n(GFF) strategy that combines global image features through simple yet effective\noperators; and ii) transformer-based feature fusion (TFF) strategy that\nleverages transformers for fine-grained temporal integration. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on two benchmark RS archives demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in accurately retrieving semantically relevant\nbitemporal images (or text sentences) to a query text sentence (or bitemporal\nimage).

However, the problem\nof generating diverse and feasible swarm behaviors in a scalable manner remains\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we fill this gap by combining generative\nmodels with a safety-filter (SF). Specifically, we sample diverse trajectories\nfrom a learned generative model which is subsequently projected onto the\nfeasible set using the SF. We experiment with two choices for generative\nmodels, namely: Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and Vector-Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). We highlight the trade-offs these two models\nprovide in terms of computation time and trajectory diversity. We develop a\ncustom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that predicts\ncontext-specific initialization. Thecinitialization network is trained in a\nself-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the SF\nsolver. We provide two sets of empirical results. First, we demonstrate that we\ncan generate a large set of multi-modal, feasible trajectories, simulating\ndiverse swarm behaviors, within a few tens of milliseconds.

We find that the injection of cosmic ray electrons by shocks is the\nmost volume filling process, and that it also dominates the energy density of\nfossil relativistic electrons in halos. The combination of the seeding\nmechanisms studied in this work, regardless of the uncertainties related to\nphysical or numerical uncertainties, is more than enough to fuel large-scale\nradio emissions with a large amount of seed fossil electrons.

However, there is no proper metric of slice\ncoherence without relying on extra information like predefined slice labels.\nCurrent evaluation of slice coherence requires access to predefined slices\nformulated by metadata like attributes or subclasses.

These associations have the potential to reveal the molecular\nmechanisms underlying complex diseases and lead to the identification of novel\ndrug targets. Despite these advancements, the biological pathways and\nmechanisms linking genetic variants to complex diseases are still not fully\nunderstood. Most trait-associated variants reside in non-coding regions and are\npresumed to influence phenotypes through regulatory effects on gene expression.\nYet, it is often unclear which genes they regulate and in which cell types this\nregulation occurs. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) aim to bridge\nthis gap by detecting trait-associated tissue gene expression regulated by GWAS\nvariants. However, traditional TWAS approaches frequently overlook the critical\ncontributions of trans-regulatory effects and fail to integrate comprehensive\nregulatory networks. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages\ntissue-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to integrate cis- and\ntrans-genetic regulatory effects into the TWAS framework for complex diseases.\nWe validate our approach using coronary artery disease (CAD), utilizing data\nfrom the STARNET project, which provides multi-tissue gene expression and\ngenetic data from around 600 living patients with cardiovascular disease.\nPreliminary results demonstrate the potential of our GRN-driven framework to\nuncover more genes and pathways that may underlie CAD.

Additionally, the larger polarization and\nband offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN\nquantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random\nalloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward\nvoltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally\nintroduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs\nthrough the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on\nvoltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not\nreduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and\nconsequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than\nthe measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the\nturn-on voltage (\\(V < \\hbar\\omega/e = 2.0 \\, \\text{V}\\)) of red LEDs. To\naddress this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling,\nsuggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant\nrole both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that\nleakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen\nthe polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further\nreduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of\ndislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in\nthe dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device\ninjection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization\nstrategies.",

In this study,\nwe introduce a novel approach incorporating two-phase training to discover\ncontextual embeddings of input sequences. Specifically, this method\nencapsulates the knowledge for each input word within the dataset's vocabulary,\nsubsequently constructing embeddings for a sequence of input words utilizing\nthe extracted knowledge. This technique not only facilitates the design of a\nscalable model but also preserves interpretability. Our experimental findings\nrevealed that the proposed method yields competitive performance compared to\nthe previous approaches, demonstrating promising results in contrast to\nhuman-generated benchmarks. Furthermore, we applied the proposed approach to\nsentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset, where the TM embedding and the TM\nclassifier, along with other interpretable classifiers, offered a transparent\nend-to-end solution with competitive performance.",

In this study, we present evidence of\nthe effect of various epidemic-related variables on the dynamics of infodemics,\nusing a robust modelling framework applied to data from 30 countries across\ndiverse income groups. We use WHO COVID-19 surveillance data on new cases and\ndeaths, vaccination data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker,\ninfodemic data (volume of public conversations and social media content) from\nthe WHO EARS platform, and Google Trends data to represent information demand.\nOur findings show that new deaths are the strongest predictor of the infodemic,\nmeasured as new document production including social media content and public\nconversations, and that the epidemic burden in neighbouring countries appears\nto have a greater impact on document production than the domestic one. Building\non these results, we propose a taxonomy that highlights country-specific\ndiscrepancies between the evolution of the infodemic and the epidemic. Further,\nan analysis of the temporal evolution of the relationship between the two\nphenomena quantifies how much the discussions around vaccine rollouts may have\nshaped the development of the infodemic.

It can thus be described independently of the\ngrid, e.g., by image data obtained from computed tomography scans. The drawback\nof such a discretization lies in the potentially small overlap between certain\nelements in the grid and the geometry.

In this letter we explore the continuum emission and a\nspectrum of the bright and long-period Cepheid, $\\ell$~Car ($P=35.56\\,$day) at\nmillimeter-wavelengths in order to detect possible effects of ionized gas\nemission. We presented ALMA observations of $\\ell$ Car in two spectral setups\nin Band~6 (near 212 and 253\\,GHz, respectively) and we compared the measured\nflux density to one expected for the stellar continuum.

We\nreport statistically significant emission of about 3.5$\\,$mJy in the two\nspectral ranges, which is about 2.5 times the stellar continuum emission.

Running on a dual\n16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R server, GVE-Louvain outperforms Vite, Grappolo,\nNetworKit Louvain, and cuGraph Louvain (on an NVIDIA A100 GPU) by factors of\n50x, 22x, 20x, and 5.8x, respectively, achieving a processing rate of 560M\nedges per second on a 3.8B-edge graph. Additionally, it scales efficiently,\nimproving performance by 1.6x for every thread doubling. The paper also\npresents $\\nu$-Louvain, a GPU-based implementation. When evaluated on an NVIDIA\nA100 GPU, $\\nu$-Louvain performs only on par with GVE-Louvain, largely due to\nreduced workload and parallelism in later algorithmic passes. These results\nsuggest that CPUs, with their flexibility in handling irregular workloads, may\nbe better suited for community detection tasks.",

Our model allows to compute the quality of a biopsy\nsample taken from potential POE, taking into account the margin of error that\narises from discrepancies between the orientation in the planning simulation\nand the actual orientation during the operation. Additionally, the study\nexamines the impact of the characteristics of the lesion. Methods: The quality\nof the biopsy is given by a heatmap projected onto the skeleton of a\npatient-specific model of airways. The skeleton provides a 3D representation of\nairways structure, while the heatmap intensity represents the potential amount\nof tissue that it could be extracted from each POE. This amount of tissue is\ndetermined by the intersection of the lesion with a cone that represents the\nuncertainty area in the introduction of biopsy instruments. The cone, lesion,\nand skeleton are modelled as graphical objects that define a 3D scene of the\nintervention. Results: We have simulated different settings of the intervention\nscene from a single anatomy extracted from a CT scan and two lesions with\nregular and irregular shapes. The different scenarios are simulated by\nsystematic rotation of each lesion placed at different distances from airways.\nAnalysis of the heatmaps for the different settings show a strong impact of\nlesion orientation for irregular shape and the distance for both shapes.\nConclusion: The proposed heatmaps help to visually assess the optimal POE and\nidentify whether multiple optimal POEs exist in different zones of the bronchi.\nThey also allow us to model the maximum allowable error in navigation systems\nand study which variables have the greatest influence on the success of the\noperation. Additionally, they help determine at what point this influence could\npotentially jeopardize the operation.",

This\ntransformation drastically alters the energy landscape. Especially in 1-RDM\nfunctional theory this means that the convexity of the energy functional is\nlost.

By extending a\nsingle coordinate of one of these blocks, we demonstrate that the resulting\ncode remains an optimally designed locally repairable code. This suggests that\nthe maximal length of an optimal LRC from rational function fields can be\nextended up to $q+2$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. In addition, we give a\nnew construction of optimal $(r, 3)$-LRC by extending one coordinate in each\nblock within $C$. Furthermore, we propose a novel family of LRCs with\nRoth-Lempel type that are optimal under certain conditions. Finally, we explore\noptimal LRCs derived from elliptic function fields and extend a single\ncoordinate of such codes. This approach leads us to confirm that the new codes\nare also optimal, thereby allowing their lengths to reach $q + 2\\sqrt{q} - 2r -\n2$ with locality $r$. We also consider the construction of optimal $(r, 3)$-LRC\nin elliptic function fields, with exploring one more condition.",

Given a simple (directed\nor undirected) temporal graph and a set of passengers (each specifying a\nstarting vertex, an ending vertex, and a desired arrival time), we ask whether\nit is possible to delay some of the edges of the temporal graph to realize all\nthe passengers' demands. We call this problem DelayBetter (DB), and study it\nalong with two variants: in $\\delta$-DelayBetter, each delay must be of at most\n$\\delta$; in ($\\delta$-)Path DB, passengers also fully specify the vertices\nthey should visit on their journey. On the positive side, we give a\npolynomial-time algorithm for Path DB and $\\delta$-Path DB, and obtain as a\ncorollary a polynomial-time algorithm for DB and $\\delta$-DB on trees. We also\nprovide an fpt algorithm for both problems parameterized by the size of the\ngraph's Feedback Edge Set together with the number of passengers. On the\nnegative side, we show NP-completeness of ($1$-)DB on bounded-degree temporal\ngraphs even when the lifetime is $2$, and of ($10$-)DB on bounded-degree planar\ntemporal graphs of lifetime $19$. Our results complement previous work studying\nreachability problems in temporal graphs with delaying operations.

We compare the power spectral density of the\nLagrangian velocity of turbulent flows with different forcing methods and\nReynolds numbers. This systematic comparison demonstrates that universal\nbehavior is observed in a narrow high-frequency regime, whereas\nnon-universality originating from the forcing method broadly appears in a\nlow-frequency regime. To reveal the formation mechanism of the spectra in terms\nof the hierarchy of coherent structures in turbulence, we propose a\nscale-decomposition method for the Lagrangian velocity, which enables us to\nevaluate the contribution of vortices at different scales. This\nscale-decomposition analysis directly demonstrates that the largest-scale flows\ndriven by the external force can contaminate the Kolmogorov scaling of the\nLagrangian velocity spectra formed by small-scale vortices in the inertial\nrange, thus leading to the narrow Lagrangian inertial range. Furthermore, we\nprovide evidence that this remarkable effect by the largest-scale flows is\nspecific to the Lagrange velocity by demonstrating that the power spectral\ndensity of the Eulerian velocity is less sensitive to the forcing method.",

    "abstract": "Recently, significant advancements have been made in the reconstruction and\ngeneration of 3D assets, including static cases and those with physical\ninteractions. To recover the physical properties of 3D assets, existing methods\ntypically assume that all materials belong to a specific predefined category\n(e.g., elasticity). However, such assumptions ignore the complex composition of\nmultiple heterogeneous objects in real scenarios and tend to render less\nphysically plausible animation given a wider range of objects. We propose\nOmniPhysGS for synthesizing a physics-based 3D dynamic scene composed of more\ngeneral objects. A key design of OmniPhysGS is treating each 3D asset as a\ncollection of constitutive 3D Gaussians. For each Gaussian, its physical\nmaterial is represented by an ensemble of 12 physical domain-expert sub-models\n(rubber, metal, honey, water, etc.), which greatly enhances the flexibility of\nthe proposed model. In the implementation, we define a scene by user-specified\nprompts and supervise the estimation of material weighting factors via a\npretrained video diffusion model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nOmniPhysGS achieves more general and realistic physical dynamics across a\nbroader spectrum of materials, including elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, and\nfluid substances, as well as interactions between different materials.

Notably, the octupole moment relaxes\norders of magnitude faster than the typical dipolar order parameters, reaching\npicosecond timescales. By combining Langer's theory with an effective\nlow-energy description of octupole dynamics in chiral AFMs, we derive\nanalytical expressions for the relaxation times. We find that relaxation in\nchiral AFMs parallels dipole relaxation in XY magnets, with exchange fields\nserving the role of the dipole fields. Further, by drawing on the analogy\nbetween order parameter dynamics in XY magnets under spin injection and\ncurrent-biased Josephson junctions, we propose a new scheme for electrically\ntuning the octupole relaxation times.

Starting with Bloom filters in the 1970s,\nmany filter data structures have been developed, each with its own advantages\nand disadvantages, e.g., Blocked Bloom filters, Cuckoo filters, XOR filters,\nRibbon filters, and more.\n  We introduce Blocked Bloom filters with choices that work similarly to\nBlocked Bloom filters, except that for each key there are two (or more)\nalternative choices of blocks where the key's information may be stored. The\nresult is a filter that partially inherits the advantages of a Blocked Bloom\nfilter, such as the ability to insert keys rapidly online or the ability to\nslightly overload the filter with only a small penalty to the false positive\nrate. At the same time, it avoids the major disadvantage of a Blocked Bloom\nfilter, namely the larger space consumption. Our new data structure uses less\nspace at the same false positive rate, or has a lower false positive rate at\nthe same space consumption as a Blocked Bloom filter. We discuss the\nmethodology, engineered implementation, a detailed performance evaluation and\nuse cases in bioinformatics of Blocked Bloom filters with choices, showing that\nthey can be of practical value.\n  The implementation of the evaluated filters and the workflows used are\nprovided via Gitlab at https://gitlab.com/rahmannlab/blowchoc-filters.",

While all previous works focus on\nwell-specified linear regression, we consider more general convex objectives,\nwhere the structural low-rank and cluster assumptions are expressed on the\noptima of each function. We show that under mild assumptions such as\n\\textit{Hessian concentration} and \\textit{noise concentration at the optimum},\nrank and clustered regularized estimators recover such structure, provided the\nnumber of samples per task and the number of tasks are large enough. We then\nstudy the problem of recovering the subspace in which all the solutions lie, in\nthe setting where there is only a single sample per task: we show that in that\ncase, the rank-constrained estimator can recover the subspace, but that the\nnumber of tasks needs to scale exponentially large with the dimension of the\nsubspace. Finally, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm via nuclear norm\nconstraints for learning a shared linear representation in the context of\nconvex learning objectives.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is\nessential for understanding biological systems and developing targeted\ntherapeutic strategies. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown\npromise in modeling perturbation responses, their limited explainability poses\na significant challenge, as the learned features often lack clear biological\nmeaning. Nevertheless, model explainability is one of the most important\naspects in the realm of biological AI. One of the most effective ways to\nachieve explainability is incorporating the concept of gene regulatory networks\n(GRNs) in designing deep learning models such as VAEs. GRNs elicit the\nunderlying causal relationships between genes and are capable of explaining the\ntranscriptional responses caused by genetic perturbation treatments. Results:\nWe propose GPO-VAE, an explainable VAE enhanced by GRN-aligned Parameter\nOptimization that explicitly models gene regulatory networks in the latent\nspace. Our key approach is to optimize the learnable parameters related to\nlatent perturbation effects towards GRN-aligned explainability. Experimental\nresults on perturbation prediction show our model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in predicting transcriptional responses across multiple benchmark\ndatasets. Furthermore, additional results on evaluating the GRN inference task\nreveal our model's ability to generate meaningful GRNs compared to other\nmethods. According to qualitative analysis, GPO-VAE posseses the ability to\nconstruct biologically explainable GRNs that align with experimentally\nvalidated regulatory pathways.

This block causal framework more effectively captures the\nspatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical\nphenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 3.5x\naccuracy improvement over next token prediction.

In this study, the effects of a finite satellite body on high-potential\narea generation are investigated by using a plasma flow simulation based on the\nfully kinetic model. The simulation results show that the predicted\nhigh-potential region shrinks due to the finite satellite body because the\npositive charges of stagnated ions in front of the satellite are absorbed into\nthe satellite surface. In addition, simply applying a bias voltage at the front\nsurface is ineffective in expanding the high-potential region.

    "abstract": "The theory of isotropic capillary turbulence was developed in the late 1960s\nby Zakharov and Filonenko. To date, the analytical solution of the kinetic\nequation describing the stationary transfer of energy to small scales due to\nthree-wave resonant interactions, called the Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum, has\nbeen confirmed with high accuracy. However, in the case of strong anisotropy in\nwave propagation, where all waves are collinear, the situation changes\nsignificantly. In such a degenerate geometry, the conditions of resonant\ninteraction cease to be fulfilled not only for three waves, but also for four\ninteracting waves. In this work, we perform fully nonlinear simulations of\nplane-symmetric capillary turbulence. We demonstrate that the system of\ninteracting waves evolves into a quasi-stationary state with a direct energy\ncascade, despite the absence of low-order resonances. The calculated spectra of\nsurface elevations are accurately described by analytical estimates derived\ndimensionally under the assumption of the dominant influence of five-wave\nresonant interactions. A detailed study of the statistical characteristics of\nthe weakly turbulent state does not reveal the influence of any coherent or\nstrongly nonlinear structures. The performed high-order correlation analysis\nindicates a variety of non-trivial five-wave resonances. We show that the\nprocess of wave decay into two pairs of counter-propagating waves is\nresponsible for the local energy transfer to small scales. Overall, the\ncalculation results are in good agreement with both the weak turbulence theory\nand recent experiments made by Ricard and Falco",

The common principle of previous works to remove a\nspecific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral\nconcept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this\nfixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of\nerasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the\nconcept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one\nconcept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric\nproperties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is\nconfined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive\nGuided Erasure (AGE) method, which \\emph{dynamically} selects optimal target\nconcepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side\neffects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while\nmaintaining effective erasure performance.

    "abstract": "Inferring reward functions from demonstrations is a key challenge in\nreinforcement learning (RL), particularly in multi-agent RL (MARL), where large\njoint state-action spaces and complex inter-agent interactions complicate the\ntask. While prior single-agent studies have explored recovering reward\nfunctions and policies from human preferences, similar work in MARL is limited.\nExisting methods often involve separate stages of supervised reward learning\nand MARL algorithms, leading to unstable training. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel end-to-end preference-based learning framework for cooperative MARL,\nleveraging the underlying connection between reward functions and soft\nQ-functions. Our approach uses a carefully-designed multi-agent value\ndecomposition strategy to improve training efficiency.

However, with the recent emergence\nof various LiDAR types, the importance of matching data across different LiDAR\ntypes has grown significantly-a challenge that has been largely overlooked for\nmany years. To address these challenges, we introduce HeLiOS, a deep network\ntailored for heterogeneous LiDAR place recognition, which utilizes small local\nwindows with spherical transformers and optimal transport-based cluster\nassignment for robust global descriptors.

Stitch layers enable the seed LLM to integrate representations from\nany number of experts during the forward pass, allowing it to generalize to new\ndomains, despite remaining frozen. Because BTS does not alter the constituent\nLLMs, BTS provides a modular and flexible approach: experts can be easily\nremoved and new experts can be added with only a small amount of training.\nCompared to alternative model merging approaches, BTS yields the best\ngeneralist performance on a variety of downstream tasks, retaining the\nspecialized capabilities of each of the experts.",

DOCI is a seniority-zero method\nfocused on electron pairs. Although DOCI considers much fewer electron\nconfigurations than the complete active space (CAS) configuration interaction\nmethod, it efficiently captures the static correlation, while the consequent\nph-AFQMC recovers the dynamical correlation across all orbitals. We also\nexplore an orbital-optimized version (OO-DOCI) to further improve accuracy. We\ntest this approach on several chemical systems, including single O-H bond\nbreaking in water and polymer additives. In these cases, OO-DOCI-AFQMC closely\nmatches CAS-based ph-AFQMC and even outperforms coupled-cluster singles,\ndoubles, and perturbative triples. However, for strongly correlated systems,\nsuch as the carbon dimer and multi-bond dissociation in hydrogen systems and\nwater, the method's accuracy drops. This suggests that seniority-zero space\nmodels may be insufficient as trial wave functions in ph-AFQMC for strongly\ncorrelated systems, suggesting the need for trial wave functions in an extended\nspace. Despite such a limitation, our study demonstrates that DOCI- and\nOO-DOCI-based ph-AFQMC can reduce the steep cost of CAS approaches, offering a\npath to accurate multi-reference calculations for larger, more complex systems.",

Building on the recently established connection between Mixture of\nExperts (MoE) and prompt-based methods, wherein each attention head can be\nconceptualized as a composition of multiple MoE models, we reinterpret VPT as\nthe introduction of new prompt experts into these MoE structures. We identify a\nkey limitation in existing VPT frameworks: the restricted functional\nexpressiveness of prompt experts, which remain static and thus limited in their\nadaptability. To address this, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompt Tuning (VAPT),\na novel method that endows prompt experts with enhanced expressiveness while\npreserving parameter efficiency. Empirical evaluations on VTAB-1K and FGVC\ndemonstrate that VAPT achieves substantial performance improvements, surpassing\nfully fine-tuned baselines by 7.34% and 1.04%, respectively. Moreover, VAPT\nconsistently outperforms VPT while requiring fewer additional parameters.\nFurthermore, our theoretical analysis indicates that VAPT achieves optimal\nsample efficiency.

However, there lacks\nclarity in implementing this framework in early phase dose optimization\nstudies. This manuscript aims at discussing the Estimand framework for dose\noptimization trials in oncology considering efficacy and toxicity through\nutility functions. Such trials should include Pharmacokinetics (PK) data,\ntoxicity data, and efficacy data. Based on these data, the analysis methods\nused to identify the optimized dose/s are also described. Focusing on\noptimizing the utility function to estimate the OBD, the population-level\nsummary measure should reflect only the properties used for the estimating this\nutility function. A detailed strategy recommendation for intercurrent events\nhas been provided using a real-life oncology case study. Key recommendations\nregarding the estimand attributes include that in a seamless Phase I/II dose\noptimization trial, the treatment attribute should start when the subject\nreceives the first dose. We argue that such a framework brings in additional\nclarity to dose optimization trial objectives and strengthens the understanding\nof the drug under consideration that would enable the correct dose to move to\nPhase II of clinical development.",

    "abstract": "Edge detection is a cornerstone of image processing, yet existing methods\noften face critical limitations. Traditional deep learning edge detection\nmethods require extensive training datasets and fine-tuning, while classical\ntechniques often fail in complex or noisy scenarios, limiting their real-world\napplicability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free,\nquantum-inspired edge detection model. Our approach integrates classical Sobel\nedge detection, the Schr\\\"odinger wave equation refinement, and a hybrid\nframework combining Canny and Laplacian operators. By eliminating the need for\ntraining, the model is lightweight and adaptable to diverse applications. The\nSchr\\\"odinger wave equation refines gradient-based edge maps through iterative\ndiffusion, significantly enhancing edge precision. The hybrid framework further\nstrengthens the model by synergistically combining local and global features,\nensuring robustness even under challenging conditions. Extensive evaluations on\ndatasets like BIPED, Multicue, and NYUD demonstrate superior performance of the\nproposed model, achieving state-of-the-art metrics, including ODS, OIS, AP, and\nF-measure. Noise robustness experiments highlight its reliability, showcasing\nits practicality for real-world scenarios. Due to its versatile and adaptable\nnature, our model is well-suited for applications such as medical imaging,\nautonomous systems, and environmental monitoring, setting a new benchmark for\nedge detection.",

Moreover, the shares do not leak much information about the secret\ncircuit $C$. Our protocol for quantum secret sharing uses the {\\em Cayley\npath}, a tool that has been extensively used to support quantum primacy claims.\nMore concretely, the shares of $C$ correspond to randomized version of $C$\nwhich are delegated to the quantum parties, and the reconstruction can be done\nby extrapolation. Our scheme has two limitations, which we prove to be inherent\nto our techniques: First, our scheme is only secure against single adversaries,\nand we show that if two parties collude, then they can break its security.\nSecond, the evaluation done by the parties requires exponential time in the\nnumber of gates.",

While in this paper, we demonstrate that the conditional\nscore approximation employed by DPS is not as effective as previously assumed,\nbut rather aligns more closely with the principle of maximizing a posterior\n(MAP). This assertion is substantiated through an examination of DPS on 512x512\nImageNet images, revealing that: 1) DPS's conditional score estimation\nsignificantly diverges from the score of a well-trained conditional diffusion\nmodel and is even inferior to the unconditional score; 2) The mean of DPS's\nconditional score estimation deviates significantly from zero, rendering it an\ninvalid score estimation; 3) DPS generates high-quality samples with\nsignificantly lower diversity. In light of the above findings, we posit that\nDPS more closely resembles MAP than a conditional score estimator, and\naccordingly propose the following enhancements to DPS: 1) we explicitly\nmaximize the posterior through multi-step gradient ascent and projection; 2) we\nutilize a light-weighted conditional score estimator trained with only 100\nimages and 8 GPU hours. Extensive experimental results indicate that these\nproposed improvements significantly enhance DPS's performance. The source code\nfor these improvements is provided in\nhttps://github.com/tongdaxu/Rethinking-Diffusion-Posterior-Sampling-From-Conditional-Score-Estimator-to-Maximizing-a-Posterior.",

Leveraging the closed form solution of\none-dimensional optimal transport, s-OTDD achieves (near-)linear computational\ncomplexity in the number of data points and feature dimensions and is\nindependent of the number of classes. With its geometrically meaningful\nprojection, s-OTDD strongly correlates with the optimal transport dataset\ndistance while being more efficient than existing dataset discrepancy measures.\nMoreover, it correlates well with the performance gap in transfer learning and\nclassification accuracy in data augmentation.",

    "abstract": "A Differential Drive Robot (DDR) located inside a circular detection region\nin the plane wants to escape from it in minimum time. Various robotics\napplications can be modeled like the previous problem, such as a DDR escaping\nas soon as possible from a forbidden/dangerous region in the plane or running\nout from the sensor footprint of an unmanned vehicle flying at a constant\naltitude. In this paper, we find the motion strategies to accomplish its goal\nunder two scenarios. In one, the detection region moves slower than the DDR and\nseeks to prevent escape; in another, its position is fixed. We formulate the\nproblem as a zero-sum pursuit-evasion game, and using differential games\ntheory, we compute the players' time-optimal motion strategies. Given the DDR's\nspeed advantage, it can always escape by translating away from the center of\nthe detection region at maximum speed.

Existing approaches model different body\nregions such as body, legs and hands separately, which fail to capture the\nspatial interactions between them and result in unnatural and disjointed\nmovements. Additionally, their autoregressive/diffusion-based pipelines show\nslow generation speed due to dozens of inference steps. To address these two\nchallenges, we propose GestureLSM, a flow-matching-based approach for Co-Speech\nGesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. Our method i) explicitly\nmodel the interaction of tokenized body regions through spatial and temporal\nattention, for generating coherent full-body gestures. ii) introduce the flow\nmatching to enable more efficient sampling by explicitly modeling the latent\nvelocity space. To overcome the suboptimal performance of flow matching\nbaseline, we propose latent shortcut learning and beta distribution time stamp\nsampling during training to enhance gesture synthesis quality and accelerate\ninference. Combining the spatial-temporal modeling and improved flow\nmatching-based framework, GestureLSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nBEAT2 while significantly reducing inference time compared to existing methods,\nhighlighting its potential for enhancing digital humans and embodied agents in\nreal-world applications.

Coronary Artery\nDisease (CAD) develops when coronary arteries, the major blood vessels\nsupplying the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients, become clogged or\ndiseased. This is often due to many risk factors, including lifestyle and\ncardiometabolic ones, but few studies were done on ethnicity as one of these\nrisk factors, especially in PCAD. In this study, we tested the rank of\nethnicity among the major risk factors of PCAD, including age, gender, body\nmass index (BMI), visceral obesity presented as waist circumference (WC),\ndiabetes mellitus (DM), high blood pressure (HBP), high low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (LDL-C), and smoking in a large national sample of patients with\nPCAD from different ethnicities. All patients who met the age criteria\nunderwent coronary angiography to confirm CAD diagnosis. The weight of\nethnicity was compared to the other eight features using feature weighting\nalgorithms in PCAD diagnosis. In addition, we conducted an experiment where we\nran predictive models (classification algorithms) to predict PCAD. We compared\nthe performance of these models under two conditions: we trained the\nclassification algorithms, including or excluding ethnicity. This study\nanalyzed various factors to determine their predictive power influencing PCAD\nprediction. Among these factors, gender and age were the most significant\npredictors, with ethnicity being the third most important. The results also\nshowed that if ethnicity is used as one of the input risk factors for\nclassification algorithms, it can improve their efficiency. Our results show\nthat ethnicity ranks as an influential factor in predicting PCAD. Therefore, it\nneeds to be addressed in the PCAD diagnostic and preventive measures.",

Deep learning (DL) techniques,\nsuch as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformers, have facilitated\npredictive tasks like disease progression and diagnosis prediction.

Additionally, VLMs often encounter\nlimitations due to insufficient and imbalanced fine-tuning data. To address\nthese issues, we propose a new generalizable framework to improve VLM\nfine-tuning by integrating it with a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. Our\nmethod utilizes the RL agent to manipulate objects within an indoor setting to\ncreate synthetic data for fine-tuning to address certain vulnerabilities of the\nVLM.

The key contribution of this work\nis developing a framework where the RL agent serves as an informative data\nsampling tool and assists the VLM in order to enhance performance and address\ntask-specific vulnerabilities.

In the first, we\nuse nonparametric binscatter and linear regression techniques to analyze over\n29,000 evaluations of 1,220 anonymized papers drawn from 110 economics journals\nexcluded from the training data of current LLMs, along with a set of\nAI-generated submissions.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based\nreinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary\npreferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This\napproach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models\nduring multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust\nthan handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an\noffline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown `competence' --\nand online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may\nexhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is\nnecessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference\nLearning ($\\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson\nSampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and\ntransition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in\nthis setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of\n$\\mathsf{PSPL}$.

This narrative review and pooled\nanalysis evaluates the safety, efficacy, and technical characteristics of STAR,\nintegrating preclinical studies, case reports, case series, and clinical\ntrials. Methods and Materials: A comprehensive review identified 86 studies\npublished between 2015 and 2025, including 12 preclinical studies, 49 case\nreports, 18 case series, and 7 clinical trials. Study-level data were extracted\nfor pooled analysis of 6- and 12-month mortality, VT burden reduction, and\ngrade 3+ acute toxicities. Subgroup analyses were performed by delivery\nmodality, age, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and cardiomyopathy\ntype. Results: Pooled mortality was 16% (95% CI: 11-20%) at 6 months and 33%\n(95% CI: 27-38%) at 12 months. VT burden reduction at 6 months averaged 75%\n(95% CI: 73-77%) but showed substantial heterogeneity (I^2 = 98.8%). Grade 3+\nacute toxicities occurred in 7% (95% CI: 4-10%), with heart failure being most\ncommon. Subgroup analyses suggested better outcomes in younger patients, those\nwith NICM, and those with higher LVEF. Conclusions: STAR is a promising salvage\ntherapy with favorable acute safety and efficacy. Outcome heterogeneity and\ninconsistent reporting highlight the need for standardized definitions,\ndosimetric protocols, and longer-term follow-up. Prospective trials and\nreal-world registries are critical for refining STAR's role in VT management.",

The carrier media\nafter hiding secret information only displays its own characteristics, which\ncan ensure the transmission of confidential information without being detected,\nthereby greatly improving the security of the information. In theory, any\ndigital media including image, video, audio, and text can serve as a host\ncarrier. Among them, hiding information in binary images poses great\nchallenges. As we know, any information hiding method involves modifying the\ndata of the host carrier. The more information hidden, the more data of the\nhost carrier are modified. In this paper, we propose information hiding in the\nblack-and-white mixed region of binary images, which can greatly reduce visual\ndistortion. In addition, we propose an efficient encoding to achieve\nhigh-capacity information hiding while ensuring image semantics. By selecting\nbinary images of different themes, we conduct experiments.

PRAC uses an Alert Back-Off (ABO) protocol to request the memory\ncontroller to issue Rowhammer mitigation requests. However, recent PRAC\nimplementations are either insecure or impractical. For example, Panopticon,\nthe inspiration for PRAC, is rendered insecure if implemented per JEDEC's PRAC\nspecification. On the other hand, the recent UPRAC proposal is impractical\nsince it needs oracular knowledge of the `top-N' activated DRAM rows that\nrequire mitigation.\n  This paper provides the first secure, scalable, and practical RowHammer\nsolution using the PRAC framework. The crux of our proposal is the design of a\npriority-based service queue (PSQ) for mitigations that prioritizes pending\nmitigations based on activation counts to avoid the security risks of prior\nsolutions. This provides principled security using the reactive ABO protocol.\nFurthermore, we co-design our PSQ, with opportunistic mitigation on Refresh\nManagement (RFM) operations and proactive mitigation during refresh (REF), to\nlimit the performance impact of ABO-based mitigations. QPRAC provides secure\nand practical RowHammer mitigation that scales to Rowhammer thresholds as low\nas 71 while incurring a 0.8% slowdown for benign workloads, which further\nreduces to 0% with proactive mitigations.",

To mitigate this, state-of-the-art host-side RowHammer\nmitigations typically rely on shared counters or tracking structures. While\nthese optimizations benefit benign applications, they are vulnerable to\nPerformance Attacks (Perf-Attacks), where adversaries exploit shared structures\nto reduce DRAM bandwidth for co-running benign applications by increasing DRAM\naccesses for RowHammer counters or triggering repetitive refreshes required for\nthe early reset of structures, significantly degrading performance.\n  In this paper, we propose secure hashing mechanisms to thwart adversarial\nattempts to capture the mapping of shared structures. We propose DAPPER, a\nnovel low-cost tracker resilient to Perf-Attacks even at ultra-low RowHammer\nthresholds.

Existing deep learning models and ``pre-training + fine-tuning''\nparadigms often face challenges of limited adaptability in resource-constrained\nenvironments and inadequate scalability across diverse data domains. To\novercome these limitations, we propose FlexiCrackNet, a novel pipeline that\nseamlessly integrates traditional deep learning paradigms with the strengths of\nlarge-scale pre-trained models. At its core, FlexiCrackNet employs an\nencoder-decoder architecture to extract task-specific features.

To harmonize\ngeneral and domain-specific features, we introduce the information-Interaction\ngated attention mechanism (IGAM), which adaptively fuses multi-level features\nto enhance segmentation performance while mitigating irrelevant noise. This\ndesign enables the efficient transfer of general knowledge to crack\nsegmentation tasks while ensuring adaptability to diverse input resolutions and\nresource-constrained environments. Experiments show that FlexiCrackNet\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, excels in zero-shot generalization,\ncomputational efficiency, and segmentation robustness under challenging\nscenarios such as blurry inputs, complex backgrounds, and visually ambiguous\nartifacts.

    "abstract": "Future quantum networks will enable the interconnection of multiple users\ndistributed across vast geographic distances. Due to these large separations\nand limited physical resources, communication will often rely on multi-path\nrouting strategies, where physical resources are distributed across channels of\nvarying lengths and delivered to end users. Efficient long-distance quantum\ncommunication therefore requires optimizing the allocation of these resources\nacross available paths. In this work, we introduce a performance-oriented\napproach to quantum network routing by extending the classical concept of\nQuality of Service (QoS) to the context of multi-path quantum resources\ndistribution. Unlike prior models that consider entanglement generation or\nquantum memory coherence in isolation, we investigate the interplay between\npath assignment strategies, coherence time constraints, and quantum error\ncorrection (QEC), and how they jointly impact end-to-end communication\nfidelity. We analyze both unencoded and encoded transmissions over aggregated\nnetwork paths, quantifying the effects of resource allocation on transmission\nsuccess. Our findings show that fidelity cannot be optimized independently of\nmemory lifetimes, and that while QEC can enhance performance under specific\nconditions, it also imposes additional constraints depending on network\ntopology and path-length asymmetries. This work provides a foundation for\ndeveloping QoS-aware quantum routing protocols that balance fidelity,\nthroughput, and memory utilization -- key considerations for near-term quantum\nrepeater networks.",

    "abstract": "The increasing size and complexity of pre-trained language models have\ndemonstrated superior performance in many applications, but they usually\nrequire large training datasets to be adequately trained. Insufficient training\nsets could unexpectedly make the model overfit and fail to cope with complex\ntasks. Large language models (LLMs) trained on extensive corpora have prominent\ntext generation capabilities, which improve the quality and quantity of data\nand play a crucial role in data augmentation. Specifically, distinctive prompt\ntemplates are given in personalised tasks to guide LLMs in generating the\nrequired content. Recent promising retrieval-based techniques further improve\nthe expressive performance of LLMs in data augmentation by introducing external\nknowledge to enable them to produce more grounded-truth data. This survey\nprovides an in-depth analysis of data augmentation in LLMs, classifying the\ntechniques into Simple Augmentation, Prompt-based Augmentation, Retrieval-based\nAugmentation and Hybrid Augmentation. We summarise the post-processing\napproaches in data augmentation, which contributes significantly to refining\nthe augmented data and enabling the model to filter out unfaithful content.\nThen, we provide the common tasks and evaluation metrics.

Communication in the social media ecosystem\nhappens not only because of human interactions, but is also fueled by\nalgorithmically controlled bot agents. Most studies have not looked at the\nsocial cyber geography of bots because they focus on bot activity within a\nsingle country. Since creating a bot uses universal programming technology,\nbots, how prevalent are these bots throughout the world? To quantify bot\nactivity worldwide, we perform a multilingual and geospatial analysis on a\nlarge dataset of social data collected from X during the Coronavirus pandemic\nin 2021. This pandemic affected most of the world, and thus is a common topic\nof discussion. Our dataset consists of ~100 mil posts generated by ~31mil\nusers. Most bot studies focus only on English-speaking countries, because most\nbot detection algorithms are built for the English language. However, only 47\\%\nof the bots write in the English language. To accommodate multiple languages in\nour bot detection algorithm, we built Multilingual BotBuster, a multi-language\nbot detection algorithm to identify the bots in this diverse dataset. We also\ncreate a Geographical Location Identifier to swiftly identify the countries a\nuser affiliates with in his description. Our results show that bots can appear\nto move from one country to another, but the language they write in remains\nrelatively constant. Bots distribute narratives on distinct topics related to\ntheir self-declared country affiliation. Finally, despite the diverse\ndistribution of bot locations around the world, the proportion of bots per\ncountry is about 20%.

For shin muscle, the correlation is statistically significant (p < 0.05)\nwhen using original images but not statistically significant (p > 0.05) when\nany defacing method is applied, suggesting that defacing might not only fail to\nprotect privacy but also eliminate valuable information.",

The reliability of widely employed approximate\ncomputational methods is questioned here against the complex experimental\nspectrum of ethylene glycol. Comparisons between quantum vibrational\nself-consistent field and virtual-state configuration interaction (VSCF/VCI),\nadiabatically switched semiclassical initial value representation (AS SCIVR),\nand thermostatted ring polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD) calculations are made\nusing a full-dimensional machine-learned potential energy surface. Calculations\nare done for five low-lying conformers and compared with the experiment, with a\nfocus on the high-frequency, OH-stretches, and CH-stretches, part of the\nspectrum. Fermi resonances are found in the analysis of VSCF/VCI eigenstates\nbelonging to the CH-stretching band. Results of comparable accuracy, quality,\nand level of detail are obtained by means of AS SCIVR. The current VSCF/VCI and\nAS-SCIVR power spectra largely close the gaps between the experiment and TRPMD\nand classical MD calculations. Analysis of these results provide guidance on\nwhat level of accuracy to expect from TRPMD and classical MD calculations of\nthe vibrational spectra for ubiquitous CH and OH-stretches bands. This work\nshows that even general vibrational features require a proper quantum treatment\nusually not achievable by the most popular theoretical approaches.",

This technique has\nnot produced competitive results yet due to constraints of non-optimized data\nthat contain large systematic errors. We use data from the neutron spectrometer\non-board NASA's Lunar Prospector, and study two large systematics in the\nmeasurement of neutron lifetime: the lunar sub-surface temperature and the\nlunar surface composition. We use the HeCd and HeSn neutron spectrometer data\nwhen the spacecraft was in a highly elliptical orbit during the orbit insertion\nperiod. We report the neutron lifetime using four different models that each\nhave different choices of surface temperature and composition. 5$^{\\circ}$\n\\cite{prettyman2006elemental} and 2$^{\\circ}$ re-binned\n\\cite{wilson2021measurement} maps result in 777.6$\\pm$11.7~s and\n739.6$\\pm$10.8~s respectively.

In the\nheavy quark region of QCD, we have another first-order phase transition region\naround the heavy quark limit at zero density. By numerical simulations of\neffective heavy quark QCD, we found that, the first-order transition at zero\ndensity turns into a crossover as the chemical potential is increased, but,\nwhen we increase the chemical potential further, the change in the plaquette\nvalue near the crossover point becomes much steeper. This may be suggesting\nreappearance of the first-order phase transition.

However, fine-tuning often incurs high memory\noverhead, especially for large transformer-based models, such as LLMs. While\nexisting methods may reduce certain parts of the memory required for\nfine-tuning, they still require caching all intermediate activations computed\nin the forward pass to update weights during the backward pass. In this work,\nwe develop TokenTune, a method to reduce memory usage, specifically the memory\nto store intermediate activations, in the fine-tuning of transformer-based\nmodels. During the backward pass, TokenTune approximates the gradient\ncomputation by backpropagating through just a subset of input tokens. Thus,\nwith TokenTune, only a subset of intermediate activations are cached during the\nforward pass. Also, TokenTune can be easily combined with existing methods like\nLoRA, further reducing the memory cost. We evaluate our approach on pre-trained\ntransformer models with up to billions of parameters, considering the\nperformance on multiple downstream tasks such as text classification and\nquestion answering in a few-shot learning setup. Overall, TokenTune achieves\nperformance on par with full fine-tuning or representative memory-efficient\nfine-tuning methods, while greatly reducing the memory footprint, especially\nwhen combined with other methods with complementary memory reduction\nmechanisms.

Using simulated data, we\npresent numerical illustrations along with step-by-step implementations in the\n\\texttt{R} environment to facilitate a deeper understanding of dWOLS-based DTR\nestimation methodologies.",

In\nparticular, we prove that some (concrete) generalizations of twisted conjugacy\nseparability of a group $G$ with respect to virtually inner automorphisms are\nequivalent to some (concrete) generalizations of the conjugacy problem in\nfinite extensions of $G$. Similarly, (generalized) conjugacy separability in\ncyclic extensions of $G$ implies (generalized) twisted conjugacy and\nBrinkmann's conjugacy separability in $G$.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in the reasoning skills of Large Language Models (LLMs)\ndemonstrate an increase in the ability of LLMs to solve simple planning tasks.\nHowever, as long as the driving force behind improved reasoning capability is\nthe size and complexity of the model, the financial and computational costs\nassociated with running them will also increase. This trend raises questions\nabout continued accessibility and whether these improvements will increase at\nthe same pace as models continue to grow in size and expense. We propose two\napproaches to enhance the reasoning ability of less resource-intensive LLMs.\n(1) Provide them with a generalised strategy for solving tasks within a given\ndomain, generated by a more resource-intensive LLM. (2) Exploit their\ncost-effectiveness by iteratively prompting these models to correct errors in\ntheir proposed solutions. Our empirical results from planning and mathematical\nreasoning tasks demonstrate that these methods improve the performance of less\nresource-intensive LLMs to levels comparable with their more resource-intensive\ncounterparts, at a fraction of the cost. Additionally, we show that the\nutilisation of generalised strategies in our experiments reduced the cost of\nthe less resource-intensive model by nearly 30 percent on average.",

    "abstract": "While systems designed for solving planning tasks vastly outperform Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) in this domain, they usually discard the rich semantic\ninformation embedded within task descriptions. In contrast, LLMs possess\nparametrised knowledge across a wide range of topics, enabling them to leverage\nthe natural language descriptions of planning tasks in their solutions.\nHowever, current research in this direction faces challenges in generating\ncorrect and executable plans. Furthermore, these approaches depend on the LLM\nto output solutions in an intermediate language, which must be translated into\nthe representation language of the planning task. We introduce a novel planning\nmethod, which leverages the parametrised knowledge of LLMs by using their\noutput as a heuristic for Hill-Climbing Search. This approach is further\nenhanced by prompting the LLM to generate a solution estimate to guide the\nsearch. Our method outperforms the task success rate of similar systems within\na common household environment by 22 percentage points, with consistently\nexecutable plans. All actions are encoded in their original representation,\ndemonstrating that strong results can be achieved without an intermediate\nlanguage, thus eliminating the need for a translation step.",

    "abstract": "We developed a generative patch based 3D image registration model that can\nregister very high resolution images obtained from a biochemical process name\ntissue clearing. Tissue clearing process removes lipids and fats from the\ntissue and make the tissue transparent. When cleared tissues are imaged with\nLight-sheet fluorescent microscopy, the resulting images give a clear window to\nthe cellular activities and dynamics inside the tissue.Thus the images obtained\nare very rich with cellular information and hence their resolution is extremely\nhigh (eg .2560x2160x676). Analyzing images with such high resolution is a\ndifficult task for any image analysis pipeline.Image registration is a common\nstep in image analysis pipeline when comparison between images are required.\nTraditional image registration methods fail to register images with such\nextant. In this paper we addressed this very high resolution image registration\nissue by proposing a patch-based generative network named InvGAN. Our proposed\nnetwork can register very high resolution tissue cleared images. The tissue\ncleared dataset used in this paper are obtained from a tissue clearing protocol\nnamed CUBIC. We compared our method both with traditional and deep-learning\nbased registration methods.Two different versions of CUBIC dataset are used,\nrepresenting two different resolutions 25% and 100% respectively. Experiments\non two different resolutions clearly show the impact of resolution on the\nregistration quality. At 25% resolution, our method achieves comparable\nregistration accuracy with very short time (7 minutes approximately). At 100%\nresolution, most of the traditional registration methods fail except Elastix\nregistration tool.Elastix takes 28 hours to register where proposed InvGAN\ntakes only 10 minutes.",

    "abstract": "We present and analyze an algorithm for estimating the size, under a Gaussian\nor uniform measure, of a localized neighborhood in neural network parameter\nspace with behavior similar to an ``anchor'' point. We refer to this as the\n\"local volume\" of the anchor. We adapt an existing basin-volume estimator,\nwhich is very fast but in many cases only provides a lower bound. We show that\nthis lower bound can be improved with an importance-sampling method using\ngradient information that is already provided by popular optimizers. The\nnegative logarithm of local volume can also be interpreted as a measure of the\nanchor network's information content. As expected for a measure of complexity,\nthis quantity increases during language model training. We find that overfit,\nbadly-generalizing neighborhoods are smaller, indicating a more complex learned\nbehavior. This smaller volume can also be interpreted in an MDL sense as\nsuboptimal compression. Our results are consistent with a picture of\ngeneralization we call the \"volume hypothesis\": that neural net training\nproduces good generalization primarily because the architecture gives simple\nfunctions more volume in parameter space, and the optimizer samples from the\nlow-loss manifold in a volume-sensitive way. We believe that fast local-volume\nestimators are a promising practical metric of network complexity and\narchitectural inductive bias for interpretability purposes.",

    "abstract": "Active matter swarms -- collectives of self-propelled particles that could\nself-assemble, ferry microscopic cargo, or endow materials with dynamic\nproperties -- remain hard to steer. In crowded systems, tracking or controlling\nindividual agents becomes challenging, so strategies should operate on\nmacroscopic fields like particle density. Yet predicting how density evolves is\ndifficult due to inter-agent interactions. For model-based feedback control\nmethods -- like Model Predictive Control (MPC) -- fast, accurate, and\ndifferentiable models are crucial. Detailed agent-based simulations are too\nslow, necessitating coarse-grained continuum models. However, constructing\naccurate closures -- approximations expressing the effect of unresolved\nmicroscopic states (e.g., agent positions) on continuum dynamics -- is\nchallenging for active matter swarms. We present a learning-for-control\nframework that learns continuum closures from agent simulations, demonstrated\nwith active Brownian particles under a controllable external field. Our\nUniversal Differential Equation (UDE) framework represents the continuum as an\nadvection-diffusion equation. A neural operator learns the advection term,\nproviding closure relations for microscopic effects like self-propulsion,\ninteractions, and external field responses. This UDE approach, embedding\nuniversal function approximators in differential equations, ensures adherence\nto physical laws (e.g., conservation) while learning complex dynamics directly\nfrom data. We embed this learned continuum model into MPC for precise agent\nsimulation control. We demonstrate this framework's capabilities by dynamically\nexchanging particle densities between two groups, and simultaneously\ncontrolling particle density and mean flux to follow a prescribed sinusoidal\nprofile. These results highlight the framework's potential to control complex\nactive matter dynamics.",
