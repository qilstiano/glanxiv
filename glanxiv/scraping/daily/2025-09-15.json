    "abstract": "This study introduces a mathematical framework to investigate the viability\nand reachability of production systems under constraints. We develop a model\nthat incorporates key decision variables, such as pricing policy, quality\ninvestment, and advertising, to analyze short-term tactical decisions and\nlong-term strategic outcomes. In the short term, we constructed a capture basin\nthat defined the initial conditions under which production viability\nconstraints were satisfied within the target zone. In the long term, we explore\nthe dynamics of product quality and market demand to achieve and sustain the\ndesired target. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) theory characterizes the\ncapture basin and viability kernel using viscosity solutions of the HJB\nequation. This approach, which avoids controllability assumptions, is well\nsuited to viability problems with specified targets. It provides managers with\ninsights into maintaining production and inventory levels within viable ranges\nwhile considering product quality and evolving market demand. We numerically\nstudied the HJB equation to design and test computational methods that validate\nthe theoretical insights. Simulations offer practical tools for decision-makers\nto address operational challenges while aligning with the long-term\nsustainability goals. This study enhances the production system performance and\nresilience by linking rigorous mathematics with actionable solutions.",

    "abstract": "Animated movies are captivating for their unique character designs and\nimaginative storytelling, yet they pose significant challenges for existing\nrecognition systems. Unlike the consistent visual patterns detected by\nconventional face recognition methods, animated characters exhibit extreme\ndiversity in their appearance, motion, and deformation. In this work, we\npropose an audio-visual pipeline to enable automatic and robust animated\ncharacter recognition, and thereby enhance character-centric understanding of\nanimated movies. Central to our approach is the automatic construction of an\naudio-visual character bank from online sources. This bank contains both visual\nexemplars and voice (audio) samples for each character, enabling subsequent\nmulti-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions.\nBuilding on accurate character recognition, we explore two downstream\napplications: Audio Description (AD) generation for visually impaired\naudiences, and character-aware subtitling for the hearing impaired. To support\nresearch in this domain, we introduce CMD-AM, a new dataset of 75 animated\nmovies with comprehensive annotations. Our character-centric pipeline\ndemonstrates significant improvements in both accessibility and narrative\ncomprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches.\nFor the code and dataset, visit\nhttps://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/animated_ad/.",

    "abstract": "The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core\nbottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on\nweakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This\ncompromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models,\nsuppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper,\nwe introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for\nMulti-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on\nimplicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit\ncorrespondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the\nattention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable\nfull-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing\ntask. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability\nof models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with\ntext guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach:\nopening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects\nlike a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes\nlike moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round\nworkflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the\nDragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual\nquality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only\nestablishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to\nediting paradigms.",

Existing datasets and\nbenchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and\nspatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric\nreconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To\naddress this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain,\nmulti-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld\nconsists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public\ndatasets spanning diverse domains.

Based on this dataset, we establish a\nchallenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning\nexisting SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains\nacross 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating\nOmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation.

We employ\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate galaxy cluster masses from radially\nsampled profiles of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) inferred from X-ray\nobservations. GNNs naturally handle inputs of variable length and resolution by\nrepresenting each ICM profile as a graph, enabling accurate and flexible\nmodeling across diverse observational conditions. We trained and tested GNN\nmodel using state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters from\nThe Three Hundred Project. The mass estimates using our method exhibit no\nsystematic bias compared to the true cluster masses in the simulations.\nAdditionally, we achieve a scatter in recovered mass versus true mass of about\n6\\%, which is a factor of six smaller than obtained from a standard hydrostatic\nequilibrium approach. Our algorithm is robust to both data quality and cluster\nmorphology and it is capable of incorporating model uncertainties alongside\nobservational uncertainties. Finally, we apply our technique to XMM-Newton\nobserved galaxy cluster samples and compare the GNN derived mass estimates with\nthose obtained with $Y_{\\rm SZ}$-M$_{500}$ scaling relations. Our results\nprovide strong evidence, at 5$\\sigma$ level, for a mass-dependent bias in SZ\nderived masses, with higher mass clusters exhibiting a greater degree of\ndeviation. Furthermore, we find the median bias to be $(1-b)=0.85_{-14}^{+34}$,\nalbeit with significant dispersion due to its mass dependence.

The behavior of the thermoelectric current\nwith the system's base temperature and chemical potential is very similar to\nthat in traditional SC heterostructures.

    "abstract": "Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token\nrepresentations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each\nlayer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially\ndiverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in\ndomains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static\nrelational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous\ninter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where\ndifferent channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by\nentirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the\nattention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with\ndynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where\neach token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise\ninteractions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per\ninteraction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique\nrelational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction\nfor that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime\nattention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in\nMTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard\nattention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently\noutperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\\%\nimprovement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention\nachieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\\% less sequence\nlength compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior\nrelational modeling capabilities.",

However, prior AI\nevaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted\nreasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.\n  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),\nwe conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create\nCPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and\nmultimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models\n(LLMs). Then, we developed \"Dr. CaBot,\" an AI discussant designed to produce\nwritten and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,\nmodeling the role of the human expert in these cases.\n  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the\nfinal diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,\noutperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached\n98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per\nunit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image\ntasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image\nchallenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,\nphysicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of\ntrials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote\nresearch, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.\n  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based\ndifferential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,\nbut image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker.

    "abstract": "When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language\nModels (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical\nas LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We\nintroduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in\nmulti-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically\npermissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their\nimmediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource\nthat is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a\nstriking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical\nmisalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral\narchetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide\nquantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically\nleads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical\nSelf-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt\nand satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an\ninternal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while\nincreasing cooperative behaviors.

Our model leverages a\nsimple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable\nembeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under\nspecific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a\nEuclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the\nrepresentation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a\nproperty we term the linear additive hypothesis.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis (NVS) of in-the-wild garments is a challenging task due\nsignificant occlusions, complex human poses, and cloth deformations. Prior\nmethods rely on synthetic 3D training data consisting of mostly unoccluded and\nstatic objects, leading to poor generalization on real-world clothing. In this\npaper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3\nimages or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates\n360{\\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion. Extensive experiments show that\nHoloGarment achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS of in-the-wild\ngarments from images and videos. Notably, our method robustly handles\nchallenging real-world artifacts -- such as wrinkling, pose variation, and\nocclusion -- while maintaining photorealism, view consistency, fine texture\ndetails, and accurate geometry.

The accelerometer is based on a Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane,\ncryogenically cooled to 4 K, with photothermal heating employed to scan the\nresonance frequency by $10^2$ detector linewidths. Leveraging\nshot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation pressure feedback\ncooling, we realize an acceleration resolution of $\\sim\n10\\;\\text{n}g_0/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ over a bandwidth of $30$ Hz near the\nfundamental test mass resonance. We find no evidence of a dark matter signal\nand infer an upper bound on the coupling to normal matter that is several\norders of magnitude above the stringent bounds set by equivalence principle\nexperiments. We outline a path toward novel dark matter constraints in future\nexperiments by exploiting arrays of mass-loaded optomechanical sensors at lower\ntemperature probed with distributed squeezed light.",

To overcome it, this paper\naims to develop tools for modeling, analysis, and synthesis for a class of\nAI-based AV; in particular, their closed-loop properties, e.g., stability,\nrobustness, and performance, are rigorously studied in the statistical sense.\nFirst, we provide a novel modeling means for the AI-driven perception processes\nby looking at their error characteristics. Specifically, three fundamental\nAI-induced perception uncertainties are recognized and modeled by Markov\nchains, Gaussian processes, and bounded disturbances, respectively. By means of\nthat, the closed-loop stochastic stability (SS) is established in the sense of\nmean square, and then, an SS control synthesis method is presented within the\nframework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Besides the SS properties, the\nrobustness and performance of AI-based AVs are discussed in terms of a\nstochastic guaranteed cost, and criteria are given to test the robustness level\nof an AV when in the presence of AI-induced uncertainties. Furthermore, the\nstochastic optimal guaranteed cost control is investigated, and an efficient\ndesign procedure is developed innovatively based on LMI techniques and convex\noptimization. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness, the developed results\nare applied to an example of car following control, along with extensive\nsimulation.",

A cost effective\nparadigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches\noften cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful\nways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a\ntext retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called\nRAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition\nLLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting\nand introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output\n(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References\n(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation\ntasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy\nincorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens\nfrom the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing\ninteractions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and\nremain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)\nmethods.

One of these processes is the\nacceleration of non-thermal ions, which will, eventually, reach relativistic\nspeeds and become cosmic rays. This process is difficult to simulate in a\ncomputer model because it requires both macro-physics (the overall shape of the\nshock) and micro-physics (the interaction between individual particles and the\nmagnetic field). The combined PIC-MHD method is one of several options to get\naround this problem. It is based on the assumption that a plasma can be\ndescribed as a combination of a thermal gas, which can be accurately described\nas a fluid using grid-based magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and a small non-thermal\ncomponent which has to be described as individual particles using\nparticle-in-cell (PIC). By combining aspects of both methods, we reduce the\ncomputational costs while maintaining the ability to trace the acceleration of\nindividual particles. We apply this method to a variety of astrophysical shock\nconfigurations to investigate if, and how, they can contribute to the cosmic\nray spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that\nnegatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health.\nAutomated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)\nand deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving\ndiagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods\nemploy either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations\nbuilt from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex\nbrain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and\nGraph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for\ndefining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and\nfunctional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are\ntrained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches.\nFurther, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional\nrelationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were\nconducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained\n78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and\n78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the\ncube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific\nanatomical priors for MDD detection.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates an information-theoretic model of secure\nsemantic-aware communication. For this purpose, we consider the lossy joint\nsource-channel coding (JSCC) of a memoryless semantic source transmitted over a\nmemoryless wiretap channel. The source consists of two correlated parts that\nrepresent semantic and observed aspects of the information. Our model assumes\nseparate fidelity and secrecy constraints on each source component and, in\naddition, encompasses two cases for the source output, in order to evaluate the\nperformance gains if the encoder has an extended access to the source.\nSpecifically, in Case 1, the encoder has direct access only to the samples from\na single (observed) source component, while in Case 2 it has additional direct\naccess to the samples of the underlaying semantic information. We derive\nsingle-letter converse and achievability bounds on the\nrate-distortion-equivocation region. The converse bound explicitly contains\nrate-distortion functions, making it easy to evaluate, especially for some\ncommon distributions. The proposed achievability coding scheme involves novel\nstochastic superposition coding with two private parts to enable analysis of\nthe equivocation for each source component, separately. Our results generalise\nsome of the previously established source and source-channel coding problems.\nThe general results are further specialised to Gaussian and Bernoulli sources\ntransmitted over Gaussian and binary wiretap channels, respectively. The\nnumerical evaluations illustrate the derived bounds for these distributions.",

Traditional cloud-based MoE encounters challenges\nsuch as prolonged response latency, high bandwidth consumption, and data\nprivacy leakage. To address these issues, researchers have proposed to deploy\nMoE over distributed edge networks. However, a key concern of distributed MoE\nframeworks is the lack of trust in data interactions among distributed experts\nwithout the surveillance of any trusted authority, and thereby prone to\npotential attacks such as data manipulation. In response to the security issues\nof traditional distributed MoE, we propose a blockchain-aided trustworthy MoE\n(B-MoE) framework that consists of three layers: the edge layer, the blockchain\nlayer, and the storage layer. In this framework, the edge layer employs the\nactivated experts downloaded from the storage layer to process the learning\ntasks, while the blockchain layer functions as a decentralized trustworthy\nnetwork to trace, verify, and record the computational results of the experts\nfrom the edge layer. The experimental results demonstrate that B-MoE is more\nrobust to data manipulation attacks than traditional distributed MoE during\nboth the training and inference processes.",

This system with ongoing mass transfer has been extensively\nobserved, using photometry, spectroscopy and interferometry. All these\nobservations were recently interpreted using a radiation-transfer kinematic\nmodel.\n  We modified the analytical Shakura-Sunyaev models for a general opacity\nprescription, and derived radial profiles of various quantities.These profiles\nwere computed for the fixed accretion rate, $\\dot M = 2\\times\n10^{-5}\\,M_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, inferred from the observed rate of change of\nthe binary period. More general models were computed numerically, using\n1-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics, accounting for viscous, radiative as\nwell as irradiation terms. The initial conditions were taken from the\nanalytical models.\n  To achieve the accretion rate, the surface density~$\\Sigma$ must be much\nhigher (of the order of $10^4\\,{\\rm kg}\\,{\\rm m}^{-2}$ for the viscosity\nparameter $\\alpha = 0.1$) than in the kinematic model. Viscous dissipation and\nradiative cooling in the optically thick regime lead to a high midplane\ntemperature~$T$ (up to $10^5\\,{\\rm K}$). The accretion disc is still gas\npressure dominated with the opacity close to Kramers one.} To reconcile\ntemperature profiles with observations, we had to distinguish three different\ntemperatures: midplane, atmospheric and irradiation. The latter two are\ncomparable to observations (30000 to 12000\\,K).

To approach this\ndifficulty, this paper aims to develop new modeling, analysis, and synthesis\ntools for AI-based AVs. Inspired by recent developments in perception error\nmodels (PEMs), the focus is shifted from directly modeling AI-based perception\nprocesses to characterizing the perception errors they produce. Two key classes\nof AI-induced perception errors are considered: misdetection and measurement\nnoise. These error patterns are modeled using continuous-time Markov chains and\nWiener processes, respectively. By means of that, a PEM-augmented driving model\nis proposed, with which we are able to establish the closed-loop stability for\na class of AI-driven AV systems via stochastic calculus. Furthermore, a\nperformance-guaranteed output feedback control synthesis method is presented,\nwhich ensures both stability and satisfactory performance. The method is\nformulated as a convex optimization problem, allowing for efficient numerical\nsolutions.

Existing\ntools for this problem are either too narrow in scope and/or outdated. Recent\nexplosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their\nability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach.\nToward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs\nto translate between parallel languages.\n  In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for\nLLM-based parallel code translation. Specifically, in this work, we target\ntranslations between serial code, CUDA, and OpenMP. Our goal is to assess how\nwell current instruction-tuned LLMs -- specifically GPT-4o-mini and\nLLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct -- can be used out of the box or enhanced through known\nstrategies. We evaluated four major usage modes: hyperparameter optimization\nfor decoding, zero- and few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and\niterative feedback through compiler-based repair. As a part of the evaluation,\nwe construct a new dataset called PARATRANS, covering both serial-to-parallel\ntranslation and cross-paradigm transformations.\n  Our findings reveal that while off-the-shelf models struggle under the\ndefault settings (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves only 46% compilation and 15%\nfunctional correctness), our UniPar methodology -- combining fine-tuning,\nhyperparameter tuning, and compiler-guided repair -- improves performance by up\nto 2X (69% compilation and 33% correctness). We believe that our findings will\nprovide useful insights for researchers to further improve LLMs for the\nparallel language translation problem.\n  UniPar source code and PARATRANS dataset are available at our GitHub\nrepository https://github.com/Scientific-Computing-Lab/UniPar_AI.",

However, such attribution is usually made under\ndebatable practices of determining scale-freeness and when only snapshots of\nthe degree distribution are observed. In the presence of the evolution history\nof the network, modelling the increments of the evolution allows us to measure\npreferential attachment directly. Therefore, we propose a generalised linear\nmodel for such purpose, where the in-degrees and their increments are the\ncovariate and response, respectively. Not only are the parameters that describe\nthe preferential attachment directly incorporated, they also ensure that the\ntail heaviness of the asymptotic degree distribution is realistic.

Despite significant progress in large\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance\non general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied\nnavigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and\nembodiment-specific architectures.

NavFoM\nemploys a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from\nvarying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse\ncamera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that\nembed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks.\nFurthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all\nobservation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a\nlimited token length budget.

The molecularization of\nthe cold neutral medium (CNM) is due to the opacity of small dust grains that\nprotect the center of the cloud from dissociating radiation when the column\ndensity is $\\Sigma_d\\geq 5\\ (Z/Z_\\odot)M_\\odot\\text{ pc}^{-2}$.

Here, we model a population of warm sub-Saturns to search for\nimprints of their formation history in their internal structure. Using the GAS\ngianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI), we calculate a grid of interior structure\nmodels on which we perform retrievals for our sample of 28 sub-Saturns to\nderive their envelope mass fractions ($f_{env}$). For each planet, we run three\ndifferent retrievals assuming low (-2.0 < log(Fe/H) < 0.5), medium ( 0.5 <\nlog(Fe/H) < 1.4), and high (1.4 < log(Fe/H) < 1.7) atmospheric metallicity. The\ndistribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample is then compared to predictions of\nplanet formation models. When compared to the outcomes of a planetesimal\naccretion model, we find that we require medium to high atmospheric\nmetallicities to reproduce the simulated planet population. Additionally, we\nfind a bimodal distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample with a gap that is\nlocated at different values of $f_{env}$ for different atmospheric\nmetallicities. For the high atmospheric metallicity case, the gap in the\n$f_{env}$ distribution is located between 0.5 and 0.7, which is consistent with\nassumptions by the core-accretion model where runaway accretion starts when\n$M_{env} \\approx M_{core}$ ($f_{env} \\sim 0.5$). We also find a bimodal\ndistribution of the hydrogen and helium mass fraction ($f_{H/He}$) with a gap\nat $f_{H/He} = 0.3$. The location of this gap is independent of the assumed\natmospheric metallicity. Lastly, we compare the distributions of our\nsub-Saturns in the Neptunian savanna to a population of sub-Saturns in the\nNeptune desert and ridge. We find that the observed $f_{env}$ distribution of\nsavanna and ridge sub-Saturns is consistent with the planets coming from the\nsame underlying population.",

This paper proposes a framework that integrates\nfairness and interpretability into algorithmic decision making by combining\ndata transformation with policy trees, a class of interpretable policy\nfunctions. The approach is based on pre-processing the data to remove\ndependencies between sensitive attributes and decision-relevant features,\nfollowed by a tree-based optimization to obtain the policy. Since data\npre-processing compromises interpretability, an additional transformation maps\nthe parameters of the resulting tree back to the original feature space. This\nprocedure enhances fairness by yielding policy allocations that are pairwise\nindependent of sensitive attributes, without sacrificing interpretability.\nUsing administrative data from Switzerland to analyze the allocation of\nunemployed individuals to active labor market programs (ALMP), the framework is\nshown to perform well in a realistic policy setting. Effects of integrating\nfairness and interpretability constraints are measured through the change in\nexpected employment outcomes.

Our\nstudy incorporates 26 data points across ultraviolet to near-infrared, sourced\nfrom published literature, unpublished data, and new observations. In addition,\narchival XMM-Newton spectra were used to represent the X-ray emission. Care was\ntaken to use out-of-eclipse flux measurements when the irradiated side of the\ncompanion faces the observer. The SED model includes contributions from a\ncentral source, a reprocessed accretion disk, and an irradiated companion star\natmosphere, resulting in a good match to the observed fluxes. The revised and\nnew parameters for the disk and the central source align with previous studies\nand match expectations for such systems. The temperature of the irradiated side\nof the companion star was estimated based on its B-V colour during the\nsecondary eclipse. This work highlights the importance of broad wavelength\ncoverage for understanding the properties of supersoft X-ray sources.",

The ANC geometry enables strong\ndipolar coupling at sub-50 nm separations while preserving independent current\nbias for each oscillator. We first characterize the auto-oscillation of a\nsingle ANC-SHNO, revealing a broad frequency tuning range and a\nfield-controlled crossover between negative and positive nonlinearities. We\nthen demonstrate that two such oscillators can mutually synchronize solely via\ndipolar stray fields, without electrical or spin-wave coupling. Depending on\nthe bias conditions, the coupled pair exhibits robust in-phase (0{\\deg}) or\nout-of-phase (180{\\deg}) locking. Notably, we find a bias-dependent amplitude\ncorrelation: when the oscillators sustain comparable amplitudes, both in-phase\nand out-of-phase synchronization are accessible, whereas amplitude imbalance\ndrives the system into an out-of-phase state accompanied by suppression of the\nweaker oscillator. By combining strong conservative coupling with independent\nfrequency and gain control, the ANC-SHNO platform provides a scalable route\ntoward phased oscillator arrays, neuromorphic computing architectures, and\nexperimental exploration of non-Hermitian spintronic dynamics.",

To\naddress this dual challenge, we propose Customized Black-box Prompt Tuning\n(CBP-Tuning), a novel framework that facilitates efficient local customization\nwhile preserving bidirectional privacy.

This approach\neliminates the need for users to access model weights or upload private data,\nrequiring only a single customized vector per task while achieving effective\nadaptation.

Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by\ntraining from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with\nthese approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The\nSegment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and\nvideo segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot\nsegmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities\nare directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images\ntypically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames\nused in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of\nparameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from\nits impressive segmentation performance. Our method supports any K-shot\nconfiguration. We evaluate FS-SAM2 on the PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and\nFSS-1000 datasets, achieving remarkable results and demonstrating excellent\ncomputational efficiency during inference.

    "abstract": "This pilot study presents a small-scale but carefully annotated benchmark of\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) performance across six systems: three non-LLM\nNLP tools (NLTK, spaCy, Stanza) and three general-purpose large language models\n(LLMs: Gemini-1.5-flash, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-3-4B). The dataset contains 119\ntokens covering five entity types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, TIME).\nWe evaluated each system's output against the manually annotated gold standard\ndataset using F1-score. The results show that LLMs generally outperform\nconventional tools in recognizing context-sensitive entities like person names,\nwith Gemini achieving the highest average F1-score. However, traditional\nsystems like Stanza demonstrate greater consistency in structured tags such as\nLOCATION and DATE. We also observed variability among LLMs, particularly in\nhandling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations. Our findings\nhighlight that while LLMs offer improved contextual understanding, traditional\ntools remain competitive in specific tasks, informing model selection.",

The recent detection of higher-energy\nisomers in other chemical families raises questions about the formation and\nabundance of less stable isomers. We used ultra-sensitive wide-band spectral\nsurveys obtained with the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes to search for\ncis-NMF towards the Galactic Centre molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. We present\nthe first detection of cis-NMF in the ISM, with 55 unblended or slightly\nblended transitions, 44 of which were new transitions identified based on\nextrapolated spectroscopic data. Due to the lack of collisional rate\ncoefficients, a quasi-non-LTE analysis, which separated the transitions into\ndifferent K$_a$ ladders, was used to determine the excitation conditions. The\nresulting trans/cis-NMF isomeric ratio of 2.9$\\pm$0.6 deviates significantly\nfrom thermodynamic expectations, suggesting that kinetic non-equilibrium\nprocesses and stereospecific chemical pathways are responsible for the\nformation of cis-NMF in this environment. The detection of cis-NMF expands the\nknown inventory of interstellar C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers and challenges the\nassumption that isomer abundances strictly correlate with thermodynamic\nstability. Laboratory and theoretical studies propose formation via CH$_3$NCO\nhydrogenation or spin-forbidden reactions involving CH$_2$ and NH$_2$CHO,\nthough these may not reflect typical ISM conditions.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\ntheir capacities to capture universal knowledge, making them promising\ngeneral-purpose optimization solvers for wireless signal processing. Motivated\nby these findings, we take the first step towards fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs\nfor the effective analysis of radar signal features in marine target detection\ntasks. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on marine target\ndetection tasks tends to suffer from pronounced overfitting, particularly in\nchallenging low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) scenarios. This overfitting\nprimarily stems from the model's tendency to memorize spurious or noisy feature\npatterns rather than learning discriminative structures that generalize well to\nunseen data. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarLLM, a novel\nfine-tuning framework that utilizes an effective preference-aware loss. Unlike\nconventional training strategies that uniformly optimize all feature tokens,\nthis loss function selectively optimizes different feature patches based on\ntheir online evaluated learning values, thus guiding the model to focus on the\nmost generalizable patterns during optimization. We theoretically demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the evaluated learning values by transforming the problem\nas selecting useful feature tokens. Extensive experiments on real-world marine\nradar datasets show that 1) the proposed loss function is much better than the\noriginal one, with particularly significant gains in challenging low SCR\nscenarios and 2) RadarLLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nacross diverse detection scenarios, with particularly notable gains under\nlimited training data conditions.",

An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize\ndimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error.\nTo speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first\nquantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized\nvectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive\nenumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical\nmethods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ,\nExtended RabitQ).

    "abstract": "Feature selection has emerged as a crucial technique in refining recommender\nsystems. Recent advancements leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has\ndrawn significant attention, particularly in two main categories: early feature\nselection and late feature selection, differentiated by whether the selection\noccurs before or after the embedding layer. The early feature selection selects\na fixed subset of features and retrains the model, while the late feature\nselection, known as adaptive feature selection, dynamically adjusts feature\nchoices for each data instance, recognizing the variability in feature\nsignificance. Although adaptive feature selection has shown remarkable\nimprovements in performance, its main drawback lies in its post-embedding layer\nfeature selection. This process often becomes cumbersome and inefficient in\nlarge-scale recommender systems with billions of ID-type features, leading to a\nhighly sparse and parameter-heavy embedding layer. To overcome this, we\nintroduce Adaptive Early Feature Selection (AEFS), a very simple method that\nnot only adaptively selects informative features for each instance, but also\nsignificantly reduces the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS\nemploys a dual-model architecture, encompassing an auxiliary model dedicated to\nfeature selection and a main model responsible for prediction. To ensure\neffective alignment between these two models, we incorporate two collaborative\ntraining loss constraints. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark\ndatasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Notably,\nAEFS matches the performance of current state-of-theart Adaptive Late Feature\nSelection methods while achieving a significant reduction of 37. 5% in the\nactivated parameters of the embedding layer.

ImplMORe incorporates local features using a 3D CNN\nencoder and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn the features in the\ncontinuous domain using occupancy functions. We apply our method for single and\nmultiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset. By\nleveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, our approach\noutperforms the discrete explicit representation based surface reconstruction\napproaches, providing fine-grained surface details of the organ at a resolution\nhigher than the given input image.

    "abstract": "Recent observations have revealed that dust is widespread and abundant in\ngalaxies up to $z\\,{\\backsimeq}\\,8$, significantly influencing their appearance\nand spectral properties. In the early Universe, dust is thought to form\nprimarily in supernova (SN) ejecta, but also undergoes destruction by the\nreverse shock. Studying dust in local supernova remnants (SNRs) of different\nsizes and ages thus provides key constraints on dust formation and evolution\nduring cosmic dawn. Using the newly released 3D $R_{\\rm V}$ map, we derived\nlocal $R_{\\rm V} \\equiv A_{\\rm V}/E(B-V)$ values for dust in 14 Galactic SNRs\nin the early Sedov phase and their surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). For\nthe first time, we detect a moderately strong positive correlation between the\ndifference in SNR and ISM $R_{\\rm V}$ ($\\Delta R_{\\rm V}$) and SNR radius\n($R_{\\rm SNR}$), with a Spearman coefficient of $r_{\\rm\ns}\\,{=}\\,0.62\\,{\\pm}\\,0.14$. This trend offers direct observational evidence\nfor a redistribution of dust grain sizes toward larger grains during SN shock\nprocessing, consistent with theoretical models. Our findings provide essential\nobservational constraints on dust size evolution in SNRs and important\nimplications for understanding the rapid enrichment and survival of dust in the\nearly Universe.",

    "abstract": "It is often of interest to test a global null hypothesis using multiple,\npossibly dependent, $p$-values by combining their strengths while controlling\nthe Type I error. Recently, several heavy-tailed combinations tests, such as\nthe harmonic mean test and the Cauchy combination test, have been proposed:\nthey map $p$-values into heavy-tailed random variables before combining them in\nsome fashion into a single test statistic. The resulting tests, which are\ncalibrated under the assumption of independence of the $p$-values, have shown\nto be rather robust to dependence. The complete understanding of the\ncalibration properties of the resulting combination tests of dependent and\npossibly tail-dependent $p$-values has remained an important open problem in\nthe area. In this work, we show that the powerful framework of multivariate\nregular variation (MRV) offers a nearly complete solution to this problem.\n  We first show that the precise asymptotic calibration properties of a large\nclass of homogeneous combination tests can be expressed in terms of the angular\nmeasure -- a characteristic of the asymptotic tail-dependence under MRV.\nConsequently, we show that under MRV, the Pareto-type linear combination tests,\nwhich are equivalent to the harmonic mean test, are universally calibrated\nregardless of the tail-dependence structure of the underlying $p$-values. In\ncontrast, the popular Cauchy combination test is shown to be universally honest\nbut often conservative; the Tippet combination test, while being honest, is\ncalibrated if and only if the underlying $p$-values are tail-independent.\n  One of our major findings is that the Pareto-type linear combination tests\nare the only universally calibrated ones among the large family of possibly\nnon-linear homogeneous heavy-tailed combination tests.",

In Part I of this series, we rigorously defined the proper\ndecision tree model through four axioms and, based on these, introduced four\nformal definitions of the ODT problem. From these definitions, we derived four\ngeneric algorithms capable of solving ODT problems for arbitrary decision trees\nsatisfying the axioms. We also analyzed the combinatorial geometric properties\nof hypersurfaces, showing that decision trees defined by polynomial\nhypersurface splitting rules satisfy the proper axioms that we proposed.\n  In this second paper (Part II) of this two-part series, building on the\nalgorithmic and geometric foundations established in Part I, we introduce the\nfirst hypersurface decision tree (HODT) algorithm. To the best of our\nknowledge, existing optimal decision tree methods are, to date, limited to\nhyperplane splitting rules--a special case of hypersurfaces--and rely on\ngeneral-purpose solvers. In contrast, our HODT algorithm addresses the general\nhypersurface decision tree model without requiring external solvers.\n  Using synthetic datasets generated from ground-truth hyperplane decision\ntrees, we vary tree size, data size, dimensionality, and label and feature\nnoise. Results showing that our algorithm recovers the ground truth more\naccurately than axis-parallel trees and exhibits greater robustness to noise.\nWe also analyzed generalization performance across 30 real-world datasets,\nshowing that HODT can achieve up to 30% higher accuracy than the\nstate-of-the-art optimal axis-parallel decision tree algorithm when tree\ncomplexity is properly controlled.",

    "abstract": "Existing talking-head animation approaches based on Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) or diffusion models often suffer from inter-frame flicker,\nidentity drift, and slow inference. These limitations inherent to their video\ngeneration pipelines restrict their suitability for applications. To address\nthis, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme\nrepresentations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head\nanimations from a single reference image, driven directly text or audio input.\nIn addition, AvatarSync adopts a two-stage generation strategy, decoupling\nsemantic modeling from visual dynamics, which is a deliberate \"Divide and\nConquer\" design. The first stage, Facial Keyframe Generation (FKG), focuses on\nphoneme-level semantic representation by leveraging the many-to-one mapping\nfrom text or audio to phonemes. A Phoneme-to-Visual Mapping is constructed to\nanchor abstract phonemes to character-level units. Combined with a customized\nText-Frame Causal Attention Mask, the keyframes are generated. The second\nstage, inter-frame interpolation, emphasizes temporal coherence and visual\nsmoothness. We introduce a timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on a\nselective state space model, enabling efficient bidirectional context\nreasoning. To support deployment, we optimize the inference pipeline to reduce\nlatency without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments show that\nAvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual\nfidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a\nscalable and controllable solution.",

Our analysis shows that\nflares are present in some observations, whereas they are absent in others.\nFlaring state exhibits two-component spectra at a lower average flux level,\nwhereas the non-flaring state displays single-component spectra at a higher\naverage flux level. The M74 X-1 spectra are best described by the combination\nof accretion disk and Comptonization components, a dual thermal disk blackbody\nmodel, and a modified multi-temperature disk blackbody model. Using the dual\nthermal disk blackbody model, we obtain cool and hot temperatures of $T_{in}$\n(cool) = $0.38^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$ keV and $T_{in}$ (hot) = $1.67^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$\nkeV, respectively, suggesting two temperature emitting regions and indicating\npossible presence of outflowing wind along with the accretion disk.

Additionally, using the hot\ndisk blackbody component from the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we\nestimate the mass of the compact object to be M = $7.1^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$\nM$_\\odot$, classifying it as a stellar-mass black hole and confirming\nsuper-Eddington accretion in the system.",

However, it remains a\nprevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and\nenvironmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of\naccommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and\ncomplex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency\nmatrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV)\nvalues to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather\nfactors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights\nand enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic\nstations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to\nadapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental\nconditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP)\nframework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target\ncoverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline\nmethods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then,\nvalidate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying\nMonte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under\nTest (VUT) to reflect real-world variability.

This design enables the\nnetwork to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various\ndegradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning\nstrategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the\nintegrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while\nretaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy\nthat leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant\nrepresentations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful\nand semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves\nrobust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen,\nextreme, and mixed degradations.

The\nreported improvements achieved by employing a single dynamically activated\nradiating position in fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) are significant. To\nfully realize the potential of FAMA in multi-user multiplexing, we propose\nleveraging the unique fast-switching capabilities of a single radio-frequency\n(RF)-chain meta-fluid antenna structure to achieve multi-activation.

Simulations demonstrate that\nmulti-activation FAMA enables robust multi-user multiplexing with a higher\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR) under various Rayleigh-fading environments\ncompared to other single RF-chain technologies. We further show that the SIR\ncan be optimized within a 15~$\\mu s$ timeframe under a multi-user\nRayleigh-fading channel, making the proposed scheme highly suitable for\nfast-changing wireless environments.

We propose a general formulation of the\nrisk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's\nreturn distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting\nand assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited\nexpressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and\nsufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it.\nBuilding on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC\nand RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and\nknown, respectively.

SCORE formulates concept erasure as an\n\\emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the\nmodel's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike\nprior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a\ntarget concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We\nprovide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper\nbounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable\nDiffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW\nremoval, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT,\nMACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \\textbf{12.5\\%} higher erasure efficacy\nwhile maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating\nadversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven\nfine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in\ndiffusion models.",

This limitation becomes\nespecially evident in settings involving the continuous control of complex\nsystems with delays and memory effects. To capture historical dependencies,\nexisting approaches often rely on recurrent neural network (RNN)-based\nencoders, which are inherently discrete and struggle with continuous modeling.\nIn addition, they may exhibit poor training behavior.

The solution to this randomized problem is characterized as\nthe fixed point of a compound operator which consists of a regularized nonlocal\noperator and a regularized stopping operator. This approach allows us to derive\na semi-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Through an equivalent\nrandomization scheme with a Poisson compound measure, we establish a\nverification theorem that implies the uniqueness of the solution. Via an\niterative approach, we prove the existence of the solution. The\nexistence--and--uniqueness result ensures the randomized problem is\nwell-defined. We then demonstrate that our randomized impulse control problem\nconverges to its classical counterpart as the randomization parameter $\\bf\n\\lambda$ vanishes. This convergence, combined with the value function's\n$C^{2,\\alpha}_{loc}$ regularity, confirms our framework provides a robust\napproximation and a foundation for developing learning algorithms. Under this\nframework, we propose an offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Its\npolicy improvement step is naturally derived from the iterative approach from\nthe existence proof, which enjoys a geometric convergence rate. We implement a\nmodel-free version of the algorithm and numerically demonstrate its\neffectiveness using a widely-studied example.

It relies on an action formalism in which, at large scales,\nthe dynamics is fully determined by the minimum of the action. Within this\nformalism, the analysis of the statistical properties of a given observable\nreduces to solving the Euler-Lagrange equations with the appropriate boundary\nconditions. One must then compute the action at its minimum to deduce the\ncumulant generating function of the observable. This typically involves\ncomputing multiple integrals of cumbersome expressions. Recently, a simple\nformula has been conjectured to shortcut this last step, and compute the\ncumulant generating function of different observables (integrated current or\nposition of a tracer) without the need to compute any integral. In this work,\nwe prove this simple formula, and extend it to more general observables. We\nthen illustrate the efficiency of this approach by applying it to compute the\nvariance of a generalised current in the semi-infinite symmetric exclusion\nprocess and the joint properties of two occupation times in any diffusive\nsystem.

However, IRL is\ninherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible\nset, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce\ndifferent policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional\ninformation, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the\n\"average\" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset\nof the feasible set.

    "abstract": "The quiescent or dynamic nature of fine scale ray-like features in the sun\ncorona, observed in visible light, is still an open question. Here, we show\nthat most of daily and hourly periodic variations in visible light brightness\nof the high corona (up to 15 Rs) are aligned to the tip of streamers and are\nconsistent with the periodicity of plasma release from simulations of\ntearing-induced magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet. The\nareas in which we detect periodicities can be used as tracers of non-quiescent\nfine coronal rays. This also allows their distinction from coronal rays more\nlikely to be real quiescent features or associated with smaller and/or faster\nunresolved brightness variations. In the low- and middle-corona (down to 1.4\nRs) similar brightness variations are observed along loop-like and cusp-like\nfeatures marking boundaries of streamers which then connect to radial features\nin the high corona. This suggests the presence of additional mechanisms in the\nlow- and middle-corona periodically releasing density structures in the solar\nwind. The periodicity distributions show a solar cycle modulation with shorter\nperiods (smaller structures) during solar maximum. Periodicities are observed\nwithin streamers during solar minimum, but are visible at all latitudes, even\nextending radially from the poles, during solar maximum.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the oscillation behavior of a sessile drop placed on\na hydrophobic substrate subjected to vertical vibrations with varying\nfrequencies and amplitudes. We examined the responses of both Newtonian and\nviscoelastic drops. For viscoelastic samples, image analysis techniques were\nemployed to correlate the drop dynamics with the rheological properties of the\nmaterial. Overall, we demonstrate that this drop-based method allows for\noscillatory shear experiments at frequencies that are difficult to access using\nconventional rheometers. The results reveal that the essential features of the\ndrop response can be explained by the ratio of two characteristic time scales:\nthe internal polymer relaxation time ($t_{p}$) and the external forcing time\nscale ($1/f$). This ratio defines the Deborah number ($De$). When the two time\nscales are comparable ($De \\approx 1$), viscous dissipation dominates, which is\nobserved in Lissajous curves and the drop's profile. At very low Deborah\nnumbers ($De \\ll 1$), the drop behaves like a Newtonian fluid (having a peak\naround natural frequency of the drop), while at high Deborah numbers ($De \\gg\n1$), it exhibits an elastic response. Furthermore, we show that increasing the\napplied deformation drives the system into the nonlinear viscoelastic regime.\nIn this regime, unlike traditional rheology measurements, we observe the\npresence of $even$ and $odd$ harmonics in the drop response. This is attributed\nto the inherent geometric asymmetry of the drop setup, which breaks the\nsymmetric assumptions typically present in standard rheological techniques.",

Using this\nparadigm, several smaller QPUs can collectively execute circuits that each\nwould not be able on its own. However, communication between QPUs is costly as\nit requires generating and maintaining entanglement, and hence it should be\nused wisely. In this paper, we evaluate the architectures, and in particular\nthe entanglement patterns, of variational quantum circuits in a distributed\nquantum computing (DQC) setting. That is, using Qiskit, we simulate the\nexecution of an eight qubit circuit using four QPUs each with two computational\nand two communication qubits where non-local CX-gates are performed using the\nremote-CX protocol. We compare the performance of various circuits on a binary\nclassification task where training is executed under ideal and testing under\nnoisy conditions.

The IGMF is expected to be generated either\nvia processes mainly connected to astrophysical processes or it could be a\nrelic of phase transitions in the early universe. Upper bounds to the average\nfield present are set via observations of Faraday rotation measure. Lower\nbounds have been derived from the non-detection of secondary gamma-rays\npossibly produced in electromagnetic cascades. We investigate the presence of\nIGMFs by studying the GeV gamma-ray emission from the nearby blazar Mkn~501\n($z=0.034$), searching for evidence of the extended halo expected to be\nobserved around the point source. We analyse 14 years of data from Fermi-LAT\nand Swift-XRT/BAT to construct a time-average synchrotron-self Compton model\nfor the TeV spectrum of Mkn~501. This injection spectrum is used to simulate\nthe resulting cascade emission with the ELMAG code for different magnetic field\nand coherence length configurations. These templates are fit to the Fermi-LAT\ndata to find a best-fitting model for the cascade emission. We find significant\n($\\ge 5 \\sigma$ trial-corrected) evidence for extended secondary emission\naround Mkn~501, which is consistent with an IGMF with\n$B_\\mathrm{rms}=1.5_{-0.6}^{+1.6}\\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{G}$ and a coherence\nlength of $\\ell_C=(10\\pm 3)~\\mathrm{kpc}$. The source needs to actively inject\nTeV gamma-rays for at least 45000 years to match the level of secondary\nemission. Our results indicate that the secondary gamma-rays are significantly\npresent in the $\\it{Fermi}$-LAT data. The effect of plasma-heating by pairs in\nthe cascade appears to be negligible for Mkn 501. This is consistent with the\nobservation that Mkn~501 is one of the objects with the lowest injection power\namong the blazars studied in the context of cascade emission.",

Through\nsimulations across various graph models and dynamic conditions, it is shown\nthat the method achieves faster execution times (lower complexity) and\ncompetitive sparsity compared to classical greedy and genetic algorithms (GA),\noffering a robust, distributed, and cost-efficient node selection solution.",

    "abstract": "Here, we present a novel algorithm that discriminates between bound and\nunbound particles by consideration of the gravitational potential from an\naccelerated reference frame -- also referred to as `the boosted potential'.\nParticles are considered bound if their energy does not exceed the escape\nenergy of a potential well -- given by the closest saddle-point that connects\nto a deeper potential minimum. This approach has core benefits over previous\napproaches, since it does not require any ad-hoc thresholds (such as\nover-density criteria), it includes the gravitational effect of all particles\nin the binding criterion (improving over widely used self-potential binding\nchecks) and it only operates with instantaneous information (making it simpler\nthan approaches based on dynamical histories). We show that particles typically\nbecome bound between their first peri- and apo-centeric passage and that bound\nand unbound populations show very distinct characteristics through their\ndistribution in phase space, their density profiles, their virial ratios, and\ntheir redshift evolution. Our findings suggest that it is possible to\nunderstand haloes as two-component systems, with one component being bound,\nvirialized, of finite extent and evolving slowly in quasi-equilibrium and the\nother component being unbound, unvirialized and evolving rapidly.",

    "abstract": "Prediction markets have gained adoption as on-chain mechanisms for\naggregating information, with platforms such as Polymarket demonstrating demand\nfor stablecoin-denominated markets. However, denominating in\nnon-interest-bearing stablecoins introduces inefficiencies: participants face\nopportunity costs relative to the fiat risk-free rate, and Bitcoin holders in\nparticular lose exposure to BTC appreciation when converting into stablecoins.\nThis paper explores the case for prediction markets denominated in Bitcoin,\ntreating BTC as a deflationary settlement asset analogous to gold under the\nclassical gold standard. We analyse three methods of supplying liquidity to a\nnewly created BTC-denominated prediction market: cross-market making against\nexisting stablecoin venues, automated market making, and DeFi-based redirection\nof user trades. For each approach we evaluate execution mechanics, risks\n(slippage, exchange-rate risk, and liquidation risk), and capital efficiency.\nOur analysis shows that cross-market making provides the most user-friendly\nrisk profile, though it requires active professional makers or\nplatform-subsidised liquidity. DeFi redirection offers rapid bootstrapping and\nreuse of existing USDC liquidity, but exposes users to liquidation thresholds\nand exchange-rate volatility, reducing capital efficiency. Automated market\nmaking is simple to deploy but capital-inefficient and exposes liquidity\nproviders to permanent loss. The results suggest that BTC-denominated\nprediction markets are feasible, but their success depends critically on the\nchoice of liquidity provisioning mechanism and the trade-off between user\nsafety and deployment convenience.",

We present an analysis of these predicted radio\ngalaxy morphologies for the RGZ catalogue, classified using a pre-trained radio\ngalaxy foundation model that has been fine-tuned to predict Fanaroff-Riley (FR)\nmorphology. As seen in previous studies, our results show overlap between\nmorphologically classified FRI and FRII luminosity-size distributions and we\nfind that the model's confidence in its predictions is lowest in this overlap\nregion, suggesting that source morphologies are more ambiguous. We identify the\npresence of low-luminosity FRII sources, the proportion of which, with respect\nto the total number of FRIIs, is consistent with previous studies. However, a\ncomparison of the low-luminosity FRII sources found in this work with those\nidentified by previous studies reveals differences that may indicate their\nselection is influenced by the choice of classification methodology. We\ninvestigate the impacts of both pre-training and fine-tuning data selection on\nmodel performance for the downstream classification task, and show that while\ndifferent pre-training data choices affect model confidence they do not appear\nto cause systematic generalisation biases for the range of physical and\nobservational characteristics considered in this work; however, we note that\nthe same is not necessarily true for fine-tuning.

This highlights the ability of fractional dynamics to\novercome fundamental limitations of classical second-order flows. We develop a\nconvergence analysis framework for such systems by introducing fractional\nOpial-type lemmas and Lyapunov memory functionals.

Given a directed graph $G$ and integers\n$d$ and $k$, the standard problem asks whether $G$ contains a packing of\nvertex-disjoint cycles, each of length $\\leq d$, covering at least $k$ vertices\nin total. In the multi-agent setting we consider, the vertex set is partitioned\nover several agents who reject a cycle packing as solution if it can be\nmodified into an alternative packing that covers more of their own vertices. A\ncycle packing is called rejection-proof if no agent rejects it and the problem\nasks whether such a packing exists that covers at least $k$ vertices.\n  We exploit the sunflower lemma on a set packing formulation of the problem to\ngive a kernel for this $\\Sigma_2^P$-complete problem that is polynomial in $k$\nfor all constant values of $d$. We also provide a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k \\log k)} +\nn^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithm based on it and show that this FPT algorithm is\nasymptotically optimal under the ETH. Further, we generalize the problem by\nincluding an additional positive integer $c$ in the input that naturally\ncaptures how much agents can modify a given cycle packing to reject it. For\nevery constant $c$, the resulting problem simplifies from being\n$\\Sigma_2^P$-complete to NP-complete. With a single-exponential algorithm for\nthe setting where $c = 1$, we show this to be strictly easier under the ETH\nthan when $c = 2$. In turn, we show that any $c \\geq 2$ yields a problem that\nis essentially as hard as the original problem with $c$ unbounded.

The blind source separation efficacy of the proposed method is\nshowcased through a simulation study, where it is compared against\nstate-of-the-art methods, and the spatio-temporal prediction performance is\nevaluated against several competitors on air pollution and weather datasets.",

We introduce Spec-LLaVA, a system that applies speculative\ndecoding to accelerate VLMs without sacrificing output quality.

To maximize efficiency, we design a dynamic\ntree-based verification algorithm that adaptively expands and prunes\nspeculative branches using draft model confidence. On MS COCO out-of-domain\nimages, Spec-LLaVA achieves up to 3.28$\\times$ faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5\n(7B, 13B) with no loss in generation quality. This work presents a lossless\nacceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative\ndecoding, opening a path toward practical real-time multimodal assistants.\nImportantly, the lightweight draft model design makes the framework amenable to\nresource-constrained or on-device deployment settings.",

We demonstrate that high-precision\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments like the Atacama Cosmology\nTelescope (ACT), though designed for cosmology, offer a unique capability for\nsuch time-domain science due to their high cadence and broad sky coverage in\nmillimeter bands. While previous ACT searches have focused on transients\nlasting minutes or longer, we develop and validate analysis methods to search\nfor periodic, millisecond-scale transients, a capability not typically\nassociated with CMB experiments. We describe a phase-resolved mapmaking\napproach, which leverages the known periodicity of the signal to enhance\nsensitivity and offers advantages in diagnosing systematic errors. We also\nintroduce a template-based fit to the raw data timestreams that independently\nvalidate our results. Applying these methods to estimate the millimeter flux of\nthe Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21), we derive 95% confidence upper limits of 4.6\nmJy, 4.4 mJy, and 20.7 mJy on the pulsar's period-averaged flux density at 96\nGHz, 148 GHz, and 225 GHz, respectively.

The\nconvective derivative $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla u$ is considered as part of the\ntotal time derivative $\\frac{d}{dt}u = \\partial_t u + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla\nu$, and therefore we can use a rather standard stability and error analysis for\nrelated space-time finite element methods. For stationary problems we restrict\nthe ansatz space $H^1_0(\\Omega)$ such that the convective derivative is\nconsidered as an element of the dual $H^{-1}(\\Omega)$ of the test space\n$H^1_0(\\Omega)$, which also allows unbounded velocities $\\mathbf{v}$. While the\ndiscrete finite element schemes are always unique solvable, the numerical\nsolutions may suffer from a bad approximation property of the finite element\nspace when considering convection dominated problems, i.e., small diffusion\ncoefficients. Instead of adding suitable stabilization terms, we aim to resolve\nthe solutions by using adaptive (space-time) finite element methods.

Recent work has introduced structural fidelity as a\ntabular-specific evaluation dimension to assess whether synthetic data complies\nwith the causal structures of real data. However, existing benchmarks often\nneglect the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional evaluation\ndimensions, thus failing to provide a holistic understanding of model\nperformance. Moreover, they are typically limited to toy datasets, as\nquantifying existing structural fidelity metrics requires access to\nground-truth causal structures, which are rarely available for real-world\ndatasets.

These properties are shared with the conifold locus in\nmoduli space, rather than the large complex-structure locus. The conifold locus\nis well-known to arise from integrating out a charged BPS state, and so the\nsimilarities suggest that the K-point also arises from integrating out a BPS\nstate. We develop such an interpretation, finding that it corresponds to a BPS\nstate which is extremely light, whose mass in Planck units is\ndoubly-exponentially small in the distance to the K-point. The state behaves as\nif it had complex charges, or as if it couples to the self-dual and anti\nself-dual parts of the graviphoton differently.

    "abstract": "This study develops a spectral Ritz formulation for the nonlinear free\nvibration analysis of carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (CNTRC) beams.\nBoundary-adapted Chebyshev basis functions are constructed to exactly satisfy\nclamped and simply supported boundary conditions. The governing equations\nincorporate von~K\\'{a}rm\\'{a}n geometric nonlinearity, while the effective\nmaterial properties for both uniform and functionally graded (FG) CNT\ndistributions are evaluated using a modified rule of mixtures. Discretization\nvia the Chebyshev-Ritz approach produces a reduced-order model exhibiting\nexponential convergence; for basis sizes $N \\geq 12$, the fundamental frequency\nerror remains below $0.1\\%$ relative to published benchmarks.\n  Computational results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains, with the\nspectral approach requiring significantly less time than high-fidelity finite\nelement discretizations of comparable accuracy. Parametric studies reveal that\nthe fundamental frequency increases with CNT volume fraction and is sensitive\nto the interfacial load-transfer efficiency parameter $\\eta_E$. Selected FG\npatterns are shown to enhance stiffness relative to uniformly distributed CNTs.\n  Validation against established numerical benchmarks yields relative\ndifferences of only a few percent. The current limitation of the method is its\nreliance on the Euler-Bernoulli beam assumption, which neglects transverse\nshear deformation and damping; addressing these effects is proposed for future\nwork.

    "abstract": "Aims. We explore frequency-dependent changes in pulsar radio emission by\nanalyzing their profile widths and emission heights, assessing whether the\nsimple radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM) or the fan beam model can describe the\ndata. Methods. Using wideband (704-4032 MHz) Murriyang (Parkes) observations of\nover 100 pulsars, we measured profile widths at multiple intensity levels, fit\nGaussian components, and used aberration-retardation effects to estimate\nemission altitudes. We compared trends in width evolution and emission height\nwith a fan beam model. Results. Similar to other recent studies, we find that\nwhile many pulsars show profiles narrowing with increasing frequency, a\nsubstantial fraction show the reverse. The Gaussian decomposition of the\nprofiles reveals that the peak locations of the components vary little with\nfrequency. However, the component widths do, in general, narrow with increasing\nfrequency. This argues that propagation effects are responsible for the width\nevolution of the profiles rather than emission height. Overall, the evolution\nof the emission height with frequency is unclear, and clouded by the\nassumptions in the model. Spin-down luminosity correlates weakly with profile\nnarrowing but not with emission height. Conclusions. The classic picture where\npulsars emit at a single emission height which decreases with increasing\nobserving frequency cannot explain the diversity in behavior observed here.\nInstead, pulsar beams likely originate from extended regions at multiple\naltitudes, with fan-beam or patchy structures dominating their frequency\nevolution. Future models must incorporate realistic plasma physics and\nmulti-altitude emission to capture the range of pulsar behaviors.",

Although some multimodal\nreasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific\ndomains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall\nshort in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of\nmultimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare\nprofessionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through\na directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in\naccommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the\nreasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the\nbest recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at\ndifferent time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and\ndisease progression.

Environments are not passive testing\ngrounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit\nvery challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous\ncapacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets\nhas led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the\nstructure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these\nenvironments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This\npaper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief\nstates of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This\nfoundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of\n\\emph{possibility} and \\emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal\nlogic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make\ninfere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for\nproper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively\nguide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from\nreaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity\nsimulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses\ncomplex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs\nwith the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world\nmodel and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable\nautonomous agents.",

    "abstract": "Visual documentation is an effective tool for reducing the cognitive barrier\ndevelopers face when understanding unfamiliar code, enabling more intuitive\ncomprehension. Compared to textual documentation, it provides a higher-level\nunderstanding of the system structure and data flow. Developers usually prefer\nvisual representations over lengthy textual descriptions for large software\nsystems. Visual documentation is both difficult to produce and challenging to\nevaluate. Manually creating it is time-consuming, and currently, no existing\napproach can automatically generate high-level visual documentation directly\nfrom code. Its evaluation is often subjective, making it difficult to\nstandardize and automate. To address these challenges, this paper presents the\nfirst exploration of using agentic LLM systems to automatically generate visual\ndocumentation. We introduce VisDocSketcher, the first agent-based approach that\ncombines static analysis with LLM agents to identify key elements in the code\nand produce corresponding visual representations. We propose a novel evaluation\nframework, AutoSketchEval, for assessing the quality of generated visual\ndocumentation using code-level metrics. The experimental results show that our\napproach can valid visual documentation for 74.4% of the samples. It shows an\nimprovement of 26.7-39.8% over a simple template-based baseline. Our evaluation\nframework can reliably distinguish high-quality (code-aligned) visual\ndocumentation from low-quality (non-aligned) ones, achieving an AUC exceeding\n0.87. Our work lays the foundation for future research on automated visual\ndocumentation by introducing practical tools that not only generate valid\nvisual representations but also reliably assess their quality.",

Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's\nKappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability.

In\nthis automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical\ndiagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable.

    "abstract": "To select suitable filters for a task or to improve existing filters, a deep\nunderstanding of their inner workings is vital. Diffusion echoes, which are\nspace-adaptive impulse responses, are useful to visualise the effect of\nnonlinear diffusion filters. However, they have received little attention in\nthe literature. There may be two reasons for this: Firstly, the concept was\nintroduced specifically for diffusion filters, which might appear too limited.\nSecondly, diffusion echoes have large storage requirements, which restricts\ntheir practicality. This work addresses both problems. We introduce the filter\necho as a generalisation of the diffusion echo and use it for applications\nbeyond adaptive smoothing, such as image inpainting, osmosis, and variational\noptic flow computation. We provide a framework to visualise and inspect echoes\nfrom various filters with different applications. Furthermore, we propose a\ncompression approach for filter echoes, which reduces storage requirements by a\nfactor of 20 to 100.",

However, most existing\nplanners rely on a fixed, pre-specified horizon during both training and\ninference. This rigidity often produces length-mismatch (trajectories that are\ntoo short or too long) and brittle performance across instances with varying\ngeometric or dynamical difficulty. In this paper, we introduce the Variable\nHorizon Diffuser (VHD) framework, which treats the horizon as a learned\nvariable rather than a fixed hyperparameter. Given a start-goal pair, we first\npredict an instance-specific horizon using a learned Length Predictor model,\nwhich guides a Diffusion Planner to generate a trajectory of the desired\nlength. Our design maintains compatibility with existing diffusion planners by\ncontrolling trajectory length through initial noise shaping and training on\nrandomly cropped sub-trajectories, without requiring architectural changes.\nEmpirically, VHD improves success rates and path efficiency in maze-navigation\nand robot-arm control benchmarks, showing greater robustness to horizon\nmismatch and unseen lengths, while keeping training simple and offline-only.",

    "abstract": "When query evaluation produces too many tuples, a new approach in query\nanswering is to retrieve a diverse subset of them. The standard approach for\nmeasuring the diversity of a set of tuples is to use a distance function\nbetween tuples, which measures the dissimilarity between them, to then\naggregate the pairwise distances of the set into a score (e.g., by using sum or\nmin aggregation). However, as we will point out in this work, the resulting\ndiversity measures may display some unintuitive behavior. Moreover, even in\nvery simple settings, finding a maximally diverse subset of the answers of\nfixed size is, in general, intractable and little is known about approximations\napart from some hand-picked distance-aggregator pairs.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel approach for computing the diversity of\ntuples based on volume instead of distance. We present a framework for defining\nvolume-based diversity functions and provide several examples of these measures\napplied to relational data. Although query answering of conjunctive queries\n(CQ) under this setting is intractable in general, we show that one can always\ncompute a (1-1/e)-approximation for any volume-based diversity function.\nFurthermore, in terms of combined complexity, we connect the evaluation of CQs\nunder volume-based diversity functions with the ranked enumeration of\nsolutions, finding general conditions under which a (1-1/e)-approximation can\nbe computed in polynomial time.",

Such wireless\npropagation measurements typically employ GPS-based logging for TX/RX\nlocations, which can produce meter-level errors that lead to unreliable RT\ncalibration and validation. These location misalignments cause inaccurate\ninteractions between RT-generated multipath components (MPCs) and the modeled\n3D environment, which lead to erroneous channel predictions, and severe\ndiscrepancies between simulated and measured power delay profiles (PDPs) and\nchannel characteristics. Moreover, the same RT-generated PDPs using inaccurate\nlocations result in calibration errors when adjusting material properties such\nas conductivity and permittivity.\n  This paper presents a systematic multi-stage TX/RX location calibration\nframework to correct location errors and consequently align measured and\nsimulated omnidirectional PDPs.\n  Optimization is performed using a computationally efficient multi-stage grid\nsearch and the Powell method.

    "abstract": "Facial emotion recognition (FER) models trained only on pixels often fail to\ngeneralize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased\nproxy for underlying affect. We present NeuroGaze-Distill, a cross-modal\ndistillation framework that transfers brain-informed priors into an image-only\nFER student via static Valence/Arousal (V/A) prototypes and a\ndepression-inspired geometric prior (D-Geo). A teacher trained on EEG\ntopographic maps from DREAMER (with MAHNOB-HCI as unlabeled support) produces a\nconsolidated 5x5 V/A prototype grid that is frozen and reused; no EEG-face\npairing and no non-visual signals at deployment are required. The student\n(ResNet-18/50) is trained on FERPlus with conventional CE/KD and two\nlightweight regularizers: (i) Proto-KD (cosine) aligns student features to the\nstatic prototypes; (ii) D-Geo softly shapes the embedding geometry in line with\naffective findings often reported in depression research (e.g., anhedonia-like\ncontraction in high-valence regions). We evaluate both within-domain (FERPlus\nvalidation) and cross-dataset protocols (AffectNet-mini; optional CK+),\nreporting standard 8-way scores alongside present-only Macro-F1 and balanced\naccuracy to fairly handle label-set mismatch. Ablations attribute consistent\ngains to prototypes and D-Geo, and favor 5x5 over denser grids for stability.\nThe method is simple, deployable, and improves robustness without architectural\ncomplexity.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced, it is increasingly\ndifficult to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. This\npaper draws a conceptual parallel between quantum uncertainty and the limits of\nauthorship detection in natural language. We argue that there is a fundamental\ntrade-off: the more confidently one tries to identify whether a text was\nwritten by a human or an AI, the more one risks disrupting the text's natural\nflow and authenticity. This mirrors the tension between precision and\ndisturbance found in quantum systems. We explore how current detection\nmethods--such as stylometry, watermarking, and neural classifiers--face\ninherent limitations. Enhancing detection accuracy often leads to changes in\nthe AI's output, making other features less reliable. In effect, the very act\nof trying to detect AI authorship introduces uncertainty elsewhere in the text.\nOur analysis shows that when AI-generated text closely mimics human writing,\nperfect detection becomes not just technologically difficult but theoretically\nimpossible. We address counterarguments and discuss the broader implications\nfor authorship, ethics, and policy. Ultimately, we suggest that the challenge\nof AI-text detection is not just a matter of better tools--it reflects a\ndeeper, unavoidable tension in the nature of language itself.",

EgoMem enables real-time\nmodels to recognize multiple users directly from raw audiovisual streams, to\nprovide personalized response, and to maintain long-term knowledge of users'\nfacts, preferences, and social relationships extracted from audiovisual\nhistory. EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval\nprocess that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers\nrelevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that\ngenerates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and\n(iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries\nfrom omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the\nlong-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies\nentirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for\nlifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy\non the test set.

We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological\nobservations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of\ngalaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon\nin the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be\neasily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when\ncoupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as\npredicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the\nUniverse's expansion and Zwicky's tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that\nthe CCC parameter {\\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark\nmatter and dark energy, which we call {\\alpha}-matter and {\\alpha}-energy, and\nis influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically\n{\\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe,\ne.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme\nanisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions,\none expects {\\alpha}-matter and {\\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low\nand vice versa.

Among various\nout-of-distribution detection methods, Outlier Exposure and Mixture Outlier\nExposure are promising approaches that enhance out-of-distribution detection\nperformance by exposing the outlier data during training. However, even with\nthese sophisticated techniques, it remains challenging for models to learn the\nrelationships between classes effectively and to distinguish data sampling from\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution clearly. Therefore, we focus on the\nlogit space, where the properties between class-wise distributions are\ndistinctly separated from those in the input or feature spaces. Specifically,\nwe propose a linear interpolation technique in the logit space that mixes\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution data to facilitate smoothing logits\nbetween classes and improve the out-of-distribution detection performance,\nparticularly for out-of-distribution data that lie close to the in-distribution\ndata. Additionally, we enforce consistency between the logits obtained through\nmixing in the logit space and those generated via mixing in the input space.\nOur experiments demonstrate that our logit-space mixing technique reduces the\nabrupt fluctuations in the model outputs near the decision boundaries,\nresulting in smoother and more reliable separation between in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution data.

Both star-forming (SF) and quiescent (QS)\nmisaligned galaxies exhibit narrower HI linewidths compared to their gas-star\naligned controls.

The shape of HI profiles is expected to change\nwith the HI surface density radial gradients through external gas accretion --\nthe interaction between the accreted gas and the pre-existing gas leads to the\nre-distribution of angular momentum and induces gas inflow. It suggests that\nthe progenitors of SF misaligned galaxies are central HI-enriched, in this\ncase, the shape of HI profiles is insensitive to the further increase of\ncentral HI surface density.

While most\nexisting SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting\nfavorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is\nidentified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's\nsemantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse\nSAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the\ninfluence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's\nparameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to\nstrengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers,\noriginally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training\nlayers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by\nlinear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules,\nSAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing\nadvantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD\ntask. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the\nproposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new\nbenchmark in the field.

For large-sized reactors,\nlike ITER and DEMO, high particle collision rates lead to a substantial\ncomputational cost for such schemes. To address this challenge, an\nasymptotic-preserving kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) simulation method\nand a corresponding fluid estimation technique have been proposed in the\nliterature. In this work, we perform numerical analysis on the convergence of\nKDMC with the fluid estimation. To do so, we compare the accuracy of the\nanalyzed algorithm with the accuracy of an approximate fluid method using the\nkinetic MC method as a reference. In a one-dimensional test case, KDMC with the\nfluid estimation achieves at least one order of magnitude lower errors than the\nfluid method for both high- and low-collisional regimes. Moreover, KDMC with\nthe fluid estimation outperforms the kinetic MC method with a clear speed-up.\nOverall, our analysis confirms the effectiveness of the discussed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We propose an O(100)m Atom Interferometer (AI) experiment to be installed\nagainst a wall of the PX46 access shaft to the LHC. This experiment would probe\nunexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter\n(ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for\ngravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which\nexisting and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics\nstudies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be\nisolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and\nsurveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no\ntechnical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that\nthe preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation\nshielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and\ninstallation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing\ninstallation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without\nimpacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a\nuniquely promising location for an AI experiment.

To address\nthis issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive,\ntemporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained\nspatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark\ndataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes\n10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched\nwith detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in\nLVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the\nperceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This\nstep-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively\nidentifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is\neffective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and\nreliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in\nreal-world scenarios.

Unfortunately, such attacks rely on trial and\nerror, lack generalizability across models, and are constrained by scalability\nand reliability.\n  This paper presents NeuroStrike, a novel and generalizable attack framework\nthat exploits a fundamental vulnerability introduced by alignment techniques:\nthe reliance on sparse, specialized safety neurons responsible for detecting\nand suppressing harmful inputs. We apply NeuroStrike to both white-box and\nblack-box settings: In the white-box setting, NeuroStrike identifies safety\nneurons through feedforward activation analysis and prunes them during\ninference to disable safety mechanisms. In the black-box setting, we propose\nthe first LLM profiling attack, which leverages safety neuron transferability\nby training adversarial prompt generators on open-weight surrogate models and\nthen deploying them against black-box and proprietary targets. We evaluate\nNeuroStrike on over 20 open-weight LLMs from major LLM developers. By removing\nless than 0.6% of neurons in targeted layers, NeuroStrike achieves an average\nattack success rate (ASR) of 76.9% using only vanilla malicious prompts.\nMoreover, Neurostrike generalizes to four multimodal LLMs with 100% ASR on\nunsafe image inputs. Safety neurons transfer effectively across architectures,\nraising ASR to 78.5% on 11 fine-tuned models and 77.7% on five distilled\nmodels.

This enables selective downsampling of the dense point cloud,\npreserving scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count.\nExperiments across diverse benchmarks show that SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count\nby up to 50% and achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and\nSSIM, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS. It further enables faster\ntraining and lower memory footprint, advancing the practicality of 3DGS for\nconstrained-view scenarios.",

Our findings reveal\nthat minimum wage regulation impacts substantially drivers income, and may lead\nto higher fares for travelers and threaten platforms survival.

The\nforeground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when\nmeasuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck\nspectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark\nages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new,\nprecision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies\nfrom 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to\nprevious all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that\nis constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We\nfind that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100\nMHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a\nfactor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of\nunaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a\nnew receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise\nand bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single,\naccurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter\nground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky\nbrightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark\nmatter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a\nstable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for\nlow-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy\nof the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our\nmeasurements.",

    "abstract": "The present work aims at exploring the scale-by-scale kinetic energy\nexchanges in multiphase turbulence. For this purpose, we derive the\nK\\'arm\\'an-Howarth-Monin equation which accounts for the variations of density\nand viscosity across the two phases together with the effect of surface\ntension. We consider both conventional and phase conditional averaging\noperators. This framework is applied to numerical data from detailed\nsimulations of forced homogeneous and isotropic turbulence covering different\nvalues for the liquid volume fraction, the liquid/gas density ratio, the\nReynolds, and Weber numbers. We confirm the existence of an additional transfer\nterm due to surface tension. Part of the kinetic energy injected at large\nscales is transferred into kinetic energy at smaller scales by classical\nnon-linear transport while another part is transferred to surface energy before\nbeing released back into kinetic energy, but at smaller scales. The overall\nkinetic energy transfer rate is larger than in single phase flows. Kinetic\nenergy budgets conditioned in a given phase show that the scale-by-scale\ntransport of turbulent kinetic energy due to pressure is a gain (loss) of\nkinetic energy for the lighter (heavier) phase. Its contribution can be\ndominant when the gas volume fraction becomes small or when the density ratio\nincreases. Building on previous work, we hypothesize the existence of a pivotal\nscale above which kinetic energy is stored into surface deformation and below\nwhich the kinetic energy is released by interface restoration. Some\nphenomenological predictions for this scale are discussed.",

We reveal that PMTUD is inadequately designed to\nhandle IP address sharing, creating vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit\nto perform off-path TCP hijacking attacks. We demonstrate that by observing the\npath MTU value determined by a server for a public IP address (shared among\nmultiple devices), an off-path attacker on the Internet, in collaboration with\na malicious device, can infer the sequence numbers of TCP connections\nestablished by other legitimate devices sharing the same IP address. This\nvulnerability enables the attacker to perform off-path TCP hijacking attacks,\nsignificantly compromising the security of the affected TCP connections. Our\nattack involves first identifying a target TCP connection originating from the\nshared IP address, followed by inferring the sequence numbers of the identified\nconnection. We thoroughly assess the impacts of our attack under various\nnetwork configurations. Experimental results reveal that the attack can be\nexecuted within an average time of 220 seconds, achieving a success rate of\n70%.Case studies, including SSH DoS, FTP traffic poisoning, and HTTP injection,\nhighlight the threat it poses to various applications.

    "abstract": "Sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) as a close remote sensing based proxy for\nphotosynthesis is accepted as a useful measure to remotely monitor vegetation\nhealth and gross primary productivity. In this work we present the new\nretrieval method WAFER (WAvelet decomposition FluorEscence Retrieval) based on\nwavelet decompositions of the measured spectra of reflected radiance as well as\na reference radiance not containing fluorescence. By comparing absolute\nabsorption line depths by means of the corresponding wavelet coefficients, a\nrelative reflectance is retrieved independently of the fluorescence, i.e.\nwithout introducing a coupling between reflectance and fluorescence. The\nfluorescence can then be derived as the remaining offset. This method can be\napplied to arbitrary chosen wavelength windows in the whole spectral range,\nsuch that all the spectral data available is exploited, including the\nseparation into several frequency (i.e. width of absorption lines) levels and\nwithout the need of extensive training datasets. At the same time, the\nassumptions about the reflectance shape are minimal and no spectral shape\nassumptions are imposed on the fluorescence, which not only avoids biases\narising from wrong or differing fluorescence models across different spatial\nscales and retrieval methods but also allows for the exploration of this\nspectral shape for different measurement setups. WAFER is tested on a synthetic\ndataset as well as several diurnal datasets acquired with a field spectrometer\n(FloX) over an agricultural site. We compare the WAFER method to two\nestablished retrieval methods, namely the improved Fraunhofer line\ndiscrimination (iFLD) method and spectral fitting method (SFM) and find a good\nagreement with the added possibility of exploring the true spectral shape of\nthe offset signal and free choice of the retrieval window.

The light curves show significant\nvariability, with fractional variability peaking at 0.75 in X-rays, 0.4 in the\noptical/UV, and 0.65 in $\\gamma$-ray band-consistent with expectations for\nHSPs. Segmenting the $\\gamma$-ray light curve with Bayesian blocks, we defined\n253 time-resolved epochs with adequate multi-band coverage and categorized them\ninto quiescent states (QS), multiwavelength flares (MWF), $\\gamma$-ray flares\n($\\gamma$F), X-ray flares (XF), and optical/UV flares (OUF). Each SED is\nmodeled within a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework that\nself-consistently evolves particle injection and cooling; a neural-network\nsurrogate is used to accelerate parameter inference. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests\nreveal state-dependent parameter variations relative to QS: (i) during MWF, the\nmagnetic field B, electron luminosity $L_{e}$, maximum electron Lorentz factor\n$\\gamma_{max}$, and Doppler factor $\\delta$ differ significantly; (ii) during\n$\\gamma$F, a harder electron index p is estimated; (iii) XF shows higher B and\n$\\gamma_{max}$ with a more compact emitting region; and (IV) during OUF,\nchanges in B, $L_{e}$, $\\gamma_{max}$, $\\delta$, and p are found while the\nemitting-zone size remains approximately constant.

In general, we found that the\nmagnetic field ($B$) is weaker than those obtained for flaring/outburst state\nby nearly one order of magnitude, and the dissipation region size ($R$) is\nlarger than those obtained for flaring/outburst state, suggesting that the\ndissipation region could be more extend and less magnetized. A correlation\nbetween the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) peak frequency ($\\log \\nu_{\\rm\nssc}$) against the synchrotron peak frequency ($\\log \\nu_{\\rm sy}$) suggest\nthat the inverse Compton scattering of HBLs suffer a significant Klein-Nishina\n(KN) suppression, we quantified the condition of KN suppression by determining\nthe critical synchrotron peak frequency ($\\nu_{\\rm sy}^{\\rm c}$) and found 359\nout of 513 sources in our sample suffer KN suppression.

    "abstract": "Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a federated learning (FL) approach that\nimproves model performance at the target client by collaborating with source\nclients while preserving data privacy. FDA faces two primary challenges: domain\nshifts between source and target data and limited labeled data at the target.\nMost existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts, assuming ample target data,\nyet often neglect the combined challenges of both domain shifts and data\nscarcity. Moreover, approaches that address both challenges fail to prioritize\nsharing relevant information from source clients according to the target's\nobjective. In this paper, we propose FedDAF, a novel approach addressing both\nchallenges in FDA. FedDAF uses similarity-based aggregation of the global\nsource model and target model by calculating model functional distance from\ntheir mean gradient fields computed on target data. This enables effective\nmodel aggregation based on the target objective, constructed using target data,\neven with limited data. While computing model functional distance between these\ntwo models, FedDAF computes the angle between their mean gradient fields and\nthen normalizes with the Gompertz function. To construct the global source\nmodel, all the local source models are aggregated using simple average in the\nserver. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority\nover existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in terms of achieving better test\naccuracy.",

Modern digital twin platforms decouple data streams and representations\ninto separate architectural planes, fusing them only at the visualization layer\nand limiting potential for simulation or further processing of the combined\nassets. At the same time, geometry-centric file standards for digital twin\ndescription, and services built on top of them, focus primarily on explicitly\ndeclaring geometry and additional structural or photorealistic parameters,\nmaking integration with evolving context information a complicated process\nwhile limiting compatibility with newer representation methods. Additionally,\nmulti-provider federation, critical in smart city services where multiple\nstakeholders may control distinct infrastructure or representation assets, is\nsparsely supported.

This model couples surface and bulk\nhydrodynamics, accommodates large shape deformations and incorporates a\ndiffusible contraction-generating molecule (myosin) that drives cortical flows.\nThese capabilities enable a systematic exploration of how mechanical cues\ndirect cell polarization and migration. We first demonstrate that spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking of cortical activity can lead to persistent and directed\nmovement in channels.

    "abstract": "Static analysis tools are widely used to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and\ncode smells. Traditionally, developers must resolve these warnings manually.\nBecause this process is tedious, developers sometimes ignore warnings, leading\nto an accumulation of warnings and a degradation of code quality. This paper\npresents CodeCureAgent, an approach that harnesses LLM-based agents to\nautomatically analyze, classify, and repair static analysis warnings. Unlike\nprevious work, our method does not follow a predetermined algorithm. Instead,\nwe adopt an agentic framework that iteratively invokes tools to gather\nadditional information from the codebase (e.g., via code search) and edit the\ncodebase to resolve the warning. CodeCureAgent detects and suppresses false\npositives, while fixing true positives when identified. We equip CodeCureAgent\nwith a three-step heuristic to approve patches: (1) build the project, (2)\nverify that the warning disappears without introducing new warnings, and (3)\nrun the test suite. We evaluate CodeCureAgent on a dataset of 1,000 SonarQube\nwarnings found in 106 Java projects and covering 291 distinct rules. Our\napproach produces plausible fixes for 96.8% of the warnings, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baseline approaches by 30.7% and 29.2% in plausible-fix rate,\nrespectively. Manual inspection of 291 cases reveals a correct-fix rate of\n86.3%, showing that CodeCureAgent can reliably repair static analysis warnings.\nThe approach incurs LLM costs of about 2.9 cents (USD) and an end-to-end\nprocessing time of about four minutes per warning. We envision CodeCureAgent\nhelping to clean existing codebases and being integrated into CI/CD pipelines\nto prevent the accumulation of static analysis warnings.",

    "abstract": "Industrial control systems (ICSs) are widely used in industry, and their\nsecurity and stability are very important. Once the ICS is attacked, it may\ncause serious damage. Therefore, it is very important to detect anomalies in\nICSs. ICS can monitor and manage physical devices remotely using communication\nnetworks. The existing anomaly detection approaches mainly focus on analyzing\nthe security of network traffic or sensor data. However, the behaviors of\ndifferent domains (e.g., network traffic and sensor physical status) of ICSs\nare correlated, so it is difficult to comprehensively identify anomalies by\nanalyzing only a single domain. In this paper, an anomaly detection approach\nbased on cross-domain representation learning in ICSs is proposed, which can\nlearn the joint features of multi-domain behaviors and detect anomalies within\ndifferent domains. After constructing a cross-domain graph that can represent\nthe behaviors of multiple domains in ICSs, our approach can learn the joint\nfeatures of them by leveraging graph neural networks. Since anomalies behave\ndifferently in different domains, we leverage a multi-task learning approach to\nidentify anomalies in different domains separately and perform joint training.\nThe experimental results show that the performance of our approach is better\nthan existing approaches for identifying anomalies in ICSs.",

We validate and demonstrate the\nability of the proposed framework to segment the domain, and characterize the\nconstituent materials on various types of thin square heterogeneous domains. We\nvalidate of the framework's ability to segment and characterize materials with\nvarious levels of displacement noises and non-native mesh discretizations, i.e,\nusing different meshes for the forward FE simulations and the inverse EUCLID\nproblem.

Sampling methods, such as general-purpose Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC), are commonly used, but they require prior and likelihood densities to\nbe explicitly provided. In cases where expressing the prior explicitly is\nchallenging, implicit priors offer an alternative, encoding prior information\nindirectly. These priors have gained increased interest in recent years, with\nmethods like Plug-and-Play (PnP) priors and Regularized Linear\nRandomize-then-Optimize (RLRTO) providing computationally efficient\nalternatives to standard MCMC algorithms. However, the abstract concept of\nimplicit priors for Bayesian inverse problems is yet to be systematically\nexplored and little effort has been made to unify different kinds of implicit\npriors. This paper presents a computational framework for implicit priors and\ntheir distinction from explicit priors. We also introduce an implementation of\nvarious implicit priors within the CUQIpy Python package for Computational\nUncertainty Quantification in Inverse Problems.

Recent advances in\nfoundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot\ngeneralization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS\n(MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and\nmemory efficiency.

Furthermore, a sliding-window\nmemory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance\ndegradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D face from a single unconstrained image remains a\nchallenging problem due to diverse conditions in unconstrained environments.\nRecently, learning-based methods have achieved notable results by effectively\ncapturing complex facial structures and details across varying conditions.\nConsequently, many existing approaches employ projection-based losses between\ngenerated and input images to constrain model training. However, learning-based\nmethods for 3D face reconstruction typically require substantial amounts of 3D\nfacial data, which is difficult and costly to obtain. Consequently, to reduce\nreliance on labeled 3D face datasets, many existing approaches employ\nprojection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model\ntraining. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, existing approaches\nfrequently struggle to capture detailed and multi-scale features under diverse\nfacial attributes and conditions, leading to incomplete or less accurate\nreconstructions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with\nMulti-Attribute (MSMA) framework for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained\nimages. Our method integrates multi-scale feature fusion with a focus on\nmulti-attribute learning and leverages a large-kernel attention module to\nenhance the precision of feature extraction across scales, enabling accurate 3D\nfacial parameter estimation from a single 2D image.

This\npaper demonstrates that resolving this trilemma requires a shift in perspective\n- from seeking engineering trade-offs to deriving solutions from logical\nnecessity. We establish a rigorous axiomatic system that formalizes these\nphysical constraints and prove that for the broad class of computations\nadmitting an idempotent merge operator, there exists a unique, optimal\nparadigm.

The HC state is determined by 3-D MHD force balance\nand all factors that contribute to it, such as plasma shaping, the safety\nfactor profile, and the pressure profiles of all particle species. An\nincomplete but useful measure of the HC is the displacement of the magnetic\naxis, $\\delta_\\mathrm{HC}$.

Within the ITER operating alpha pressure\n$\\beta_\\mathrm{\\alpha}(0) \\lesssim 1\\%$, $\\beta_\\mathrm{\\alpha}$ can be\napproximately treated as part of the total MHD pressure. In this regime, there\nis no notable flattening of the pressure profile, indicating that the HC\npreserves the omnigenity of the plasma.

This secondary mode consists of a broad spectrum of\nshort-wavelength Fourier components that grow at same rates and are thus part\nof a single coherent entity. Our present simulation model is insufficient to\nadequately represent such a secondary mode; however, preliminary results\nsuggest that it can facilitate magnetic chaos, which affects plasma\nconfinement.",

To theoretically tackle the diverse correlated\nand topological states emerging from moir\\'e superlattices, one usually adopts\nan effective low-energy continuum model based on which the electron-electron\neffects are further considered. However, the construction of an accurate\ncontinuum model remains a challenging task, particularly for complex moir\\'e\nsuperlattices such as twisted transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work,\nwe develop a formalism for constructing generic continuum models that are in\nprinciple applicable for arbitrary moir\\'e superlattices and are extrapolatable\nto any twist angles. Our key insight is that the microscopic electronic\nproperties are intrinsic properties of the system, which should remain\ninvariant across all twist angles; the lattice relaxations act as external\ninputs that vary with twist angles and are coupled with the electrons, and the\ncoupling coefficients are characterized by intrinsic parameters. This partition\nenables a universal description of the angle variation of the continuum model\nusing a single set of model parameters. To extract the model parameters, we\ndesign a numerical workflow based on data from first principles density\nfunctional theory calculations. We apply this framework to twisted bilayer\nMoTe$_{2}$, and obtain a single set of model parameters that accurately\nreproduce first-principles results, including electronic band structures,\ncharge density distributions and Chern numbers, at three different twist\nangles. Furthermore, the model extrapolates robustly to smaller twist angles.\nOur work not only provides a more precise understanding of the microscopic\nproperties of moir\\'e superlattices, but also lays a foundation for future\ntheoretical studies of low-energy electronic properties in generic moir\\'e\nsuperlattice systems.",

In this model, the final partonic state (FPS) and the final\nhadronic state (FHS) are simulated and recorded sequentially. Besides the\nexcited strangeonium and tetraquark interpretations, we propose for the first\ntime that the $X(2300)$ could also be a hadro-strangeonium state, in which a\nstrangeonium and a light hadron are bound together. The excited strangeonium\nand tetraquark states are, respectively, produced by coalescing with $s\\bar{s}$\nand $ss\\bar{s}\\bar{s}$ in the FPS with the quantum statistical mechanics\ninspired dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence (DCPC) model. The\nhadro-strangeonium state is generated by the recombination of $\\phi\\eta/\\phi\n\\eta'$ in the FHS with DCPC. We then calculate the $X(2300)$'s orbital angular\nmomentum quantum number in its rest frame and perform the spectral\nclassification for each of the above candidates. Given its quantum numbers\n$J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$, the $X(2300)$ is identified as a $P$-wave $s\\bar{s}$, an\n$S$-wave $ss\\bar{s}\\bar{s}$ or an $S$-wave $\\phi\\eta/\\phi \\eta'$ candidate. The\nproduction rates for the $X(2300)$ candidates with different configurations are\nestimated for the first time. Those for the excited strangeonium and tetraquark\nstates are on the order of $10^{-4}$, while the hadro-strangeonium state is\nproduced at a rate on the order of $10^{-6}$. Moreover, significant\ndiscrepancies are observed in the rapidity distributions and the transverse\nmomentum spectra among the different configurations.

    "abstract": "LiDAR-to-OpenStreetMap (OSM) localization has gained increasing attention, as\nOSM provides lightweight global priors such as building footprints. These\npriors enhance global consistency for robot navigation, but OSM is often\nincomplete or outdated, limiting its reliability in real-world deployment.\nMeanwhile, LiDAR itself suffers from a limited field of view (FoV), where\nmotorized rotation is commonly used to achieve panoramic coverage. Existing\nmotorized LiDAR systems, however, typically employ constant-speed scanning that\ndisregards both scene structure and map priors, leading to wasted effort in\nfeature-sparse regions and degraded localization accuracy. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Adaptive LiDAR Scanning with OSM guidance, a framework\nthat integrates global priors with local observability prediction to improve\nlocalization robustness. Specifically, we augment uncertainty-aware model\npredictive control with an OSM-aware term that adaptively allocates scanning\neffort according to both scene-dependent observability and the spatial\ndistribution of OSM features. The method is implemented in ROS with a motorized\nLiDAR odometry backend and evaluated in both simulation and real-world\nexperiments. Results on campus roads, indoor corridors, and urban environments\ndemonstrate significant reductions in trajectory error compared to\nconstant-speed baselines, while maintaining scan completeness. These findings\nhighlight the potential of coupling open-source maps with adaptive LiDAR\nscanning to achieve robust and efficient localization in complex environments.",

Our empirical and modeling results\nindicate that Braess' paradox is unlikely to be a prevalent phenomenon in\npedestrian traffic systems.

    "abstract": "Self-lensing (SL) in binary systems has the potential to provide a unique\nobservational window into the Galactic population of compact objects. Using the\n$\\mathtt{startrack}$ and COSMIC population synthesis codes, we investigate how\ndifferent supernova mechanisms affect the observable population of SL systems,\nwith particular attention to the mass gap (2$\\mathrm{-}$5 M$_\\odot$) in compact\nobject distributions. We test three supernova remnant formation models with\ndifferent convective growth timescales ($f_{\\rm mix}$ = 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0),\nsimulating SL binary systems across the Galactic disk and bulge. We identify\ndistinct groupings of SL sources based on lens mass and Einstein crossing time,\nclearly differentiating neutron star from black hole systems and close from\nwide orbits. Notably, the delayed $f_{\\rm mix} = 0.5$ model predicts a\nsignificantly higher fraction of systems with lens masses in the mass gap\nregion (up to $\\sim10$ times more for certain surveys), suggesting that SL\nobservations could help constrain this controversial population. Our analysis\nreveals a strong preference for systems with low centre-of-mass velocities\n($v_{\\rm cm}\\leq20$ km/s) across all models, resulting primarily from physical\nprocesses governing compact object formation and binary survival. While many\npotential detections will have limited observational coverage, ZTF is predicted\nto yield several dozen well-covered systems that should enable detailed\ncharacterization. When applying simple detection criteria including photometric\nprecision and signal-to-noise requirements, predicted rates decrease by\napproximately two orders of magnitude, but still yield up to a few tens of\nexpected detections for LSST and ZTF in the Galactic disk population.",

Existing methods,\nhowever, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics,\nparticularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse\nbehaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling\nheterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global\ncontext, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each\nagent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and\ncomplex group-wise interactions (\\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or\npedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of\nagent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme\nand type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced,\ntype-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a\nprincipled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and\nexpressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset,\nHeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for\nkey metrics including Soft mAP and minADE.

    "abstract": "In the modern, fast-moving world of e-commerce, many Android apps face\nchallenges in providing a simple and secure shopping experience. Many of these\napps, often enough, have complicated designs that prevent users from finding\nwhat they want quickly, thus frustrating them and wasting their precious time.\nAnother major issue is that of security; with the limitation of payment options\nand weak authentication mechanisms, users' sensitive information can be\ncompromised. This research presents a new e-commerce platform that responds to\nthe above challenges with an intuitive interface and strong security measures.\nThe platform makes online shopping easy with well-organized categories of\nproducts and a fast, efficient checkout process. It also gives priority to\nsecurity by incorporating features such as Google authentication and\nSSL-secured payment gateways to protect user data and ensure secure\ntransactions. This paper discusses how a focus on user-friendliness, security,\nand personalization steps up the game for e-commerce platforms, providing\nworkable frameworks that match modern user needs and expectations. The findings\nshow the e-commerce user experience can be remodelled by the platform, hence\nopening ways for future developments in that respect.",

This paper extends this hypothesis by\nradically constraining its scope to a single set of just 8 universal filters\nthat depthwise separable convolutional networks inherently converge to. While\nconventional DS-CNNs employ thousands of distinct trained filters, our analysis\nreveals these filters are predominantly linear shifts (ax+b) of our discovered\nuniversal set. Through systematic unsupervised search, we extracted these\nfundamental patterns across different architectures and datasets. Remarkably,\nnetworks initialized with these 8 unique frozen filters achieve over 80%\nImageNet accuracy, and even outperform models with thousands of trainable\nparameters when applied to smaller datasets. The identified master key filters\nclosely match Difference of Gaussians (DoGs), Gaussians, and their derivatives,\nstructures that are not only fundamental to classical image processing but also\nstrikingly similar to receptive fields in mammalian visual systems. Our\nfindings provide compelling evidence that depthwise convolutional layers\nnaturally gravitate toward this fundamental set of spatial operators regardless\nof task or architecture.

    "abstract": "For the dynamic analysis of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) in\nrealistic operating environment, this paper develops a coupled\naero-hydro-mooring-servo model applicable to turbulent wind and irregular sea\nstates with high computational efficiency. A modified rotor control strategy\nwith platform motion feedback is proposed with a novel gain-scheduling\ntechnique to mitigate the negative damping effect on platform motions and\ndecouple the rotor dynamics from the platform dynamics for better rotor\noperating performance. Firstly, the performance for the bottom-fixed wind\nturbine in steady uniform wind is validated and the turbulent wind tests show\nthat using the rotor-disk-averaged wind speed for control is beneficial for\nreducing fluctuations of wind thrust and operational parameters compared with\nusing the hub-height wind speed. For the FOWT, the negative damping phenomenon\nat above-rated wind speeds when using the baseline control is demonstrated\nthrough a range of wind and wave scenarios, and effects of control strategy and\nturbulent wind are investigated. The results indicate that the modified control\nstrategy eliminates the negative damping effect on the platform pitch while\nmaintaining small variations in rotor speed. Though the control including the\nblade pitch compensation from platform motion feedback with a constant gain can\nalso eliminate the negative damping effect, it produces much larger\nfluctuations in rotor speed and causes larger overspeed exceeding the safety\nthreshold of 20% at large wind speeds. Compared to steady wind, turbulent wind\nyields significantly larger low-frequency platform responses and increases the\nmaximum rotor speed by 7.9% to 23.7% for the wind speeds considered.",

    "abstract": "Motion instruction is a crucial task that helps athletes refine their\ntechnique by analyzing movements and providing corrective guidance. Although\nrecent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,\ngenerating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to\nthe highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative\nguidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the\ndifferences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and\nphysical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the\nacquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors\neffectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we\nillustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and\nboxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data.\nExperiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of\ndirections merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information.\nCoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on\nboxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their\ncorresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions. You can find\nCoachMe here: https://motionxperts.github.io/",

    "abstract": "In order to support the real-time interaction with LLMs and the instant\nsearch or the instant recommendation on social media, it becomes an imminent\nproblem to build k-NN graph or indexing graph for the massive number of\nvectorized multimedia data. In such scenarios, the scale of the data or the\nscale of the graph may exceed the processing capacity of a single machine. This\npaper aims to address the graph construction problem of such scale via\nefficient graph merge. For the graph construction on a single node, two generic\nand highly parallelizable algorithms, namely Two-way Merge and Multi-way Merge\nare proposed to merge subgraphs into one. For the graph construction across\nmultiple nodes, a multi-node procedure based on Two-way Merge is presented. The\nprocedure makes it feasible to construct a large-scale k-NN graph/indexing\ngraph on either a single node or multiple nodes when the data size exceeds the\nmemory capacity of one node. Extensive experiments are conducted on both\nlarge-scale k-NN graph and indexing graph construction. For the k-NN graph\nconstruction, the large-scale and high-quality k-NN graphs are constructed by\ngraph merge in parallel. Typically, a billion-scale k-NN graph can be built in\napproximately 17h when only three nodes are employed. For the indexing graph\nconstruction, similar NN search performance as the original indexing graph is\nachieved with the merged indexing graphs while requiring much less time of\nconstruction.",

    "abstract": "The control of robotic systems in complex, shared collaborative workspaces\npresents significant challenges in achieving robust performance and safety when\nlearning from experienced or simulated data is employed in the pipeline. A\nprimary bottleneck is the reliance on coordinate-dependent models, which leads\nto profound data inefficiency by failing to generalize physical interactions\nacross different frames of reference. This forces learning algorithms to\nrediscover fundamental physical principles in every new orientation,\nartificially inflating the complexity of the learning task. This paper\nintroduces a novel framework that synergizes a coordinate-free, unreduced\nmultibody dynamics and kinematics model based on tensor mechanics with a\nData-Assisted Control (DAC) architecture. A non-recursive, closed-form\nNewton-Euler model in an augmented matrix form is derived that is optimized for\ntensor-based control design. This structure enables a principled decomposition\nof the system into a structurally certain, physically grounded part and an\nuncertain, empirical, and interaction-focused part, mediated by a virtual port\nvariable. Then, a complete, end-to-end tensor-invariant pipeline for modeling,\ncontrol, and learning is proposed. The coordinate-free control laws for the\nstructurally certain part provide a stable and abstract command interface,\nproven via Lyapunov analysis. Eventually, the model and closed-loop system are\nvalidated through simulations. This work provides a naturally ideal input for\ndata-efficient, frame-invariant learning algorithms, such as equivariant\nlearning, designed to learn the uncertain interaction. The synergy directly\naddresses the data-inefficiency problem, increases explainability and\ninterpretability, and paves the way for more robust and generalizable robotic\ncontrol in interactive environments.",

    "abstract": "It is anticipated that mass accretion rates exceeding approximately\n$10^{19}\\,{\\rm g\\,s^{-1}}$ in X-ray pulsars lead to radiation-driven outflows\nfrom super-critical accretion discs. The outflows launched from the disc\ninfluence the angular distribution of X-ray radiation, resulting in geometrical\nbeaming. The beaming, in turn, impacts the apparent luminosity of the X-ray\npulsar, detectability of pulsations, and the spectral composition of the X-ray\nflux. We employ a straightforward geometrical model of the outflows, perform\nMonte Carlo simulations, and model the spectra of radiation, reprocessed by the\nwalls of the accretion cavity formed by the outflows. We consider the\nreprocessed emission only; direct pulsar emission is not included in our\nmodelling. Our results demonstrate that the spectra of reprocessed radiation\ndepend on the actual luminosity of the central engine, the geometry of the\noutflows, and the viewing angle - most notably on the latter, through changing\nvisibility of the hotter wall regions near the disc plane. The high-energy part\nof the reprocessed spectrum depends strongly on viewing angle (harder at lower\ninclinations), while the soft flux varies comparatively little with\ninclination. In our model, this contrast is a prediction: variable\nultra-luminous X-ray sources are expected to exhibit strong high-energy angle\nsensitivity together with comparatively modest soft-band variation, naturally\narising if precession modulates the effective inclination.",

The benchmark supports three tasks, including video\nobject segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We\nevaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for\nsegmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess\nmodel performance in industrial contexts.

To\ntest this hypothesis, this study uses a new framework developed in\n\\textsc{ZEUS3D}, a multiphysics magnetohydrodynamics code. The results of this\nwork show that when a time-varying stellar wind is at its maximum brightness,\nthe polarization signal is at a minimum due to the wind structure and a dense,\nsymmetric shell that forms around the star. Conversely, when the brightness is\nat a minimum, the symmetric shell around the star is much less dense, and the\npolarization is instead dominated by the asymmetric bow shock structure,\ncausing the polarization signal to attain a maximum value.

We\nprovide convergence guarantees and show that our method is capable of computing\nan $\\epsilon$-stationary point for smooth, nonconvex functions at a rate\n$\\mathcal{O} (\\epsilon^{-1})$, in line with existing results for two-point\ngradient-free methods for static optimization. Simulation results validate the\nfindings.",

The\nDurgapal-Banerjee transformation is employed to obtain the relativistic\ninterior solution using the MIT Bag model equation of state (EoS): $P =\n\\frac{1}{3}(\\rho - 4 B_{g})$. For a linear form of $f(Q)$ gravity, we obtain\nthe exterior vacuum solution, which reduces to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter\n(SdS) solution with the cosmological constant term, $\\Lambda =\n\\frac{\\phi}{2\\alpha}$. The stellar model is analyzed for the different values\nof the spheroidicity parameter ($\\mu$). The value of $\\alpha$ is constrained\nusing a viable physical limit on the Bag parameter ($B_{g} \\in\n[57.55,95.11]\\,MeV\\,fm^{-3}$). The constraints on Mass-Radius relation\nindicates that physically acceptable SS models are permitted for $\\mu \\geq 7$.\nThe contribution of $\\mu$ to the energy density, pressure profiles, and other\nphysical features is studied for the SS candidate EXO 1745-248. The stability\nof the stellar model obtained here is also analyzed through causality\ncondition, adiabatic index and other stability criteria.

    "abstract": "This paper formulates the Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) problem,\nintroduces a corresponding benchmark, and proposes a system to tackle the\nproblem. Classical Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is typically formulated as\nanswering one single question by actively exploring a 3D environment. Real\ndeployments, however, often demand handling multiple questions that may arrive\nasynchronously and carry different urgencies. We formalize this setting as\nEmbodied Questions Answering (EQsA) and present ParaEQsA, a framework for\nparallel, urgency-aware scheduling and answering. ParaEQsA leverages a group\nmemory module shared among questions to reduce redundant exploration, and a\npriority-planning module to dynamically schedule questions. To evaluate this\nsetting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs)\nbenchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in\ntotal), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels. We\nfurther propose metrics for EQsA performance: Direct Answer Rate (DAR), and\nNormalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL), which jointly measure efficiency\nand responsiveness of this system. ParaEQsA consistently outperforms strong\nsequential baselines adapted from recent EQA systems, while reducing\nexploration and delay. Empirical evaluations investigate the relative\ncontributions of priority, urgency modeling, spatial scope, reward estimation,\nand dependency reasoning within our framework. Together, these results\ndemonstrate that urgency-aware, parallel scheduling is key to making embodied\nagents responsive and efficient under realistic, multi-question workloads.",

This\ndesign avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while\npreserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for\nvisually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the\nsmooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a\ndistributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain\ntraining accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators.\nMindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase,\nmultitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually\nenhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal\npre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction\ntuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism\ntechniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further\nboost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search\nand model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training\ndata required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL\nin evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table\ncomprehension.

    "abstract": "Erasure of the binary memory, 0 or 1, is an essential step for digital\ncomputation as it involves irreversible logic operations. In the classical\ncase, the erasure of a bit of memory is accompanied by the evolution of a\nminimum amount of heat set by the Landauer bound kTln2, which can be achieved\nin the asymptotic limit. However, the erasure of memory needs to be completed\nwithin a finite time for practical and effective computational processes. It is\nobserved that the higher the speed of erasure, the greater the amount of heat\nreleased, which leads to unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, this\nis a fundamental challenge to reduce the evolved heat related to finite-time\nmemory erasure. In the present work, we address this crucial aspect in the\nfield of information thermodynamics, where the two memory states correspond to\nthe two wells of a bistable potential, as in the conventional cases. However,\nthe potential is asymmetric in terms of the width of the two wells. Moreover,\nthe two memory states are separated by a barrier that is asymmetric in\nstructure. We examine in detail the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the\nsuccess rate of the erasure process and the work done or heat released\nassociated with it. We find that the asymmetry in the potential barrier\npartitioning the two memory states plays a very significant role in improving\nthe efficiency of the erasure process, in view of the success rate and the\nthermodynamic costs.",

Current 2D-based methods for retinal vessel (RV)\nsegmentation offer insufficient accuracy. To address this, we propose RVMamba,\na novel architecture integrating multiple feature extraction modules with the\nMamba state-space model.

To simultaneously\nimprove the segmentation of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and mitigate this\nimbalance, we introduce FAZMamba and a unified Joint-OCTAMamba framework.\nExperimental results on the OCTA-500 dataset demonstrate that Joint-OCTAMamba\noutperforms existing models across evaluation metrics.The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/lc-sfis/Joint-OCTAMamba.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in mental health and other\nsensitive domains raises urgent questions about ethical reasoning, fairness,\nand responsible alignment. Yet, existing benchmarks for moral and clinical\ndecision-making do not adequately capture the unique ethical dilemmas\nencountered in mental health practice, where confidentiality, autonomy,\nbeneficence, and bias frequently intersect. To address this gap, we introduce\nEthical Reasoning in Mental Health (EthicsMH), a pilot dataset of 125 scenarios\ndesigned to evaluate how AI systems navigate ethically charged situations in\ntherapeutic and psychiatric contexts. Each scenario is enriched with structured\nfields, including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected\nmodel behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. This\nstructure enables evaluation not only of decision accuracy but also of\nexplanation quality and alignment with professional norms. Although modest in\nscale and developed with model-assisted generation, EthicsMH establishes a task\nframework that bridges AI ethics and mental health decision-making. By\nreleasing this dataset, we aim to provide a seed resource that can be expanded\nthrough community and expert contributions, fostering the development of AI\nsystems capable of responsibly handling some of society's most delicate\ndecisions.",

In this paper, we highlight\nseveral often-overlooked properties of these models by analyzing their\ncosmological perturbations. We show that a non-minimal coupling to gravity is\nessential for the stability of the setup. However, avoiding propagation of a\nghost mode then requires imposing a relation between the coupling coefficients,\nknown as the degeneracy condition, which reduces the bumblebee model to a\nsubset of generalized Proca theories with a marginal non-minimal operator. By\nimposing the degeneracy condition, the vector field becomes non-dynamical at\nthe background level, and the form of its potential is completely fixed in\nvacuum. We show that the vacuum expectation value of the vector field can drive\na de Sitter solution, for which the effects of the non-minimal coupling are\nnegligible at the background level but provide essential order-one corrections\nto the sound speed of the scalar mode, keeping the setup weakly coupled at the\nlevel of perturbations. Treating this stealth de Sitter solution as a dark\nenergy candidate, we study its coupling to matter and find the effective\ngravitational coupling for the matter density contrast in the quasi-static\nregime. At the level of perturbations, the system behaves differently from\n$\\Lambda$CDM, providing a potential observational signature to distinguish the\ntwo models.",

Thirty-six adults (18-45 years) viewed each hue in a\nwithin-subject design while pupil diameter and skin conductance were recorded\ncontinuously, and self-reported emotions were assessed using the\nSelf-Assessment Manikin across pleasure, arousal, and dominance.\nRepeated-measures ANOVAs revealed robust hue effects on all three self-report\ndimensions and on pupil dilation, with medium to large effect sizes. Reds and\nred-purple hues elicited the highest arousal and dominance, whereas blue-green\nhues were rated most pleasurable. Pupil dilation closely tracked arousal\nratings, while skin conductance showed no reliable hue differentiation, likely\ndue to the brief (30 s) exposures. Individual differences in cognitive style\nand personality modulated overall reactivity but did not alter the relative\nranking of hues.

The TALSC\nframework incorporates a sample confidence module (SCM) as meta-learner and the\nsemantic coding networks as learners. The learners are updated based on the\nempirical knowledge provided by the learnable weighted-KB (LW-KB). Meanwhile,\nthe meta-learner evaluates the significance of samples according to the task\nloss feedback, and adjusts the update strategy of learners to enhance the\nrobustness in semantic recovery for unknown tasks. To strike a balance between\nSCM parameters and precision of significance evaluation, we design an SCM-grid\nextension (SCM-GE) approach by embedding the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN)\nwithin SCM, which leverages the concept of spline refinement in KAN and enables\nscalable SCM with customizable granularity without retraining.

However, existing approaches struggle with\nscalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving\ntraffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight\nand scalable framework for real-time anomaly detection in streaming edge data.\nOur method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch\nusing Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns\nwith bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues. We incorporate\nBayesian inference for probabilistic anomaly scoring and apply Exponentially\nWeighted Moving Average (EWMA) for adaptive thresholding tuned to burst\nintensity. Extensive experiments on four real-world intrusion detection\ndatasets demonstrate that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines such as ANOEDGE-G/L, MIDAS-R, and F-FADE, achieving up to 6.5% AUC\ngain on CIC-IDS2018 and up to 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, while processing 20\nmillion edges in under 3.4 seconds using only 10 hash functions.

Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their\nthought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to\nprovide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety\nAlignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason\nthrough direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety\ncapability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks.\nNotably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning\ncapabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval.

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based robotic assembly assistance has gained\nsignificant research attention. It requires the injection of domain-specific\nknowledge to guide the assembly process through natural language interaction\nwith humans. Despite some progress, existing methods represent knowledge in the\nform of natural language text. Due to the long context and redundant content,\nthey struggle to meet the robots' requirements for real-time and precise\nreasoning. In order to bridge this gap, we present AssemMate, which utilizes\nthe graph\\textemdash a concise and accurate form of knowledge\nrepresentation\\textemdash as input. This graph-based LLM enables knowledge\ngraph question answering (KGQA), supporting human-robot interaction and\nassembly task planning for specific products. Beyond interactive QA, AssemMate\nalso supports sensing stacked scenes and executing grasping to assist with\nassembly. Specifically, a self-supervised Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)\nencodes knowledge graph entities and relations into a latent space and aligns\nthem with LLM's representation, enabling the LLM to understand graph\ninformation. In addition, a vision-enhanced strategy is employed to address\nstacked scenes in grasping. Through training and evaluation, AssemMate\noutperforms existing methods, achieving 6.4\\% higher accuracy, 3 times faster\ninference, and 28 times shorter context length, while demonstrating strong\ngeneralization ability on random graphs.

Traditional vessel detection\nmethods, such as synthetic aperture radar, video surveillance, and\nmultispectral satellite imagery, face limitations in real-time processing,\nadverse weather conditions, and coverage range. This paper explores Distributed\nAcoustic Sensing (DAS) as an alternative by repurposing submarine\ntelecommunication cables as large-scale acoustic sensor arrays.

Advanced machine learning\nmodels are applied to improve detection and localization accuracy in dynamic\nmaritime environments. The approach is evaluated over a continuous ten-day\nperiod, covering diverse ship and operational conditions, representing one of\nthe largest-scale DAS-based vessel monitoring studies to date, and for which we\nrelease the full evaluation dataset.

In this work, the aim is to analyze the surface and orbital dynamics of\ncomet 67P in detail, using a suitable 3-D polyhedral shape model. We applied\nthe polyhedron method to calculate dynamic surface characteristics, including\ngeometric height, surface tilt, surface slopes, geopotential surface,\nacceleration surface, escape speed, equilibrium points, and zero-velocity\ncurves. The results show that the gravitational potential is predominant on the\ncomet's surface due to its slow rotation. The escape speed has the maximum\nvalue in the Hapi region (the comet's neck). The surface slopes were analyzed\nto predict possible regions of particle motion and accumulation. The results\nshow that most regions of the comet's surface have low slopes. Furthermore, we\nanalyzed the slopes under the effects of Third-Body gravitational and Solar\nRadiation Pressure perturbations. Our results showed that the effects of\nThird-Body perturbations do not significantly affect the global behavior of\nslopes. Meanwhile, the Solar Radiation Pressure does not significantly affect\nparticles across the surface of comet 67P with sizes $>\\sim10^{-3}$\\,cm at\napocenter and $>\\sim10^{-1}$\\,cm at pericenter. We also identified four\nequilibrium points around comet 67P and one equilibrium point inside the body,\nwhere points E$_2$ and E$_5$ are linearly stable.

    "abstract": "Frictional sliding contact in hydrodynamic environments can be found in a\nrange of engineering applications. Accurate modeling requires an integrated\nnumerical framework capable of resolving large relative motions, multiphase\ninteractions, and nonlinear contact responses. Building on our previously\ndeveloped fully Eulerian fluid structure formulation, we introduce a phase\nfield based formulation for dynamic frictional contact in 3D. Contact detection\nis achieved via the overlap of diffuse interfaces of colliding solids. The\nnormal contact response is defined as a volumetric body force proportional to\nthe overlap parameter, while the tangential response is computed using the\nCoulomb friction model. The direction of the friction forces are derived by\nprojecting phase-averaged relative velocities onto the local tangent plane of\ncolliding bodies. This proposed unified treatment enables the computation of\nboth normal and frictional forces within a single momentum balance equation,\navoiding separate velocity fields for individual solids. We present several\ntest cases with increasing complexity to verify and demonstrate our proposed\nfrictional contact model. Verification against the Hertzian contact problem\nshows excellent agreement with the analytical solution, with errors below $3\\%$\nin the traction profile. In the sliding block benchmark, the computed\ndisplacement profiles closely follow the analytical solution for point-mass\nsystems across multiple friction coefficients. The ironing problem demonstrates\nstable force predictions under finite deformation, with normal and tangential\nforces matching kinetic friction laws. The robustness and scalability of the\nproposed formulation are further demonstrated through a representative ship ice\ninteraction scenario with free surface and frictional sliding effects.",

    "abstract": "Entity-level sentiment classification involves identifying the sentiment\npolarity linked to specific entities within text. This task poses several\nchallenges: effectively modeling the subtle and complex interactions between\nentities and their surrounding sentiment expressions; capturing dependencies\nthat may span across sentences; and ensuring consistent sentiment predictions\nfor multiple mentions of the same entity through coreference resolution.\nAdditionally, linguistic phenomena such as negation, ambiguity, and overlapping\nopinions further complicate the analysis. These complexities make entity-level\nsentiment classification a difficult problem, especially in real-world, noisy\ntextual data. To address these issues, we propose SpanEIT, a novel framework\nintegrating dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory mechanisms for\nenhanced entity-sentiment relational modeling. SpanEIT builds span-based\nrepresentations for entities and candidate sentiment phrases, employs\nbidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, and uses a graph\nattention network to capture syntactic and co-occurrence relations. A\ncoreference-aware memory module ensures entity-level consistency across\ndocuments. Experiments on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets show SpanEIT\noutperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines in accuracy and\nF1 scores. Ablation and interpretability analyses validate the effectiveness of\nour approach, underscoring its potential for fine-grained sentiment analysis in\napplications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.",

Kida et al.\\ introduced collage systems [Theor. Comput. Sci.,\n2003] to generalize SLPs by adding repetition rules and truncation rules. The\nsmallest size $c(T)$ of collage systems for $T$ has gained attention to see how\nthese generalized rules improve the compression ability of SLPs. Navarro et al.\n[IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2021] showed that $c(T) \\in O(z(T))$ and there is a\nstring family with $c(T) \\in \\Omega(b(T) \\log |T|)$, where $z(T)$ is the number\nof Lempel-Ziv parsing of $T$ and $b(T)$ is the smallest size of bidirectional\nschemes for $T$. They also introduced a subclass of collage systems, called\ninternal collage systems, and proved that its smallest size $\\hat{c}(T)$ for\n$T$ is at least $b(T)$. While $c(T) \\le \\hat{c}(T)$ is obvious, it is unknown\nhow large $\\hat{c}(T)$ is compared to $c(T)$. In this paper, we prove that\n$\\hat{c}(T) = \\Theta(c(T))$ by showing that any collage system of size $m$ can\nbe transformed into an internal collage system of size $O(m)$ in $O(m^2)$ time.\nThanks to this result, we can focus on internal collage systems to study the\nasymptotic behavior of $c(T)$, which helps to suppress excess use of truncation\nrules. As a direct application, we get $b(T) = O(c(T))$, which answers an open\nquestion posed in [Navarro et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2021].

A\nlearnable gating network dynamically assigns weights to experts based on the\ninput sample and computes a weighted fusion of their outputs. Furthermore, a\nhybrid regularization loss function ensures stable training and addresses the\ncommon issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale\nnetwork intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017/2018) validate DAPNet's higher\naccuracy for its target application.

While large language models\n(LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work\nreveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful - serving more as\nplausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to\ncombine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved\nreliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with\ndynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional\ntransitions.\n  In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a\nneuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support\nproperty verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal\nspecifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation,\nwe introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic\nprocedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and\ninterpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes\nclosed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its\nperformance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to\ncontextualize its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "A radio map captures the spatial distribution of wireless channel parameters,\nsuch as the strength of the signal received, across a geographic area. The\nproblem of fine-grained three-dimensional (3D) radio map estimation involves\ninferring a high-resolution radio map for the two-dimensional (2D) area at an\narbitrary target height within a 3D region of interest, using radio samples\ncollected by sensors sparsely distributed in that 3D region. Solutions to the\nproblem are crucial for efficient spectrum management in 3D spaces,\nparticularly for drones in the rapidly developing low-altitude economy.\nHowever, this problem is challenging due to ultra-sparse sampling, where the\nnumber of collected radio samples is far fewer than the desired resolution of\nthe radio map to be estimated. In this paper, we design a Large Artificial\nIntelligence Model (LAM) called RadioLAM for the problem. RadioLAM employs the\ncreative power and the strong generalization capability of LAM to address the\nultra-sparse sampling challenge. It consists of three key blocks: 1) an\naugmentation block, using the radio propagation model to project the radio\nsamples collected at different heights to the 2D area at the target height; 2)\na generation block, leveraging an LAM under an Mixture of Experts (MoE)\narchitecture to generate a candidate set of fine-grained radio maps for the\ntarget 2D area; and 3) an election block, utilizing the radio propagation model\nas a guide to find the best map from the candidate set. Extensive simulations\nshow that RadioLAM is able to solve the fine-grained 3D radio map estimation\nproblem efficiently from an ultra-low sampling rate of 0.1%, and significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art.",

Ensuring the reliability of LLMs'\noutputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as\nfinance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination\ndetection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics.\nLeveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of\nLLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the\nsemantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic\ndepth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we\npropose \\textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)},\na training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1)\n\\textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of\ntoken representations within each layer; and (2) \\textbf{Inter-Layer Drift},\nwhich tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across\nlayers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather\nthan noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention\nsignals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of\nrepresentation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and\nlightweight proxy for hallucination detection.

Here, we report a previously unidentified asymmetric\n(1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO2(100) surface, discovered through an\nintegrated approach that combines global structure search algorithms, machine\nlearning-based atomic potential models, density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations, and in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The\nreconstructed surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically stable,\ncharacterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions, increased\ninterlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. Importantly, the\nformation of localized Ce3+ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that\nstrongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, resulting in new occupied\nelectronic states below the Fermi level. This orbital hybridization activates\nthe O 2p states, enhances their electron-donating capacity, and facilitates the\ndissociation of adsorbed molecules such as H2O. These findings reveal a\nfundamental orbital-mediated mechanism by which surface reconstruction governs\nelectronic structure and reactivity, offering critical insights and a new\ndesign strategy for tuning catalytic performance on polar oxide surfaces.",

In this work, we used optical data cubes of a\nsubsample of nearby galaxies of the DIVING 3D survey. These allowed us to\nanalyze the scaling relations involving stellar velocity dispersion, stellar\npopulation age, and stellar population metallicity at the nuclear and\ncircumnuclear regions of galaxies. We detected correlations between the stellar\nvelocity dispersion and the age, metallicity, and total stellar mass. These\ncorrelations are independent of galaxy inclinations, considering all\nmorphological types, nuclear activity, and the presence or absence of galactic\nbars. We detected, for the first time, a correlation between the stellar\nvelocity dispersion and stellar metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies.\nIt is found to be qualitatively consistent with the well-known stellar\nmass-metallicity relation. We also noted that barred galaxies tend to show\nyounger and less metal-rich stellar populations than unbarred galaxies in the\ncentral regions, which may be a consequence of the bar triggering star\nformation in the nuclear regions of these objects. Some active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) in our sample are positioned above the observed correlation between\nstellar velocity dispersion and stellar population age, suggesting that their\nnuclear stellar populations are younger than expected.

Exposure to air pollutants such as PM$_{10}$ $\\mu$m,\nNO$_2$, and SO$_2$ has been associated with the worsening of these diseases,\nespecially in urban areas. This study evaluated the association between the\ndaily concentration of these pollutants and daily hospitalizations for acute\nmyocardial infarction and cerebrovascular diseases in S\\~ao Paulo (2010-2019),\nusing generalized additive models with a lag of 0 to 4 days. Two approaches for\nchoosing the degrees of freedom in temporal smoothing were compared: based on\npollutant prediction and based on outcome prediction (hospitalizations). Data\nwere obtained from official government databases. The modeling used the\nquasi-Poisson family in R software (v. 4.4.0). Models with exposure-based\nsmoothing generated more consistent estimates. For PM10{\\mu}m, the cumulative\nrisk estimate for exposure was 1.08%, while for hospitalization, it was 1.20%.\nFor NO$_2$, the estimated risk was 1.47% (exposure) versus 1.33%\n(hospitalization).

The results show that smoothing based on outcome prediction can\ngenerate bias, masking the true effect of pollutants. The appropriate choice of\ndf in the smoothing function is crucial.

In particular, the\nspontaneous dynamics in neuronal circuit is known to operate near a highly\nvariable critical state, which intuitively contrasts with the requirement of\nreliable representation. It is intriguing to understand how reliable\nrepresentation could be maintained or even enhanced by critical spontaneous\nstates. We firstly examined the co-existence of the scale-free avalanche in the\nspontaneous activity of mouse visual cortex with restricted representational\ngeometry manifesting representational reliability amid the representational\ndrift with respect to the visual stimulus. To explore how critical spontaneous\nstate influences the neural representation, we built an excitation-inhibition\nnetwork with homeostatic plasticity, which self-organizes to the critical\nspontaneous state. This model successfully reproduced both representational\ndrift and restricted representational geometry observed experimentally, in\ncontrast with randomly shuffled plasticity which causes accumulated drift of\nrepresentational geometry. We further showed that the self-organized critical\nstate enhances the cross-session low-dimensional representation, comparing to\nthe non-critical state, by restricting the synapse weight into a low variation\nspace. Our findings suggest that spontaneous self-organized criticality serves\nnot only as a ubiquitous property of neural systems but also as a functional\nmechanism for maintaining reliable information representation under\ncontinuously changing networks, providing a potential explanation how the brain\nmaintains consistent perception and behavior despite ongoing synaptic rewiring.",

    "abstract": "A method for approximating sixth-order ordinary differential equations is\nproposed, which utilizes a deep learning feedforward artificial neural network,\nreferred to as a neural solver. The efficacy of this unsupervised machine\nlearning method is demonstrated through the solution of two distinct boundary\nvalue problems (BVPs), with the method being extended to include the solution\nof a sixth-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). The proposed mean\nsquared loss function is comprised of two terms: the differential equation is\nsatisfied by the first term, while the initial or boundary conditions are\nsatisfied by the second. The total loss function is minimized using a\nquasi-Newton optimization method to obtain the desired network output. The\napproximation capability of the proposed method is verified for sixth-order\nODEs. Point-wise comparisons of the approximations show strong agreement with\navailable exact solutions. The proposed algorithm minimizes the overall\nlearnable network hyperparameters in a given BVP. Simple minimization of the\ntotal loss function yields highly accurate results even with a low number of\nepochs. Therefore, the proposed framework offers an attractive setting for the\ncomputational mathematics community.",

To\naddress these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via\nreasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP\nestablishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct\nsum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes\nlinguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these\nsubspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its\nparameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are\nobtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the\nreasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input\nfeatures for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP\nreduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original,\nfilters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness.

Fully sighted individuals typically adopt consistent\nscanning strategies, whereas those with visual impairments rely on\nheterogeneous adaptations shaped by residual vision and experience.\n  Methods: We conducted a comparative eye-tracking study of fully sighted, low\nvision, blind, and fully blind participants navigating outdoor routes. Using a\nwearable eye tracker, we quantified fixation counts, fixation rate, fixation\narea, direction, peak fixation location, and walking speed.\n  Results: Walking speed declined systematically with worsening vision.\nFixation count increased with greater impairment, reflecting slower travel\ntimes and more frequent sampling. Fixation rate rose with worsening vision,\nthough between-group differences were generally not significant between most\ngroups. Fixation spatial coverage decreased along the continuum of vision loss.\nFixation patterns were most consistent in the fully sighted group. Peak\nfixation locations were centered in fully sighted participants but shifted\noutward and became more variable with impairment.\n  Conclusion: Gaze strategies during navigation form a graded continuum across\nvision groups, with fully sighted and fully blind participants at opposite\npoles and low vision and blind groups spanning the middle. Visual acuity alone\ndoes not predict functional gaze use, as rehabilitation experience and adaptive\nstrategies strongly shape behavior. These findings highlight the need for\npersonalized rehabilitation and assistive technologies, with residual gaze\npatterns offering insight into mobility capacity and training opportunities for\nsafer navigation.",

These problems can have millions of constraints, such as when\nlaying out transistors on a circuit, or trying to optimize traffic light\ntimings, making fast sparse solvers extremely important. However, existing\nstate-of-the-art software-level solutions for solving sparse linear systems,\ntermed iterative solvers, are extremely inefficient on current hardware. This\ninefficiency can be attributed to two key reasons: (1) poor short-term data\nreuse, which causes frequent, irregular memory accesses, and (2) complex data\ndependencies, which limit parallelism. Hence, in this paper, we present an FPGA\nimplementation of the existing Azul accelerator, an SRAM-only hardware\naccelerator that achieves both high memory bandwidth utilization and arithmetic\nintensity. Azul features a grid of tiles, each of which is composed of a\nprocessing element (PE) and a small independent SRAM memory, which are all\nconnected over a network on chip (NoC). We implement Azul on FPGA using simple\nRISC-V CPU cores connected to a memory hierarchy of different FPGA memory\nmodules. We utilize custom RISC-V ISA augmentations to implement a task-based\nprogramming model for the various PEs, allowing communication over the NoC.\nFinally, we design simple distributed test cases so that we can functionally\nverify the FPGA implementation, verifying equivalent performance to an\narchitectural simulation of the Azul framework.",

By exploiting the graphical structure linking factors, asset\nprices, and views, we derive closed-form expressions for the dynamics of the\nfactor and price processes after conditioning on the views.

    "abstract": "Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has\nopened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue\ncomprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance\nLearning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via\nattention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify\ninstances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that\nhard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.\nApplying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework\nwith masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure\nwith a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a\nclass-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask\nsalient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student\nmodel. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale\nrandom masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of\nlosing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an\nexponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent\ntraining iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer\ndiagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate\nthat MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and\nefficiency.

While Adversarial Training (AT\n) is a widely adopted defense mechanism to enhance robustness, it often incurs\na trade-off by degrading performance on unperturbed, natural data. Recent\nefforts have highlighted that larger models exhibit enhanced robustness over\ntheir smaller counterparts. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that such\nrobustness can be systematically distilled from large teacher models into\ncompact student models. To achieve better performance, we introduce Dice\nAdversarial Robustness Distillation (DARD), a novel method designed to transfer\nrobustness through a tailored knowledge distillation paradigm.

Towards this, we introduce Light Latent-space Decoding (L2D), an\neffective and efficient latent-space decoding method.

    "abstract": "The application of language models to project-level vulnerability detection\nremains challenging, owing to the dual requirement of accurately localizing\nsecurity-sensitive code and correctly correlating and reasoning over complex\nprogram context. We present VulAgent, a multi-agent vulnerability detection\nframework based on hypothesis validation. Our design is inspired by how human\nauditors review code: when noticing a sensitive operation, they form a\nhypothesis about a possible vulnerability, consider potential trigger paths,\nand then verify the hypothesis against the surrounding context. VulAgent\nimplements a semantics-sensitive, multi-view detection pipeline: specialized\nagents, each aligned to a specific analysis perspective (e.g., memory,\nauthorization), collaboratively surface and precisely localize sensitive code\nsites with higher coverage. Building on this, VulAgent adopts a\nhypothesis-validation paradigm: for each vulnerability report, it builds\nhypothesis conditions and a trigger path, steering the LLM to target the\nrelevant program context and defensive checks during verification, which\nreduces false positives. On average across the two datasets, VulAgent improves\noverall accuracy by 6.6%, increases the correct identification rate of\nvulnerable--fixed code pairs by up to 450% (246% on average), and reduces the\nfalse positive rate by about 36% compared with state-of-the-art LLM-based\nbaselines.",

STCF holds great potential to address\nfundamental questions such as the essence of color confinement and the\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe in the next decades. The main\ndesign goals of STCF are with a center-of-mass energy ranging from 2 to 7 GeV\nand a peak luminosity surpassing 5*10^34 cm^-2s^-1 that is optimized at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 4 GeV, which is about 50 times that of the currently\noperating Tau-Charm factory - BEPCII. The STCF accelerator is composed of two\nmain parts: a double-ring collider with the crab-waist collision scheme and an\ninjector that provides top-up injections for both electron and positron beams.\nAs a typical third-generation electron-positron circular collider, the STCF\naccelerator faces many challenges in both accelerator physics and technology.\nIn this paper, the conceptual design of the STCF accelerator complex is\npresented, including the ongoing efforts and plans for technological R&D, as\nwell as the required infrastructure.

    "abstract": "Inference latency and trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the\nbottlenecks in deploying them in critical applications like sensitive tasks.\nEarly Exit (EE) DNNs overcome the latency issues by allowing samples to exit\nfrom intermediary layers if they attain `high' confidence scores on the\npredicted class. However, the DNNs are known to exhibit overconfidence, which\ncan lead to many samples exiting early and render EE strategies untrustworthy.\nWe use Selective Prediction (SP) to overcome this issue by checking the\n`hardness' of the samples rather than just relying on the confidence score\nalone. We propose SPEED, a novel approach that uses Deferral Classifiers (DCs)\nat each layer to check the hardness of samples before performing EEs.\nSpecifically, the DCs identify if a sample is hard to predict at an\nintermediary layer, leading to hallucination, and defer it to an expert. Early\ndetection of hard samples for inference prevents the wastage of computational\nresources and improves trust by deferring the hard samples to the expert. We\ndemonstrate that EE aided with SP improves both accuracy and latency. Our\nmethod minimizes the risk of wrong prediction by $50\\%$ with a speedup of\n$2.05\\times$ as compared to the final layer.

However, the extent to which\nthis high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from\na Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as\nLLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a\ndataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians\npursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate\nand compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the\nfine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice\nquestion-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12\nmedical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including\nmedgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific\nprompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient\nfine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it\nutilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS:\nmedgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of\ncorrect answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion\nparameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results\n<50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all\nLLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters\nacross various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and\nresearch that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those\nexhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties\nshould utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.",

To address this, we investigate two approaches: one based\non attention weights and another leveraging the more interpretable integrated\ngradients method, both designed to measure the influence of context tokens on\nthe target token and to rank candidates by incorporating semantic similarity\nbetween the original and substituted sentences. Experiments on the LS07 and\nSWORDS datasets demonstrate that both approaches improve ranking performance.",

    "abstract": "The collaborative efforts of large communities in science experiments, often\ncomprising thousands of global members, reflect a monumental commitment to\nexploration and discovery. Recently, advanced and complex data processing has\ngained increasing importance in science experiments. Data processing workflows\ntypically consist of multiple intricate steps, and the precise specification of\nresource requirements is crucial for each step to allocate optimal resources\nfor effective processing. Estimating resource requirements in advance is\nchallenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels\namong community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing\noptions. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially\nprocessing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from\nactual processing profiles before completing the entire step. While this\ntwo-staged approach enables processing on optimal resources for most of the\nworkflow, it has drawbacks such as initial inaccuracies leading to potential\nfailures and suboptimal resource usage, along with overhead from waiting for\ninitial processing completion, which is critical for fast-turnaround analyses.\nIn this context, our study introduces a novel pipeline of machine learning\nmodels within a comprehensive workflow management system, the Production and\nDistributed Analysis (PanDA) system. These models employ advanced machine\nlearning techniques to predict key resource requirements, overcoming challenges\nposed by limited upfront knowledge of characteristics at each step. Accurate\nforecasts of resource requirements enable informed and proactive\ndecision-making in workflow management, enhancing the efficiency of handling\ndiverse, complex workflows across heterogeneous resources.",

To that end, an effective topology for\ndoing so was developed, characterized, and demonstrated, requiring the ability\nto de-modulate incoming signals from the AM radio band--spanning from 530 kHz\nto 1700 kHz--and re-modulate these signals into the FM radio band--spanning\nfrom 88 MHz to 108 MHz.

Yet, most these\nsystems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of\nmanaging multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating\ncomplicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on\nadministration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large\nlanguage model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding\nand computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with\noperating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing\nagents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an\nabstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language\ninto machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a\nmore domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical\nguidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and\ncompliance. To address this need, we present \\textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified\nagent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract\nlayer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital\nhealthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam\nmanagement, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped\nas off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP,\nLinux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22\nspecialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically\nsound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and\nmedication recommendations.

Here, $z = {\\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t =\n{\\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the\ntemperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic\nfield-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical\nvalues $h \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $T > 0$, and $J \\in \\mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \\in\n(0,\\infty)$ and $z \\in (0,\\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \\in (0,\\infty)$ and\nfixed $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how\nthey accumulate on the ray $(0,\\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n\n\\rightarrow \\infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J > 0$ or equivalently $t \\in\n(0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\\infty)$\nwhich we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J <\n0$ or equivalently $t \\in (1,\\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to\nfinitely many points of $(0,\\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit\nformulae.

    "abstract": "We investigated microlensing events detected by the OGLE and KMTNet surveys\nduring the 2024 observing season, focusing on those that exhibit very complex\nanomaly features. Through this analysis, we found that the light curves of\nthree events including OGLE-2024-BLG-0657, KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and\nKMT-2024-BLG-2480 cannot be readily interpreted using standard three-body\nlensing models such as a binary lens with a single source (2L1S) or a single\nlens with a binary source (1L2S). In this work we present detailed analyses of\nthese events to uncover the nature of their anomalous features. An initial\nanalysis using 2L1S modeling of the light curves showed that while it was\ndifficult to simultaneously explain all of the multiple anomaly features, the\nmain anomaly feature could be accounted for. Based on this model, we conducted\nfour-body modeling that includes an additional lens or source. Through this\napproach, we found that the complex anomalies observed in the three events\ncould be explained by a 2L2S model, in which both the lens and the source are\nbinaries. Analysis of the color and magnitude revealed that the source is a\nbinary system consisting of G- and K-type main sequence stars for\nOGLE-2024-BLG-0657, two K-type main sequence stars for KMT-2024-BLG-2017, and a\nK-type star with an early G-type main sequence companion for KMT-2024-BLG-2480.\nA Bayesian analysis incorporating constraints from the lensing observables\nindicates that the lenses in KMT-2024-BLG-2017 and KMT-2024-BLG-2480 are likely\nbinary systems of low-mass stars located in the Galactic bulge, whereas the\nlens system OGLE-2024-BLG-0657L is likely a binary composed of two stellar\nremnants situated in the Galactic disk.",

Conventional correction strategies typically approximate the medium\nas one or a few discrete layers. While effective in the presence of dominant\nscattering layers, these approaches break down in thick, volumetric tissues,\nwhere accurate modeling would require an impractically large number of layers.\nTo address this challenge, we introduce an inverse-scattering framework that\nrepresents the entire volume as a superposition of angular deflectors, each\ncorresponding to scattering at a specific angle. This angular formulation is\nparticularly well suited to biological tissues, where narrow angular spread due\nto the dominant forward scattering allow most multiple scattering to be\ncaptured with relatively few components. Within this framework, we solve the\ninverse problem by progressively incorporating contributions from small to\nlarge deflection angles. Applied to simulations and in vivo reflection-mode\nimaging through intact mouse skull, our method reconstructs up to 121 angular\ncomponents, converting ~80% of multiply scattered light into signal. This\nenables non-invasive visualization of osteocytes in the skull that remain\ninaccessible to existing layer-based methods. These results establish the\nscattering-angle basis as a deterministic framework for imaging through complex\nmedia, paving the way for high-resolution microscopy deep inside living\ntissues.",

Within EPED, the KBM constraint is usually approximated by the\nideal ballooning mode (IBM) stability threshold. It has been noted that\nquantitative differences between local ideal MHD and gyro-kinetic (GK)\nballooning stability can be larger at low aspect ratio. KBM critical pedestals\nare consistent with observation in initial studies on conventional and\nspherical tokamaks. In this work, the application of a reduced model for the\ncalculation of the kinetic ballooning stability boundary is presented based on\na novel and newly developed Gyro-Fluid System (GFS) code [G.M. Staebler et al\n2023 Phys. Plasmas 30 102501]. GFS is observed to capture KBMs in DIII-D as\nwell as the NSTX(-U) pedestals, opening the route for the integration of this\nmodel into EPED. Finally, high-n global ballooning modes are observed to limit\nlocal 2nd stability access and thus provide a transport mechanism that\nconstrains the width evolution with beta_p,ped. The high-n global ballooning\nstability is approximated by its ideal MHD analogue using ELITE. It is shown\nthat nearly local high-n with k_y*rho_s~1/2 modes can provide a proxy for the\ncritical beta_p,ped when 2nd stable access exists on DIII-D plasmas. The use of\nGFS and ELITE scaling in EPED provided improved agreement in comparison to\nEPED1 with DIII-D pedestal data.",

    "abstract": "We analyze a second-order projection method for the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations on bounded Lipschitz domains. The scheme employs a\nBackward Differentiation Formula of order two (BDF2) for the time\ndiscretization, combined with conforming finite elements in space. Projection\nmethods are widely used to enforce incompressibility, yet rigorous convergence\nresults for possibly non-smooth solutions have so far been restricted to\nfirst-order schemes. We establish, for the first time, convergence (up to\nsubsequence) of a second-order projection method to Leray-Hopf weak solutions\nunder minimal assumptions on the data, namely $u_0 \\in\nL^2_{\\text{div}}(\\Omega)$ and $f \\in L^2(0,T;L^2_{\\text{div}}(\\Omega))$. Our\nanalysis relies on two ingredients: A discrete energy inequality providing\nuniform $L^{\\infty}(0,T;L^2(\\Omega))$ and $L^2(0,T;H^1_0(\\Omega))$ bounds for\nsuitable interpolants of the discrete velocities, and a compactness argument\ncombining Simon's theorem with refined time-continuity estimates. These tools\novercome the difficulty that only the projected velocity satisfies an\napproximate divergence-free condition, while the intermediate velocity is\ncontrolled in space. We conclude that a subsequence of the approximations\nconverges to a Leray-Hopf weak solution. This result provides the first\nrigorous convergence proof for a higher-order projection method under no\nadditional assumptions on the solution beyond those following from the standard\na priori energy estimate.",

    "abstract": "PF708 teriparatide, manufactured by Alvogen, was approved through the\n505(B)(2) application after the expiration of Forteo market exclusivity in\nOctober 2019. The 505(B)(2) application allows safety and efficacy information\nto come from studies not conducted by the applicant if it is demonstrated that\nthe proposed product shares characteristics (active ingredient, dose, route of\nadministration, strength) with the reference product and comparable\npharmacokinetic data is established. Real-world data is thus needed to\ndemonstrate equivalent safety and efficacy between Forteo and PF708\nteriparatide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in bone mineral\ndensity in osteoporotic patients treated with either Forteo or PF708\nteriparatide for 18-24 months. This retrospective chart review included\nosteoporotic patients > 18 years of age who received PF708 teriparatide or\nForteo prescriptions from the practice location and initiated therapy between\nOctober 1, 2019 and October 31, 2022. The primary endpoint was percent change\nfrom baseline in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip. A total\nof 108 patients were included: 27 (median age 67 years, 88.9% female) in the\nPF708 teriparatide group and 81 (median age 68 years, 85.2% female) in the\nForteo group. There was no significant difference in median change from\nbaseline BMD of lumbar spine (+9.6% vs +7.7%, P= 0.56), left femoral neck (1.5%\nvs 2.8%, P= 0.39), right femoral neck (+1.6% vs +4.4%, P= 0.14), left total hip\n(+2.4% vs +3.2%, P= 0.24), or right total hip (0.0% vs +1.4% , P= 0.71) with\nPF708 teriparatide vs Forteo, respectively. In this small retrospective study,\neffect on BMD and reported adverse events were similar between PF708\nteriparatide and Forteo when used for the recommended duration of therapy.",

    "abstract": "Humans are remarkably data-efficient when adapting to new unseen conditions,\nlike driving a new car. In contrast, modern robotic control systems, like\nneural network policies trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), are highly\nspecialized for single environments. Because of this overfitting, they are\nknown to break down even under small differences like the Simulation-to-Reality\n(Sim2Real) gap and require system identification and retraining for even\nminimal changes to the system. In this work, we present RAPTOR, a method for\ntraining a highly adaptive foundation policy for quadrotor control. Our method\nenables training a single, end-to-end neural-network policy to control a wide\nvariety of quadrotors. We test 10 different real quadrotors from 32 g to 2.4 kg\nthat also differ in motor type (brushed vs. brushless), frame type (soft vs.\nrigid), propeller type (2/3/4-blade), and flight controller\n(PX4/Betaflight/Crazyflie/M5StampFly). We find that a tiny, three-layer policy\nwith only 2084 parameters is sufficient for zero-shot adaptation to a wide\nvariety of platforms. The adaptation through In-Context Learning is made\npossible by using a recurrence in the hidden layer. The policy is trained\nthrough a novel Meta-Imitation Learning algorithm, where we sample 1000\nquadrotors and train a teacher policy for each of them using Reinforcement\nLearning. Subsequently, the 1000 teachers are distilled into a single, adaptive\nstudent policy. We find that within milliseconds, the resulting foundation\npolicy adapts zero-shot to unseen quadrotors. We extensively test the\ncapabilities of the foundation policy under numerous conditions (trajectory\ntracking, indoor/outdoor, wind disturbance, poking, different propellers).",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist\npolicies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model\narchitectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power\nbudgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five\nrepresentative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly\nproposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using\nthe LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics,\nincluding latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power\nconstraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results\nidentify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action\ntokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory\nfootprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance\ndegradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter\nGPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant\naccuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and\noptimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints.
