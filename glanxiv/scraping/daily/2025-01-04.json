    "abstract": "Verifying the provenance of content is crucial to the function of many\norganizations, e.g., educational institutions, social media platforms, firms,\netc. This problem is becoming increasingly challenging as text generated by\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) becomes almost indistinguishable from\nhuman-generated content. In addition, many institutions utilize in-house LLMs\nand want to ensure that external, non-sanctioned LLMs do not produce content\nwithin the institution. In this paper, we answer the following question: Given\na piece of text, can we identify whether it was produced by a particular LLM or\nnot? We model LLM-generated text as a sequential stochastic process with\ncomplete dependence on history. We then design zero-shot statistical tests to\n(i) distinguish between text generated by two different known sets of LLMs $A$\n(non-sanctioned) and $B$ (in-house), and (ii) identify whether text was\ngenerated by a known LLM or generated by any unknown model, e.g., a human or\nsome other language generation process. We prove that the type I and type II\nerrors of our test decrease exponentially with the length of the text. For\nthat, we show that if $B$ generates the text, then except with an exponentially\nsmall probability in string length, the log-perplexity of the string under $A$\nconverges to the average cross-entropy of $B$ and $A$. We then present\nexperiments using LLMs with white-box access to support our theoretical results\nand empirically examine the robustness of our results to black-box settings and\nadversarial attacks. In the black-box setting, our method achieves an average\nTPR of 82.5\\% at a fixed FPR of 5\\%. Under adversarial perturbations, our\nminimum TPR is 48.6\\% at the same FPR threshold. Both results outperform all\nnon-commercial baselines. See\nhttps://github.com/TaraRadvand74/llm-text-detection for code, data, and an\nonline demo of the project.",

Different from the predominant standard approach, our\nmethodology is guaranteed to detect all dependencies expressed by classical\ngenetic association models. The asymptotic distribution under mild regularity\nassumptions is derived. Moreover, the finite sample distribution under\nGaussianity is provided in which the exact p-value can be efficiently evaluated\nvia the classical Appell hypergeometric series. Both results are extended to a\nregression-type setting with nuisance covariates, enabling hypotheses testing\nin a wide range of scenarios.

Second, the variations of both the time-integrated\nand the time-resolved polarization angles (PAs) with frequency of the magnetic\nreconnection model is not random, while the time-integrated PA varies randomly\nwith frequency for the photosphere model.

This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including\nGraph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA),\nto enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures\ncomplex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced\ngeneralization gap and improved learning performance.

    "abstract": "Previously a mathematical approach has been developed for calculation of the\npropagation time of a signal, emitted by a moving along an elliptical orbit\nsatellite, with account also for the General Relativity Theory (GRT) effects.\nThe formalism was restricted to one dynamical parameter (the true anomaly or\nthe eccentric anomaly angle). In this paper the aim is to extend the formalism\nto the case, when also the other five Kepler parameters will be changing.The\nfollowing problem can be formulated: if two satellites move on two\nspace-distributed orbits and they exchange signals, how can the propagation\ntime be calculated? In this paper approaches from differential geometry and\ntopology were implemented.The action functional for the propagation time is\nrepresented in the form of a quadratic functional in the differentials of the\nKepler elements. The known mapping from celestial mechanics is used, when by\nmeans of a transformation the 6 Kepler parameters are mapped into the cartesian\ncoordinates X, Y, Z. This is in fact a submersion of a manifold of 6 parameters\ninto a manifold of 3 parameters. If a variational approach is applied with\nrespect to a differential form in terms of the differentials of the Kepler\nparameters, the second variation will be different from zero and the Stokes\ntheorem can be applied, provided that the second partial derivatives of the\nCartesian coordinates with respect to the Kepler parameters are assumed to be\ndifferent from zero. From topology viewpoint this requirement is equivalent to\nthe existence of the s.c. Morse functions (non-degenerate at the critical\npoints). In the given case it has been shown that Morse function cannot exist\nwith respect to each one of the Kepler parameters- Morse function cannot be\ndefined with respect to the omega angle.",

    "abstract": "Task arithmetic in large-scale pre-trained models enables agile adaptation to\ndiverse downstream tasks without extensive retraining. By leveraging task\nvectors (TVs), users can perform modular updates through simple arithmetic\noperations like addition and subtraction. Yet, this flexibility presents new\nsecurity challenges. In this paper, we investigate how TVs are vulnerable to\nbackdoor attacks, revealing how malicious actors can exploit them to compromise\nmodel integrity. By creating composite backdoors that are designed\nasymmetrically, we introduce BadTV, a backdoor attack specifically crafted to\nremain effective simultaneously under task learning, forgetting, and analogy\noperations. Extensive experiments show that BadTV achieves near-perfect attack\nsuccess rates across diverse scenarios, posing a serious threat to models\nrelying on task arithmetic. We also evaluate current defenses, finding they\nfail to detect or mitigate BadTV. Our results highlight the urgent need for\nrobust countermeasures to secure TVs in real-world deployments.",

    "abstract": "In doped transition metal dichalcogenides, optically created excitons (bound\nelectron-hole pairs) can strongly interact with a Fermi sea of electrons to\nform Fermi polaron quasiparticles. When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as\nis the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive)\npolarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi\nsea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional\ncoherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence\nevolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable\nFermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with\nthese resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley\ncoherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond\ntime scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion\nprocess leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization,\npersisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet\npolaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides\nvaluable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley\nindexes in atomically thin semiconductors.",

We\ncompare DFP and cross-attention under a variety of configurations, such as CTC\ncompression, sequence-level knowledge distillation, on monolingual, bilingual,\nand multilingual models.

    "abstract": "As an alternative approach for predicting complex dynamical systems where\nphysics-based models are no longer reliable, reservoir computing (RC) has\ngained popularity. The hybrid approach is considered an interesting option for\nimproving the prediction performance of RC. The idea is to combine a\nknowledge-based model (KBM) to support the fully data-driven RC prediction.\nThere are three types of hybridization for RC, namely full hybrid (FH), input\nhybrid (IH) and output hybrid (OH), where it was shown that the latter one is\nsuperior in terms of the accuracy and the robustness for the prediction of\nlow-dimensional chaotic systems. Here, we extend the formalism to the\nprediction of spatiotemporal patterns in two dimensions. To overcome the curse\nof dimensionality for this very high-dimensional case we employ the local\nstates ansatz, where only a few locally adjacent time series are utilized for\nthe RC-based prediction. Using simulation data from the Barkley model\ndescribing chaotic electrical wave propagation in cardiac tissue, we outline\nthe formalism of high-dimensional hybrid RC and assess the performance of the\ndifferent hybridization schemes. We find that all three methods (FH, IH and OH)\nperform better than reservoir only, where improvements are small when the model\nis very inaccurate. For small model errors and small reservoirs FH and OH\nperform nearly equally well and better than IH. Given the smaller CPU needs for\nOH and especially the better interpretability of it, OH is to be favored. For\nlarge reservoirs the performance of OH drops below that of FH and IH.\nGenerally, it maybe advisable to test the three setups for a given application\nand select the best suited one that optimizes between the counteracting factors\nof prediction performance and CPU needs.",

Recent empirical studies have shown that deep networks\nlearn features that are linearly separable across classes. However, these\nfindings often lack rigorous justifications, even under relatively simple\nsettings. In this work, we address this gap by examining the linear separation\ncapabilities of shallow nonlinear networks. Specifically, inspired by the low\nintrinsic dimensionality of image data, we model inputs as a union of\nlow-dimensional subspaces (UoS) and demonstrate that a single nonlinear layer\ncan transform such data into linearly separable sets. Theoretically, we show\nthat this transformation occurs with high probability when using random weights\nand quadratic activations. Notably, we prove this can be achieved when the\nnetwork width scales polynomially with the intrinsic dimension of the data\nrather than the ambient dimension. Experimental results corroborate these\ntheoretical findings and demonstrate that similar linear separation properties\nhold in practical scenarios beyond our analytical scope. This work bridges the\ngap between empirical observations and theoretical understanding of the\nseparation capacity of nonlinear networks, offering deeper insights into model\ninterpretability and generalization.",

In this work, we propose CorrFill, a training-free module\ndesigned to enhance the awareness of geometric correlations between the\nreference and target images. This enhancement is achieved by guiding the\ninpainting process with correspondence constraints estimated during inpainting,\nutilizing attention masking in self-attention layers and an objective function\nto update the input tensor according to the constraints.

Second, DP is usually\nachieved through advanced composition mechanisms that tend to converge\nprematurely when working with a small privacy budget. In this paper, inspired\nby the simplicity, effectiveness, and ease of analysis of PageRank, we design\nPrivDPR, a novel privacy-preserving deep PageRank for graph synthesis. In\nparticular, we achieve DP by adding noise to the gradient for a specific weight\nduring learning.

    "abstract": "The increasing reliance on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS),\nparticularly the Global Positioning System (GPS), underscores the urgent need\nto safeguard these technologies against malicious threats such as spoofing and\njamming. As the backbone for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) across\nvarious applications including transportation, telecommunications, and\nemergency services GNSS is vulnerable to deliberate interference that poses\nsignificant risks. Spoofing attacks, which involve transmitting counterfeit\nGNSS signals to mislead receivers into calculating incorrect positions, can\nresult in serious consequences, from navigational errors in civilian aviation\nto security breaches in military operations. Furthermore, the lack of inherent\nsecurity measures within GNSS systems makes them attractive targets for\nadversaries. While GNSS/GPS jamming and spoofing systems consist of numerous\ncomponents, the ability to distinguish authentic signals from malicious ones is\nessential for maintaining system integrity. Recent advancements in machine\nlearning and deep learning provide promising avenues for enhancing detection\nand mitigation strategies against these threats. This paper addresses both\nspoofing and jamming by tackling real-world challenges through machine\nlearning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques. Through extensive\nexperiments on two real-world datasets related to spoofing and jamming\ndetection using advanced algorithms, we achieved state of the art results. In\nthe GNSS/GPS jamming detection task, we attained approximately 99% accuracy,\nimproving performance by around 5% compared to previous studies.

To address this concern, they encrypt their data before\nuploading it to the cloud. However, encryption with different keys means that\neven identical data will become different ciphertexts, making deduplication\nless effective. Encrypted deduplication avoids this issue by ensuring that\nidentical data chunks generate the same ciphertext with content-based keys,\nenabling the cloud to efficiently identify and remove duplicates even in\nencrypted form. Current encrypted data deduplication work can be classified\ninto two types: target-based and source-based. Target-based encrypted\ndeduplication requires clients to upload all encrypted chunks (the basic unit\nof deduplication) to the cloud with high network bandwidth overhead.\nSource-based deduplication involves clients uploading fingerprints (hashes) of\nencrypted chunks for duplicate checking and only uploading unique encrypted\nchunks, which reduces network transfer but introduces high latency and\npotential side-channel attacks, which need to be mitigated by Proof of\nOwnership (PoW), and high computing overhead of the cloud. So, reducing the\nlatency and the overheads of network and cloud while ensuring security has\nbecome a significant challenge for secure data deduplication in cloud storage.\nIn response to this challenge, we present PM-Dedup, a novel secure source-based\ndeduplication approach that relocates a portion of the deduplication checking\nprocess and PoW tasks from the cloud to the trusted execution environments\n(TEEs) in the client-side edge servers.

    "abstract": "Low-altitude mobility, exemplified by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has\nintroduced transformative advancements across various domains, like\ntransportation, logistics, and agriculture. Leveraging flexible perspectives\nand rapid maneuverability, UAVs extend traditional systems' perception and\naction capabilities, garnering widespread attention from academia and industry.\nHowever, current UAV operations primarily depend on human control, with only\nlimited autonomy in simple scenarios, and lack the intelligence and\nadaptability needed for more complex environments and tasks. The emergence of\nlarge language models (LLMs) demonstrates remarkable problem-solving and\ngeneralization capabilities, offering a promising pathway for advancing UAV\nintelligence. This paper explores the integration of LLMs and UAVs, beginning\nwith an overview of UAV systems' fundamental components and functionalities,\nfollowed by an overview of the state-of-the-art in LLM technology.\nSubsequently, it systematically highlights the multimodal data resources\navailable for UAVs, which provide critical support for training and evaluation.\nFurthermore, it categorizes and analyzes key tasks and application scenarios\nwhere UAVs and LLMs converge. Finally, a reference roadmap towards agentic UAVs\nis proposed, aiming to enable UAVs to achieve agentic intelligence through\nautonomous perception, memory, reasoning, and tool utilization.

    "abstract": "We present results from a high cadence multi-wavelength observational\ncampaign of the enigmatic changing look AGN 1ES 1927+654 from May 2022- April\n2024, coincident with an unprecedented radio flare (an increase in flux by a\nfactor of $\\sim 60$ over a few months) and the emergence of a spatially\nresolved jet at $0.1-0.3$ pc scales (Meyer et al. 2024). Companion work has\nalso detected a recurrent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the $2-10$ keV\nband with an increasing frequency ($1-2$ mHz) over the same period (Masterson\net al., 2025). During this time, the soft X-rays ($0.3-2$ keV) monotonically\nincreased by a factor of $\\sim 8$, while the UV emission remained near-steady\nwith $<30\\%$ variation and the $2-10$ keV flux showed variation by a factor\n$\\lesssim 2$. The weak variation of the $2-10$ keV X-ray emission and the\nstability of the UV emission suggest that the magnetic energy density and\naccretion rate are relatively unchanged, and that the jet could be launched due\nto a reconfiguration of the magnetic field (toroidal to poloidal) close to the\nblack hole. Advecting poloidal flux onto the event horizon would trigger the\nBlandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism, leading to the onset of the jet. The\nconcurrent softening of the coronal slope (from $\\Gamma= 2.70\\pm 0.04$ to\n$\\Gamma=3.27\\pm 0.04$), the appearance of a QPO, and low coronal temperature\n($kT_{e}=8_{-3}^{+8}$ keV) during the radio outburst suggest that the poloidal\nfield reconfiguration can significantly impact coronal properties and thus\ninfluence jet dynamics. These extraordinary findings in real time are crucial\nfor coronal and jet plasma studies, particularly as our results are independent\nof coronal geometry.",

    "abstract": "This bachelor's thesis examines the capabilities of ChatGPT 4 in code\ngeneration across 19 programming languages. The study analyzed solution rates\nacross three difficulty levels, types of errors encountered, and code quality\nin terms of runtime and memory efficiency through a quantitative experiment. A\ntotal of 188 programming problems were selected from the LeetCode platform, and\nChatGPT 4 was given three attempts to produce a correct solution with feedback.\nChatGPT 4 successfully solved 39.67% of all tasks, with success rates\ndecreasing significantly as problem complexity increased. Notably, the model\nfaced considerable challenges with hard problems across all languages. ChatGPT\n4 demonstrated higher competence in widely used languages, likely due to a\nlarger volume and higher quality of training data. The solution rates also\nrevealed a preference for languages with low abstraction levels and static\ntyping. For popular languages, the most frequent error was \"Wrong Answer,\"\nwhereas for less popular languages, compiler and runtime errors prevailed,\nsuggesting frequent misunderstandings and confusion regarding the structural\ncharacteristics of these languages. The model exhibited above-average runtime\nefficiency in all programming languages, showing a tendency toward statically\ntyped and low-abstraction languages. Memory efficiency results varied\nsignificantly, with above-average performance in 14 languages and below-average\nperformance in five languages. A slight preference for low-abstraction\nlanguages and a leaning toward dynamically typed languages in terms of memory\nefficiency were observed. Future research should include a larger number of\ntasks, iterations, and less popular languages. Additionally, ChatGPT 4's\nabilities in code interpretation and summarization, debugging, and the\ndevelopment of complex, practical code could be analyzed further.\n  ----\n  Diese Bachelorarbeit untersucht die F\\\"ahigkeiten von ChatGPT 4 zur\nCode-Generierung in 19 Programmiersprachen. Betrachtet wurden die\nL\\\"osungsraten zwischen drei Schwierigkeitsgraden, die aufgetretenen\nFehlerarten und die Qualit\\\"at des Codes hinsichtlich der Laufzeit- und\nSpeichereffizienz in einem quantitativen Experiment. Dabei wurden 188\nProgrammierprobleme der Plattform LeetCode entnommen, wobei ChatGPT 4 jeweils\ndrei Versuche hatte, mittels Feedback eine korrekte L\\\"osung zu generieren.\nChatGPT 4 l\\\"oste 39,67 % aller Aufgaben erfolgreich, wobei die Erfolgsrate mit\nzunehmendem Schwierigkeitsgrad deutlich abnahm und bei komplexen Problemen in\nallen Sprachen signifikante Schwierigkeiten auftraten. Das Modell zeigte eine\nh\\\"ohere Kompetenz in weit verbreiteten Sprachen, was wahrscheinlich auf eine\ngr\\\"o{\\ss}ere Menge und h\\\"ohere Qualit\\\"at der Trainingsdaten\nzur\\\"uckzuf\\\"uhren ist. Bez\\\"uglich der L\\\"osungsraten zeigte das Modell zudem\neine Pr\\\"aferenz f\\\"ur Sprachen mit niedrigem Abstraktionsniveau und statischer\nTypisierung. Bei Sprachen hoher Popularit\\\"at trat der Fehler Wrong Answer am\nh\\\"aufigsten auf, w\\\"ahrend bei weniger popul\\\"aren Sprachen Compiler- und\nLaufzeitfehler \\\"uberwogen, was auf h\\\"aufige Missverst\\\"andnisse und\nVerwechslungen bez\\\"uglich der spezifischen strukturellen Eigenschaften dieser\nSprachen zur\\\"uckzuf\\\"uhren ist. ChatGPT 4 demonstrierte in allen\nProgrammiersprachen eine \\\"uberdurchschnittliche Laufzeiteffizienz und\ntendierte diesbez\\\"uglich erneut zu statisch typisierten und niedrig\nabstrahierten Sprachen. Die Werte zur Speichereffizienz variierten erheblich,\nwobei in 14 Sprachen \\\"uberdurchschnittliche und in f\\\"unf Sprachen\nunterdurchschnittliche Werte erzielt wurden. Es zeigte sich diesbez\\\"uglich\neine leichte Tendenz zugunsten von niedrig abstrahierten sowie eine Pr\\\"aferenz\nzu dynamisch typisierten Sprachen.

Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement\nlearning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's\npolicy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the\ntwo. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward\nfunction, called \\textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to\nencode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the\ndemonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman\nequation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement\nlearning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We\nalso introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors\nby reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness.\nThis strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that\nemploy the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark,\nachieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to\ntrue rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning.\nMoreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages\nand limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.",

The interpretation of\nexisting surveys has also been hindered by the lack of reliable redshift\nindicators for measuring distances for the entire sample. Thanks to recent\nadvances in mm-wave detector technologies we can now overcome these\nlimitations, and conduct the first truly volumetric surveys of star-forming\ngalaxies at mm-wavelengths down to the L* luminosities of typical galaxies,\nwith ~1000 redshift slices spanning most of the Cosmic star-forming volume (z ~\n1--12) with nearly uniform mass and luminosity selection. We describe an\ninstrument concept capable of delivering such surveys with the technologies\navailable today, which can be built and operated on a ground-based mm-wave\nfacility in the near future. Such spectrometer cameras can resolve and redshift\nidentify up to to 25,000 star-forming galaxies per year even when operated on a\n10-m class telescope. On a larger aperture it can do the same faster or probe\neven deeper. We propose a loose, open-source collaboration to design, build,\nand operate one or several such cameras through the shared contributions of\nleading experts and telescopes from around the globe.",

Analytical optimal\ncontrol can result in highly nonlinear PDEs, which might yield unstable\nnumerical results. Accurate and convergent numerical schemes are essential to\nleverage the benefits of the hedging process. In this study, we apply a finite\nelement approach with a non-uniform mesh for the task of option pricing with\nstock borrowing fees, leading to an HJB equation that bypasses analytical\noptimal control in favor of direct PDE discretization. The time integration\nemploys the theta-scheme, with initial modifications following Rannacher`s\nprocedure. A Newton-type algorithm is applied to address the penalty-like term\nat each time step. Numerical experiments are conducted, demonstrating\nconsistency with a benchmark problem and showing a strong match. The CPU time\nneeded to reach the desired results favors P2-FEM over FDM and linear P1-FEM,\nwith P2-FEM displaying superior convergence.

By\ndefining a pseudo meridional overturning streamfunction ({\\Psi}pseudo) and\ndefining a new vector-type, dual-component index (ASCI), we diagnose zonally\nasymmetric abrupt seasonal change (ASC) of tropical meridional circulation.\n{\\Psi}pseudo converges to traditional, meridional overturning streamfunction\n({\\Psi}m) after being averaged over a zonal circle around any latitude. By\napplying the Helmholtz decomposition to horizontal velocity fields so as to\ndecompose {\\Psi}pseudo into rotational and divergent components, we\nquantitatively compare the contributions of horizontally rotational and\ndivergent flows to the abrupt seasonal change. We find that the zonal sectors\nassociated with strong deep convection exhibit the most pronounced ASC of\ntropical meridional circulation, and all of subregions exhibiting ASC contain\nlandmass with low heat inertia. Particularly, in contrast to the case of\nzonally symmetric Hadley cell, rotational flow, rather than the thermal-direct\ndivergent flow, dominates the zonally asymmetric ASC in the tropics, although\nthe divergent flow also contributes to the ASC over the zonal sectors\nassociated with deep convection.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized\ngraph-structured data modeling, yet traditional GNNs struggle with complex\nheterogeneous structures prevalent in real-world scenarios. Despite progress in\nhandling heterogeneous interactions, two fundamental challenges persist: noisy\ndata significantly compromising embedding quality and learning performance, and\nexisting methods' inability to capture intricate semantic transitions among\nheterogeneous relations, which impacts downstream predictions. To address these\nfundamental issues, we present the Heterogeneous Graph Diffusion Model\n(DiffGraph), a pioneering framework that introduces an innovative cross-view\ndenoising strategy. This advanced approach transforms auxiliary heterogeneous\ndata into target semantic spaces, enabling precise distillation of\ntask-relevant information. At its core, DiffGraph features a sophisticated\nlatent heterogeneous graph diffusion mechanism, implementing a novel forward\nand backward diffusion process for superior noise management. This methodology\nachieves simultaneous heterogeneous graph denoising and cross-type transition,\nwhile significantly simplifying graph generation through its latent-space\ndiffusion capabilities. Through rigorous experimental validation on both public\nand industrial datasets, we demonstrate that DiffGraph consistently surpasses\nexisting methods in link prediction and node classification tasks, establishing\nnew benchmarks for robustness and efficiency in heterogeneous graph processing.\nThe model implementation is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/HKUDS/DiffGraph.",

    "abstract": "A $d$-ary cuckoo hash table is an open-addressed hash table that stores each\nkey $x$ in one of $d$ random positions $h_1(x), h_2(x), \\ldots, h_d(x)$. In the\noffline setting, where all items are given and keys need only be matched to\nlocations, it is possible to support a load factor of $1 - \\epsilon$ while\nusing $d = \\lceil \\ln \\epsilon^{-1} + o(1) \\rceil$ hashes. The online setting,\nwhere keys are moved as new keys arrive sequentially, has the additional\nchallenge of the time to insert new keys, and it has not been known whether one\ncan use $d = O(\\ln \\epsilon^{-1})$ hashes to support $\\poly(\\epsilon^{-1})$\nexpected-time insertions.\n  In this paper, we introduce bubble-up cuckoo hashing, an implementation of\n$d$-ary cuckoo hashing that achieves all of the following properties\nsimultaneously:\n  (1) uses $d = \\lceil \\ln \\epsilon^{-1} + \\alpha \\rceil$ hash locations per\nitem for an arbitrarily small positive constant $\\alpha$.\n  (2) achieves expected insertion time $O(\\delta^{-1})$ for any insertion\ntaking place at load factor $1 - \\delta \\le 1 - \\epsilon$.\n  (3) achieves expected positive query time $O(1)$, independent of $d$ and\n$\\epsilon$.\n  The first two properties give an essentially optimal value of $d$ without\ncompromising insertion time. The third property is interesting even in the\noffline setting: it says that, even though \\emph{negative} queries must take\ntime $d$, positive queries can actually be implemented in $O(1)$ expected time,\neven when $d$ is large.",

    "abstract": "Operator-splitting methods are widely used to solve differential equations,\nespecially those that arise from multi-scale or multi-physics models, because a\nmonolithic (single-method) approach may be inefficient or even infeasible. The\nmost common operator-splitting methods are the first-order Lie--Trotter (or\nGodunov) and the second-order Strang (Strang--Marchuk) splitting methods.\nHigh-order splitting methods with real coefficients require backward-in-time\nintegration in each operator and hence may be adversely impacted by instability\nfor certain operators such as diffusion. However, besides the method\ncoefficients, there are many other ancillary aspects to an overall\noperator-splitting method that are important but often overlooked. For example,\nthe operator ordering and the choice of sub-integration methods can\nsignificantly affect the stability and efficiency of an operator-splitting\nmethod. In this paper, we investigate some design principles for the\nconstruction of operator-splitting methods, including minimization of local\nerror measure, choice of sub-integration method, maximization of linear\nstability, and minimization of overall computational cost. We propose a new\nfour-stage, third-order, 2-split operator-splitting method with seven\nsub-integrations per step and optimized linear stability for a benchmark\nproblem from cardiac electrophysiology. We then propose a general principle to\nfurther improve stability and efficiency of such operator-splitting methods by\nusing low-order, explicit sub-integrators for unstable sub-integrations. We\ndemonstrate an almost 30\\% improvement in the performance of methods derived\nfrom these design principles compared to the best-known third-order methods.",

One network\nselects beam illumination patterns in the discrete action space, while the\nother manages power allocation in the continuous space. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed algorithm significantly reduces LTCAD while maintaining high\nthroughput in time-varying traffic scenarios.

This is done by varying only the\nmagnetic Prandtl number, $Pm$, the non-dimensional form of the fluid's\nelectrical conductivity $\\sigma$. Because the strength of the dynamo magnetic\nfield and the Lorentz force scale with $Pm$, it is found that the fluid\nmotions, the pattern of convective heat transfer, and the mode of dynamo\ngeneration all differ across the $0.25 \\leq Pm \\leq 10$ range investigated\nhere.

Using extensive census data across American cities,\nwe analyse how parenthood and partnership reshape their urban experiences. Our\nfindings indicate that cities can indeed be classified by their level of\nfriendliness towards parents and partners. For example, Dallas and Nashville\ncan be more suited for single individuals, New York and Chicago can be more\naccommodating to parents, while Washington and Baltimore favour married people.\nThese insights contribute to the growing body of research advocating for more\nnuanced and equitable urban planning. By recognising the diverse needs of\ndifferent demographic groups, particularly parents, our study underscores the\nimportance of tailored urban design strategies over universal solutions.",

    "abstract": "Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) aim to sample from a target distribution\nby learning score functions using samples perturbed by Gaussian noise. Existing\nconvergence bounds for SGMs in the $\\mathcal{W}_2$-distance rely on stringent\nassumptions about the data distribution. In this work, we present a novel\nframework for analyzing $\\mathcal{W}_2$-convergence in SGMs, significantly\nrelaxing traditional assumptions such as log-concavity and score regularity.\nLeveraging the regularization properties of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU)\nprocess, we show that weak log-concavity of the data distribution evolves into\nlog-concavity over time. This transition is rigorously quantified through a\nPDE-based analysis of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation governing the\nlog-density of the forward process. Moreover, we establish that the drift of\nthe time-reversed OU process alternates between contractive and non-contractive\nregimes, reflecting the dynamics of concavity. Our approach circumvents the\nneed for stringent regularity conditions on the score function and its\nestimators, relying instead on milder, more practical assumptions. We\ndemonstrate the wide applicability of this framework through explicit\ncomputations on Gaussian mixture models, illustrating its versatility and\npotential for broader classes of data distributions.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of ultralight dark matter with non-negligible self-interactions\nare determined by a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation rather than by the Vlasov\nequation of collisionless particles. This leads to wave-like effects, such as\ninterferences, the formation of solitons, and a velocity field that is locally\ncurl-free, implying that vorticity is carried by singularities associated with\nvortices. Using analytical derivations and numerical simulations in 2D, we\nstudy the evolution of such a system from stochastic initial conditions with\nnonzero angular momentum. Focusing on the Thomas-Fermi regime, where the de\nBroglie wavelength of the system is smaller than its size, we show that a\nrotating soliton forms in a few dynamical times. The rotation is not associated\nwith a large orbital quantum number of the wave function. Instead, it is\ngenerated by a regular lattice of vortices that gives rise to a solid-body\nrotation in the continuum limit. Such rotating solitons have a maximal radius\nand rotation rate for a given central density, while the vortices follow the\nmatter flow on circular orbits. We show that this configuration is a stable\nminimum of the energy at fixed angular momentum and we check that the numerical\nresults agree with the analytical derivations. We expect most of these\nproperties to extend to the 3D case where point vortices would be replaced by\nvortex rings.",

In this work, we investigate\nthe mobilization dynamics of oil clusters by 10 means of microfluidic devices\nthat allow pore scale direct characterization of flow in water-wet chips. We\nvaried both flow rates during waterflooding and the viscosity ratio by\ninjecting Glycerol/water mixtures of various compositions right after the\nwaterflooding period. During waterflooding, the flow rate has only a limited\nimpact on residual oil. With a subsequent injection of a Glycerol/water\nmixture, the oil recovery is significantly enhanced. To better understand the\nrecovery mechanisms, oil clusters were categorized into droplets, blobs and\nganglia. Increasing the viscosity of the injected mixture resulted in only a\nslight reduction in the number of ganglia but significantly decreased their\ntotal volume, thus reducing overall oil saturation. This is due to ganglia\nbreakup into smaller ganglia, blobs and droplets that are subsequently\nmobilized and transported away, while remaining parts of original ganglia still\nremain trapped. As long as droplets and blobs are considered, their number is\nseen to only weakly change by the increase of mixture viscosity and even their\nnumber may temporarily increase as they result from ganglia rupture. So, the\nprocess can be separated in two main steps: ganglia breakage that feed the\nmedium in blobs and droplets and a second step where such moving oil entities\nare transported. The characteristic time for oil transport is believed to be\nlonger than that required for ganglia breakage.",

This paper presents a systematic framework grounded in\nsocial psychology theories to investigate and compare explicit and implicit\nbiases in LLMs. We propose a novel self-reflection-based evaluation framework\nthat operates in two phases: first measuring implicit bias through simulated\npsychological assessment methods, then evaluating explicit bias by prompting\nLLMs to analyze their own generated content. Through extensive experiments on\nadvanced LLMs across multiple social dimensions, we demonstrate that LLMs\nexhibit a substantial inconsistency between explicit and implicit biases: while\nexplicit bias manifests as mild stereotypes, implicit bias exhibits strong\nstereotypes. We further investigate the underlying factors contributing to this\nexplicit-implicit bias inconsistency, examining the effects of training data\nscale, model size, and alignment techniques. Experimental results indicate that\nwhile explicit bias declines with increased training data and model size,\nimplicit bias exhibits a contrasting upward trend. Moreover, contemporary\nalignment methods effectively suppress explicit bias but show limited efficacy\nin mitigating implicit bias.",

In a binary star system, the\nscalar-induced charge would result in a long-range force between the stars,\nwith the scalar field acting as the mediator. The scalar-photon interactions\nwould modify Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields in vacuum,\nresulting in a modified dispersion relation. This could be observed as an\napparent redshift for photons emitted by such sources. The scalar field would\nalso induce additional electric and magnetic fields and hence affect the\nelectromagnetic energy radiated from such compact objects. A scalar field\nsourced by time-varying electromagnetic fields can also carry away energy from\na compact star in the form of radiation, and hence contribute to its spin-down\nluminosity.

    "abstract": "Alpha satellite DNA is large tandem arrays of 150-400 bp units, and its\norigin remains an evolutionary mystery. In this research, we identified 1,545\nalpha-satellite-like (SatL) repeat units in the nuclear genome of jewel wasp\nNasonia vitripennis. Among them, thirty-nine copies of SatL were organized in\ntwo palindromic arrays in mitochondria, resulting in a 50% increase in the\ngenome size. Strikingly, genomic neighborhood analyses of 1,516 nuclear SatL\nrepeats revealed that they are located in NuMT (nuclear mitochondrial DNA)\nregions, and SatL phylogeny matched perfectly with mitochondrial genes and NuMT\npseudogenes. These results support that SatL arrays originated from ten\nindependent mitochondria insertion events into the nuclear genome within the\nlast 500,000 years, after divergence from its sister species N. giraulti.\nDramatic repeat GC-percent elevation (from 33.9% to 50.4%) is a hallmark of\nrapid SatL sequence evolution in mitochondria due to GC-biased gene conversion\nfacilitated by the palindromic sequence pairing of the two mitochondrial SatL\narrays. The nuclear SatL repeat arrays underwent substantial copy number\nexpansion, from 12-15 (SatL1) to over 400 copies (SatL4). The oldest SatL4B\narray consists of four types of repeat units derived from deletions in the\nAT-rich region of ancestral repeats, and complex high-order structures have\nevolved through duplications. We also discovered similar repeat insertions into\nthe nuclear genome of Muscidifurax, suggesting this mechanism can be common in\ninsects. This is the first report of the mitochondrial origin of nuclear\nsatellite sequences, and our findings shed new light on the origin and\nevolution of satellite DNA.",

The earliest form of symmetry for\nanalytic input-output systems is due to Fliess who introduced systems described\nby an exchangeable generating series. In this case, one is able to write the\noutput as a memoryless analytic function of the integral of each input. The\nfirst goal of this paper is to describe two new types of symmetry for such\nChen--Fliess input-output systems, namely, coefficient reversible symmetry and\npalindromic symmetry. Each concept is then related to the notion of an\nexchangeable series. The second goal of the paper is to provide an in-depth\nanalysis of Chen--Fliess input-output systems whose generating series are\nlinear time-varying, palindromic, and have generating series coefficients\ngrowing at a maximal rate while ensuring some type of convergence. It is shown\nthat such series have an infinite Hankel rank and Lie rank, have a certain\ninfinite dimensional state space realization, and a description of their\nrelative degree and zero dynamics is given.",

In contrast, two ring polymers remain\nmixed within a sphere, as there is no symmetry breaking direction [Nat Rev\nMicrobiol, 8, 600-607 (2010)]. Therefore, in order to observe emergent\norganization of ring polymers in a sphere, we can introduce an asymmetric\ntopological modification to the polymer architecture by creating a small loop\nand a big loop within the ring polymer. We consider the bead-spring model of\npolymers where there are only repulsive excluded volume interactions between\nthe monomers ensuring that the organization we observe is purely\nentropy-driven. We find that for a single topologically modified polymer within\na sphere, the monomers of the bigger loop are statistically more probable to be\nfound closer to the periphery. However, the situation is reversed when we have\nmultiple such topologically modified polymers in a sphere. The monomers of the\nsmall loops are found closer to the walls of the sphere. We can increase this\nlocalization and radial organization of polymer segments by increasing the\nnumber of small loops in each ring polymer. We study how these loops interact\nwith each other within a polymer, as well as with loops of other polymers in\nspherical confinement. We compare contact maps of multiple such topologically\nmodified polymers in a sphere. Finally, we discuss the plausible relevance of\nour studies to eukaryotic chromosomes that are confined within a spherical\nnucleus.",

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nnovel framework for training semantic encoders and decoders to enable\nchannel-adaptive digital SC. The core idea is to use binary symmetric channel\n(BSC) as a universal representation of generic digital communications,\neliminating the need to specify channel environments or system designs. Based\non this idea, our framework employs parallel BSCs to equivalently model the\nrelationship between the encoder's output and the decoder's input. The bit-flip\nprobabilities of these BSCs are treated as trainable parameters during\nend-to-end training, with varying levels of regularization applied to address\ndiverse requirements in practical systems. The advantage of our framework is\njustified by developing a training-aware communication strategy for the\ninference stage. This strategy makes communication bit errors align with the\npre-trained bit-flip probabilities by adaptively selecting power and modulation\nlevels based on practical requirements and channel conditions. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing training\napproaches in terms of both task performance and power consumption.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive\nanalysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their\nimplementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In\ncontrol engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered\nsubmerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and\naddressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be\ncompromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms\nfail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required\nproperties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov\nfunction, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even\ndestabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with\nregards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical\nproblems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control\nengineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should\nindeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The\nmajor contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in\nanalysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which\nexplicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite\nprecision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous\nworks is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization,\napproximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories,\nmeasurable selectors.

However, even in theory, analysis of 2D spectra resulting from complex\ninter- and intra-molecular motions using only molecular dynamics methods is not\neasy. This is because molecular motions comprise complex multiple modes, and\npeaks broaden and overlap owing to various relaxation processes and\ninhomogeneous broadening. On the basis of an anharmonic multimode Brownian\noscillator model with nonlinear system-bath coupling, we have developed an\napproach that simulates 2D spectra, taking into account arbitrary modes of\nintermolecular and intramolecular vibrations simultaneously. Although only\ntwo-mode quantum calculations are feasible with this model, owing to high\ncomputational costs, here we restrict ourselves to the classical case and\nperform three-mode calculations. We demonstrate the applicability of our method\nby calculating 2D correlation infrared spectra of water for symmetric\nstretching, antisymmetric stretching, and bending modes. The quantum effects of\nthese results are deduced by comparing 2D quantum spectra previously obtained\nfor two intramolecular modes with those obtained using our classical approach\nunder the same physical conditions. The results show that the 2D spectra\ncalculated by separating the stretching modes into symmetric and asymmetric\nmodes provide better descriptions of peak profiles, such as the splitting of\ncross-peaks.",

Additionally, due to data\nscarcity and security privacy concerns between enterprises, end-to-end graph\nneural network (GNN) algorithms may struggle in delivering satisfactory\nperformance for target tasks. To address these challenges, we present a novel\ntwo-stage model. In the first stage, we employ an innovative Masked\nAutoencoders for Heterogeneous Graph (HGMAE) to pre-train on a vast enterprise\nknowledge graph. Subsequently, in the second stage, a specialized classifier\nmodel is trained to predict default risk propagation probabilities. The\nclassifier leverages concatenated feature vectors derived from the pre-trained\nencoder with the enterprise's task-specific feature vectors. Through the\ntwo-stage training approach, our model not only boosts the importance of unique\nbond characteristics for specific default prediction tasks, but also securely\nand efficiently leverage the global information pre-trained from other\nenterprises. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model\noutperforms existing approaches in predicting default risk for bond issuers.",

    "abstract": "To better explore the oceans, seamless communication coverage of the vast 3D\nunderwater space is desired. Unlike terrestrial networks using radio signals,\nunderwater acoustic communications face a unique challenge: nodes in underwater\nshadow zones cannot connect to the network, even within the line of sight.\nThese shadow zones can extend for tens of kilometers, causing communication\nnodes to disconnect. Existing efforts focus on passive avoidance of shadow\nzones, but this strategy cannot ensure seamless coverage in dynamic ocean\nenvironments. This paper addresses the shadow zone problem by utilizing\nacoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to actively control the\nunderwater channel. Shadow zones are analytically modeled, and optimal RIS\ndeployment strategies are developed for both deep-sea and shallow-sea\nenvironments. The acoustic RIS is redesigned considering practical engineering\nlimitations and validated through pool tests. Bellhop-based simulations show\nthat without RIS deployment, coverage is limited to less than 20%, regardless\nof source strength. However, with optimal RIS deployment, energy coverage can\nreach almost 100%.",

By fully capturing the inherent physical characteristics of\nthe multi-user (MU) environment, it is possible to reduce pilot costs and\nimprove the channel estimation performance. In reality, users nearby may share\nthe same scatterer, while users further apart tend to have orthogonal channels.\nThis paper proposes a two-timescale approach for joint MU uplink channel\nestimation and localization in MIMO-OFDM systems, which fully captures the\nspatial characteristics of MUs. To accurately represent the structure of the MU\nchannel, the channel is modeled in the 3-D location domain. In the\nlong-timescale phase, the time-space-time multiple signal classification\n(TST-MUSIC) algorithm initially offers a rough approximation of scatterer\npositions for each user, which is subsequently refined through the scatterer\nassociation algorithm based on density-based spatial clustering of applications\nwith noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. The BS then utilizes this prior information to\napply a graph-coloring-based user grouping algorithm, enabling spatial division\nmultiplexing of pilots and reducing pilot overhead. In the short timescale\nphase, a low-complexity scattering environment aware location-domain turbo\nchannel estimation (SEA-LD-TurboCE) algorithm is introduced to merge the\noverlapping scatterer information from MUs, facilitating high-precision joint\nMU channel estimation and localization under spatially reused pilots.\nSimulation results verify the superior channel estimation and localization\nperformance of our proposed scheme over the baselines.",

In this paper, we investigate a more general case and propose an\nalgorithm that addresses geometric irregularities of boundaries without\nrequiring prior knowledge of their analytical expressions. To achieve this, we\ndevelop a Fourier-based curve fitting method for boundary approximation using\nsampled points, enabling parametric characterization of general 2-D boundaries.\nThis approach allows star-shaped boundaries to be fitted into polar-angle-based\nparametric curves, while boundaries of other shapes are handled through\ndecomposition. Then, we design a vector field (VF) to achieve the encirclement\nof the parameterized boundary, wherein a polar radius error is introduced to\nmeasure the robot's ``distance'' to the boundary. The controller is finally\nsynthesized using a control barrier function and quadratic programming to\nmediate some potentially conflicting specifications: boundary encirclement,\nobstacle avoidance, and limited actuation. In this manner, the VF-guided\nreference control not only guides the boundary encircling action, but can also\nbe minimally modified to satisfy obstacle avoidance and input saturation\nconstraints.

    "abstract": "Improving user engagement and platform revenue is crucial for online\nmarketing platforms. Uplift modeling is proposed to solve this problem, which\napplies different treatments (e.g., discounts, bonus) to satisfy corresponding\nusers. Despite progress in this field, limitations persist. Firstly, most of\nthem focus on scenarios where only user features exist. However, in real-world\nscenarios, there are rich contexts available in the online platform (e.g.,\nshort videos, news), and the uplift model needs to infer an incentive for each\nuser on the specific item, which is called real-time marketing. Thus, only\nconsidering the user features will lead to biased prediction of the responses,\nwhich may cause the cumulative error for uplift prediction. Moreover, due to\nthe large-scale contexts, directly concatenating the context features with the\nuser features will cause a severe distribution shift in the treatment and\ncontrol groups. Secondly, capturing the interaction relationship between the\nuser features and context features can better predict the user response. To\nsolve the above limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic Robust Uplift\nModeling with Large-Scale Contexts (UMLC) framework for Real-time Marketing.\nOur UMLC includes two customized modules. 1) A response-guided context grouping\nmodule for extracting context features information and condensing value space\nthrough clusters. 2) A feature interaction module for obtaining better uplift\nprediction. Specifically, this module contains two parts: a user-context\ninteraction component for better modeling the response; a treatment-feature\ninteraction component for discovering the treatment assignment sensitive\nfeature of each instance to better predict the uplift. Moreover, we conduct\nextensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and a real-world product dataset\nto verify the effectiveness and compatibility of our UMLC.",

Our findings reveal that star-forming cores do not\nnecessarily coincide with high-density regions when nearby stars are present,\nas gas selectively accretes onto protostars, leading to clumpy, fragmented\nstructures. We calculated convex hull cores from star-forming cores and defined\ntheir filling factors. Regardless of turbulence strength, convex hull cores\nwith lower filling factors tend to contain more protostars and have larger\nmasses and sizes, indicating that cores in clustered regions are more massive\nand larger than those in isolated regions. Thus, the filling factor serves as a\nkey indicator for distinguishing between isolated and clustered star-forming\nregions and may provide insights into the star formation processes within\nclustered regions. We also found that most convex hull cores are\ngravitationally bound. However, in the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm rms} = 10$ model,\nthere are more low-mass, unbound convex hull cores compared to the\n$\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm rms} = 2$ model. In the $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm rms} = 10$ model,\n16% of the convex hull cores are unbound, which may be explained by the\ninertial-inflow model. These findings highlight the influence of turbulence\nstrength on the mass and gravitational stability of cores.",

This process\nenables precise $M_{Z_{\\rm D}}$ reconstruction using the photon recoil mass\n($m_{\\rm recoil}$). Focusing on the $Z_{\\rm D} \\to jjX$ and $Z_{\\rm D} \\to\ne^+e^-$ decay modes, we present strategies for achieving high sensitivity to\nthe kinetic mixing parameter $\\varepsilon$ at 3, 6, and 10 TeV muon colliders\nwith integrated luminosities of 1, 4, and 10 ab$^{-1}$ respectively, assuming\n$Z_{\\rm D}$ decays exclusively into Standard Model particles. A key innovation\nis our optimized implementation of $M_{Z_{\\rm D}}$-dependent cuts on $m_{\\rm\nrecoil}$, which accounts for the energy-dependent detector response. For\nheavier $Z_{\\rm D}$, the associated photon becomes less energetic, leading to\nbetter photon energy resolution and thus enabling more stringent $m_{\\rm\nrecoil}$ cuts. This approach enhances $\\varepsilon$ sensitivity for heavier\n$Z_{\\rm D}$. Conversely, for lighter $Z_{\\rm D}$, the lower-energy electron\npair from $Z_{\\rm D} \\to e^+e^-$ enables tighter cuts on the invariant mass of\nthe electron pair ($m_{ee}$), providing better sensitivity in the lighter mass\nregime. Combining these complementary $m_{\\rm recoil}$- and $m_{ee}$-based\nselections with both $jjX$ and $e^+e^-$ channels, we achieve $\\varepsilon$\nsensitivity down to $O\\left(10^{-3}\\right)$ as $M_{Z_{\\rm D}}$ approaches\n$\\sqrt{s}$, substantially surpassing the reach of a 100 TeV proton-proton\ncollider. Even if $Z_{\\rm D}$ decays into dark-sector particles, the recoil\nmass method remains effective, establishing muon colliders as powerful\nfacilities for exploring heavy dark sectors.",

A fully functional and scalable quantum computer could transform\nvarious fields such as scientific research, material science, chemistry, and\ndrug discovery. However, in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era,\nquantum hardware faces challenges including decoherence, gate infidelity, and\nrestricted qubit connectivity. Efficient implementation of multi-qubit gates is\ncritical to advancing quantum computing, especially given the constraints of\nnear-term quantum hardware, such as the absence of all-to-all qubit\nconnectivity. Among these gates, the Toffoli gate (or CCNOT gate) plays a\npivotal role in a wide range of quantum algorithms and error correction\nschemes. While various decomposition strategies have been proposed, they often\nassume idealized all-to-all connectivity, which is not available on most NISQ\nhardware. This paper introduces a novel decomposition of the Toffoli gate using\nEchoed Cross-Resonance (ECR) gates, a native operation for many superconducting\nqubit architectures, including IBM Quantum's hardware. By leveraging the\ninherent compatibility of ECR gates with superconducting qubit technology, this\napproach is intended to facilitate the implementation of the Toffoli gate,\npotentially reducing circuit depth and enhancing the efficiency of quantum\ncircuits implementations on near-term quantum hardware.",

The prevailing\nwisdom has been that a particular crystal structure can be targeted by\ndesigning the DNA-mediated interactions, to enforce binding between specific\nparticle pairs, and the particle diameters, to control the packing of the\nvarious species. In this article, we show that other ubiquitous nonspecific\ninteractions can play equally important roles in determining the relative\nstability of different crystal polymorphs and therefore what crystal structure\nis most likely to form in an experiment. For a binary mixture of same-sized\nDNA-coated colloidal micrometer-scale particles, we show how changing the\nmagnitudes of nonspecific steric and van der Waals interactions gives rise to a\nfamily of binary body-centered tetragonal crystals, including both\ncesium-chloride and copper-gold crystals.

Tests could be treated as fuel to further boost FL by\nproviding more debugging information. Therefore, it is highly valuable to\nmeasure the Fault Diagnosis Capability (FDC) of a test for diagnosing faults,\nso as to select or generate tests to better help FL. To this end, researchers\nhave proposed many FDC metrics, which serve as the selection criterion in\nFL-oriented test selection or the fitness function in FL-oriented test\ngeneration. Existing FDC metrics can be classified into result-agnostic and\nresult-aware metrics depending on whether they take test results (i.e., passing\nor failing) as input. Although result-aware metrics perform better in test\nselection, they have restricted applications due to the input of test results,\ne.g., they cannot be applied to guide test generation. Moreover, all the\nexisting FDC metrics are designed based on some predefined heuristics and have\nachieved limited FL performance due to their inaccuracy. To address these\nissues, in this paper, we reconsider result-agnostic metrics, and propose a\nnovel result-agnostic metric RLFDC which predicts FDC values of tests through\nreinforcement learning. In particular, we treat FL results as reward signals,\nand train an FDC prediction model with the direct FL feedback to automatically\nlearn a more accurate measurement rather than design one based on predefined\nheuristics. Finally, we evaluate the proposed RLFDC on Defects4J by applying\nthe studied metrics to test selection and generation.

In this work, based on the Kepler\nData Release 25 (DR25) catalog combined with LAMOST and Gaia data, we\ninvestigate the correlation between stellar mass and the inner edge position\nacross different populations of small planets in multi-planetary systems, such\nas super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. By correcting for the influence of stellar\nmetallicity and analyzing the impact of observational selection effects, we\nconfirm the trend that as stellar mass increases, the position of the inner\nedge shifts outward. Our results reveal a stronger correlation between the\ninner edge and stellar mass with a power-law index of 0.6-1.1, which is larger\ncompared to previous studies. The stronger correlation in our findings is\nprimarily attributed to two factors: first, the metallicity correction applied\nin this work enhances the correlation; second, the previous use of occurrence\nrates to trace the inner edge weakens the observed correlation. Through\ncomparison between observed statistical results and current theoretical models,\nwe find that the pre-main-sequence (PMS) dust sublimation radius of the\nprotoplanetary disk best matches the observed inner edge stellar mass.\nTherefore, we conclude that the inner dust disk likely limits the innermost\norbits of small planets, contrasting with the inner edges of hot Jupiters,\nwhich are associated with the magnetospheres of gas disks, as suggested by\nprevious studies. This highlights that the inner edges of different planetary\npopulations are likely regulated by distinct mechanisms.",

The estimated bridge function is then plugged in to\nestimate the average treatment effect. This approach may have two efficiency\nlosses. First, the bridge function may not be efficiently estimated since it\nsolves an integral equation. Second, the sequential procedure may fail to\naccount for the correlation between the two steps. This paper proposes to\napproximate the integral equation with increasing moment restrictions and\njointly estimate the bridge function and the average treatment effect.

    "abstract": "We assess how quantum-mechanical effects associated with high-frequency\nchromophore vibrations influence excitation energy transfer in biological\nlight-harvesting complexes. We begin with a mixed quantum-classical theory that\ncombines a quantum description of the electronic motion with a classical\ndescription of the nuclear motion in a way that is consistent with the\nquantum-classical equilibrium distribution. We then include nuclear quantum\neffects in this theory with a variational polaron transformation of the high\nfrequency vibrational modes. This approach is validated by comparison with\nfully quantum mechanical benchmark calculations and then applied to three\nprototypical biological light-harvesting complexes. We find that high-frequency\nvibrations delay the energy transfer in the quantum treatment, but accelerate\nit in the classical treatment. For the inter-ring transfer in the\nlight-harvesting complex 2 of purple bacteria, the transfer rate is a factor of\n1.5 times slower in the quantum treatment than the classical. The transfer\ntimescale in the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex is essentially the same in both\ncases, whereas the transfer in light-harvesting complex II of spinach is 1.7\ntimes slower in the quantum treatment. In all cases, the quantum mechanical\nlong-time equilibrium populations of the chromophores are well reproduced by\nthe classical treatment, suggesting that nuclear quantum effects are generally\nunimportant for the directionality of energy transfer. Nuclear quantum effects\ndo however reduce the transfer rate in systems with large excitonic energy gaps\nand strong vibronic coupling to high-frequency vibrational modes.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models trained on massive collections of human-generated data\noften reproduce and amplify societal stereotypes. One critical form of\nstereotyping reproduced by these models is homogeneity bias-the tendency to\nrepresent certain groups as more homogeneous than others. We investigate how\nthis bias responds to hyperparameter adjustments in GPT-4, specifically\nexamining sampling temperature and top p which control the randomness of model\noutputs. By generating stories about individuals from different racial and\ngender groups and comparing their similarities using vector representations, we\nassess both bias robustness and its relationship with hyperparameter values. We\nfind that (1) homogeneity bias persists across most hyperparameter\nconfigurations, with Black Americans and women being represented more\nhomogeneously than White Americans and men, (2) the relationship between\nhyperparameters and group representations shows unexpected non-linear patterns,\nparticularly at extreme values, and (3) hyperparameter adjustments affect\nracial and gender homogeneity bias differently-while increasing temperature or\ndecreasing top p can reduce racial homogeneity bias, these changes show\ndifferent effects on gender homogeneity bias. Our findings suggest that while\nhyperparameter tuning may mitigate certain biases to some extent, it cannot\nserve as a universal solution for addressing homogeneity bias across different\nsocial group dimensions.",

    "abstract": "LLM safety and ethical alignment are widely discussed, but the impact of\ncontent moderation on user satisfaction remains underexplored. In particular,\nlittle is known about how users respond when models refuse to answer a\nprompt-one of the primary mechanisms used to enforce ethical boundaries in\nLLMs. We address this gap by analyzing nearly 50,000 model comparisons from\nChatbot Arena, a platform where users indicate their preferred LLM response in\npairwise matchups, providing a large-scale setting for studying real-world user\npreferences. Using a novel RoBERTa-based refusal classifier fine-tuned on a\nhand-labeled dataset, we distinguish between refusals due to ethical concerns\nand technical limitations. Our results reveal a substantial refusal penalty:\nethical refusals yield significantly lower win rates than both technical\nrefusals and standard responses, indicating that users are especially\ndissatisfied when models decline a task for ethical reasons. However, this\npenalty is not uniform. Refusals receive more favorable evaluations when the\nunderlying prompt is highly sensitive (e.g., involving illegal content), and\nwhen the refusal is phrased in a detailed and contextually aligned manner.\nThese findings underscore a core tension in LLM design: safety-aligned\nbehaviors may conflict with user expectations, calling for more adaptive\nmoderation strategies that account for context and presentation.",

This study aims to map water distribution using optical\nsatellite data and estimate its importance as a crucial element in determining\nliquefaction vulnerability. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was\nused to assess water and vegetation indexes, taking advantage of its\nsensitivity to water content in varied land surfaces. We recommended using the\nNIR (near-infrared) and SWIR (short wave infrared) bands with 832.8 nm and\n2202.4 nm, respectively, which are sensitive to soil water content.\nHigh-resolution satellite data were used to create NDWI maps, highlighting\nlocations with high water saturation. These findings were combined with\ngeological and seismic data to identify liquefaction-prone zones. The study\nfound that locations with high water content, as measured by NDWI, are highly\nassociated with greater liquefaction susceptibility. The findings highlight the\nimportance of water distribution in determining soil behavior during seismic\noccurrences.

    "abstract": "This study assesses the capability of ChatGPT to generate finite element code\nfor geotechnical engineering applications from a set of prompts. We tested\nthree different initial boundary value problems using a hydro-mechanically\ncoupled formulation for unsaturated soils, including the dissipation of excess\npore water pressure through fluid mass diffusion in one-dimensional space,\ntime-dependent differential settlement of a strip footing, and gravity-driven\nseepage. For each case, initial prompting involved providing ChatGPT with\nnecessary information for finite element implementation, such as balance and\nconstitutive equations, problem geometry, initial and boundary conditions,\nmaterial properties, and spatiotemporal discretization and solution strategies.\nAny errors and unexpected results were further addressed through prompt\naugmentation processes until the ChatGPT-generated finite element code passed\nthe verification/validation test. Our results demonstrate that ChatGPT required\nminimal code revisions when using the FEniCS finite element library, owing to\nits high-level interfaces that enable efficient programming. In contrast, the\nMATLAB code generated by ChatGPT necessitated extensive prompt augmentations\nand/or direct human intervention, as it involves a significant amount of\nlow-level programming required for finite element analysis, such as\nconstructing shape functions or assembling global matrices. Given that prompt\nengineering for this task requires an understanding of the mathematical\nformulation and numerical techniques, this study suggests that while a large\nlanguage model may not yet replace human programmers, it can greatly assist in\nthe implementation of numerical models.",

To address this problem, we\nintroduce a novel contrastive prompt tuning method for RE, CPTuning, which\nlearns to associate a candidate relation between two in-context entities with a\nprobability mass above or below a threshold, corresponding to whether the\nrelation exists.

We conduct extensive experiments on four\nwidely used datasets to validate our method.

A community is a\ncohesive subgraph that offers valuable insights for analyzing (multilayer)\ngraphs. Recently, there has been an emerging trend focused on searching\nquery-driven communities within the multilayer graphs. However, existing\nmethods for multilayer community search are either 1) rule-based, which suffer\nfrom structure inflexibility; or 2) learning-based, which rely on labeled data\nor fail to capture layer-specific characteristics. To address these, we propose\nEnMCS, an Ensemble-based unsupervised (i.e., label-free) Multilayer Community\nSearch framework. EnMCS contains two key components, i.e., HoloSearch which\nidentifies potential communities in each layer while integrating both\nlayer-shared and layer-specific information, and EMerge which is an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM)-based method that synthesizes the potential\ncommunities from each layer into a consensus community. Specifically,\nHoloSearch first employs a graph-diffusion-based model that integrates three\nlabel-free loss functions to learn layer-specific and layer-shared\nrepresentations for each node. Communities in each layer are then identified\nbased on nodes that exhibit high similarity in layer-shared representations\nwhile demonstrating low similarity in layer-specific representations w.r.t. the\nquery nodes. To account for the varying layer-specific characteristics of each\nlayer when merging communities, EMerge models the error rates of layers and\ntrue community as latent variables. It then employs the EM algorithm to\nsimultaneously minimize the error rates of layers and predict the final\nconsensus community through iterative maximum likelihood estimation.\nExperiments over 10 real-world datasets highlight the superiority of EnMCS in\nterms of both efficiency and effectiveness.",

We conducted\ndetailed modeling of the light curves to uncover the nature of the anomalies.\nThis modeling revealed that all signals originated from planetary companions to\nthe primary lens. The planet-to-host mass ratios are very low: $q\\sim 7.5\\times\n10^{-5}$ for MOA-2022-BLG-033, $q\\sim 3.6\\times 10^{-4}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-0119,\nand $q\\sim 6.9\\times 10^{-5}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-1896. The anomalies occurred as\nthe source passed through the negative deviation region behind the central\ncaustic along the planet-host axis. The solutions are subject to a common\ninner-outer degeneracy, resulting in variations in estimating the projected\nplanet-host separation. For KMT-2023-BLG-1896, although the planetary scenario\nprovides the best explanation of the anomaly, the binary companion scenario is\nmarginally possible. We estimate the physical parameters of the planetary\nsystems through Bayesian analyses based on the lensing observables. The\nanalysis identifies MOA-2022-BLG-033L as a planetary system with an ice giant,\napproximately 12 times the mass of Earth, orbiting an early M dwarf star. The\ncompanion of KMT-2023-BLG-1896L is also an ice giant, with a mass around 16\nEarth masses, orbiting a mid-K-type main-sequence star. The companion of\nKMT-2023-BLG-0119L, which has a mass about the mass of Saturn, orbits a\nmid-K-type dwarf star.

    "abstract": "Self-driven photodetectors (SDPDs) transform photon energy into electrical\nenergy without external voltage, which makes them highly advantageous for\napplications such as low-power communication and imaging systems.\nTwo-dimensional materials (2DMs) provide ideal platforms for SDPDs thanks to\ntheir band structures covering ultraviolet to infrared spectrum, strong light\nabsorption efficiencies, and high carrier mobilities. However, the lack of\nstable doping methods and the complicated 2DMs multilayer stacking techniques\npose tremendous difficulties for 2DMs to adopt the same device structures (i.e.\nPN junctions) as bulk materials, and the resultant self-driven performance\nremains at a low level. This work reveals how different asymmetrical effects\ncan be combined to synergistically boost self-driven properties based on\ntypical 2D metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors. Using WSe2 as an\nexemplary 2D material to build MSM photodetectors, the synergistic effect of\nasymmetrical contact electrodes and asymmetrical contact geometries is\ntheoretically and experimentally demonstrated. The open-circuit voltage (Voc)\nof the SDPD reaches 0.58V, with a zero-bias responsivity of 5.77 A/W and an\non/off ratio of 1.73*10^5. Additionally, our devices demonstrate potential for\nvisible light communication (VLC) in underwater environments.

    "abstract": "We present a multifractal artificial terrain generation method that uses the\n3D Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function to control roughness. By varying the fractal\ndimension used in terrain generation across three different values, we generate\n60 unique off-road terrains. We use gradient maps to categorize the roughness\nof each terrain, consisting of low-, semi-, and high-roughness areas. To test\nhow the fractal dimension affects the difficulty of vehicle traversals, we\nmeasure the success rates, vertical accelerations, pitch and roll rates, and\ntraversal times of an autonomous ground vehicle traversing 20 randomized\nstraight-line paths in each terrain. As we increase the fractal dimension from\n2.3 to 2.45 and from 2.45 to 2.6, we find that the median area of low-roughness\nterrain decreases 13.8% and 7.16%, the median area of semi-rough terrain\nincreases 11.7% and 5.63%, and the median area of high-roughness terrain\nincreases 1.54% and 3.33%, all respectively. We find that the median success\nrate of the vehicle decreases 22.5% and 25% as the fractal dimension increases\nfrom 2.3 to 2.45 and from 2.45 to 2.6, respectively. Successful traversal\nresults show that the median root-mean-squared vertical accelerations, median\nroot-mean-squared pitch and roll rates, and median traversal times all increase\nwith the fractal dimension.",

    "abstract": "The origin of charge density wave (CDW) is a long-term open issue.\nFurthermore, the evolution of phonon-phonon interactions (PPI) across CDW\ntransitions has rarely been investigated. Besides, whether electron-phonon\ncoupling (EPC) would be weakened or enhanced after CDW transitions is still\nunder debate. Additionally, CDW provides a fertile ground for uncovering\nintriguing intermediate electronic states. Here, we report a Raman spectroscopy\nstudy of the PPI and EPC in topological semimetal EuAl4 exhibiting a CDW phase\nbelow temperature Tc ~ 145 K. The free-charge-carrier-density (nc) and\ntemperature dependences of the Fano asymmetric factors (1/|q|) of the two\nphonon modes A1g and B1g indicates that below Tc, the EPC becomes weakened\nprobably due to the reduction of the nc. Interestingly, in the temperature\nrange from 50 to 145 K, the steep growth of the 1/|q| leading to the\nsignificant deviation from the linear dependence on the nc, together with the\nshoulder-like features in the temperature evolutions of the 1/|q| and the nc\naround 50 K, implies the possible existence of an intermediate electronic state\nwith the EPC distinctly larger than the CDW ground state in EuAl4. Furthermore,\nbelow Tc, the faster decrease in the full width at half maxima of the B1g\nphonon mode representing the collective vibrations of the CDW-modulated Al1\natoms suggests that a remarkable growth of the PPI for the B1g phonon mode\nafter the CDW phase transition, which is in contrast to the weakening of the\nEPC and thus may mainly arise from the strengthening of lattice anharmonicity\nin EuAl4. Our results not only highlight the significance of the enhanced PPI\nand the weakened EPC in completely understanding the formation of the CDW phase\nbut also initiate the exploration of novel intermediate electronic states in\nEuAl4.",

However, off-the-shelf LiDAR-based SLAM methods\nsuffer from significant pose estimation drifts, particularly components\nrelevant to the vertical direction, when passing to uneven terrains. This\ndeficiency typically leads to a conspicuously distorted global map. In this\narticle, a LiDAR-based SLAM method is presented to improve the accuracy of pose\nestimations for ground vehicles in rough terrains, which is termed\nRotation-Optimized LiDAR-Only (ROLO) SLAM. The method exploits a forward\nlocation prediction to coarsely eliminate the location difference of\nconsecutive scans, thereby enabling separate and accurate determination of the\nlocation and orientation at the front-end. Furthermore, we adopt a\nparallel-capable spatial voxelization for correspondence-matching. We develop a\nspherical alignment-guided rotation registration within each voxel to estimate\nthe rotation of vehicle. By incorporating geometric alignment, we introduce the\nmotion constraint into the optimization formulation to enhance the rapid and\neffective estimation of LiDAR's translation. Subsequently, we extract several\nkeyframes to construct the submap and exploit an alignment from the current\nscan to the submap for precise pose estimation. Meanwhile, a global-scale\nfactor graph is established to aid in the reduction of cumulative errors. In\nvarious scenes, diverse experiments have been conducted to evaluate our method.\nThe results demonstrate that ROLO-SLAM excels in pose estimation of ground\nvehicles and outperforms existing state-of-the-art LiDAR SLAM frameworks.",

Decades of space-based experiments\nhave shown that the energization process does not stop after it escapes.\nInstead, the solar wind continues to accelerate and it cools far more slowly\nthan a freely-expanding adiabatic gas. Recent work suggests that fast solar\nwind requires additional momentum beyond what can be provided by the observed\nthermal pressure gradients alone whereas it is sufficient for the slowest wind.\nThe additional acceleration for fast wind can be provided through an Alfv\\'en\nwave pressure gradient. Beyond this fast-slow categorization, however, a subset\nof slow solar wind exhibits high Alfv\\'enicity that suggest Alfv\\'en waves\ncould play a larger role in its acceleration compared to conventional slow wind\noutflows. Through a well-timed conjunction between Solar Orbiter and Parker\nSolar Probe, we trace the energetics of slow wind to compare with a neighboring\nAlfv\\'enic slow solar wind stream. An analysis that integrates remote and\nheliospheric properties and modeling of the two distinct solar wind streams\nfinds Alfv\\'enic slow solar wind behaves like fast wind, where a wave pressure\ngradient is required to reconcile its full acceleration, while non-Alfv\\'enic\nslow wind can be driven by its non-adiabatic electron and proton thermal\npressure gradients.

A systematic resolution to this dilemma requires: (1) an\nindependent yet coordinated control over exploration and exploitation, and (2)\nan explicit, computationally feasible, adaptive regulation mechanism. The\ncurrent, almost decentralized, traditional parameter tuning-centeric\napproach--lacks the foundation to satisfy these requirements under\nencoding-imposed structural constraints.\n  We propose a Human-Centered Two-Phase Search (HCTPS) framework, in which the\nactualization of (1) and (2) is enabled through an external configuration\nvariable--the Search Space Control Parameter (SSCP). As the sole control knob\nof HCTPS, the SSCP centralizes exploration adjustments, sparing users from\nmicromanaging traditional parameters with unintelligible interdependencies. To\nthis construct, the human user serves as a meta-parameter, adaptively steering\nthe regulatory process via SSCP adjustments. We prove that the HCTPS strictly\nsurpasses the current approach in terms of search space coverage without\ndisrupting the EAs' inherent convergence mechanisms, demonstrate a concrete\ninstantiation of it--using the Genetic Algorithm as the underlying heuristic on\na suite of global benchmark unconstrained optimization problems, provide a\nthrough assessment of the proposed framework, and envision future research\ndirections.\n  Any search algorithm prone to this dilemma can be applied in light of the\nproposed framework, being algorithm-agnostic by design.",

Our approach fuses the embeddings\nof a workspace image and a query text using a gated-attention mechanism and\nlearns to predict instance grasping affordances. To train the joint embedding\nspace of visual and textual attributes, the robot utilizes object persistence\nbefore and after grasping. Our model is self-supervised in a simulation that\nonly uses basic objects of various colors and shapes but generalizes to novel\nobjects in new environments. To further facilitate generalization, we propose\ntwo adaptation methods, adversarial adaption and one-grasp adaptation.\nAdversarial adaptation regulates the image encoder using augmented data of\nunlabeled images, whereas one-grasp adaptation updates the overall end-to-end\nmodel using augmented data from one grasp trial. Both adaptation methods are\ndata-efficient and considerably improve instance grasping performance.\nExperimental results in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that our\napproach achieves over 81% instance grasping success rate on unknown objects,\nwhich outperforms several baselines by large margins.",

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning for classical data is currently perceived to have a\nscalability problem due to (i) a bottleneck at the point of loading data into\nquantum states, (ii) the lack of clarity around good optimization strategies,\nand (iii) barren plateaus that occur when the model parameters are randomly\ninitialized. In this work, we propose techniques to address all of these\nissues. First, we present a quantum classifier that encodes both the input and\nthe output as binary strings which results in a model that has no restrictions\non expressivity over the encoded data but requires fast classical compression\nof typical high-dimensional datasets to only the most predictive degrees of\nfreedom. Second, we show that if one parameter is updated at a time, quantum\nmodels can be trained without using a classical optimizer in a way that\nguarantees convergence to a local minimum, something not possible for classical\ndeep learning models. Third, we propose a parameter initialization strategy\ncalled sub-net initialization to avoid barren plateaus where smaller models,\ntrained on more compactly encoded data with fewer qubits, are used to\ninitialize models that utilize more qubits. Along with theoretical arguments on\nefficacy, we demonstrate the combined performance of these methods on subsets\nof the MNIST dataset for models with an all-to-all connected architecture that\nuse up to 16 qubits in simulation. This allows us to conclude that the loss\nfunction consistently decreases as the capability of the model, measured by the\nnumber of parameters and qubits, increases, and this behavior is maintained for\ndatasets of varying complexity. Together, these techniques offer a coherent\nframework for scalable quantum machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for materials\ndiscovery, yet its advantages over traditional methods remain unclear. In this\nwork, we introduce and benchmark two baseline approaches - random enumeration\nof charge-balanced prototypes and data-driven ion exchange of known compounds -\nagainst four generative techniques based on diffusion models, variational\nautoencoders, and large language models. Our results show that established\nmethods such as ion exchange are better at generating novel materials that are\nstable, although many of these closely resemble known compounds. In contrast,\ngenerative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when\nsufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties\nsuch as electronic band gap and bulk modulus. To enhance the performance of\nboth the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation\nscreening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability\nand property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including\nuniversal interatomic potentials. This low-cost filtering step leads to\nsubstantial improvement in the success rates of all methods, remains\ncomputationally efficient, and ultimately provides a practical pathway toward\nmore effective generative strategies for materials discovery. By establishing\nbaselines for comparison, this work highlights opportunities for continued\nadvancement of generative models, especially for the targeted generation of\nnovel materials that are thermodynamically stable.",
