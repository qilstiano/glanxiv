    "abstract": "The rise and growing popularity of accessible large language models have\nraised questions about their impact on various aspects of life, including how\nscientists write and publish their research. The primary objective of this\npaper is to analyze a dataset consisting of all abstracts posted on arXiv.org\nbetween 2010 and June 7th, 2024, to assess the evolution of their readability\nand determine whether significant shifts occurred following the release of\nChatGPT in November 2022. Four standard readability formulas are used to\ncalculate individual readability scores for each paper, classifying their level\nof readability. These scores are then aggregated by year and across the eight\nprimary categories covered by the platform. The results show a steady annual\ndecrease in readability, suggesting that abstracts are likely becoming\nincreasingly complex. Additionally, following the release of ChatGPT, a\nsignificant change in readability is observed for 2023 and the analyzed months\nof 2024. Similar trends are found across categories, with most experiencing a\nnotable change in readability during 2023 and 2024. These findings offer\ninsights into the broader changes in readability and point to the likely\ninfluence of AI on scientific writing.",

    "abstract": "Thermodynamics, introduced over two centuries ago, remains foundational to\nour understanding of physical, chemical, biological, and engineering systems.\nIts principles are traditionally grounded in the statistical mechanics\nframework, which explains macroscopic behavior from microscopic states. In this\nwork, we propose an alternative approach that interprets thermodynamic behavior\nthrough the lenses of time series analysis, an approach commonly used in other\nfields, including finance, climate, and signal processing. We perform classical\nmolecular dynamics simulations of liquid water, the most complex, anomalous,\nand important substance known, over a wide range of its phase diagram. By\nexamining the temporal evolution of the hydrogen bond network (HBN) topology,\nwe demonstrate that the dynamics of microscopic topological motifs populating\nthe HBN encode the system's macroscopic thermodynamic behavior. Furthermore,\nour approach enables the prediction of thermodynamic properties in regions\nbeyond those directly sampled in our simulations. We achieve this result by\nleveraging artificial intelligence to uncover patterns in temporally resolved\ndata that are often lost through conventional averaging. This work offers new\ninsights into the fundamental behavior of water and network-forming materials\nmore broadly, establishing a new paradigm for understanding material properties\nbeyond the classical confines of statistical mechanics.",

Existing proposals often use some\ndescription of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For\na chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play\ntogether with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions\nwell. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization\nto graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free\ngraph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from\nmathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The\nsimple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small\nadjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range\nof different graphs.

    "abstract": "Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent\nyears, with words such as \"delve,\" \"intricate,\" and \"crucial\" showing\nsignificant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely\nattributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in\nthe discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in\nfrequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.\nThe present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve\nthe replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, \"crucial\"\nreplacing \"essential\" and \"key,\" or whether they reflect broader semantic and\npragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective \"important\"\nshows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze\ndecreasing lexical items. Our analysis of \"collapsing\" words reveals a more\ncomplex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts\nwith the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of\nlanguage change contribute to our understanding of how language technology\ncontinues to shape human language.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive computational approach to verify and\ninductively construct Hamiltonian paths for the Buratti--Horak--Rosa (BHR)\nConjecture. The conjecture posits that for any multiset $L$ of $p-1$ positive\nintegers not exceeding $\\lfloor p/2 \\rfloor$, there exists a Hamiltonian path\nin the complete graph $K_p$ with vertex-set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, p-1\\}$ whose edge\nlengths (under the cyclic metric) match $L$, if and only if for every divisor\n$d$ of $p$, the number of multiples of $d$ appearing in $L$ is at most $p - d$.\n  Building upon prior computational work by Mariusz Meszka, which verified the\nconjecture for all primes up to $p=23$, our Python program extends this\nverification significantly. We approach the problem by systematically\ngenerating frequency partitions (FPs) of edge lengths and employing a recursive\nbacktracking algorithm. We report successful computational verification for all\nfrequency partitions for integers $p < 32$, specifically presenting results for\n$p=31$ and a composite $p=26$. For the composite number $p=30$, the Python code\ntook approximately 11 hours to verify on a Lenovo laptop. For $p=16$, $167,898$\nvalid multisets were processed, taking around 20 hours on Google Colab Pro+.\n  Furthermore, we introduce and implement two constructive, inductive\nstrategies for building Hamiltonian paths: (1) increasing the multiplicity of\nan existing edge length, and (2) adding a new edge length. These methods,\nsupported by a reuse-insertion heuristic and backtracking search, demonstrate\nsuccessful constructions for evolving FPs up to $p=40$. Through these empirical\ntests and performance metrics, we provide strong computational evidence for the\nvalidity of the BHR conjecture within the scope tested, and outline the\nscalability of our approach for higher integer values.",

Four teams attempted to extract copyrighted content from GPT4DFCI\nacross four domains: literary works, news articles, scientific publications,\nand access-restricted clinical notes. Teams successfully extracted verbatim\nbook dedications and near-exact passages through various strategies. News\narticle extraction failed despite jailbreak attempts. Scientific article\nreproduction yielded only high-level summaries.

Differential success rates across content types suggest varying\nprotective mechanisms. The event led to implementation of a copyright-specific\nmeta-prompt in GPT4DFCI; this mitigation has been in production since Jan.\n2025.\n  Conclusion: Systematic red teaming revealed specific vulnerabilities in\ngenerative AI copyright compliance, leading to concrete mitigation strategies.\nAcademic medical institutions deploying generative AI should implement\ncontinuous testing protocols to ensure legal and ethical compliance.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models always make a prediction, even when they are\nlikely to be wrong. This causes problems in practical applications, as we do\nnot know if we should trust a prediction. ML with reject option addresses this\nissue by abstaining from making a prediction if it is likely to be incorrect.\nIn this work, we formalise the approach to ML with reject option in binary\nclassification, deriving theoretical guarantees on the resulting error rate.\nThis is achieved through conformal prediction (CP), which produce prediction\nsets with distribution-free validity guarantees. In binary classification, CP\ncan output prediction sets containing exactly one, two or no labels. By\naccepting only the singleton predictions, we turn CP into a binary classifier\nwith reject option.\n  Here, CP is formally put in the framework of predicting with reject option.\nWe state and prove the resulting error rate, and give finite sample estimates.\nNumerical examples provide illustrations of derived error rate through several\ndifferent conformal prediction settings, ranging from full conformal prediction\nto offline batch inductive conformal prediction. The former has a direct link\nto sharp validity guarantees, whereas the latter is more fuzzy in terms of\nvalidity guarantees but can be used in practice. Error-reject curves illustrate\nthe trade-off between error rate and reject rate, and can serve to aid a user\nto set an acceptable error rate or reject rate in practice.",

Their origin lies in the noncommutativity\nbetween the phonon Hamiltonian and angular momentum, which enables\ntime-dependent rotational dynamics even in symmetric vacua. We provide\nintuitive insight into the coherence underlying this phenomenon by drawing an\nanalogy with the beating between linearly polarized classical waves.

BASS\nprovides a powerful all-sky census of nearby AGN, minimizing obscuration biases\nand providing a robust dataset for studying AGN-host galaxy connections.\nClassifications are based on volunteer-based visual inspection on the\nZooniverse platform, adapted from Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (GZD). Dual-contrast grz\ncolor composite images, generated from public surveys (e.g., NOAO Legacy\nSurvey, Pan-STARRS, SDSS) and dedicated observations enabled key morphological\nfeatures to be identified. Our analysis reveals that, with respect to a control\nsample of inactive galaxies matched in redshift and i-band magnitude, BASS AGN\nhosts show a deficiency of smooth ellipticals (~70%) and disks with prominent\narms (~80%), while displaying an excess of mergers or disturbed systems\n(~400%), and disk galaxies without a spiral structure (~300%). These trends\nsuggest a preference for AGN activity in gas-rich, dynamically disturbed\nenvironments or transitional disk systems. We also find a higher bar fraction\namong AGN hosts than the control sample (~50% vs. ~30%). We further explore the\nrelations between AGN properties (e.g., X-ray luminosity, black hole mass, and\nEddington ratio) and host morphology, and find that high-luminosity and\nhigh-accretion AGN preferentially reside in smooth or point-like hosts. In\nparallel, lower-luminosity AGN are more common in disk galaxies. These results\nunderscore the importance of morphological studies in understanding the fueling\nand feedback mechanisms that drive AGN activity and their role in galaxy\nevolution.

Recently introduced multipath-based\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) can jointly localize a mobile\nagent and the reflective surfaces in radio frequency (RF) environments. Most\nexisting MP-SLAM methods assume that map features and their corresponding RF\npropagation paths are statistically independent, which neglects inherent\ndependencies arising when a single reflective surface contributes to different\npropagation paths or when an agent communicates with more than one base\nstation. Previous approaches that aim to fuse information across propagation\npaths are limited by their inability to perform ray tracing in environments\nwith nonconvex geometries. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian MP-SLAM method\nfor distributed MIMO systems that addresses this limitation. In particular, we\nuse amplitude statistics to establish adaptive time-varying detection\nprobabilities. Based on the resulting \"soft\" ray-tracing strategy, our method\ncan fuse information across propagation paths in RF environments with nonconvex\ngeometries. A Bayesian estimation method for the joint estimation of map\nfeatures and agent position is established by applying the message passing\nrules of the sum-product algorithm (SPA) to the factor graph that represents\nthe proposed statistical model. We also introduce an improved proposal PDF for\nparticle-based computation of SPA messages. This proposal PDF enables the early\ndetection of new surfaces that are solely supported by double-bounce paths.

The performance of the ML-based\nchannel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed\nchannel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the\nchannel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results\ndemonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel\nfeedback link without having to share ML models between device and network\nvendors.

In this study, we propose an\nautomatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized\nautoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT\n(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely\nused baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated\nusing the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter\ndataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show\nthat XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing\nthe types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the\ntargets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and\nundersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and\nimproving classification performance.

However, doping efficiency and outcomes in\nthese materials are strongly influenced by the complex interactions between\nintroduced dopants and intrinsic defects, particularly sulfur vacancies. This\ncoupling between dopants and defects can lead to distinctly different behaviors\ndepending on doping concentration, presenting significant challenges in the\npredictable and controlled design of TMD properties. For example, in this work\nwe systematically varied the p-type vanadium (V) doping density in tungsten\ndisulfide (WS2) monolayers and observed a transition in doping behavior. At low\nconcentrations, V-dopants enhance the native optical properties of WS2, as\nevidenced by increased photoluminescence, without introducing new electronic\nstates. However, at higher concentrations, V-dopants promote the formation of\nvanadium-sulfur vacancy complexes that generate mid-gap states, with energies\nthat can be precisely tuned by controlling the vanadium concentration. Using a\ncombination of excitation- and temperature-dependent photoluminescence\nmicroscopy, atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, and\nfirst-principles calculations, we identify attractive interactions between\np-type V-dopants and n-type monosulfur vacancies.

Upon maturation, core-1, comprising of the 57 residues (39-95) in\nthe N-terminus become structured, resulting in the formation of a\nnon-polymorphic fibril. The truncated FUS-LC-C (residues 110-214) construct\nforms a fibril in which core-2 (residues 112-150) adopts a $\\beta$-sheet\nstructure. Using coarse-grained monomer SOP-IDP model simulations of FUS-LC, we\npredict that residues 155-190 in the C-terminal (core-3) form rapidly, followed\nby core-2, and finally core-1. The time scale of formation of the cores and\ntheir stabilities are inversely correlated, as anticipated by the Ostwald's\nrule of stages. Unbiased multichain simulations show that the chemical\npotentials in the two phases are equal and the calculated densities of the\ndense and dilute phases are in agreement with experiments. The dense phase,\nwhich forms by a nucleation mechanism, coarsens over time by a process that is\nreminiscent of Ostwald ripening. AlphaFold predictions of the core-3 structure\nand the simulations show that $\\beta$-strand emerges in the core-3 region early\nduring the droplet formation, and drives the initiation of FUS-LC assembly.

    "abstract": "The search for life outside our solar system is at the forefront of modern\nastronomy, and telescopes such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) are\nbeing designed to identify biosignatures. Molecular oxygen, O$_2$, is\nconsidered a promising indication of life, yet substantial abiotic O$_2$ may\naccumulate from H$_2$O photolysis and hydrogen escape on a lifeless, fully\n(100%) ocean-covered terrestrial planet when surface O$_2$ sinks are\nsuppressed. This so-called waterworld false positive scenario could be ruled\nout with land detection because exposed land precludes extremely deep oceans\n(~50 Earth oceans) given topographic limits set by the crushing strength of\nrocks. Land detection is possible because plausible geologic surfaces exhibit\nincreasing reflectance with wavelength in the visible, whereas liquid water and\nice/snow have flat or decreasing reflectance, respectively. Here, we present\nreflected light retrievals to demonstrate that HWO could detect land on an\nexo-Earth in the disk-averaged spectrum. Given a signal-to-noise ratio of 20\nspectrum, Earth-like land fractions can be confidently detected with 0.3-1.1\n$\\mu$m spectral coverage (resolution R~140 in the visible, R~7 in the UV, with\nEarth-like atmosphere and clouds). We emphasize the need for UV spectroscopy\ndown to at least 0.3 $\\mu$m to break an O$_3$-land degeneracy. We find that the\nSNR and resolution requirements in the visible/UV imply that a larger aperture\n(~8 m) will be necessary to ensure the observing times required for land\ndetection are feasible for most HWO terrestrial habitable zone targets. These\nresults strongly inform the HWO minimum requirements to corroborate possible\noxygen biosignatures.",

We\nconsider missingness at random and additionally propose several specific\nmissing not at random (MNAR) assumptions.

Our simulations show that standard\nmultiple imputation techniques paired with a complete data estimator is\nunbiased when data are missing at random (MAR) but can be biased otherwise. For\neach of the MNAR assumptions, we instead propose doubly robust targeted maximum\nlikelihood estimators (TMLE), allowing misspecification of either (i) the\noutcome models or (ii) the exposure and missingness models. The proposed\nmethods are suitable for any outcome types, and we apply them to a motivating\nstudy that examines the effect of prescription opioid usage on all-cause\nmortality using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES).",

    "abstract": "Parameter estimation for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) plays a\nfundamental role in the analysis of dynamical systems. Generally lacking\nclosed-form solutions, ODEs are traditionally approximated using deterministic\nsolvers. However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that\nprobabilistic ODE solvers produce more reliable parameter estimates by better\naccounting for numerical uncertainty. Here we present rodeo, a Python library\nproviding a fast, lightweight, and extensible interface to a broad class of\nprobabilistic ODE solvers, along with several associated methods for parameter\ninference. At its core, rodeo provides a probabilistic solver that scales\nlinearly in both the number of evaluation points and system variables.\nFurthermore, by leveraging state-of-the-art automatic differentiation (AD) and\njust-in-time (JIT) compiling techniques, rodeo is shown across several examples\nto provide fast, accurate, and scalable parameter inference for a variety of\nODE systems.",

In such\nsystems, the mathematical data encoding fusion and statistics comprises a\nfinitely generated module over a Laurent polynomial ring $\\mathbb{Z}[t^\\pm]$\nequipped with a quadratic form giving the topological spin. The principle of\nremote detectability requires that every planon braids nontrivially with\nanother planon. While this is a necessary condition for physical realizability,\nwe observe - via a simple example - that it is not sufficient. This leads us to\npropose the $\\textit{excitation-detector principle}$ as a general feature of\ngapped quantum matter. For planon-only fracton orders, the principle requires\nthat every detector - defined as a string of planons extending infinitely in\nthe normal direction - braids nontrivially with some finite excitation. We\nprove this additional constraint is satisfied precisely by perfect theories of\nexcitations - those whose quadratic form induces a perfect Hermitian form. To\njustify the excitation-detector principle, we consider the 2d abelian anyon\ntheory obtained by spatially compactifying a planon-only fracton order in a\ntransverse direction. We prove the compactified 2d theory is modular if and\nonly if the original 3d theory is perfect, showing that the excitation-detector\nprinciple gives a necessary condition for physical realizability that we\nconjecture is also sufficient. A key ingredient is a structure theorem for\nfinitely generated torsion-free modules over $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^k} [t^\\pm]$, where\n$p$ is prime and $k$ a natural number. Finally, as a first step towards\nclassifying perfect theories of excitations, we prove that every theory of\nprime fusion order is equivalent to decoupled layers of 2d abelian anyon\ntheories.",

Now in its early\nstages of design, a list of the 164 most promising targets for HWO has been\nreleased to the community to carry out precursor science. Massive companions in\nthese systems--stars, brown dwarfs, or giant planets--could preclude the\nexistence of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone by impacting their\nlong-term dynamical stability. Here, we use astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia\nEDR3 to identify stars in the HWO preliminary target list that exhibit\nastrometric accelerations and determine joint constraints on the expected mass\nand separation of these companions. We find that 54 HWO targets have\nsignificant astrometric accelerations, 37 of which are accounted for by known\ngiant planets and stellar companions. Follow-up efforts are required to clarify\nthe specific nature of the suspected companions around the remaining 17\naccelerating stars. Stars without significant accelerations are used to rule\nout large regions of companion mass and separation down to planetary masses. We\nfind that with Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 we are $\\sim$85$\\%$ sensitive to 2\n$M_\\mathrm{Jup}$ planets between 4 and 10 AU.

    "abstract": "Data visualization tasks often require multi-step reasoning, and the\ninterpretive strategies experts use, such as decomposing complex goals into\nsmaller subtasks and selectively attending to key chart regions are rarely made\nexplicit. ViStruct is an automated pipeline that simulates these expert\nbehaviours by breaking high-level visual questions into structured analytic\nsteps and highlighting semantically relevant chart areas. Leveraging large\nlanguage and vision-language models, ViStruct identifies chart components, maps\nsubtasks to spatial regions, and presents visual attention cues to externalize\nexpert-like reasoning flows. While not designed for direct novice instruction,\nViStruct provides a replicable model of expert interpretation that can inform\nthe development of future visual literacy tools. We evaluate the system on 45\ntasks across 12 chart types and validate its outputs with trained visualization\nusers, confirming its ability to produce interpretable and expert-aligned\nreasoning sequences.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the black hole information paradox in the setting of\npseudo-complex gravity, a covariant geometric extension of general relativity\nthat introduces a minimal length scale by deforming the spacetime manifold. In\nthis framework, curvature invariants stay finite, and the classical singularity\nis geometrically regularized via a smooth core. We show that the correction\nterm B/(6r**4) alters the Schwarzschild metric, generating the regularized\ngeometry above, yielding a finite Hawking temperature, and inducing subleading\ncorrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Crucially, we demonstrate that\nthe pseudo-complex geometric structure obstructs a clean factorization of the\nHilbert space into interior and exterior regions, thereby removing the key\nassumption behind the standard derivation of the paradox. This structural\nreinterpretation of entanglement flow offers a new geometric route to unitarity\npreservation and information recovery. We examine the resulting effects on\nevaporation dynamics, entropy flow, and thermodynamic behavior. Our predictions\nare compared with those of generalized uncertainty principles (GUP), loop\nquantum gravity (LQG), and island-based models, and are summarized in a\ncomparative table. Observable signatures-such as shifts in quasi-normal mode\nfrequencies and the appearance of gravitational wave echoes from the\nregularized core-suggest that pseudo-complex gravity is a testable, covariant\napproach to resolving the paradox without invoking firewalls, holography, or\nexotic quantum states.",

However, most standard equilibrium\nsolvers are time-independent and do not include dynamic effects such as plasma\ncurrent flux consumption, induced vessel currents, or voltage constraints.\nAnother class of tools, plasma equilibrium evolution simulators, do include\ntime-dependent effects. These are generally structured to solve the forward\nproblem of evolving the plasma equilibrium given feedback-controlled voltages.\nIn this work, we introduce GSPulse, a novel algorithm for equilibrium\ntrajectory optimization, that is more akin to a pulse planner than a pulse\nsimulator. GSPulse includes time-dependent effects and solves the inverse\nproblem: given a user-specified set of target equilibrium shapes, as well as\nlimits on the coil currents and voltages, the optimizer returns trajectories of\nthe voltages, currents, and achievable equilibria. This task is useful for\nscoping performance of a tokamak and exploring the space of achievable pulses.\nThe computed equilibria satisfy both Grad-Shafranov force balance and\naxisymmetric circuit dynamics. The optimization is performed by restructuring\nthe free-boundary equilibrium evolution (FBEE) equations into a form where it\nis computationally efficient to optimize the entire dynamic sequence. GSPulse\ncan solve for hundreds of equilibria simultaneously within a few minutes.\nGSPulse has been validated against NSTX-U and MAST-U experiments and against\nSPARC feedback control simulations, and is being used to perform scenario\ndesign for SPARC. The computed trajectories can be used as feedforward inputs\nto inform and improve feedback performance.

This new sampling method is\ntraining-free and uses an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver.

In addition, by design our solver allows to\ncontrol the level of detail through a simple hyper-parameter at no extra\ncomputational cost. We present how our approach leverages momentum dynamics by\nestablishing a fundamental equivalence between momentum diffusion models and\nconventional diffusion models with respect to their training paradigms.\nMoreover, we observe the use of higher-dimensional noise naturally exhibits\ncharacteristics similar to stochastic differential equations (SDEs).

In this study, we constrain\nthis faint-end slope, modeled with a Schechter-like distribution, by searching\nfor potential associations between bursts from the CHIME/FRB Catalog-1 and\ngalaxies in the local volume. We cross-matched Catalog-1 FRBs with 495 local\nvolume galaxies within 21 Mpc, identified from the HECATE catalog, and found no\nassociations. Assuming the FRB energy function extends to $\\sim 3 \\times\n10^{34}$ erg-the energy of the Galactic magnetar burst from SGR 1935+2154-this\nnull result constrains $\\gamma$ to be $<$ 2.3 (95% confidence upper limit),\nrepresenting the first empirical estimate for extragalactic FRBs at such low\nenergies. This finding supports the hypothesis that the FRB population is\ndominated by bright, likely cosmological bursts with a relatively flat energy\ndistribution ($\\gamma < 2.5$). However, the constraint weakens if higher energy\nthresholds are assumed. A flatter energy function is consistent with the\nobserved anti-correlation between FRB dispersion measure and fluence, as seen\nacross various observational bands. While the contribution of low-energy\nbursts, such as those from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, appears\nminimal, our results suggest that normal magnetars like SGR 1935+2154 could\ndominate the FRB population if their burst rates and energies scale with age\nand magnetic field.

M1 is organized\nin a somatotopic manner, such that M1 output driving movement to different\nparts of the body is organized along the cortical surface. In primates, the arm\nand hand are represented in M1 as separate but overlapping territories. Unit\nactivity recorded from the M1 forelimb representation comodulates with\nparameters related to reaching and/or grasping. The overall aim of this\ndissertation is to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of M1 activity that\nproduces reach-to-grasp movements. To address this goal, intracortical\nmicrostimulation (ICMS) is delivered along the precentral gyrus of two macaque\nmonkeys to define the M1 motor map. Subsequently, cortical activity is recorded\nfrom the M1 forelimb representation using intrinsic signal optical imaging\n(ISOI) while macaques execute an instructed reach-to-grasp task. Results from\nimaging experiments produce spatial maps that define cortical territories with\nincreased activity during reach-to-grasp movements. Next, unit activity was\nrecorded from the M1 forelimb representation with a laminar multielectrode\nwhile macaques completed the same reach-to-grasp task. Recording site locations\ndiffered between sessions to comprehensively sample unit responses throughout\nthe M1 forelimb representation. Imaging experiments reveal that activity\nsupporting reach-to-grasp movements was concentrated in patches that comprise\nless than half of the M1 forelimb representation. Electrophysiology recordings\nreveal that activity related to reaching is spatially organized within M1\ndistinctly from activity related to grasping. The results support the idea that\nspatial organizing principles are inherent in M1 activity that supports\nreach-to-grasp movements.",

    "abstract": "We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability\nSpace (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential\nlimitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global\ndistributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP\nemerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe\nthat latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an\noptimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A\nlower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this\nphenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary\nLatent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent\nrepresentations. These binary latents are used as the input to our\nAutoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model\noutputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect\nmemorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the\nLocal Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability\narising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive\nexperiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.",

This\nyields exactly 60 possible local states. The automaton applies local,\nparity-aware rules that collectively reconstruct the global arithmetic of the\nCollatz map. We show that all symbolic trajectories converge in finitely many\nsteps to a unique terminal cycle (4, 0, 0) -> (2, 0, 0) -> (1, 0, 0), with all\nhigher digit positions degenerating to the absorbing state (0, 0, 0).

    "abstract": "This paper explores the fair allocation of indivisible items in a\nmultidimensional setting, motivated by the need to address fairness in complex\nenvironments where agents assess bundles according to multiple criteria. Such\nmultidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are\ncentral to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources\nare evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network\nbandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to\ncapture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we\nstudy two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up\nto c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods\n(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'\npreferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each\ndimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a\ndifferent set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the\nstrong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the\nenvied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide\nupper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the\nexistence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are\nindependent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms\nfor checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists. Moreover, we\nestablish NP-hardness results for checking the existence of weak sEF1 and\nstrong sEF1 allocations.",

To address\nthese challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the\ndiffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis\nof time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and\nmulti-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by\ndiffusion-based training.

Furthermore, recognizing\nthat diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR\ntasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,\nfurther enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in\nsingle-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.\nNotably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing\ngeneral IR architectures.",

To\nperform this matching we follow the approach of identifying the corresponding\nscattering amplitudes for physical processes in both theories, instead of the\nmost usual approach of relating the corresponding effective Lagrangians or\neffective actions. In this work we focus on the physical processes of double\nand triple Higgs production from weak boson fusion, in particular, $WW \\to HH$,\n$ZZ \\to HH$, $WW \\to HHH$ and $ZZ \\to HHH$ and complement them with the elastic\nscattering $HH \\to HH$.

Temperature fluctuation differences for two celestial\nhemispheres, Hubble tension, voids, dipole modulation, anisotropic inflation\netc motivates us to think beyond the $\\Lambda$CDM model and cosmological\nprinciple. Bianchi-I model portrays anisotropic universe imposing shear. $f(Q)$\nmodel also enables us to produce early inflation to late deSitter universe\nwithout the requirement of $\\Lambda$CDM. Embarrassment regarding fine tuning or\ncoincidences can be avoided alongwith. So, this article finds different\nstationary points of cosmic evolution with $f(Q)$ models habilitating in\nBianchi-I anisotropic universe. Depending on models' nature, fixed points with\ndifferent categories are found. Perturbations are followed wherever are\napplicable. While pursuing cosmological implications towards these fixed\npoints, some are found to be formed only for the consideration of $f(Q)$\ngravity and Bianchi-I both. Besides different prediction towards early\ninflation to late time expansion which are available in existing literature of\ndynamical system studies, occurances of ultra slow roll inflation is predicted.\nFor particular $f(Q)$ model, shear is predicted to decay leaving behind a\nconstant valued residue. This models a universe that gradually turns more\nhomogeneous. In some other models, depending on initial conditions, a final\nisotropic leftover is marked as the future fate of anisotropic world.

Although such models can\ngenerate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling\ndemands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nwith high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the\nnumber of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this\nwork, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity\ntradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length\nof the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the\ntransformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its\nlength. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow\nmatching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an\narbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our\nODE$_t$(ODE$_l$) approach is solver-agnostic in time dimension and decreases\nboth latency and memory usage. Compared to the previous state of the art, image\ngeneration experiments on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet show a latency reduction of up\nto 3$\\times$ in the most efficient sampling mode, and a FID score improvement\nof up to 3.5 points for high-quality sampling.

CNNs are effective at capturing spatial\nartifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.\nHowever, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal\nfeatures independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use\nseparate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine\nthem using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which\nlimits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we\npropose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse\nspatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows\ntemporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing\nthe model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as\nflickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization\nand deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across\ndiverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model\nusing the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both\nintra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.\nOur model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an\naccuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations.

In this paper, we\nconsider two approaches to studying 2-dimensional SFTs: textile systems and\nrank-2 graphs. Nasu's textile systems describe all two-sided 2D SFTs up to\nconjugacy, whereas the 2-graphs (higher-rank graphs of rank 2) introduced by\nKumjian and Pask yield associated C*-algebras. Both models have a\nnaturally-associated notion of insplitting. We show that these notions do not\ncoincide, raising the question of whether insplitting a 2-graph induces a\nconjugacy of the associated one-sided 2-dimensional SFTs.\n  Our first main result shows how to reconstruct 2-graph insplitting using\ntextile-system insplits and inversions, and consequently proves that 2-graph\ninsplitting induces a conjugacy of dynamical systems. We also present several\nother facets of the relationship between 2-graph insplitting and textile-system\ninsplitting. Incorporating an insplit of the bottom graph of the textile system\nturns out to be key to this relationship. By articulating the connection\nbetween operator-algebraic and dynamical notions of insplitting in two\ndimensions, this article lays the groundwork for a C*-algebraic framework for\nclassifying one-sided conjugacy in higher-dimensional SFTs.",

The\nmethod is based on our previously published theoretical framework considering\nthe optimization of heterostructural bilayer films. To demonstrate our method,\nwe have estimated the pinning energy of a typical BaZrO$_3$-nanocolumn within\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ lattice using the experimental data from our previous\nstudy. Our calculations result in pinning energy of 0.04 eV/nm for a $c$-axis\noriented vortex, which is in excellent agreement with a widely used theoretical\nformula for artificial columnar defects. However, the estimated energy is\nsignificantly higher than what has been previously reported for\nBaZrO$_3$-nanocolumns based on magnetic relaxation measurements. We argue that\nthis discrepancy originates from the previously raised issues concerning the\nreliability of the magnetic relaxation measurements in determining the pinning\nenergy. While the presented study only considers BaZrO$_3$-nanocolumns in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, the demonstrated method is equally applicable to any\npinning site and superconducting material.

At the same time, little to no\ndependence on the accretion rate is found. However, the significance of such\ntrends have been limited. Here we present kth-nearest-neighbor (kNN) statistics\nof 2MASS galaxies around AGN from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic survey.

By calculating the distances to the\nnearest 7 galaxy neighbors in angular separation to each AGN within two\nredshift ranges(0.01 < z < 0.03 and 0.03 < z < 0.06), we compare their\ncumulative distribution functions to that of a randomly distributed sample to\nshow the sensitivity of this method to the clustering of AGN. We also split the\nAGN into bins of bolometric luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio\n(while controlling for redshift) to search for trends between kNN statistics\nand fundamental AGN properties. We find that AGN with massive SMBHs have\nsignificantly closer neighbors than AGN with less-massive SMBHs (at the 99.98%\nconfidence level), especially in our lower redshift range. We find less\nsignificant trends with luminosity or Eddington ratio. By comparing our results\nto empirical SMBH-galaxy-halo models implemented in N-body simulations, we show\nthat small-scale kNN trends with black hole mass may go beyond stellar mass\ndependencies. This suggests that massive SMBHs in the local universe reside in\nmore massive dark matter halos and denser regions of the cosmic web, which may\nindicate that environment is important for the growth of SMBHs.",

To address the nonlinearity and severe ill-posedness\nof this phaseless inverse scattering problem, we introduce a robust, globally\nconvergent numerical framework combining several key regularization strategies.\nOur method first employs a phase retrieval step based on the\nWentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB) ansatz, where the lost phase information is\nreconstructed by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. Subsequently, we\nimplement a Fourier-based dimension reduction technique, transforming the\noriginal problem into a more stable system of elliptic equations with Cauchy\nboundary conditions. To solve this resulting system reliably, we apply the\nCarleman convexification approach, constructing a strictly convex weighted cost\nfunctional whose global minimizer provides an accurate approximation of the\ntrue solution. Numerical simulations using synthetic data with high noise\nlevels demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method,\nconfirming its capability to accurately recover both the geometric location and\ncontrast of hidden scatterers.",

Using a modified JADE secular code\nincorporating GW energy loss, we systematically investigate a seven-dimensional\nparameter space: masses of three BHs (5-100 $M_\\odot$ inner binary, 1-200\n$M_\\odot$ tertiary), inner/outer semimajor axes (1-200 AU and 100-10,000 AU),\nouter orbit eccentricity (0-0.9), and mutual inclination (40{\\deg}-80{\\deg}).\nWe employed an adaptive MCMC approach sampling the merger/nonmerger transition\nboundary across nearly 15 million simulations. Results reveal merger-conducive\nregions correspond to asymmetric inner binary masses, large inner separations\nwhere von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism operates effectively without\nrelativistic precession suppression, small outer separations providing stronger\nperturbations, and large outer eccentricities bringing the tertiary closer at\npericenter. Merger probability correlates positively with mutual inclination.\nWe developed a classification scheme for nonmerging systems based on GW\nemission and ZLK oscillations.

Significant progress has\nbeen made over the past two decades on increasing the functional complexity of\nphotonic chips. However, the most critical challenge that remains is the lack\nof scalable techniques to overcome perturbations arising from environmental\nthermal noise and thermal crosstalk from co-packaged electronics and other\nphotonic devices sharing the same substrate. Here, we propose and demonstrate a\nfully-integrated scheme to monitor and stabilize the temperature of a high-Q\nmicroresonator in a Si-based chip. We show that when stabilized, the\nmicroresonator exhibits remarkable resilience against external thermal noise\nand can serve as a fully-integrated photonic frequency reference. By simply\nchanging the temperature set-point, the cavity resonance frequency can be\nrepeatably tuned without any hysteresis over several hours. We also show that\nthe frequency of a distributed feedback (DFB) laser can be stabilized to this\nmicroresonator and realize a 48 dB reduction in its frequency drift, resulting\nin its center wavelength staying within +-0.5 pm of the mean over the duration\nof 50 hours in the presence of significant ambient fluctuations. This\nperformance is superior to many commercial DFB systems and is highly suitable\nfor use in data-communication systems. Finally, we demonstrate that the\ntechnique can be implemented to stabilize a soliton modelocked Kerr comb\nagainst significant ambient and crosstalk thermal noise, without the need for\nphotodetection, paving the way for Kerr-comb-based photonic devices that can\noperate in the desired modelocked state indefinitely.",

However, the extensive deployment of RIS elements imposes\nconsiderable channel acquisition overhead, with the high density of nodes and\nantennas in RIS-assisted CF networks amplifying this challenge. To tackle this\nissue, in this paper, we explore integrating RIS-user equipment (UE)\nassociation into downlink RIS-assisted CF transmitter design, which greatly\nreduces the channel acquisition costs. The key point is that once UEs are\nassociated with specific RISs, there is no need to frequently acquire channels\nfrom non-associated RISs. Then, we formulate the problem of joint RIS-UE\nassociation and beamforming at APs and RISs to maximize the weighted sum rate\n(WSR). In particular, we propose a two-stage framework to solve it. In the\nfirst stage, we apply a many-to-many matching algorithm to establish the RIS-UE\nassociation. In the second stage, we introduce a sequential optimization-based\nmethod that decomposes the joint optimization of RIS phase shifts and AP\nbeamforming into two distinct subproblems. To optimize the RIS phase shifts, we\nemploy the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to obtain a\nsemi-closed-form solution. For AP beamforming, we develop a joint block\ndiagonalization algorithm, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that,\nwhile RIS-UE association significantly reduces overhead, it incurs a minor\nperformance loss that remains within an acceptable range.

This paper\nintroduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences\nmanually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects\nMymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly\nfeatures political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio\npolitical landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.\nEach sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic\nlabeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and\nmultilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,\nContempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native\ntranslators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance\nperformed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong\nconsistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic\nchecks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a\ncritical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla\ndialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.",

However, recent studies\nindicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms\ninherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.\nMotivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing\nframework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed\nto systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing\nlanguage model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as\nefficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing\nclassifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of\neither the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the\nmessage-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach\nisolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,\navoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge\nProbing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge\nencoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,\nconsistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations\nacross different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and\nsemantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation\noperations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on\nmessage-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative\nimpacts on probing task performance.",

However, the use\nof SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary\nimages, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals.

The source spectra at different regions of the branches are well\ndescribed by accretion disk emission, blackbody surface emission and a thermal\nComptonization component. In the NB, the total bolometric unabsorbed flux\nremains constant and the variation is due to changes in the Comptonization,\ndisk fluxes. In particular, the inferred luminosity ($L_{\\rm T}$) and accretion\nrate ($\\dot M$) remain constant, while there is significant variation in the\ninner disk radii and fraction of disk photons entering the corona, indicating\nchanges in the geometry of the system.

    "abstract": "Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning\nand behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon,\nreal-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning\n(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential\nto enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions\nremains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two\nfundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible\nintermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning\nsignals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts\ngeneralization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we\npresent Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework\ndesigned for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.\nSpecifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate\nsignals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative\npolicy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into\nGRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting\nautonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce\nMulti-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the\neffectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing\nstate-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19%\n(multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also\nachieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all\nopen-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving\nembodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support\nthe potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.",

We work out the\nQNM causality condition, crucial to eliminate amplitude divergences and to\nincorporate horizon redshift effects. We then use it to derive a model of the\ntime-dependent QNM excitation via a Green's function approach, driven by the\npoint-particle source on a given trajectory. Our model predicts that: i) QNMs\npropagates along hyperboloidal slices in the minimal gauge; ii) the signal is\ncomposed of an ``activation'' term, depending on the source past history, and a\nlocal ``impulsive'' term; iii) amplitudes grow in time in an ``activation\nfunction'' fashion, and the waveform displays a stationary ringdown regime at\ntimes $\\sim 10-20M$ after its peak; iv) at these late times, an infinite tower\nof non-oscillatory, exponentially-damped terms appear: the redshift modes. The\nmodel is in good agreement with numerical solutions, capturing the main\nwaveform features after the peak. Additional components of the Green's function\nare required to complement the QNM description and reproduce the plunge-merger\nwaveform. We predict the late-time, stationary amplitude of the quadrupolar\nmode as a function of eccentricity, in agreement with accurate numerical\nsolutions, marking the first time that QNM amplitudes are predicted for generic\nbinary configurations.

    "abstract": "One challenge with explaining how high levels of planetary debris can enrich,\nor \"pollute\", old ($\\sim$3 Gyr) and very old ($\\sim$10 Gyr) white dwarfs is\nthat debris reservoirs deplete on shorter timescales, akin to the solar\nsystem's already eviscerated Main Belt and Kuiper Belt. Here, I explore how\nthese extrasolar reservoirs can be resupplied through supernovae that propel\ndistant ($\\gtrsim 10^4$ au) dust, sand and pebbles, and potentially boulders\nand comets, into the inner ($\\lesssim 10^2$ au) planetary system. I\nanalytically constrain the geometry of these blast waves, and derive\nexpressions for the probability of apt blast configurations occurring. I then\nderive the minimum kick magnitudes needed to generate stable, leaky and broken\npost-blast orbits, and prove that within this formalism, at most 23 per cent of\ntrue anomalies along an eccentric orbit could allow for resupplied planetary\ndebris to experience repeated pericentre passages. By linking these kick\nmagnitudes with debris sizes and relating these quantities to the local\nneighbourhood supernova rate, I conclude that the probabilities for ejection or\nresupply per supernova blast are $\\approx$100 per cent for micron-sized dust\nand millimetre-sized pebbles and sand, and $\\approx$0 per cent for asteroids\nlarger than $\\sim$10 km. In between these extremes, I expect metre-sized\nboulders to be resupplied at least once to very old white dwarfs over their\ncooling ages. The efficacy of this debris delivery mechanism is dependent on\nthe time-varying sources and sinks in an exo-Oort cloud and how its parent\nwhite dwarf has, throughout its cooling age, traversed the Milky Way.",

    "abstract": "As 6G evolves, wireless networks become essential for critical operations and\nenable innovative applications that demand seamless adaptation to dynamic\nenvironments and disruptions. Because these vital services require\nuninterrupted operation, their resilience to unforeseen disruptions is\nessential. However, implementing resilience necessitates rapid recovery\nprocedures, which operate in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, where short\npackets and added error-correction overhead can severely degrade communication\nefficiency. Due to this performance loss, always attempting recovery can\nbackfire and result in worse outcomes than simply enduring the disruption under\nlonger blocklengths. In this work, we study these effects of FBL constraints\nwithin a resilience framework, incorporating reconfigurable intelligent\nsurfaces (RIS) to enhance adaptation capabilities. By actively shaping the\nwireless environment, RIS help counteract some of the performance losses caused\nby FBL, enabling more effective recovery from disruptions. Numerical results\nreveal two critical blocklength thresholds: the first enables full recovery\nfrom the FBL penalty, while the second, at a higher blocklength, allows the\nsystem to recover from both the FBL penalty and the initial disruption,\nyielding a significant improvement in resilience performance. Additionally, we\nshow that the number of RIS elements shifts these thresholds, enabling faster\nreconfiguration with shorter blocklengths and providing insights to the\ntrade-offs between rate, blocklength, and reconfiguration effort under FBL\nconditions.",

Its mass is\nprotected by conformal invariance and it can be searched for in tabletop\nexperiments. However, contrary to standard pNGBs of internal symmetries, the\ndilaton generically has a large non-derivative self-coupling, leading to\nradiative contributions to its mass of the order of its decay constant. Hence\ntypical ultralight dilatons should also have sub-eV decay constants, which\nwould incur significant deviations from standard DM behavior at structure\nformation times, in severe tension with observations. Therefore, a fine-tuning\nis required to generate a hierarchy between the mass and the decay constant. In\nthis work, we consider whether supersymmetry (SUSY) can be used to protect this\nhierarchy from quantum corrections. To ensure an ultralight dilaton mass robust\nagainst realistic SUSY-breaking contributions, we must consider a novel dilaton\nstabilization mechanism. The observed DM abundance can be produced by the\nmisalignment mechanism for dilaton masses ranging from $10^{-11}$ to $1$ eV.\nUnfortunately, irreducible SUSY-breaking corrections due to gravity restrict\nthe couplings between the dilaton and the Standard Model to be extremely small,\nbeyond the reach of any current or proposed experiments. Our work demonstrates\nthat constructing a consistent model of ultralight dilaton DM is quite\ninvolved.",

To investigate this, we compute a large suite of\nphotoionization models from Cloudy powered by stellar populations and accreting\nblack holes over a large grid of ages, metallicities, initial mass functions,\nbinarity, ionization parameters, densities, and black hole masses. We use these\nmodels to test three rest-frame optical strong line ratio diagnostics which\nhave been designed to separate ionizing sources at low redshifts: the\n[NII]-BPT, VO87, and OHNO diagrams. We show that the position of a model in\nthese diagrams is strongly driven by the ionization parameter (log U) and the\ngas-phase metallicity, often more so than the ionizing spectrum itself; in\nparticular, there is significant overlap between stellar population and\naccreting black hole models at high log U and low Z. We show that the OHNO\ndiagram is especially susceptible to large contamination of the AGN region\ndefined at z=1 for stellar models with high log U and low Z, consistent with\nmany observed JWST spectra at high redshift. We show that the optical line\nratio diagnostics are most sensitive to the shape of the <54 eV ionizing\ncontinuum, and that the derived ionizing sources for a given set of optical\nstrong line ratios can be highly degenerate. Finally, we demonstrate that very\nhigh ionization (>54 eV) emission lines that trace ionizing sources harder than\nnormal stellar populations help to break the degeneracies present when using\nthe strong line diagnostics alone, even in gas conditions consistent with those\nat high redshifts.",

We compute the training loss and evaluate\ngeneralization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code\ngeneration, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.\n  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the\npretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter\ngrokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's \"emergence of\ngeneralization\" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find\nthat training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve\nfrom random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between\nsamples. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the\nconverged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization \"knowledge\ndigestion\", providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In\nthe study, we develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the\ncomplexity of a single pathway. We show their ability to predict the\ngeneralization improvement on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient,\nsimple to compute and solely dependent on training data.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced\ngrounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit\nhallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the\nimage content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing\nevaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or\ntextual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their\ncapacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce\nHalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate\nhallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual\nreasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual\ninstance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly\nintroduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually\ncoherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art\nvision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations\nare significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often\npersisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual\nreasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research\nhas been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by\nselecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data\nfiltering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy\ncan be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.\nTherefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM\ntraining.",

Third, our method\nreduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input\nlengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy.

While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents\npolicy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes\nsamples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative\nsamples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to\npenalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages\nmore concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We\napply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B\nsignificantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\\% gain over\nthe base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning\nbenchmarks.

The\ncritical point can be reached by tuning a single parameter in a Hamiltonian\nwith the same symmetry as the XXZ model, without further fine-tuning.\nEquivalently, it can arise in systems of bosons with particle-hole symmetry, as\na long-range-ordered transition point between two quasi-long-range-ordered\nsuperfluids. Our approach is to start with the continuum field theory of the\nisotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet and consider generic perturbations that\nrespect easy-plane symmetry. We argue for a renormalization-group flow to a\ncritical point where long-range order in $(S^x, S^y)$ is enabled by coexisting\ncritical fluctuations of $S^z$. (We also discuss multicritical points where\nfurther parameters are tuned to zero.) These results show that it is much\neasier to break continuous symmetries in 1D than standard lore would suggest.\nThe failure of standard intuition for 1D chains (based on the\nquantum--classical correspondence) can be attributed to Berry phases, which\nprevent the 1+1D system from mapping to a classical 2D spin model.

The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is a\ncommon tool for tackling this problem.

These UVdim stars predominantly lie on the blue MS, which is composed\nof slow rotators, and their distinct UV properties are believed to stem from\ndusty circumstellar disks. Although eMSTOs are common in both Magellanic Clouds\nand Galactic open clusters (OCs) of comparable ages, UVdim stars have not yet\nbeen investigated in Galactic OCs. In this work, we fill that gap by combining\nSwift/UVOT, SkyMapper, and Gaia photometry to extend the search for UVdim stars\nto 35 Galactic OCs younger than 2 Gyr. By constructing colour-colour diagrams\nanalogous to those employed with HST WFC3/UVIS, we find no evidence of\nUVdim-like stars in most Galactic open clusters and identify possible UVdim\ncandidates in only five systems. The rarity of UVdim stars in young OCs\nsuggests a potential difference between Magellanic Cloud clusters and their\nMilky Way counterparts, although the underlying reason remains unclear.",

Here, we report\ntemperature dependent Raman scattering study of PdTe$_2$ in the temperature\nrange from 10 K to 300 K. Our study reveals emergence of a new unreported peak\nbelow 100 K, centered around 250 cm$^{-1}$. We argue that the new mode is not a\nphonon mode because the Raman spectra calculated using Density Functional\nTheory shows only two intense peaks at 85 $ cm^{-1}$ and 128 $cm^{-1}$. To\nascertain the origin of this new peak, we constructed a microscopic model of\nelectrons coupling to a single plasmon mode at 250 $cm^{-1}$ and using the\nmemory function formalism, we obtained that the Raman relaxation rate is linear\nin frequency. We also performed phenomenological analysis of the Raman response\nfrom the experimental data and computed frequency dependent Raman relaxation\nrate, which is also found to exhibit a linear dependence on frequency. With the\ncongruence of our theoretical and phenomenological results we could ascertain\nthat the new mode observed at low temperatures is indeed a plasmon-like mode.\nFurther, phonon frequencies and line widths of the two phonon modes exhibit\nanomalous behavior above 100 K.",

These features exhibit highly complex dynamics and are a necessary\nconnecting link between the cooler, denser solar chromosphere and the extremely\nhot, tenuous corona. In this work, we explore the spatial and temporal relation\nbetween solar spicules and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) shocks using data from a\n2D radiative MHD (rMHD) simulation of the solar atmosphere driven by solar\nconvection. Here, we demonstrate, through direct identification, that slow MHD\nshocks, which propagate along magnetic field lines, are regions of strong\npositive vertical acceleration of the plasma that forms the tip of the spicule\nmaterial during its rise phase. We quantify the effect of pressure and Lorentz\nforces on the acceleration of the plasma inside the shocks during the rise of\nspicules. The causality between spicule and shock propagation in the atmosphere\nof the model is also investigated. It is further shown that the strength of\nthese shocks may play a vital role in determining the height of the spicules,\nsupporting the idea that shocks act as drivers of some spicules. In addition,\nwe also find the presence of structures similar to propagating coronal\ndisturbances (PCDs) in the simulation, linked with the spicules. Here, PCDs\nappear to be associated with the shock waves driving the spicules that\nsubsequently propagate into the corona and have similar speeds to those\nreported in observations.",

C++ has inherited this approach towards exporting interfaces from C,\nbut the approach is clunky, unreliable, and slow.

Moreover, they are constrained\nby the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training.

Existing\ntraining-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the\nuse of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during\ngeneration, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes,\nand degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome\nthese challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a\nnovel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text\ngeneration with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC\nstep-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image\nand the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of\ncandidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual\nbaseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually\ngrounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time\ncontext alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring\nthe overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted\nacross diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA,\nInstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces\nhallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference\nefficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes.

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ten frontier\nagentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error\nanalysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,\nOpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while\nspending half the time, highlighting its great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web\n2 provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next\ngeneration of agentic search systems.",

However, the manual modeling of\nfaulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models\nthat are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this\nchallenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that\nintegrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process\nmining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected\nfrom low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These\nanomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the\ndiscovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By\nincorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach\nsupports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root\ncause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using\nthe Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart\nmanufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling,\nsimulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation\nof comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the\ndevelopment of digital twins for industrial environments.",

    "abstract": "In the context of having an instrumental variable, the standard practice in\ncausal inference begins by targeting an effect of interest and proceeds by\nformulating assumptions enabling identification of this effect. We turn this\naround by simply not making assumptions anymore and just adhere to the\ninterventions we can identify, rather than starting with a desired causal\nestimand and imposing untestable hypotheses. The randomization of an instrument\nand its exclusion restriction define a class of auxiliary stochastic\ninterventions on the treatment that are implied by stochastic interventions on\nthe instrument. This mapping effectively characterizes the identifiable causal\neffects of the treatment on the outcome given the observable probability\ndistribution, leading to an explicit transparent G-computation formula under\nhidden confounding. Alternatively, searching for an intervention on the\ninstrument whose implied one best approximates a desired target -- whose causal\neffect the user aims to estimate -- naturally leads to a projection on a\nfunction space representing the closest identifiable treatment effect. The\ngenerality of this projection allows to select different norms and indexing\nsets for the function class that turn optimization into different estimation\nprocedures with the Highly Adaptive Lasso. This shift from identification under\nassumptions to identification under observation redefines how the problem of\ncausal inference is approached.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by\ncombining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the\nnumber of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the\nframe rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets.\nMoreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when\nacquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot\ndenoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances\ncontrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the\navailable transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form\ncompound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are\nthen used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme,\nenabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical\nstructures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while\nthe underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows\nthe network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the\nconsistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no\ndomain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across\nanatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports\nefficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight\narchitecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers.

    "abstract": "People make strategic decisions multiple times a day. We act strategically in\nnegotiations, when we coordinate our actions with others, or when we choose\nwith whom to cooperate. The resulting dynamics can be studied with evolutionary\ngame theory. This framework explores how people adapt their decisions over\ntime, in light of how effective their strategies have proven to be. A crucial\nquantity in respective models is the strength of selection. This quantity\nregulates how likely individuals switch to a better strategy when given the\nchoice. The larger the selection strength, the more biased is the learning\nprocess in favor of strategies with large payoffs. Therefore, this quantity is\noften interpreted as a measure of rationality. Traditionally, most models take\nselection strength to be a fixed parameter. Instead, here we allow the\nindividuals' strategies and their selection strength to co-evolve. The\nendpoints of this co-evolutionary process depend on the strategic interaction\nin place. In many prisoner's dilemmas, selection strength increases\nindefinitely, as one may expect. However, in snowdrift or stag-hunt games, it\ncan either converge to a finite value, or we observe evolutionary branching\naltogether - such that different individuals arrive at different selection\nstrengths. Overall, this work sheds light on how evolution might shape learning\nmechanisms for social behavior. It suggests that boundedly rational learning is\nnot only a by-product of cognitive constraints. Instead it might also evolve as\na means to gain strategic advantages.",

    "abstract": "Quantum gravity in a closed universe faces two a priori distinct yet\nseemingly related issues: the problem of time and the fact that its Hilbert\nspace dimension is one. Both have been argued to be resolvable by formulating\nphysics relative to an observer. Using a simple gravitational path integral\nmodel, we explain that the two issues arise from two distinct non-perturbative\neffects: the former from summing over metrics and the latter from summing over\ntopologies. We then revisit the Page-Wootters mechanism, one of the earliest\nframeworks for formulating quantum mechanics relative to an observer, see how\nit applies to both issues, and introduce some new ingredients. In particular,\nwe emphasize a hierarchy between an observer and a timekeeper. An observer is a\nsubsystem of the universe whose specification results in a nontrivial Hilbert\nspace, while a timekeeper is an observer with a specified history that can be\nused as a reference for the time of the environment and experiences a\nnontrivial time evolution. Finally, we propose a method for incorporating\nobservers and timekeepers into the gravitational path integral and show that\nimplementing a timekeeper in this way furnishes an observer-dependent\ngeneralization of holography.",

Our main result shows that the erosion and landscape\ndistances are equal, thereby bridging the former's natural category-theoretic\ninterpretation with the latter's computationally convenient structure. The\nproof utilizes the category with a flow framework of de Silva et al., and leads\nto additional insights into the structure of persistence landscapes. Our\nequivalence result is applied to prove several results on the geometry of the\nerosion distance. We show that the erosion distance is not a length metric, and\nthat its intrinsic metric is the bottleneck distance. We also show that the\nerosion distance does not coarsely embed into any Hilbert space, even when\nrestricted to persistence diagrams arising from degree-0 persistent homology.\nMoreover, we show that erosion distance agrees with bottleneck distance on this\nsubspace, so that our non-embeddability theorem generalizes several results in\nthe recent literature.",

The majority of approaches for the problem\nemploy a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where\npseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further\nfine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades\ndrastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high\nnoise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a\nsignificant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we\npropose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which\nseparates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source\n(easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance\nto partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher\ndetection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the\nsource domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into\na student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two\nfeature representations.

While diffusion-based models have achieved remarkable success in\nimage and video generation, their application to SVS remains challenging due to\nthe complex acoustic and musical characteristics of singing, often resulting in\nartifacts that degrade naturalness. In this work, we propose SmoothSinger, a\nconditional diffusion model designed to synthesize high quality and natural\nsinging voices. Unlike prior methods that depend on vocoders as a final stage\nand often introduce distortion, SmoothSinger refines low-quality synthesized\naudio directly in a unified framework, mitigating the degradation associated\nwith two-stage pipelines. The model adopts a reference-guided dual-branch\narchitecture, using low-quality audio from any baseline system as a reference\nto guide the denoising process, enabling more expressive and context-aware\nsynthesis. Furthermore, it enhances the conventional U-Net with a parallel\nlow-frequency upsampling path, allowing the model to better capture pitch\ncontours and long term spectral dependencies. To improve alignment during\ntraining, we replace reference audio with degraded ground truth audio,\naddressing temporal mismatch between reference and target signals.

We adopt a spin-based magnetometer as a benchmarking system\nfor the efficacy of the SAC algorithm. In such systems, the magnitude of a\nbackground magnetic field acting on a spin can be determined via projective\nmeasurements. The precision of the determined magnitude can be optimized by\napplying pulses of transverse fields with different strengths. We train an RL\nagent on numerical simulations of the spin system to determine a\ntransverse-field pulse sequence that optimizes the precision and compare it to\nexisting sensing strategies. We evaluate the agent's performance against\nvarious Hamiltonian parameters, including values not seen in training, to\ninvestigate the agent's ability to generalize to different situations. We find\nthat the RL agents are sensitive to certain parameters of the system, such as\nthe pulse duration and the purity of the initial state, but overall are able to\ngeneralize well, supporting the use of RL in quantum optimal control settings.",

    "abstract": "The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,\nintersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This\nwork proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration\nfor TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to\nestimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The\nintersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal\nconfiguration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into\nSimulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The\ninitial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the\ncycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,\nfour intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing\nconfiguration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of\ntotal vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic\nflow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that\nswitches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak\ntraffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic\ngenerator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and\na signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,\ndynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted\ndifferently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse\ntraffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4\nhours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions\naffect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for\nevenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly\nweighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.",

    "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become an important tool for analyzing and\ninterpreting the activation space of transformer-based language models (LMs).\nHowever, SAEs suffer several shortcomings that diminish their utility and\ninternal validity. Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the\nfailure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due\nto the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated\nby training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE\nlearns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of\nfeature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across\ndifferent checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a\nmodification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK\nactivation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states\nequivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the\nneed for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.\nThe resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,\ncomputational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple\narchitectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while\nproviding robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that\nthe sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering\nthrough targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of\nneuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers. These features make\nTopK LMs stable and reliable tools for understanding how language models learn\nand represent concepts, which we believe will significantly advance future\nresearch on model interpretability and controllability.",

    "abstract": "While transmission spectroscopy has allowed us to detect many atomic and\nmolecular species in exoplanet atmospheres, the improvement in resolution and\nsignal-to-noise ratio enabled us to become sensitive to planet-occulted line\ndistortions (POLDs) in the spectrum that are induced by center-to-limb\nvariations and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. POLDs can bias the\ninterpretation of the transmission spectrum, and it is difficult to correct for\nthem with stellar models. We analyzed two ESPRESSO transits (R $\\sim$\n140$\\,$000) of the archetypal hot Jupiter HD$\\,$189733$\\,$b. The transmission\nspectrum of this aligned system is heavily affected by POLDs, stellar activity,\nand instrumental effects. It is therefore a challenging study case of how to\naccount for these effects when the planetary signal is retrieved from chemical\nspecies through transmission spectroscopy. We confirm the previous detections\nof the sodium doublet signature in the upper atmosphere of HD$\\,$189733$\\,$b.\nWhen we accounted for POLDs and isolated the planetary signal from uncorrected\nstellar residuals, we found a shallower (0.432 $\\pm$ 0.027 %) and more strongly\nblueshifted (-7.97 $\\pm$ 0.28 km/s) signal. We attempted to reinterpret the\nother high-resolution sodium studies of this system in light of our results. We\nsuggest that the POLDs and stellar activity are insufficiently corrected for in\nall analyses, including ours. We also detected a planetary lithium signature of\n0.102 $\\pm$ 0.016 % (6.4$\\sigma$) at a blueshift of -2.4 $\\pm$ 1.8 km/s.",

For every level of the tower we prove closure under dependent\nproducts, dependent sums, identity types, and all finite limits and colimits;\nthe colimit part is obtained with a rank-stable quotient constructor. A\nuniverse-lifting operation shows strict cumulativity across levels. Assuming\npropositional resizing at one level, we construct an explicit left adjoint to\nthe inclusion of minus-one truncated types and show that resizing automatically\nlifts to every higher level. These ingredients combine in an Existence Theorem\nstating that, over Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the chosen inaccessible\ncardinals, the tower delivers a sound set-theoretic model of higher type\ntheory.

The significant improvement comes from a synergistic\napproach, \"map-then-reason\", that jointly trains the model to first generate a\ncognitive map and then reason upon it.

Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency\nimproved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues.\nSpecifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint\nthe locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by\nanalyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and\ncurrent steps.

By building on\nan inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to\nmethods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare\ndifferent conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are\ndesigned to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in\nterms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial\nshape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with\nappearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled natural language\ninterfaces that translate user questions into database queries, such as\nText2SQL, Text2SPARQL, and Text2Cypher. While these interfaces enhance database\naccessibility, most research today focuses on English, with limited evaluation\nin other languages. This paper investigates the performance of both\nfoundational and finetuned LLMs on the Text2Cypher task across multiple\nlanguages. We create and release a multilingual dataset by translating English\nquestions into Spanish and Turkish while preserving the original Cypher\nqueries, enabling fair cross-lingual comparison. Using standardized prompts and\nmetrics, we evaluate several foundational models and observe a consistent\nperformance pattern: highest on English, followed by Spanish, and lowest on\nTurkish. We attribute this to differences in training data availability and\nlinguistic features. We also examine the impact of translating task prompts\ninto Spanish and Turkish. Results show little to no change in evaluation\nmetrics, suggesting prompt translation has minor impact. Furthermore, we\nfinetune a foundational model on two datasets: one in English only, and one\nmultilingual. Finetuning on English improves overall accuracy but widens the\nperformance gap between languages. In contrast, multilingual finetuning narrows\nthe gap, resulting in more balanced performance. Our findings highlight the\nimportance for multilingual evaluation and training to build more inclusive and\nrobust query generation systems.",

These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,\nmaking accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)\nshow strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with\ncontextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address\nthese challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework\nthat integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to\nperform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists\nof three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive\nconversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a\nsemantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the\ndrift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain\nknowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to\nSEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and\nspam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high\naccuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift.

    "abstract": "The ghost Gutzwiller ansatz (gGut) embedding technique was shown to achieve\ncomparable accuracy to the gold standard dynamical mean-field theory method in\nsimulating real material properties, yet at a much lower computational cost.\nDespite that, gGut is limited by the algorithmic bottleneck of computing the\ndensity matrix of the underlying effective embedding model, a quantity which\nmust be converged within a self-consistent embedding loop. We develop a hybrid\nquantum-classical gGut technique which computes the ground state properties of\nembedding Hamiltonians with the help of a quantum computer, using the\nsample-based quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) algorithm. We\nstudy the applicability of SCI-based methods to the evaluation of the density\nof states for single-band Anderson impurity models within gGut and find that\nsuch ground states of interest become sufficiently sparse in the CI basis as\nthe number of ghost orbitals is increased. Further, we investigate the\nperformance of QSCI using local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) variational\nquantum states in combination with a circuit cutting technique, prepared on\nIQM's quantum hardware for system sizes of up to 11 ghost orbitals, equivalent\nto 24 qubits. We report converged gGut calculations which correctly capture the\nmetal-to-insulator phase transition in the Fermi-Hubbard model on the Bethe\nlattice by using quantum samples to build an SCI basis with as little as $1\\%$\nof the total CI basis states.",

Such biases can negatively\nimpact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and\ncharacterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task.\nIn this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network\npredicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image\nand annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector\ncollection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly\nlearned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset,\nHyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density\nareas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment\norgans in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two\n3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the\nAMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real\nunknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a\nstructured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant\nsystematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet\nparameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying\nlearned systematic bias.

This principle is the basis for much of\nour understanding of linear response for interacting and disordered systems,\nvia diagrammatic perturbation theory. Similar imaginary-time approaches have\nrecently been introduced for computing nonlinear response functions as well,\nalthough the rigorous connection between Matsubara and causal nonlinear\nresponse functions has not been clearly elucidated. In this work, we provide a\nproof of this connection to all orders in perturbation theory. Using an\nequations of motion approach, we show by induction that casual nonlinear\nresponse functions at every order can be obtained from an analytic continuation\nof an appropriate time-ordered Matsubara function. We demonstrate this\nconnection explicitly for second order response functions in the Lehmann\nrepresentation. As a byproduct of our approach, we derive an explicit\nexpression for the Lehmann representation of $n$-th order response functions by\nsolving the equations of motion. We also use our result to find an analytic\nspectral density representation for both causal response functions and\nMatsubara functions.

This has prompted\nincreasing efforts to assess systemic risk, namely the effects of firm\ndisruptions on entire economies. However, the ability of firms to react to\ncrises by rewiring their supply links has been largely overlooked, limiting our\nunderstanding of production networks resilience. Here we study dynamics and\ndeterminants of firm-level systemic risk in the Hungarian production network\nfrom 2015 to 2022. We use as benchmark a heuristic maximum entropy null model\nthat generates an ensemble of production networks at equilibrium, by preserving\nthe total input (demand) and output (supply) of each firm at the sector level.\nWe show that the fairly stable set of firms with highest systemic risk\nundergoes a structural change during COVID-19, as those enabling economic\nexchanges become key players in the economy -- a result which is not reproduced\nby the null model. Although the empirical systemic risk aligns well with the\nnull value until the onset of the pandemic, it becomes significantly smaller\nafterwards as the adaptive behavior of firms leads to a more resilient economy.\nFurthermore, firms' international trade volume (being a subject of disruption)\nbecomes a significant predictor of their systemic risk. However, international\nlinks cannot provide an unequivocal explanation for the observed trends, as\nimports and exports have opposing effects on local systemic risk through the\nsupply and demand channels.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in graph\nlearning and are widely adopted across various critical domains. However, the\nirregular connectivity between vertices leads to inefficient neighbor\naggregation, resulting in substantial irregular and coarse-grained DRAM\naccesses. This lack of data locality presents significant challenges for\nexecution platforms, ultimately degrading performance. While previous\naccelerator designs have leveraged on-chip memory and data access scheduling\nstrategies to address this issue, they still inevitably access features at\nirregular addresses from DRAM. In this work, we propose LiGNN, a hardware-based\nsolution that improves data locality by applying dropout and merge techniques\nduring neighbor aggregation to accelerate GNN training. Unlike conventional\nalgorithm-level dropout methods that primarily aim to improve accuracy while\noverlooking hardware costs, LiGNN introduces a locality-aware feature dropout\nmechanism. This approach selectively drops node features with data locality\nawareness, effectively reducing irregular DRAM accesses without compromising\nmodel accuracy. Moreover, by leveraging detailed knowledge of memory layout and\norganization-including critical alignment constraints-LiGNN strategically\nmerges memory accesses during neighbor aggregation at the DRAM row level,\nguided by GNN-level semantics. This optimization significantly improves data\nlocality with minimal additional cost. Under the commonly adopted 0.5 dropout\nrate, LiGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering a 1.48~3.02x\nspeedup, reducing DRAM accesses by 34%~55%, and lowering DRAM row activations\nby 59%~82%, all while maintaining model accuracy.",

These\nresults change our understanding of the material features most important for\nthese photovoltaics.

Contrasting with existing two-stage\nmethods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and\nparametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D\nparametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation\ncaused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However,\nparametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view\noptimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their\ngeometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a\nnovel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and\nedge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a\ncurve-aware Gaussian representation, \\textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables\ndifferentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by\nmulti-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology\noptimization framework during training to refine curve structures through\nlinearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive\nevaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our\none-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in\nproducing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly\noptimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter\ncount during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior\nperformance compared to existing approaches.",

To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and\nefficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates\nthrough an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query\nfeatures to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2)\nanomaly suppression through prototype alignment.

Therefore, we employ optimal\ntransport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the\ngap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression.\nFor comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive\nprototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO.\nExtensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and\nRealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our\napproach under 1/2/4-shots.",

Experiments across 34 small classification tasks size show that early\nstopping in-context learning accelerates inference by up to x1.3 with\nnegligible degradation in predictive performance. To assess scalability, we\nfurther evaluate our method on five larger classification tasks, achieving\nspeedups of up to x2.2. Our results demonstrate the potential of early exiting\nas an effective and practical strategy for improving the efficiency of tabular\nin-context learning.",

    "abstract": "Arabic dialect recognition presents a significant challenge in speech\ntechnology due to the linguistic diversity of Arabic and the scarcity of large\nannotated datasets, particularly for underrepresented dialects. This research\ninvestigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal\nprocessing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem\nin low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)\nMel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with\na Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered\nsubset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based\non speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN\narchitecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and\nstrong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the\nWavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%. These\nfindings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging spectral features with\nconvolutional models for Arabic dialect recognition, especially when working\nwith limited labeled data. The study also identifies limitations related to\ndataset size, potential regional overlaps in labeling, and model optimization,\nproviding a roadmap for future research. Recommendations for further\nimprovement include the adoption of larger annotated corpora, integration of\nself-supervised learning techniques, and exploration of advanced neural\narchitectures such as Transformers. Overall, this research establishes a strong\nbaseline for future developments in Arabic dialect recognition within\nresource-constrained environments.",

This paper\nintroduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and\neffectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs\nLLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key\nmodules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs\nwith tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and\ndecompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware\nKnowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus\n(i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking\nand Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before\na final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a\nchain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG\ncapabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those\nhighlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex\nand noisy queries.",

To achieve this while balancing the performance-cost\ntrade-off, we propose three coverage-enhancement schemes: the area-adaptive\nMA-IRS scheme, where both MA positions and IRS phase shifts are adaptively\nadjusted for each target area; the area-adaptive MA-staIRS scheme, where only\nMA positions are adjusted, while IRS phase shifts remain unchanged after\ninitial configuration (with staIRS denoting static IRSs); and the shared\nMA-staIRS scheme, where a common MA placement and static IRS configuration are\napplied across all areas. These schemes lead to challenging non-convex\noptimization problems with implicit objectives, which are difficult to solve\noptimally. To address these problems, we propose a general algorithmic\nframework that can solve each problem efficiently albeit suboptimally.\nSimulation results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed MA-based schemes\nconsistently outperform their fixed-position antenna (FPA)-based counterparts\nunder both area-adaptive and static IRS configurations, with the area-adaptive\nMA-IRS scheme achieving the best worst-case SNR; 2) as transmit antennas are\ntypically far fewer than IRS elements, the area-adaptive MA-staIRS scheme may\nunderperform the baseline FPA scheme with area-adaptive IRSs in worst-case SNR,\nbut a modest increase in antenna number can reverse this; 3) under a fixed\ntotal cost, the optimal MA-to-IRS-element ratio for worst-case SNR maximization\nis empirically found to be proportional to the reciprocal of their unit cost\nratio.",

The method achieves computational efficiency by exploiting a\ndistinctive property of satellite MIMO channels: users within the same\ngeographical cluster exhibit highly correlated channel characteristics due to\ntheir physical proximity, which typically impedes convergence in conventional\niterative MIMO detectors. The proposed method implements a two-stage strategy\nthat first eliminates intra-cluster interference using computationally\nefficient small matrix inversions, then utilizes these pre-computed matrices to\naccelerate standard iterative MIMO detectors such as Gauss-Seidel (GS) and\nsymmetric successive over-relaxation (SSOR) for effective inter-cluster\ninterference cancellation. Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod achieves more than 12 times faster convergence under perfect channel\nstate information. Even when accounting for channel estimation errors, the\nmethod maintains 9 times faster convergence, demonstrating its robustness and\neffectiveness for next-generation satellite MIMO communications.",

Their full discretization results in\na large-scale saddle-point system at each time step that is becoming singular\nfor locking cases and needs effective preconditioners for its fast iterative\nsolution. Instead of constructing spectrally equivalent ones, we develop\nnonsingular preconditioners so that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned\nsystem consist of a cluster around $1$ and an outlier in the order of\n$1/\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is a Lam\\'{e} constant that is large for locking\ncases. It is known that the convergence factor of GMRES is bounded by the\nradius of the cluster for this type of systems. Both two- and three-field block\ntriangular Schur complement preconditioners are studied. Upper bounds of the\nradius of the eigenvalue cluster for those systems are obtained and shown to be\nrelated to the inf-sup condition but independent of mesh size, time step, and\nlocking parameters, which reflects the robustness of the preconditioners with\nrespect to parameter variations. Moreover, the developed preconditioners do not\nneed to compute the Schur complement and neither require exact inversion of\ndiagonal blocks except the leading one.

In open-ended\nevaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on\nSMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant\nin-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade\nperformance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,\ni.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial\nperformance improvements by up to 71%.

This inverse\nprocess is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly\nchallenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows\npromising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it\nrequires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and\nfails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To\naddress these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective,\nreformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This\nformulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate\nrepresentation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from\nthe ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first\ngeneralizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator\nand a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current\nestimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between\nthe incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the\nrelative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design\nenables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of\nrelative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to\ntransmitter sparsity.

In addition to requiring camera\nparameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive\ntest-time optimization for each scene.

Our approach builds upon recent\nadvances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view\nversion of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view\npanoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard\npost-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach\nfor multi-view segmentation.

The\npreferential interaction coefficient and cluster analysis of individual blocks\nof PE-b-PEG were used to study the effect of clay arrangement (exfoliated\nversus tactoid) on copolymer reorientation and assembly at the clay surface. We\nfind that the oMMT coated with PE-b-PEG acts as a neutral surface (small\ndifference in polymer-polymer and polymer-oMMT+PE-b-PEG enthalpic interactions)\nand the primary influence of the nanofiller is a result of confinement and\nsteric effect of the clay sheets on the PE chains.",

Despite its promising\npotential, developing subject-invariant and session-invariant BCI systems\nremains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity and variability\nof neural activity across individuals and over time, compounded by EEG hardware\nconstraints. While prior studies have sought to develop robust BCI systems,\nexisting approaches remain ineffective in capturing the intricate\nspatiotemporal dependencies within multichannel EEG signals. This study\naddresses this gap by introducing the attentive graph-temporal convolutional\nnetwork (AGTCNet), a novel graph-temporal model for motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG)\nclassification. Specifically, AGTCNet leverages the topographic configuration\nof EEG electrodes as an inductive bias and integrates graph convolutional\nattention network (GCAT) to jointly learn expressive spatiotemporal EEG\nrepresentations. The proposed model significantly outperformed existing MI-EEG\nclassifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a compact\narchitecture, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for BCI\ndeployment. With a 49.87% reduction in model size, 64.65% faster inference\ntime, and shorter input EEG signal, AGTCNet achieved a moving average accuracy\nof 66.82% for subject-independent classification on the BCI Competition IV\nDataset 2a, which further improved to 82.88% when fine-tuned for\nsubject-specific classification.

The resulting [Rb/Fe] ratios are compared to other\nneutron-capture elements and interpreted with chemical evolution models.

Central to addressing these gaps is\nrecognizing complementary cognitive modes: thinking as slow, iterative\nhypothesis generation -- exploring counterfactual spaces where physical laws\ncan be temporarily violated to discover new patterns -- and reasoning as fast,\ndeterministic validation, traversing established knowledge graphs to test\nconsistency with known principles.

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising\nparadigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary\nstrengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing\ntime-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation,\nconsuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand,\nleverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are\nexponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these\nparadigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models\nhave important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron\nimplementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring\nrepeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use\nconventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we\npropose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these\nchallenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a\nspiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic\nspike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS\nneurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a\nhardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global\nclassical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series\nefficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state\nspace of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks\nthat are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.",

This paper presents a study that examines how varying a\nrobot's level of transparency and sociability influences user interpretation,\ndecision-making and perceived trust when faced with conflicting information\nfrom a robot. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects online study, 176 participants\nwatched videos of a Furhat robot acting as a family healthcare assistant and\nsuggesting a fictional user to take medication at a different time from that\nremembered by the user. Results indicate that robot transparency influenced\nusers' interpretation of information discrepancies: with a low transparency\nrobot, the most frequent assumption was that the user had not correctly\nremembered the time, while with the high transparency robot, participants were\nmore likely to attribute the discrepancy to external factors, such as a partner\nor another household member modifying the robot's information. Additionally,\nparticipants exhibited a tendency toward overtrust, often prioritizing the\nrobot's recommendations over the user's memory, even when suspecting system\nmalfunctions or third-party interference.

Using F430M medium band images, we select PAH emitters in the galaxy\ncluster, which capture the 3.3$\\mu$m PAH emission at the redshift of A2744. Our\nmulti-wavelength study demonstrates consistent star formation rates (SFRs)\nderived from PAH emission and SED fitting, indicating the 3.3 $\\mu$m PAH flux\nestimated from medium band image alone can reveal the entirety of star\nformation, immune to dust obscuration. We find that the PAH emitters are\nlocated in relatively low mass surface density regions of A2744, with SFRs\naligning with the field star-forming main sequence at $z=0.3$. The PAH emission\nmorphologies show more asymmetry than that of the F444W image when asymmetry\nindex $> 0.4$. With these results, we suggest that these star-forming galaxies\nin A2744 are in the stage of falling into the cluster from the field, and have\nnot been quenched yet.

    "abstract": "Electric grids in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) across the world\nface an acute challenge. To support global decarbonisation efforts and raise\nmillions from energy poverty, these grids must shoulder substantial load growth\nwhile integrating distributed renewable generation. However, decades of rapid\nand poorly funded infrastructure expansions have led to national grids in many\nLMICs that are strained and weak, composed of aging, faulty, and undersized\ninfrastructure. A cause and symptom of this weakness is excessive technical\nloss within the grid infrastructure during energy delivery, particularly at the\ndistribution level; network losses are regularly estimated to be well over 20\npercent, compared to a baseline of 5 percent in higher-income nations.\nAddressing technical loss through targeted interventions is essential for\nbolstering grids' physical and economic strength. Unfortunately, current\napproaches for estimating and localizing technical loss require expensive,\nextensive power flow sensing, which is essentially absent in LMIC distribution\nsystems. We present a novel approach to technical loss estimation without power\nflows, which leverages more readily available voltage magnitude measurements at\nsparse locations in the grid. This estimator puts loss estimation and\nlocalization within reach for LMIC grids globally, and provides a critical tool\nfor the effective design, implementation, and evaluation of loss-reduction\ninterventions.",

In the dispersive variant of the\nArt Gallery Problem, the objective is not to minimize the number of guards but\nto maximize the minimum geodesic $L_1$-distance between any two guards, called\nthe dispersion distance.\n  Our main contributions are as follows. We prove that determining whether a\nvertex guard set can achieve a dispersion distance of $4$ in office-like\npolygons is NP-complete, where vertices of the polygon are restricted to\ninteger coordinates. Additionally, we present a simple worst-case optimal\nalgorithm that guarantees a dispersion distance of $3$ in polynomial time. Our\ncomplexity result extends to polyominoes, resolving an open question posed by\nRieck and Scheffer (CGTA 2024). When vertex coordinates are allowed to be\nrational, we establish analogous results, proving that achieving a dispersion\ndistance of $2+\\varepsilon$ is NP-hard for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, while the\nclassic Art Gallery Problem remains solvable in polynomial time for this class\nof polygons. Furthermore, we give a straightforward polynomial-time algorithm\nthat computes worst-case optimal solutions with a dispersion distance of $2$.\n  On the other hand, for the more restricted class of hole-free independent\noffice-like polygons, we propose a dynamic programming approach that computes\noptimal solutions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the problem is practically\ntractable for arbitrary orthogonal polygons. To this end, we compare solvers\nbased on SAT, CP, and MIP formulations.

    "abstract": "The network has been attracting increasing attention for its role in driving\nthe artificial intelligence revolution and enabling profound insights into\ngravity. This paper investigates the gravity dual of the conformal field theory\ndefined on a network (AdS/NCFT). A typical network, consisting of edges and\nnodes, is dual to a spacetime with branches and connecting branes, which we\nrefer to as Net-branes. We demonstrate that the junction condition on the\nNet-brane results in energy conservation at the network node, providing strong\nsupport for our proposal of AdS/NCFT.\n  We find that the spectrum of gravitational Kaluza-Klein modes on the\nNet-brane is a combination of the spectra from the AdS/BCFT with Neumann\nboundary conditions and Dirichlet/Conformal boundary conditions, corresponding\nto the isolated and transparent modes, respectively. We study two-point\nfunctions for NCFTs and provide examples, such as free fields and AdS/NCFT with\ntensionless Net-branes. We propose that the RT surfaces intersect at the same\npoint on the Net-brane for connected subsystems within the network and verify\nthis with the strong additivity and monotonicity of entanglement entropy. We\nestablish that the network entropy, defined as the difference in entanglement\nbetween NCFT and BCFT, is always non-negative and effectively illustrates the\nnetwork's complexity.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large-scale music generation models, such as MusicGen and\nMustango, is a computationally expensive process, often requiring updates to\nbillions of parameters and, therefore, significant hardware resources.\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, particularly adapter-based\nmethods, have emerged as a promising alternative, enabling adaptation with\nminimal trainable parameters while preserving model performance. However, the\ndesign choices for adapters, including their architecture, placement, and size,\nare numerous, and it is unclear which of these combinations would produce\noptimal adapters and why, for a given case of low-resource music genre. In this\npaper, we attempt to answer this question by studying various adapter\nconfigurations for two AI music models, MusicGen and Mustango, on two genres:\nHindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music.\n  Our findings reveal distinct trade-offs: convolution-based adapters excel in\ncapturing fine-grained local musical details such as ornamentations and short\nmelodic phrases, while transformer-based adapters better preserve long-range\ndependencies crucial for structured improvisation. Additionally, we analyze\ncomputational resource requirements across different adapter scales,\ndemonstrating how mid-sized adapters (40M parameters) achieve an optimal\nbalance between expressivity and quality. Furthermore, we find that Mustango, a\ndiffusion-based model, generates more diverse outputs with better adherence to\nthe description in the input prompt while lacking in providing stability in\nnotes, rhythm alignment, and aesthetics. Also, it is computationally intensive\nand requires significantly more time to train. In contrast, autoregressive\nmodels like MusicGen offer faster training and are more efficient, and can\nproduce better quality output in comparison, but have slightly higher\nredundancy in their generations.",

The\ngoal is to improve scalability, resilience, and team independence, albeit at\nthe cost of increased complexity and infrastructure demands. This paper seeks\nto understand when it is worth adopting micro frontends, particularly in the\ncontext of industry. To achieve this, we conducted an investigation into the\nstate of the art of micro frontends, based on both academic and gray\nliterature. We then implemented this architectural style in a marketplace for\nhandcrafted products, which already used microservices. Finally, we evaluated\nthe implementation through a semi-open questionnaire with the developers. At\nthe studied marketplace company, the need for architectural change arose due to\nthe tight coupling between their main system (a Java monolith) and a dedicated\nfrontend system. Additionally, there were deprecated technologies and poor\ndeveloper experience. To address these issues, the micro frontends architecture\nwas adopted, along with the API Gateway and Backend for Frontend patterns, and\ntechnologies such as Svelte and Fastify. Although the adoption of Micro\nFrontends was successful, it was not strictly necessary to meet the company's\nneeds. According to the analysis of the mixed questionnaire responses, other\nalternatives, such as a monolithic frontend, could have achieved comparable\nresults. What made adopting micro frontends the most convenient choice in the\ncompany's context was the monolith strangulation and microservices adoption,\nwhich facilitated implementation through infrastructure reuse and knowledge\nsharing between teams.",

Our approach combines the construction of simple yet\nrealistic models with the development of Monte Carlo algorithms to accelerate\nequilibration and sampling. Inspired by the well-studied ortho-terphenyl\nglass-former, we construct a molecular model with an analogous triangular\ngeometry and construct a `flip' Monte Carlo algorithm. We demonstrate that the\nflip Monte Carlo algorithm achieves a sampling speedup of about $10^9$ at the\nexperimental glass transition temperature $T_g$. This allows us to\nsystematically analyze the equilibrium structure and molecular dynamics of the\nmodel over a temperature regime previously inaccessible. We carefully compare\nthe observed physical behavior to earlier studies that used atomistic models.\nIn particular, we find that the glass fragility and the departure from the\nStokes-Einstein relation are much closer to experimental observations. We\ncharacterize the development and temperature evolution of spatial correlations\nin the relaxation dynamics, using both orientational and translational degrees\nof freedom. Excess wings emerge at intermediate frequencies in dynamic\nrotational spectra, and we directly visualize the corresponding molecular\nmotion near $T_g$.

We identify two high-significance (SNR>5) emission lines at\n97.0 and 145.5 GHz, corresponding to CO(4-3) and CO(6-5), respectively in the\nspectral scans from the Atacama Compact Array and the Large Millimeter\nTelescope and the [CII] 158~$\\mu$m fine-structure line at 400~GHz using the\nAtacama Pathfinder Experiment.

A graph on which the snake has a strategy to keep eating apples until\nit covers all the vertices of the graph is called snake-winnable.

    "abstract": "With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to\ndeeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical\ncapability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the\nchallenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the\nLLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process\nsuccessfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also\nintroduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating\nmodels in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed\nmethod demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks\ncompared to other open-source omni-modal models.",

Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on\ncharacter consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles\ncharacter modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates\ncinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a\nsingle character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured\nstoryboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,\ncharacter actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we\nintroduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual\nstyle and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's\nfull visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design\nmodule further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame\ncropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the\nstory, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically\nplausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based\nimage-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion\ncustomization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from\ntemporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second\nstage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen\nidentity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent\nvideo scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,\nnarratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for\npersonalized and engaging story animation.

    "abstract": "Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in\nconsecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output\nvideo should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the\ndetails of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames.\nNaively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results\ndue to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods,\nthough very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal\nattention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task,\nwhich have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In\nthis paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement\nvideo virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different\nfrom previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem\ninstead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better\nspatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video\ninpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D\nspatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video\ngarment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage\ntraining. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with\nappropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal\nconsistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to\nthe model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as\nexpected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI\nis superior to previous works.",

During preprocessing, an adaptive\ndenoising and normalization strategy is applied to suppress environmental\nbackground interference; in the network architecture, parallel branches extract\nMel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and wavelet-packet energy features,\nwhich are subsequently fused via a cross-modal attention mechanism in the\nintermediate feature space to fully exploit time-frequency information.\nExperimental results demonstrate that BMCNN achieves a classification accuracy\nof 87.56% on the SZUR-Acoustic Dataset and 96.28% on the public IDMT-Traffic\ndataset. Ablation studies and robustness tests on the Suzhou dataset further\nvalidate the contributions of each module to performance improvement and\noverfitting mitigation.

This provides\nthe first direct evidence that red HB halo clusters originate from satellite\naccretion, a notion introduced nearly 50 years ago from MW studies which has\nremained unconfirmed until now. In addition to a more metal-rich tail, the\nsubstructure GC sample also contains a few clusters with very low metallicities\nand red HBs, unlike any objects known in the MW.

Empirically, we\ndemonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model\nover a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x\nspeedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in\nmodel convergence.

    "abstract": "I address the challenge of extracting reliable insights from large datasets\nusing a simplified model that illustrates how hierarchical classification can\ndistort outcomes. The model consists of discrete pixels labeled red, blue, or\nwhite. Red and blue indicate distinct properties, and white represents\nunclassified or ambiguous data. A macro-color is assigned only if one color\nholds a strict majority among the pixels. Otherwise, the aggregate is labeled\nwhite, reflecting uncertainty. This setup mimics a percolation threshold at\nfifty percent. Assuming direct access of the various proportions of colors is\ninfeasible from the data, I implement a hierarchical coarse-graining procedure.\nElements (first pixels, then aggregates) are recursively grouped and\nreclassified via local majority rules, producing ultimately a single\nsuper-aggregate whose color represents the inferred macro-property of the\ncollection of pixels as a whole. Analytical results, supported by simulations,\nshow that the process introduces additional white aggregates beyond white\npixels, which could be initially present. These arise from groups lacking a\nclear majority, requiring arbitrary symmetry-breaking decisions to attribute a\ncolor to them. While each local resolution may appear minor and\ninconsequential, their repetitions introduce a growing systematic bias. Even\nwith complete data, unavoidable asymmetries in local rules are shown to skew\noutcomes. This study highlights a critical limitation of recursive data\nreduction. Insight extraction is shaped not only by data quality, but by how\nlocal ambiguity is handled. That results in built-in biases. Thus, the related\nflaws are not due to the data, but due to structural choices made during local\naggregations. Though based on a simple model, the findings expose the high\nlikelihood of inherent flaws in widely used hierarchical classification\ntechniques.",

We present a mapmaking-based approach which describes the\nbeam-weighted observation of the sky by multiple globally-distributed antenna\nexperiments as an observation equation.

The resulting\nchromaticity-free sky monopole is then fit with a smooth foreground function\nand a 21-cm model.

Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench\ntargeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,\na benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The\nbenchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and\nreal-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and\nsafety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation.

We carefully sample from 10 diverse\nmodels, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification\nto ensure the integrity of the data.

The\nRunge--Kutta based gCQ has been studied so far in a rather general setting,\nwhich includes applications to boundary integral formulations of wave problems.\nThe available stability and convergence results for these new methods are\nsuboptimal compared to those known for the uniform-step CQ, both in terms of\nconvergence order and regularity requirements of the data. Here we focus on a\nspecial class of sectorial problems and prove that in these important\napplications it is possible to achieve the same order of convergence as for the\noriginal CQ, under the same regularity hypotheses on the data, and for very\ngeneral time meshes. In the particular case of data with some known algebraic\ntype of singularity, we also show how to choose an optimally graded time mesh\nto achieve convergence with maximal order, overcoming the well-known order\nreduction of the original CQ in these situations. An important advantage of the\ngCQ method is that it allows for a fast and memory-efficient implementation. We\ndescribe how the fast and oblivious Runge--Kutta based gCQ can be implemented\nand illustrate our theoretical results with several numerical experiments.

Predictive\nand optimization-based control is commonly used to address this task, but\nexisting results for DHNs do not account for time-varying problem aspects.\nSince the turnpike phenomenon can serve as a basis for model predictive control\ndesign and analysis, this paper examines its role in DHN optimization by\nanalyzing the underlying optimal control problem with time-varying prices and\ndemands.

Open questions exist as to the typical mass of the\nperturbers and the specific planetary architectures that cause metal pollution.\nJWST's sensitivity in the mid-IR has opened new doors to deciphering polluted\nwhite dwarfs. We present JWST Cycle 1 MIRI imaging of four nearby\nmetal-polluted white dwarfs with the goal of detecting and characterizing\nplanetary companions. With deep mid-IR imaging we are sensitive to cold\nJupiter-mass planet analogs. In addition to finding two candidate planetary\ncompanions, for the first time we detect significant excesses above the\nexpected photospheric emission at 21~$\\mu$m for two of our targets, WD 2149+021\nand WD 2105-820. WD 2105-280 has a candidate planetary companion at a projected\nseparation of 34 au and an infrared excess--if both candidates are confirmed,\nit would represent the first WD multi-planet system. We investigate whether\nthese excesses could be caused by very low luminosity warm dust disks or\nplanets. While both are likely, we argue that the most likely explanation for\nthe excesses is that they are the thermal emission from jovian-mass planets in\norbits with semi-major axes $<$10 au, using a combination of observational\nconstraints. If most of the candidate planets presented here are confirmed, it\nwould suggest that metal polluted white dwarfs are frequently orbited by at\nleast one giant planet.",

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence\nindicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing\nshallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal\nknowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine\nhuman-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning.

After this, the imposition of Clausius' equation on\nthe Shannon entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution leads to an\nunexpected result: in general, the Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ that imposes the\nenergy constraint in constrained entropy maximization turns out to be\nsubstantially different from the inverse temperature.

However, the latter is derived from\nentropy maximization with constrained expected energy and expected number of\nparticles, therefore if we plug $\\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature in the\nmultinomial-Boltzmann distribution, then the thermodynamics of the canonical\nsystem obtained in this way turns out to be non-compatible with the principle\nof maximum entropy.",

These models operate in a bitwise\nautoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically\ninfinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a\ngrowing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are\nlikely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same\nmodels. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where\nrepeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own\nprevious versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising\nmitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet\ndetectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of\ngenerated content.

Our bitwise watermark\nsubtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed\nwhile remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,\nit exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are\nused to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will\nalso carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when\nonly fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked\nwith our BitMark.

Our pipeline begins with the generation of a resolution-adaptive point\ncloud near the geometry's surface employing a face-based neighborhood search.\nThis point cloud forms the basis for a signed distance field, enabling\nefficient, localized computations near surface regions. To create an initial\nparticle configuration, we apply a hierarchical winding number method for fast\nand accurate inside-outside segmentation. Particle positions are then relaxed\nusing an SPH-inspired scheme, which also serves to pack boundary particles.\nThis ensures full kernel support and promotes isotropic distributions while\npreserving the geometry interface. By leveraging the meshless nature of\nparticle-based methods, our approach does not require connectivity information\nand is thus straightforward to integrate into existing particle-based\nframeworks. It is robust to imperfect input geometries and memory-efficient\nwithout compromising performance. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that\nwith increasingly higher resolution, the resulting particle distribution\nconverges to the exact geometry.",

We perform detection\ncompleteness corrections in order to discard detection bias as a possible\nexplanation to our results. After bias corrections, we find that cold Jupiters\nare 5.65 times more massive when not in company of an inner super-Earth, while\nsuper-Earths are not significantly more massive while in company of an outer\ngiant planet. We also report an occurrence enhancement for Saturns (median\nprojected mass of 0.6MJ) while in presence of a super-Earth by a factor of 4,\nand for super-Earths in presence of Saturns by the same factor. This positive\ncorrelation disappears for super-Jupiters (median projected mass of 3.1MJ).\nThese results show that while cold Jupiters are generally accompanied by inner\nsuper-Earths, this does not hold for the largest giant planets, such as those\nthat will be discovered by Gaia, which will likely not be accompanied by\ntransiting planets. The mass dependence, in combination with different\ndetection limits of different surveys, may explain the discrepancies concerning\noccurrence relations between cold Jupiters and super-Earths.",

    "abstract": "The face-centered-cubic lattice is composed of edge-sharing tetrahedra,\nmaking it a leading candidate host for strongly frustrated magnetism, but\nrelatively few face-centered frustrated materials have been investigated. In\nthe hydroxide double perovskite CuSn(OH)$_6$, magnetic frustration of the\nCu$^{2+}$ quantum spins is partially relieved by strong Jahn-Teller\ndistortions. Nevertheless, the system shows no signs of long-range magnetic\norder down to 45 mK and instead exhibits broad thermodynamic anomalies in\nspecific heat and magnetization, indicating short-range dynamical spin\ncorrelations-a behavior typical of quantum spin liquids. We propose that such\nan unusual robustness of the spin-liquid-like state is a combined effect of\nquantum fluctuations of the quantum spins $S=\\frac{1}{2}$, residual frustration\non the highly distorted face-centered Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice, and correlated\nproton disorder. Similar to the disorder-induced spin-liquid mimicry in\nYbMgGaO$_4$ and herbertsmithite, proton disorder destabilizes the long-range\nmagnetic order by introducing randomness into the magnetic exchange interaction\nnetwork. However, unlike the quenched substitutional disorder on the magnetic\nsublattice, which is difficult to control, proton disorder can in principle be\ntuned through pressure-driven proton ordering transitions. This opens up the\nprospect of tuning the degree of disorder in a magnetic system to better\nunderstand its influence on the magnetic ground state.",

    "abstract": "Let P represent the source population with complete data, containing\ncovariate $\\mathbf{Z}$ and response $T$, and Q the target population, where\nonly the covariate $\\mathbf{Z}$ is available. We consider a setting with both\nlabel shift and label censoring. Label shift assumes that the marginal\ndistribution of $T$ differs between $P$ and $Q$, while the conditional\ndistribution of $\\mathbf{Z}$ given $T$ remains the same. Label censoring refers\nto the case where the response $T$ in $P$ is subject to random censoring. Our\ngoal is to leverage information from the label-shifted and label-censored\nsource population $P$ to conduct statistical inference in the target population\n$Q$. We propose a parametric model for $T$ given $\\mathbf{Z}$ in $Q$ and\nestimate the model parameters by maximizing an approximate likelihood. This\nallows for statistical inference in $Q$ and accommodates a range of classical\nsurvival models. Under the label shift assumption, the likelihood depends not\nonly on the unknown parameters but also on the unknown distribution of $T$ in\n$P$ and $\\mathbf{Z}$ in $Q$, which we estimate nonparametrically.

For a positive\none-loop beta function for the inflaton quartic coupling (namely, $b_1>0$), a\nsub-dominant contribution from the two-loop corrections can be accommodated.

    "abstract": "Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences\nof objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed\nsteps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with\nmultiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from\neach step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as\n\"it\", \"here\" and \"the same\" to make language expressions concise. This requires\ngrounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information\nfrom previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an\neffective module for collecting related historical information,\nstate-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the\nSG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for\ntemporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we\ndemonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG\nbaseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\\% and +10.2\\%) in the SG3D benchmark,\neven outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.\nFurthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step\ninformation based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling\nGroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain\nits temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work\nintroduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.",

Subdividing the US into extreme and intermediate light-element\npopulations reveals a gradient in anisotropy, with intermediate stars lying\nbetween the LS and extreme US populations.

Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate\nthis issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high\ncompression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly\npreserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two\nkey operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second\none is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,\nVideo-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while\nusing H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully\nutilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.\nVideo-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and\ndirectly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L\nwith a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,\nLongVideoBench, and VNBench.

This approach is motivated by the fact that mixed audio often contains\nsubtle cues that are difficult to capture with mel-spectrograms alone. Thus,\nthese additional features offer alterna-tive perspectives for the model.\nSecond, an agent-based label correction system is applied to the outputs\nprocessed by the S5 system.

With the aim to reveal the effects of the magnetic field to the\nmulti-band activity of dwarf stars, we search for associated radio emission for\nan extensive list of 14 915 brown dwarfs and 15 124 flaring stars. Methods. We\nutilised the first and second epoch catalogues and radio maps from all three\nepochs of the VLASS, supplemented with X-ray catalogues based on observations\nby the ROSAT, eROSITA, and XMM-Newton space telescopes, and 2-minute cadence\noptical light curves from the TESS mission. The radio-detected sub-sample was\nqueried for concurrent TESS observations, and sources with coinciding\nlight-curves were studied individually. Results. We found no associated radio\nemission for brown dwarfs, and found 55 radio counterparts for the sample of\nflaring stars, out of which seven have coincident TESS observations. The\nradio-detected sample follows both the radio-X-ray and the period-activity\nrelations. We found a strong correlation between the radio powers and the\nstellar parameters of surface gravity, radius, and mass. We found no connection\nbetween the flare rate and the radio variability. For radio-detected stars with\navailable effective temperatures and rotational periods, we estimated\ngyrochronological ages, which resulted in values of Tgyro < 1 Gyr, with the\nmajority of the sample being younger than 150 Myr. We found no strong\nconnection between the occurrence of optical flares and radio variability for\nthe individually studied stars. Conclusions. We conclude that radio emission\nfrom intermediate-to-late type flaring stars is of synchrotron nature, and\nshares a common origin with X-ray processes.

    "abstract": "Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is\noften challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to\ndifferences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated\nusing point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D\nsensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits\nthe generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust,\ndomain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological\ninformation, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the\nsource domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware\nModeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach\nmitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized\nby low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological\nrelations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning\ntask. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines\ncross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the\nimpact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation\nprocess. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the\neffectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks.

However, direct experimental\ninsight into the local thermoelectric response of single skyrmions remains\nlimited. To address this, we employ scanning thermoelectric microscopy~(SThEM)\nto probe the nanoscale thermoelectric response from a single skyrmion.

We combine this with\nthermoelectric modelling of a range of skyrmion spin textures to reveal unique\nthermoelectric responses and allow the possibility of SThEM to be used as a\ntool to distinguish nanoscale spin textures. These findings provide fundamental\ninsights into the interaction of topologically protected spin textures with\nlocal thermal gradients and the resultant spin transport.

However, verifying randomness\nremains a challenge, as existing tests in the literature are often restricted\nto detecting specific types of data dependencies. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel graph-theoretic approach to testing randomness using random interval\ngraphs (RIGs). The key advantage of RIGs is that their properties are\nindependent of the underlying distribution of the data, relying solely on the\nassumption of independence between observations. By using two key properties of\nRIGs-edge probability and vertex degree distribution-we develop two new\nrandomness tests: the RIG-Edge Probability test and the RIG-Degree Distribution\n(RIG-DD) test. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that these tests\ncan detect a broad range of dependencies, including complex phenomena such as\nconditional heteroskedasticity and chaotic behavior, beyond simple\ncorrelations. Furthermore, we show that the RIG-DD test outperforms most of the\nexisting tests of randomness in the literature.

The\narched profile predominantly arises from contributions within the quantum\nmany-body scar subspace, while the buttress is linked to thermalization\ndynamics. To explain this behavior, we utilize the representation theory of\n$\\mathfrak{s}l_3(\\mathbb{C})$, allowing us to decompose the PXP Hamiltonian\ninto a linear component and a residual part. The linear term governs the\nformation and width of the arch, and we observe that that there exists a\nthreshold of arch width which determines whether a given initial state exhibits\nscarring.

Existing approaches often rely on\nfine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D\ninformation through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their\nresults generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric\ndetail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly\nintegrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model\ntraining to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically,\nwe train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior,\nperception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures\nthe rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained\ndiffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D\nGaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception\npriors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth\nconsistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results\nof our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D\nreconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.",

By decomposing the emitting region into a set\nof one-dimensional luminous segments, each characterized by its inclination\nangle and inner radius, we construct transfer functions that capture key image\nfeatures-namely, the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. This approach\nallows a unified treatment of disk geometry and viewing angle. We explore three\nregimes: optically thin, optically thick, and partially optically thick disks.\nFor optically thin flows, increasing the disk thickness (characterized by the\nhalf-opening angle $\\psi_0$) broadens the lensing ring, gradually bridging the\nphoton ring and the direct image. The photon ring remains narrow, but its\nposition robustly defines the innermost edge of the lensing structure. In the\noptically thick case, image features are primarily determined by the first\nintersection of traced light rays with the disk, and we provide analytical\ncriteria for the presence of lensing and photon rings based on the critical\ndeflection angles. For partially optically thick disks, we adopt a simplified\nradiative transport model and find a critical absorption coefficient $\\chi \\sim\n(6M\\psi_0)^{-1}$ beyond which the image rapidly transitions from an optically\nthin- to thick-disk appearance.

A common\napproach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;\nhowever, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.\nMoreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy\nadversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting\nstealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a\nrobust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known\ncyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),\nman-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN\nperturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as\nbenign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These\nadversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success\nrates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational\nautoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial\ninputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based\nregret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based\ndetectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats.

To address these dual challenges, we propose a novel Norm-Aware\nLinear Attention mechanism serving to restore norm-guided dynamic spikiness and\nrecover kernel-perturbed norm distributions. Specifically, we first decouple\nquery and key matrices into two components: norm and direction, to achieve\nnorm-aware spikiness control and norm consistency, respectively. We\nmathematically reveal that the extent of entropy reduction varies with the\nquery norm in softmax normalization, motivating a query-norm aware kernel\nfunction for dynamic control over entropy reduction. Furthermore, to ensure\nnorm consistency and enforce non-negativity constraints, we employ a\nnorm-preserving mapping to project all elements of the angular matrix into\npositive values, leveraging cosine similarity to inhibit dimensions with\nopposite directions. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that the\nNaLaFormer improves performance on vision and language tasks, enhancing both\nexpressiveness and efficiency by up to 4.2\\%.",

These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade\nvalue estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the\nexisting policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an\nantifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental\nadversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which\nincrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which\nenables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD\nobservations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a\ntheoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic\nforgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with\nincreasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as\nthe boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under\nwhich forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through\niterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance\nminimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically\nevaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D\nobstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms\nstandard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient\ndescent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative\nreward and over 30% fewer conflict events.

    "abstract": "The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\nhas exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in\nreinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing\nrobust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value\ndistribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To\naddress this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that\nenhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a\nswitching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism\ndynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially\ninduced state-action-value distribution shifts.

The BMV (Bose-Marletto-Vedral)\nexperiment can assess the quantum nature of gravity by testing whether\ngravitational interactions can generate entanglement between quantum systems.\nIn this work, we show that entanglement can be generated by gravity without\nrequiring spacetime superpositions or quantum spacetime degrees of freedom by\nusing mediators that do not satisfy the usual property of local tomography when\ncoupling to quantum matter. Specifically, we showcase how entanglement can be\ngenerated using three distinct toy models that display non-locally tomographic\ncouplings between quantum matter and a locally classical gravitational\nmediator. These models include (i) fermionic systems with the parity\nsuperselection rule, (ii) non-Abelian anyonic systems, and (iii) a novel bit\nanti-bit model. Our results demonstrate a crucial point: a gravitational\nmediator which does not exhibit superpositions of its classical basis but still\nqualifies as non-classical via non-locally tomographic coupling mechanisms can\ngenerate entanglement through local interactions. This work also underscores\nthe importance of relaxing local tomography in exploring the\nquantum-gravitational interface. It provides a novel perspective on the role of\nspacetime degrees of freedom in entanglement generation through local\ninteractions.",

    "abstract": "Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the\nidentification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting\nexperimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive\nprocess, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and\nafter perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and\nunperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt\nto forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent\nrelationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In\nthis work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges\n(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively\naddressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework\nas a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)\ninformation to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,\nand further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving\nthe quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same\nperturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a\nbimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we\nintroduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual\nconditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell\nperturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under\nthe guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve\ngeneration quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a\nbiologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent\nheterogeneity in single-cell responses.",

In this context,\ndynamically switching the existing network links among the system elements can\nfacilitate the onset of synchronization. However, determining the optimal rate\nat which links should be switched to ensure asymptotically stable synchronized\nbehavior remains an open question. Here, we address this issue in a\ndouble-layer network of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators with sparse inter-layer\nconnectivity.

We also\nevaluate the effectiveness of fast-switching links as the layer size increases.\nIn a reduced system, we introduce smooth square-wave functions to emulate link\nswitching, eventually introducing discontinuities into the system dynamics.\nThis approach enables the assessment of the transverse stability of\nsynchronized states induced by switching links.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes realized return behavior across a broad set of crypto\nassets by estimating heterogeneous exposures to idiosyncratic and systematic\nrisk. A key challenge arises from the latent nature of broader economy-wide\nrisk sources: macro-financial proxies are unavailable at high-frequencies,\nwhile the abundance of low-frequency candidates offers limited guidance on\nempirical relevance. To address this, we develop a two-stage\n``divide-and-conquer'' approach. The first stage estimates exposures to\nhigh-frequency idiosyncratic and market risk only, using asset-level IV\nregressions. The second stage identifies latent economy-wide factors by\nextracting the leading principal component from the model residuals and mapping\nit to lower-frequency macro-financial uncertainty and sentiment-based\nindicators via high-dimensional variable selection. Structured patterns of\nheterogeneity in exposures are uncovered using Mean Group estimators across\nasset categories. The method is applied to a broad sample of crypto assets,\ncovering more than 80% of total market capitalization. We document short-term\nmean reversion and significant average exposures to idiosyncratic volatility\nand illiquidity. Green and DeFi assets are, on average, more exposed to\nmarket-level and economy-wide risk than their non-Green and non-DeFi\ncounterparts. By contrast, stablecoins are less exposed to idiosyncratic,\nmarket-level, and economy-wide risk factors relative to non-stablecoins. At a\nconceptual level, our study develops a coherent framework for isolating\ndistinct layers of risk in crypto markets. Empirically, it sheds light on how\nreturn sensitivities vary across digital asset categories -- insights that are\nimportant for both portfolio design and regulatory oversight.",

    "abstract": "Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern\nautonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that\ndeliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major\nchallenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo\nmatching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost\nvolumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information\nand also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and\nregression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale\ncost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising\nroute for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure\nhighly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the\nEnhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with\nsmall-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary\nfeatures into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from\nthe initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These\nfeatures are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a\ncompact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene\ngeometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large\nreceptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a\nhighly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo\nachieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX\nOrin.",

Multi-carrier\nwaveforms, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), have been\nconsidered as good candidates for ISAC due to their high communications data\nrate and good time bandwidth property for sensing. Nevertheless, their high\npeak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) values lead to either performance\ndegradation or an increase in system complexity. This can make OFDM unsuitable\nfor IoT applications with insufficient resources in terms of power, system\ncomplexity, hardware size or cost. This article provides IoT-centric constant\nmodulus waveform designs that leverage the advantage of unit PAPR and thus are\nmore suitable in resource-limited scenarios. More specifically, several\nsingle-carrier frequency and/or phase-modulated waveforms are considered. A\ncomprehensive discussion on their radar sensing and communications performance\nis conducted based on performance metrics, including the radar ambiguity\nfunction, the bandwidth property, the data rate, and the communications\nreceiver complexity.",

Traditional LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\n(SLAM) systems often rely on 3D point cloud maps, which typically require\nextensive storage to preserve structural details in large-scale environments.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for LiDAR SLAM by leveraging the\nContinuous and Ultra-compact Representation of LiDAR (CURL) introduced in [1].\nOur proposed LiDAR mapping approach, CURL-SLAM, produces compact 3D maps\ncapable of continuous reconstruction at variable densities using CURL's\nspherical harmonics implicit encoding, and achieves global map consistency\nafter loop closure. Unlike popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based LiDAR\nodometry techniques, CURL-SLAM formulates LiDAR pose estimation as a unique\noptimization problem tailored for CURL and extends it to local Bundle\nAdjustment (BA), enabling simultaneous pose refinement and map correction.\nExperimental results demonstrate that CURL-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art 3D\nmapping quality and competitive LiDAR trajectory accuracy, delivering\nsensor-rate real-time performance (10 Hz) on a CPU.

To improve the\nefficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two\nseparate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the\nA-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and\ndegraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and\nviewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent\nreconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an\nend-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we\nunify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D\nnative generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we\npropose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable\ncharacter as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of\nmulti-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image\ncondition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of\npose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived\nfrom realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit\nrelationships between skeleton and skinning weights.

Current mainstream codecs are fixed-frame-rate (FFR), which\nallocate the same number of tokens to every equal-duration slice. However,\nspeech is inherently non-uniform in temporal information density. As a result,\nmany tokens are wasted on steady-state segments like long vowels and silences.\nTo address this mismatch, we present CodecSlime, a plugin-style method for\ncompressing temporal redundancy through supporting dynamic frame rate (DFR) on\nneural speech codecs for the first time. Our method is unsupervised and\narchitecture-agnostic, combining two key innovations, ScheDFR and\nMelt-and-Cool, for adapting inference and training, respectively. When\nintegrated into a typical VQ-GAN codec backbone and operating at 40 Hz DFR\n($\\approx$ 600 bps), the reconstruction WER of CodecSlime is reduced by up to\n46% relative to conventional FFR baselines with the same model architecture and\nsimilar bitrates, while other metrics are also competitive. CodecSlime also\nenables flexible trade-offs between reconstruction quality and bitrate: a\nsingle model supports inference at multiple frame rates and consistently\noutperforms FFR models at the corresponding frame rates.

In this chapter, we hope to summarize the rigorous development of what\nhas become known as Schubert calculus, with an eye toward computation. We\ndiscuss Grassmannians and flag varieties and their cohomology rings, following\nMonk's constructive algebraic approach. We derive formulas for Schur and\nSchubert polynomials, which represent cohomology classes of Schubert varieties.\nWe hint at the vast literature in this area and point to the other references\nin the Handbook for more information. Finally, we identify open problems that\nremain a challenge even with modern tools at our fingertips in hopes of\ninspiring further contributions in this fascinating field.\n  This is intended as the first chapter of a book entitled \"Handbook of\nCombinatorial Algebraic Geometry: Subvarieties of the Flag Variety\", a\ncompendium of topics in the area. The book is being edited by Erik Insko,\nMartha Precup, and Ed Richmond. In addition to this introductory chapter,\nothers will cover more advanced topics such as Kazhdan-Lusztig varieties,\ngeneralized smooth Schubert varieties, Richardson varieties and positroid\nvarieties, spherical and torus orbit closures, spanning line configurations,\ndifferent types of Hessenberg varieties, and generalizations to Kac-Moody flag\nvarieties, each written by experts in those areas.

This review systematically examines recent advancements\nin charge carrier management strategies aimed at overcoming these limitations.\nInitially, fundamental mechanisms governing carrier generation, separation,\ntransport, and recombination are outlined to provide a clear foundation. The\nstudy then delves into an in-depth analysis of carrier lifetime and mobility,\nevaluating recent methodologies for their enhancement through compositional\nengineering and structural optimization. Subsequently, trap state passivation\ntechniques and interface engineering approaches are reviewed, with a particular\nfocus on their impact on device stability and efficiency.

In this work, recent strategies for charge carrier\nmanagement are systematically categorized, comparative analyses are provided\nand synergistic solutions with high potential for real-world implementation are\nhighlighted.

To illustrate utility of the general method we apply it to\nconsider two particular cases: (i) one-parameter family of matrices\ninterpolating between complex Ginibre and real Ginibre ensembles and (ii) a\ncomplex Ginibre matrix additively perturbed by a fixed matrix.

    "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), the data distribution of each client may change\nover time, introducing both temporal and spatial data heterogeneity, known as\nconcept drift. Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift\n(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the\ninput distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution\nP(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily\nfocus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these\nmethods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading\nto catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different\nsources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift\ncalls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from\nretaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a\ngeneral adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To\naddress this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework\ndesigned to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable\nhistorical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster\nnumber determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real\ndrift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and\na concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful\nhistorical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and\nexperiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.",

The key insight\nbehind the proposed method is that the skill discovery is adversarial to the\npolicy learning, i.e., skills with weak strength should be further explored\nwhile less exploration for the skills with converged strength. As an\nimplementation, we score the degree of strength convergence with regret, and\nguide the skill discovery with a learnable skill generator. To avoid\ndegeneration, skill generation comes from an up-gradable population of skill\ngenerators. We conduct experiments on environments with varying complexities\nand dimension sizes.

    "abstract": "Atomic-scale ferroelectric thin films hold great promise for high-density,\nlow-power applications but face stability and voltage scaling challenges at\nextreme thinness. Here, we demonstrate ferroelectricity in single-crystalline\ntwo-dimensional (2D) Ga$_2$O$_3$, an ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductor, at just\n6 angstrom thickness, exhibiting exceptional retention and thermal stability.\nWe show that epitaxial beta-Ga$_2$O$_3$ can be exfoliated down to a half-unit\ncell thickness via a self-limiting mechanism, enabling a biaxial strain-induced\nphase transition into a novel ferroelectric layered structure. Strain\nmodulation enables the reduction of polarization switching voltage to 0.8 V,\nmeeting CMOS voltage scaling requirements. Theoretical calculations reveal that\nswitching is driven by covalent bond reconstruction, effectively countering\ndepolarization and enhancing stability. Additionally, we integrate\nferroelectric 2D Ga$_2$O$_3$ onto silicon using a low-temperature,\nback-end-of-line-compatible process.

    "abstract": "Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on\nthese datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world\ndatasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more\ndata-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate\nredundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing\ntraining costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically\nrely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined\neffect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We\nintroduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample\nredundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic\nstructure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a\nreinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a\nlightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging\nepsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward\nsignal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse\narchitectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

The review's goals are to address the lack of information that is\nsufficiently explained, learn how to make the most of virtual defect increase,\nand determine whether the framework is viable by using NDE measurements. As its\nbasic information source, the technique consists of compiling and categorizing\n223 CR photographs of airplane welds. Information expansion systems, such as\nvirtual defect increase and standard increase, are used to work on the\npreparation dataset. A modified U-net model is prepared using the improved data\nto produce semantic fault division veils. To assess the effectiveness of the\nmodel, NDE boundaries such as Case, estimating exactness, and misleading call\nrate are used. Tiny a90/95 characteristics, which provide strong\ndifferentiating evidence of flaws, reveal that the suggested approach achieves\nexceptional awareness in defect detection. Considering a 90/95, size error, and\nfake call rate in the weld area, the consolidated expansion approach clearly\nwins.

Existing LoRA-based\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and\nfreezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and\nambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As\nmore experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating\nforgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with\nself-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple\nlow-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,\neach treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1\nexpert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid\nambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own\nrelevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning\nand activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per\ninput. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large\nlanguage models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain\nforgetting/generalization during fine-tuning. MoRA shows significant\neffectiveness on enhancing CL with PTMs, and improving generalization while\nmitigating forgetting.",

In DKC,\ndifferences in malapposition and ostium clearance diminished between stents,\nthough Orsiro retained a hemodynamic advantage with lower low-TAESS (28.2% vs\n36.3%).Stent design influenced outcomes more strongly in PSB, where anatomical\ninteraction and platform-specific behavior impacted both structural and\nhemodynamic results.

    "abstract": "This work develops novel energy-stable parametric finite element methods\n(ES-PFEM) for the Willmore flow and curvature-dependent geometric gradient\nflows of surfaces in three dimensions. The key to achieving the energy\nstability lies in the use of two novel geometric identities: (i) a reformulated\nvariational form of the normal velocity field, and (ii) incorporation of the\ntemporal evolution of the mean curvature into the governing equations. These\nidentities enable the derivation of a new variational formulation. By using the\nparametric finite element method, an implicit fully discrete scheme is\nsubsequently developed, which maintains the energy dissipative property at the\nfully discrete level. Based on the ES-PFEM, comprehensive insights into the\ndesign of ES-PFEM for general curvature-dependent geometric gradient flows and\na new understanding of mesh quality improvement in PFEM are provided. In\nparticular, we develop the first PFEM for the Gauss curvature flow of surfaces.\nFurthermore, a tangential velocity control methodology is applied to improve\nthe mesh quality and enhance the robustness of the proposed numerical method.\nExtensive numerical experiments confirm that the proposed method preserves\nenergy dissipation properties and maintain good mesh quality in the surface\nevolution under the Willmore flow.",

We perform a noise\nanalysis of the KAGRA data obtained during the O3GK observation. Our analysis\nis performed with hierarchical veto (Hveto) which identifies noises based on\nthe statistical time correlation between the main channel and the auxiliary\nchannels. A total of 2,531 noises were vetoed by 28 auxiliary channels with the\nconfiguration (i.e., signal-to-noise threshold set to 8) that we chose for\nHveto. We identify vetoed events as glitches on the spectrogram via visual\nexamination after plotting them with Q-transformation. By referring to the\nGravity Spy project, we categorize 2,354 glitches into six types: blip, helix,\nscratchy, and scattered light, which correspond to those listed in Gravity Spy,\nand dot and line, which are not found in the Gravity Spy classification and are\nthus named based on their spectrogram morphology in KAGRA data. The remaining\n177 glitches are determined not to belong to any of these six types. We show\nhow the KAGRA glitch types are related to each subsystem of KAGRA. To\ninvestigate the possible correlation between the main channel and the round\nwinner - an auxiliary channel statistically associated with the main channel\nfor vetoing purposes - we visually examine the similarity or difference in the\nglitch pattern on the spectrogram. We compare the qualitative correlation found\nthrough visual examination with coherence, which is known to provide\nquantitative measurement for the correlation between the main channel and each\nauxiliary channel.

One popular approach to population size estimation, the\nmultiplier method, is a back-calculation tool requiring only a marginal\nsubpopulation size and an estimate of the proportion belonging to this\nsubgroup. Another approach is to use Bayesian methods, which are inherently\nwell-suited to incorporating multiple data sources. However, both methods have\ntheir drawbacks. A framework for applying the multiplier method which combines\ninformation from several known subpopulations has not yet been established;\nBayesian models, though able to incorporate complex dependencies and various\ndata sources, can be difficult for researchers in less technical fields to\ndesign and implement. Increasing data collection and linkage across diverse\nfields suggests accessible methods of estimating population size with\nsynthesized data are needed. We propose an extension to the well-known\nmultiplier method which is applicable to tree-structured data, where multiple\nsubpopulations and corresponding proportions combine to generate a population\nsize estimate via the minimum variance estimator. The methodology and resulting\nestimates are compared with those from a Bayesian hierarchical model, for both\nsimulated and real world data.

Currently,\nMannheim and Kazanas have provided vacuum solutions for cosmological and local\ngravitational systems, and these solutions may resolve the dark matter and dark\nenergy issues encountered in GR, making them particularly valuable. For static,\nspherically symmetric systems, CG predicts an additional linear potential\ngenerated by luminous matter in addition to the conventional Newtonian\npotential. This extra potential is expected to account for the observations of\ngalaxies and galaxy clusters without the need of dark matter. It is\ncharacterized by the parameter $\\gamma^*$, which corresponds to the linear\npotential generated by the unit of the solar mass, and it is thus a universal\nconstant. The value of $\\gamma^\\ast$ was determined by fitting the rotation\ncurve data of spiral galaxies. These predictions of CG should also be verified\nby the observations of strong gravitational lensing. In this study, building\nupon the previous research, we tested CG via strong lensing statistics. We used\na well-defined sample that consisted of both galaxies and galaxy clusters. This\nallowed us to test CG through statistical strong lensing in a way similar to\nthe conventional approach in GR. As anticipated, our results were consistent\nwith previous studies, namely that the fitted $\\gamma^*$ is much larger than\nthat from rotation curves. Intriguingly, we further discovered that, in order\nto fit the strong lensing data of another sample, the value of $\\gamma^*$\ncannot be a constant, as is required in CG. Instead, we derived a formula for\n$\\gamma^*$ as a function of the stellar mass $M_*$ of the galaxies or galaxy\nclusters. It was found that $\\gamma^*$ decreases as $M_*$ increases.",

To preserve the\ngeneralization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach\nincorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the\nprompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with\nclass-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local\nalignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further\nimproving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on\nthree FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained\nmodel and minimizing computational costs.",

Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy\nconcerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical\ngenerative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational\nresources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising\nalternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield\ngrayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space\nfusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first\nclassical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating\ncolor medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs\nand existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and\nclassification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the\nperformance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art\nclassical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10\ntimes fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for\nquantum image generation as quantum hardware advances.

Currently, most deep learning-based\nvulnerability detection methods focus on stand-alone functions, neglecting the\ncomplex inter-function interrelations, particularly the multilateral\nassociations.

To address this gap, we present an Inter-Function Multilateral\nAssociation analysis framework for Vulnerability Detection (IFMA-VD). The\ncornerstone of the IFMA-VD lies in constructing a code behavior hypergraph and\nutilizing hyperedge convolution to extract multilateral association features.\nSpecifically, we first parse functions into a code property graph to generate\nintra-function features. Following this, we construct a code behavior\nhypergraph by segmenting the program dependency graph to isolate and encode\nbehavioral features into hyperedges. Finally, we utilize a hypergraph network\nto capture the multilateral association knowledge for augmenting vulnerability\ndetection. We evaluate IFMA-VD on three widely used vulnerability datasets and\ndemonstrate improvements in F-measure and Recall compared to baseline methods.\nAdditionally, we illustrate that multilateral association features can boost\ncode feature representation and validate the effectiveness of IFMA-VD on\nreal-world datasets.",

The spin-flavor\nstructure of the nucleon matrix element is interpreted through a multipole\nexpansion in the transverse momentum transfer, leading to the definition of\nmultipole mean-field GPDs. Using these GPDs as the basis of our analysis, we\ntake their $m$-th moments and demonstrate the polynomiality property within the\nmean-field framework, making use of discrete symmetries in the proof. In\nparticular, the first moments ($m = 1$) of the GPDs are related to the nucleon\ntensor form factors, as generally required.

However, one major challenge is\nthe data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences\nat multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data\nheterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g.,\nfine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information\ncontained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client\nsemantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this\npaper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC)\nto capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous\nclients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and\nconsistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class\nunderlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise\ncollaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive\nlearning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational\nprototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other\nhand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner,\nas a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local\nmodel. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a\nconvergence guarantee.

    "abstract": "Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score\nto judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to\ndescribe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability.\nBenefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models\n(LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue.\nThe core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data.\nPrevious explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data\ngeneration processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary\nsystems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline.\nSpecifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled\nvideo and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a\nhierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific\ndimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning\nprocess. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written\nquality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and\ngeneration efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset\ncontains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for\ninstruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and\njustification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy\nto fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a\nbenchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the\nquality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the\nS2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently\nimproves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video\nLMMs.",

    "abstract": "Procrastination represents one of the most prevalent behavioral problems\naffecting individual health and societal productivity. Although it is often\nconceptualized as a form of self-control failure, its underlying neurocognitive\nmechanisms are poorly understood. A leading model posits that procrastination\narises from imbalanced competing motivations: the avoidance of negative task\naversiveness and the pursuit of positive task outcomes, yet this theoretical\nframework has not fully validated in real-world settings and not applied\neffectively to guide interventions. Here, we addressed this gap with a\npreregistered, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We applied seven\nsessions of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS)\nto the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region for\nself-control, in chronic procrastinators. Using the intensive experience\nsampling method (iESM), we assessed the effect of anodal HD-tDCS on real-world\nprocrastination behavior at offline after-effect (2-day interval) and long-term\nretention (6-month follow-up). We found that this neuromodulation produced a\nlasting reduction in real-world procrastination, with effects sustained at a\n6-month follow-up. While the intervention both decreased task aversiveness and\nincreased perceived task outcome value, causal mediation analysis revealed a\nstriking mechanism: the increase in task outcome value uniquely and\nsufficiently mediated the entire behavioral improvement. In conclusion, these\nfindings provide causal evidence that enhancing DLPFC function mitigates\nprocrastination by selectively amplifying the valuation of future rewards, not\nby simply reducing negative feelings about the task. This establishes a\nprecise, value-driven neurocognitive pathway for self-control and offers a\nvalidated, theory-driven strategy for intervention.",

They are\nimportant examples of far-from-equilibrium fluids, which exhibit a wealth of\nnonlinear behavior. This includes active turbulence, in which topological\ndefects braid around one another in a chaotic fashion. One of the most studied\nexamples of active nematics is a dense two-dimensional layer of microtubules,\ncrosslinked by kinesin molecular motors that inject extensile deformations into\nthe fluid. Though numerous studies have modeled microtubule-based active\nnematics, no consensus has emerged on how to fully capture the features of the\nexperimental system. To better understand the foundations for modeling this\nsystem, we propose a fundamental principle we call the nematic locking\nprinciple: individual microtubules cannot rotate without all neighboring\nmicrotubules also rotating. Physically, this is justified by the high density\nof the microtubules, their elongated nature, and their corresponding steric\ninteractions. We assert that nematic locking holds throughout the majority of\nthe material but breaks down in the neighborhood of topological defects and\nother regions of low density. We derive the most general nematic transport\nequation consistent with this principle and also derive the most general term\nthat violates it. We examine the standard Beris-Edwards approach used to model\nthis system and show that it violates nematic locking throughout the majority\nof the material. We then propose a modification to the Beris-Edwards model that\nenforces nematic locking nearly everywhere. This modification shuts off\nfracturing except in regions where the order parameter is reduced. The\nresulting simulations show strong nematic locking throughout the bulk of the\nmaterial, consistent with experimental observation.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide\nrange of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine\ninteractions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing\nprocesses, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.",

This paper\ndescribes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the\neffects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from\ngradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as\ntargets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient\ndescent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model\nperformance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and\nanswering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These\nresults suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be\nsurprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context\nmodeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of\ngradient-based learning.",

In this paper, we introduce the Radical Questioning (RQ) framework\nas a five step, pre-project ethical assessment tool to critically evaluate\nwhether AI should be built at all, especially in domains involving marginalized\npopulations and entrenched systemic injustice. RQ does not replace principles\nbased ethics but precedes it, offering an upstream, deliberative space to\nconfront assumptions, map power, and consider harms before design. Using a case\nstudy in AI for HT, we demonstrate how RQ reveals overlooked sociocultural\ncomplexities and guides us away from surveillance based interventions toward\nsurvivor empowerment tools.

We engage in action research to\ndevelop an early version of a formalised process to rapidly prototype game\nstories for Cubetto.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive\nexperiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL\nprotocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in\nage accuracy and identity consistency.",

    "abstract": "When two variables depend on the same or similar underlying network, their\nshared network dependence structure can lead to spurious associations. While\nstatistical associations between two variables sampled from interconnected\nsubjects are a common inferential goal across various fields, little research\nhas focused on how to disentangle shared dependence for valid statistical\ninference. We revisit two different approaches from distinct fields that may\naddress shared network dependence: the pre-whitening approach, commonly used in\ntime series analysis to remove the shared temporal dependence, and the network\nautocorrelation model, widely used in network analysis often to examine or\naccount for autocorrelation of the outcome variable. We demonstrate how each\napproach implicitly entails assumptions about how a variable of interest\npropagates among nodes via network ties given the network structure. We further\npropose adaptations of existing pre-whitening methods to the network setting by\nexplicitly reflecting underlying assumptions about \"level of interaction\" that\ninduce network dependence, while accounting for its unique complexities. Our\nsimulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the two approaches in\nreducing spurious associations due to shared network dependence when their\nrespective assumptions hold. However, the results also show the sensitivity to\nassumption violations, underscoring the importance of correctly specifying the\nshared dependence structure based on available network information and prior\nknowledge about the interactions driving dependence.",

This study pioneers the use of generative\ndiffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal\ninfrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation\nImager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we\ndeveloped a high-precision visible light reflectance generative model, called\nReflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\\mu\\mathrm{m},\n0.65~\\mu\\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\\mu\\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance\ngeneration at night.

Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90,\nwith particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud\nstructures and thick clouds.

This\nwork investigates the co-design of integrated sensing, communication, and\ncontrol ($\\mathbf{SC^{2}}$) for multi-UAV cooperative systems with finite\nblocklength (FBL) transmission. In particular, the UAVs continuously monitor\nthe state of the field robots and transmit their observations to the robot\ncontroller to ensure stable control while cooperating to localize an unknown\nsensing target (ST). To this end, a weighted optimization problem is first\nformulated by jointly considering the control and localization performance in\nterms of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cost and the determinant of the\nFisher information matrix (FIM), respectively. The resultant problem,\noptimizing resource allocations, the UAVs' deployment positions, and multi-user\nscheduling, is non-convex. To circumvent this challenge, we first derive a\nclosed-form expression of the LQR cost with respect to other variables.\nSubsequently, the non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into a series\nof sub-problems by leveraging the alternating optimization (AO) approach, in\nwhich the difference of convex functions (DC) programming and projected\ngradient descent (PGD) method are employed to obtain an efficient near-optimal\nsolution.

While deep learning-based\ncomputational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models\nprimarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language\ninstruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including\ninsufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image\nunderstanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically\ndesigned for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse,\npathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer\nturns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated\nthat PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as\nboth state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific\nmodels. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI\nsystem leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide\nimages (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching\nhigh accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis\nbenchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded,\nhumanly-interpretable summary reports.",

    "abstract": "Domain Adaptation(DA) for dense prediction tasks is an important topic, which\nenhances the dense prediction model's performance when tested on its unseen\ndomain. Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA\ncapability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

To address the challenge,\nwe propose AgentStealth, a self-reinforcing LLM anonymization framework.First,\nwe introduce an adversarial anonymization workflow enhanced by In-context\nContrastive Learning and Adaptive Utility-Aware Control. Second, we perform\nsupervised adaptation of SLMs using high-quality data collected from the\nworkflow, which includes both anonymization and attack signals. Finally, we\napply online reinforcement learning where the model leverages its internal\nadversarial feedback to iteratively improve anonymization performance.\nExperiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms baselines in both\nanonymization effectiveness (+12.3%) and utility (+6.8%).

The\ndisplacements of users' lateral position and pelvis angle were also increased\nin the instantaneous response to a collision with a non-player character (NPC),\neven when the NPC was inside the field of view. Haptic feedback also enhanced\nusers' awareness and visual exploration when an NPC approached from the side\nand back. Furthermore, variation in walking speed was increased by the haptic\nfeedback. These results suggested that the haptic feedback enhanced users'\nsensitivity to a collision in VR environment.",

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal place to study hot core\nand COM formation in an environment that is different from our Galaxy, though\nprior to this study there have only been nine detections of extragalactic hot\ncores (seven in the LMC and two in the Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC). Here, we\nreport 1.2 mm continuum and molecular line observations with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the star-forming region N160 that we\nnamed N160A-mm. We identify six 1.2 mm continuum sources, four of which are\nassociated with methanol (CH$_3$OH) emission. Another COM, methyl cyanide\n(CH$_3$CN) is associated with the brightest source, N160A-mmA, the most\nchemically rich source in the field. Using the XCLASS software, we perform\nspectral modeling to estimate rotational temperatures and total column\ndensities of detected molecular species for four sources. Based on the\ntemperature exceeding 100 K, small size, and high H$_2$ number density, we\nidentify N160A-mmA as a hot core. We compare the molecular abundances of this\nnewly detected hot core with those previously detected in the LMC and SMC, as\nwell as with a sample of Galactic hot cores, and discuss the complex nature of\nN160A-mmA.",

We find evidence of\nmoderately alkaline water (pH 10.1-11.6)--significantly more alkaline than\ncurrent estimates (~8-9) of the pH of Enceladus's ocean. Nevertheless, the pH\nrange from phosphates is consistent with the CO$_2$/H$_2$O ratio measured in\nthe plume if CO$_2$ exsolves from ocean water according to its equilibrium\nsolubility. A simple energy balance can be used to quantify volatile\nfractionation during gas transport inside Enceladus's tiger stripes; we deduce\nthat ~83% of water vapor is removed as ice during transport between the\nliquid-vapor interface and where gases exit the subsurface. We also explore how\nCO$_2$ degassing may lead to an increase in the apparent pH of ocean water. We\ngenerate maps of allowed combinations of pH and dissolved inorganic carbon\nconcentration of the source water for a wide range of scenarios. Our preferred\ninterpretation, constrained by the observed heat flux, implies minimal CO$_2$\ndegassing from ocean water. Hence, the pH recorded by phosphates should closely\napproximate that of the ocean; our best estimate is pH ~10.6. Such a high pH\nseems to reflect a major role of silicates enriched in Na, Mg, or Fe(II)\ninteracting extensively with ocean water. Silica nanoparticles would not form\nor would subsequently dissolve if the pH is too high (>10.5). The outgassing\nmodel presented here provides a new path to quantify the dissolved\nconcentrations of volatile species.",

    "abstract": "Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated\nobject reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches\npredominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and\ndifferentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and\nunnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft\ntissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty\ntissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based\nskinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding\nthe rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh),\nwhich is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated\nskeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object\nas particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure\ndifferentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion.\nAdditionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the\nlearning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our\nframework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from\nObjaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object\ncategories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional\nLBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible\nresults. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the\npose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object\nmodeling.",

Existing backdoor strategies predominantly rely on end-to-end label\nsupervision, which, despite their efficacy, often results in detectable feature\ndisentanglement and limited persistence. In this work, we propose a novel and\nstealthy backdoor attack framework, named SPA, which fundamentally departs from\ntraditional approaches by leveraging feature-space alignment rather than direct\ntrigger-label association. Specifically, SPA reduces representational distances\nbetween backdoor trigger features and target class features, enabling the\nglobal model to misclassify trigger-embedded inputs with high stealth and\npersistence. We further introduce an adaptive, adversarial trigger optimization\nmechanism, utilizing boundary-search in the feature space to enhance attack\nlongevity and effectiveness, even against defensive FL scenarios and non-IID\ndata distributions. Extensive experiments on various FL benchmarks demonstrate\nthat SPA consistently achieves high attack success rates with minimal impact on\nmodel utility, maintains robustness under challenging participation and data\nheterogeneity conditions, and exhibits persistent backdoor effects far\nexceeding those of conventional techniques.

Strengthening the constraint to\ncover transaction prices redistributes surplus, harming the low-value group and\nbenefiting the high-value group.",

    "abstract": "Lattice arrays have been shown to have great value as simulators for\ncomplicated mathematical problems. In all physical lattices so far, coupling is\nonly between nearest neighbors or nearest plus next-nearest neighbors; the\ngeometry of the lattice controls the couplings of the sites. Realizing\nindependently tunable, long-range interactions between distant condensates is a\nprerequisite for scalable analogue spin machines but has so far been restricted\nto short-range geometric coupling. In this work we show that it is possible\nusing two-dimensional lattices of polariton condensates to use the third\ndimension to arbitrarily select two sites to couple coherently. Light emitted\nin the vertical direction from a condensate at one site can be imaged and sent\nback into the system to impinge on a different condensate at an arbitrary\ndistance. We demonstrate this for the case of two condensates, in which we\nfirst ensure that they have no coupling within the plane of the lattice, and\nthen use external imaging to phase lock the two together. Phase-resolved\ninterferometry confirms clearly visible interference fringes and deterministic\nphase locking even when direct, planar coupling is suppressed. Analytical\nmodeling reveals complementary mechanisms underpinning the robust coherence.\nBecause the mirror adds no cameras, modulators, or electronic processing, the\ncondensate pair operates as a pure, high-bandwidth analog element. Extension to\ndense graphs via segmented micro-mirror arrays is therefore ultimately limited\nonly by the field of view and numerical aperture of the imaging optics. Our\nscheme thus paves the way to reconfigurable, energy-efficient polaritonic\nhardware for optimization, classification, clustering, and other neuromorphic\ntasks at the speed of light.",

Traditional methods, including gradient-based\nsolvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become\nimpractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,\nrequiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible\nparameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present\na multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously\ninfer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then\ncollaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our\nAutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized\nagents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,\nand optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint\ngeneration using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent\noptimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational\nbounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and\nyield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance\nwith conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational\nefficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in\nunder 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond\ncomputational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates\nsophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,\nand applying domain-informed heuristics.

These\nlimitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world\nlanguage tasks.\n  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream\napplications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant\nknowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training\ntechnique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,\nwe present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces\nmemory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance.

By projecting\nthe electronic conductivity along specific spatial directions, we find that\nboth the crystal orientation and the graphene purity significantly influence\nthe anisotropy and magnitude of electronic transport in the composites.

It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$\nsearch per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to\nAI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive\nreasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously\nextract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for\nfuture tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level\nsubroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$\nsearch is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save\nexploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images,\nyielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent \"FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask\nplanning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted\nby LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$\nsearch is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks.

    "abstract": "Online advertising systems have recently transitioned to autobidding,\nenabling advertisers to delegate bidding decisions to automated agents. Each\nadvertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective\nsubject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their\nrelevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare\nprice of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which\nsimultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of\nheterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA\nbounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for\nmixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for\nadditive valuations.\n  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to\nautobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters\nacross heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving\na POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)\nSimplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous\nFPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and\nutility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)\nExtendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve\nprices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous\npayment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first\n(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of\nthe art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing\nalgorithms. Building on Kolumbus and Nisan (WWW 2022), we show that CCE from\nsuch agents have properties that keep their POA low.",

    "abstract": "Financial literacy empowers individuals to make informed and effective\nfinancial decisions, improving their overall financial well-being and security.\nHowever, for many people understanding financial concepts can be daunting and\nonly half of US adults are considered financially literate. Data visualization\nsimplifies these concepts, making them accessible and engaging for learners of\nall ages. This systematic review analyzes 37 research papers exploring the use\nof data visualization and visual analytics in financial education and literacy\nenhancement. We classify these studies into five key areas: (1) the evolution\nof visualization use across time and space, (2) motivations for using\nvisualization tools, (3) the financial topics addressed and instructional\napproaches used, (4) the types of tools and technologies applied, and (5) how\nthe effectiveness of teaching interventions was evaluated. Furthermore, we\nidentify research gaps and highlight opportunities for advancing financial\nliteracy. Our findings offer practical insights for educators and professionals\nto effectively utilize or design visual tools for financial literacy.",

We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model\nand propose novel geometric constraints that account for occlusions and depth\ndiscontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature\nmatching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of\nattention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both\ntheoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate\nthat combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal\nabstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.",

    "abstract": "Online conformal prediction has demonstrated its capability to construct a\nprediction set for each incoming data point that covers the true label with a\npredetermined probability. To cope with potential distribution shift,\nmulti-model online conformal prediction has been introduced to select and\nleverage different models from a preselected candidate set. Along with the\nimproved flexibility, the choice of the preselected set also brings challenges.\nA candidate set that includes a large number of models may increase the\ncomputational complexity. In addition, the inclusion of irrelevant models with\npoor performance may negatively impact the performance and lead to\nunnecessarily large prediction sets. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel multi-model online conformal prediction algorithm that identifies a\nsubset of effective models at each time step by collecting feedback from a\nbipartite graph, which is refined upon receiving new data. A model is then\nselected from this subset to construct the prediction set, resulting in reduced\ncomputational complexity and smaller prediction sets. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that using prediction set size as feedback, alongside model loss,\ncan significantly improve efficiency by constructing smaller prediction sets\nwhile still satisfying the required coverage guarantee. The proposed algorithms\nare proven to ensure valid coverage and achieve sublinear regret. Experiments\non real and synthetic datasets validate that the proposed methods construct\nsmaller prediction sets and outperform existing multi-model online conformal\nprediction approaches.",

    "abstract": "Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis\nin the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors\nproposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained\non modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced\nby B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and\nmetabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a\npatch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline\ncomponents were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled\nspectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra.\nThe analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled\nspectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared\nerrors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs)\nof the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the\nphantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The\nmodeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on\nthe B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The\nanalysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved\nMSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by\n26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra.\nThe performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to\n1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both\ntypes of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep\nlearning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest\nthat the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral\nanalysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.",

    "abstract": "We use JWST/NIRSpec observations of the radio galaxy 3C 293 to map the\nemission, extinction, and kinematics of hot molecular and ionized gas, as well\nas stellar kinematics, within the inner ~ 2 kpc. The stellar velocity field is\nwell described by a rotating disk model, with its kinematical center offset by\n~ 0.5 arcsec from the continuum peak. The hot molecular gas is traced by the\nH$_2$2.12$\\mu$m emission line, and the ionized gas by [Fe II]1.64$\\mu$m and\nPa$\\alpha$. The gas presents three main kinematic components: a rotating disk\nseen as a narrow component ($\\sigma$ ~ 100 kms$^{-1}$); a blueshifted broad\noutflow ($\\sigma$ ~ 250 kms$^{-1}$); and a fast ionized outflow as a very broad\ncomponent ($\\sigma$ ~ 640 kms$^{-1}$). Extinction maps reveal high A$_V$\nvalues, up to ~ 35, spatially coincident with dust lanes seen in optical\nimages. In addition to the disk and outflows components, inflows along the dust\nlanes are detected in H$_2$ gas, with a mass inflow rate of $\\dot{M}_{in}$ ~ 8\nx 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the AGN accretion rate. For\nthe outflows, we derive peak mass-outflow rates of 0.14 $\\pm$ 0.04\nM$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ (molecular) and 5.5 $\\pm$ 1.44 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$\n(ionized). The outflow, driven by the radio jet, has a kinetic power of 4.5% of\nthe jet power - enough to suppress star formation.

Broadband on-chip OFCs reaching visible wavelengths are\nespecially valuable as they address atomic clock transitions that play an\nimportant role in position, navigation, and timing infrastructure. Silicon\nnitride (SiN) deposited via low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) is\nthe usual platform for the fabrication of chip-integrated OFCs, and such\nfabrication is now standard at wafer sizes up to 200 mm. However, the LPCVD\nhigh temperature and film stress poses challenges in scaling to larger wafers\nand integration with electronic and photonic devices. Here, we report the\nlinear performance and broadband frequency comb generation from microring\nresonators fabricated on 300 mm wafers at AIM Photonics, using a lower\ntemperature, lower stress plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process\nthat is suitable for thick ($\\approx$ 700 nm) SiN films and compatible with\nelectronic and photonic integration. The platform exhibits consistent insertion\nloss, high intrinsic quality factor, and thickness variation of $\\pm$2 % across\nthe whole 300 mm wafer. We demonstrate broadband soliton microcomb generation\nwith a lithographically tunable dispersion profile extending to wavelengths\nrelevant to common alkali atom transitions.
