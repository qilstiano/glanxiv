    "abstract": "4D video control is essential in video generation as it enables the use of\nsophisticated lens techniques, such as multi-camera shooting and dolly zoom,\nwhich are currently unsupported by existing methods. Training a video Diffusion\nTransformer (DiT) directly to control 4D content requires expensive multi-view\nvideos. Inspired by Monocular Dynamic novel View Synthesis (MDVS) that\noptimizes a 4D representation and renders videos according to different 4D\nelements, such as camera pose and object motion editing, we bring pseudo 4D\nGaussian fields to video generation. Specifically, we propose a novel framework\nthat constructs a pseudo 4D Gaussian field with dense 3D point tracking and\nrenders the Gaussian field for all video frames. Then we finetune a pretrained\nDiT to generate videos following the guidance of the rendered video, dubbed as\nGS-DiT. To boost the training of the GS-DiT, we also propose an efficient Dense\n3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) method for the pseudo 4D Gaussian field\nconstruction. Our D3D-PT outperforms SpatialTracker, the state-of-the-art\nsparse 3D point tracking method, in accuracy and accelerates the inference\nspeed by two orders of magnitude. During the inference stage, GS-DiT can\ngenerate videos with the same dynamic content while adhering to different\ncamera parameters, addressing a significant limitation of current video\ngeneration models. GS-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and\nextends the 4D controllability of Gaussian splatting to video generation beyond\njust camera poses. It supports advanced cinematic effects through the\nmanipulation of the Gaussian field and camera intrinsics, making it a powerful\ntool for creative video production.

Topological phase\ntransitions may arise when there exist two or more distinct topological phases,\nand they are often revealed by a gap-closing phenomenon. In this work, we\ninvestigate the magnonic properties of honeycomb ferromagnets exhibiting Kitaev\nand DMI interactions in the presence of a Heisenberg exchange and\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy exposed to a magnetic field. We employ the\nSelf-Consistent Renormalization (SCR) spin wave theory to investigate the\neffects of magnon-magnon interactions (MMIs) and thermal fluctuations on the\nproperties of magnons. Our findings demonstrate that the magnon system\nundergoes topological phase transitions driven by temperature and magnetic\nfields, which are attributed to MMIs. Specifically, as the temperature rises,\nthe magnon band gap at the Dirac points closes and reopens at the critical\ntemperature Tc , which is below the Curie temperature. By showing that the\nChern numbers of the magnonic bands are distinct above and below Tc , we\nconfirm that the gap-closing phenomenon is indeed a signature for the\ntopological phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the\nthermal Hall conductivity in the magnonic system exhibits a sign reversal at Tc\n, which can serve as an experimental probe of its topological nature.",

In this model, measurements correspond to\nPerspectives and Meta-Perspectives, represented as Boolean subalgebras and\nHilbert sub-lattices within the Hilbert lattice, respectively. The Hilbert\nlattice itself is reinterpreted as Jung's Unus Mundus, a unified ontological\nreality. A metaphysical observation, made by a metaphysical observer, of a\ngiven system (World) is identified with the set of all corresponding\nmeta-perspectives in the Hilbert lattice/Unus Mundus, the ocean of reality.\n  Perspectives, likened to islands in this ocean, correspond to single\nmeasurements of a system, capturing the logical structure of observed\nproperties. Meta-perspectives, analogous to continents, represent the synthesis\nof multiple measurements, providing a broader yet inherently incomplete\nunderstanding of the system. This structure emphasizes the complementarity and\ncontextual dependencies of measurements while exposing the limitations of\nclassical objectivity in the quantum domain.

This can be avoided\nprovided the cutoff scale is lower than the species scale associated with the\nirrelevant operator. We apply this to towers of states associated with the\nneutrino which couple to the Higgs through the Weinberg operator, the\ndimension-5 irrelevant operator generating the Majorana neutrino mass.\nRequiring the `Majorana species scale', the species scale associated with the\nWeinberg operator, to be below the gravitational species scale, one finds the\nlower bound on the Majorana neutrino mass determined by the species number. The\nFestina-Lente bound also gives the lower bound on the Majorana neutrino mass,\nbut it is not so stringent. Meanwhile, even if the neutrino mass is of the\nDirac type at the renormalizable level, the Majorana mass term still can be\nwritten in the effective field theory action so far as the Weinberg operator is\nnot forbidden. Even if the Majorana neutrino mass is larger than the Dirac one,\nso far as there are sufficient degrees of freedom with mass smaller than the\nscale of the cosmological constant, the observation of the Majorana nature of\nthe neutrino may not contradict to quantum gravity constraints which rules out\nthe neutrino mass purely given by the Majorana type.",

In addition, the\nhyperelastic potential of the proposed model is monotonic in isotropic\nisochoric strain invariants of the right Cauchy-Green tensor. In incompressible\nhyperelasticity, this is a relaxed version of the ellipticity (or rank-one\nconvexity) condition. Using this relaxed ellipticity condition, the PANN model\nhas enough flexibility to be applicable to a wide range of materials while\nhaving enough structure for a stable extrapolation outside the calibration\ndata. The monotonic PANN yields excellent results for all materials studied and\ncan represent a wide range of largely varying qualitative and quantitative\nstress behavior. Although calibrated on uniaxial tensile data only, it leads to\na stable numerical behavior of 3D finite element simulations.

    "abstract": "It is generally thought that AGN optical variability is produced, at least in\npart, by reprocessing of central X-rays by a surrounding accretion disc,\nresulting in wavelength-dependent lags between bands. Any good model of AGN\noptical variability should explain not only these lags, but also the overall\npattern of variability as quantified by the power spectral density (PSD). Here\nwe present $\\sim$daily g'-band monitoring of the low-mass AGN NGC\\,4395 over 3\nyears. Together with previous TESS and GTC/HiPERCAM observations we produce an\noptical PSD covering an unprecedented frequency range of $\\sim7$ decades\nallowing excellent determination of PSD parameters. The PSD is well fitted by a\nbending power law with low-frequency slope $\\alpha_{L} = 1.0 \\pm 0.2$,\nhigh-frequency slope $2.1^{+0.2}_{-0.4}$ and bend timescale\n$3.0^{+6.6}_{-1.7}\\,$\\,d. This timescale is close to that derived previously\nfrom a damped random walk (DRW) model fitted to just the TESS observations,\nalthough $\\alpha_{L}$ is too steep to be consistent with a DRW. We compare the\nobserved PSD with one made from light curves synthesized assuming reprocessing\nof X-rays, as observed by \\xmm and Swift, in a disc defined by the observed\nlags. The simulated PSD is also well described by a bending power law but with\na bend two decades higher in frequency. We conclude that the large-amplitude\noptical variations seen on long-timescales are not due to disc reprocessing but\nrequire a second source of variability whose origin is unknown but could be\npropagating disc accretion rate variations.",

    "abstract": "Fiber orientation is an important descriptor of the microstructure for short\nfiber polymer composite materials where accurate and efficient prediction of\nthe orientation state is crucial when evaluating the bulk thermo-mechanical\nresponse of the material. Recent macroscopic fiber orientation models have\nemployed the moment-tensor form in representing the fiber orientation state\nwhich all require a closure approximation for the higher order orientation\ntensors. In addition, various models have been developed to account for rotary\ndiffusion due to fiber-fiber and fiber-matrix interactions which can now more\naccurately simulate the experimentally observed slow fiber kinematics in\npolymer composite processing. Traditionally explicit numerical IVP-ODE\ntransient solvers like the 4th order Runge-Kutta method have been used to\npredict the steady-state fiber orientation state. Here we propose a\ncomputationally efficient method based on the Newton-Raphson iterative\ntechnique for determining steady state orientation tensor values by evaluating\nthe exact derivatives of the moment-tensor evolution equation with respect to\nthe independent components of the orientation tensor. We consider various\nexisting macroscopic fiber orientation models and several closure\nap-proximations to ensure the robustness and reliability of the method. The\nperformance and stability of the approach for obtaining physical solutions in\nvarious homogeneous flow fields is demonstrated through several examples.\nValidation of the obtained exact derivatives of the orientation tensor is\nperformed by benchmarking with results of finite difference techniques",

Existing approaches\nprimarily focus on maximizing global model accuracy, often at the expense of\nunfairness among clients and suboptimal system efficiency, particularly in\nnon-IID (non-Independent and Identically Distributed) settings. In this paper,\nwe introduce FLamma, a novel Federated Learning framework based on adaptive\ngamma-based Stackelberg game, designed to address the aforementioned\nlimitations and promote fairness. Our approach allows the server to act as the\nleader, dynamically adjusting a decay factor while clients, acting as\nfollowers, optimally select their number of local epochs to maximize their\nutility. Over time, the server incrementally balances client influence,\ninitially rewarding higher-contributing clients and gradually leveling their\nimpact, driving the system toward a Stackelberg Equilibrium.

The combined effects of the shear-thinning fluid rheology, the\nparticle aspect ratio, the initial particle orientation and the\nshear-extensional rate factor in various homogenous flow regimes on the\nparticle's dynamics and surface pressure evolution are investigated. The\nshear-thinning fluid behavior was found to modify the particle's trajectory and\nalter the particle's kinematic response. Moreover, the pressure distribution\nover the particle's surface is significantly reduced by the shear-thinning\nfluid rheology. The FEA model is validated by comparing results of the\nNewtonian case with results obtained from the well-known Jefferys analytical\nmodel. Furthermore, Jefferys model is extended to define the particle's\ntrajectory in a special class of homogenous Newtonian flows with combined\nextension and shear rate components typically found in axisymmetric nozzle flow\ncontractions.

    "abstract": "Accurate imputation of missing laboratory values in electronic health records\n(EHRs) is critical to enable robust clinical predictions and reduce biases in\nAI systems in healthcare. Existing methods, such as XGBoost, softimpute, GAIN,\nExpectation Maximization (EM), and MICE, struggle to model the complex temporal\nand contextual dependencies in EHR data, particularly in underrepresented\ngroups. In this work, we propose Lab-MAE, a novel transformer-based masked\nautoencoder framework that leverages self-supervised learning for the\nimputation of continuous sequential lab values. Lab-MAE introduces a structured\nencoding scheme that jointly models laboratory test values and their\ncorresponding timestamps, enabling explicit capturing temporal dependencies.\nEmpirical evaluation on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrates that Lab-MAE\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as XGBoost,\nsoftimpute, GAIN, EM, and MICE across multiple metrics, including root mean\nsquare error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Wasserstein distance (WD). Notably,\nLab-MAE achieves equitable performance across demographic groups of patients,\nadvancing fairness in clinical predictions. We further investigate the role of\nfollow-up laboratory values as potential shortcut features, revealing Lab-MAE's\nrobustness in scenarios where such data is unavailable. The findings suggest\nthat our transformer-based architecture, adapted to the characteristics of EHR\ndata, offers a foundation model for more accurate and fair clinical imputation.\nIn addition, we measure and compare the carbon footprint of Lab-MAE with the a\nXGBoost model, highlighting its environmental requirements.",

In\ndeionized water, bubbles rupture within seconds due to repaid dimple collapse.\nHowever, in phosphate salt solutions, bubbles persisted for several minutes.\nWhile surface tension gradients from evaporation-driven salt concentration\ngradients have been thought to create Marangoni stresses, our results show that\ndespite film thinning being capillary-dominated, Marangoni-driven influx can be\nobserved. Marrucci's theory explains this by showing that an increased\ninterfacial area as the film thins, leads to higher salt concentration in the\nfilm due to Gibbs surface excess. This concentration gradient induces Marangoni\nstresses, causing flow reversal, increased film thickness, and enhanced foam\nstability. We show that Marrucci's theory has been incorrectly dismissed, and\nthe predicted critical heights where fluid influx occurs closely match our\nfindings and other studies using sodium chloride. Additionally, we extend the\ntheory's applicability to foam films in non-aqueous film mixtures, highlighting\nits broader relevance.",

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental problems in quantum gravity is to describe the\nexperience of a gravitating observer in generic spacetimes. In this paper, we\ndevelop a framework for describing non-perturbative physics relative to an\nobserver using the gravitational path integral. We apply our proposal to an\nobserver that lives in a closed universe and one that falls behind a black hole\nhorizon. We find that the Hilbert space that describes the experience of the\nobserver is much larger than the Hilbert space in the absence of an observer.\nIn the case of closed universes, the Hilbert space is not one-dimensional, as\ncalculations in the absence of the observer suggest. Rather, its dimension\nscales exponentially with $G_N^{-1}$. Similarly, from an observer's\nperspective, the dimension of the Hilbert space in a two-sided black hole is\nincreased. We compute various observables probing the experience of a\ngravitating observer in this Hilbert space. We find that an observer\nexperiences non-trivial physics in the closed universe in contrast to what it\nwould see in a one-dimensional Hilbert space. In the two-sided black hole\nsetting, our proposal implies that non-perturbative corrections to effective\nfield theory for an infalling observer are suppressed until times exponential\nin the black hole entropy, resolving a recently raised puzzle in black hole\nphysics. While the framework that we develop is exemplified in the toy-model of\nJT gravity, most of our analysis can be extended to higher dimensions and, in\nparticular, to generic spacetimes not admitting a conventional holographic\ndescription, such as cosmological universes or black hole interiors.",

However,\njailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to elicit unintended or\nharmful outputs, threaten LLMs' safety significantly. In this paper, we\nintroduce Layer-AdvPatcher, a novel methodology designed to defend against\njailbreak attacks by utilizing an unlearning strategy to patch specific layers\nwithin LLMs through self-augmented datasets. Our insight is that certain\nlayer(s), tend to produce affirmative tokens when faced with harmful prompts.\nBy identifying these layers and adversarially exposing them to generate more\nharmful data, one can understand their inherent and diverse vulnerabilities to\nattacks. With these exposures, we then \"unlearn\" these issues, reducing the\nimpact of affirmative tokens and hence minimizing jailbreak risks while keeping\nthe model's responses to safe queries intact. We conduct extensive experiments\non two models, four benchmark datasets, and multiple state-of-the-art jailbreak\nattacks to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

The need for\nvast amounts of training data necessitates that such curation be automated,\nminimizing human intervention.\n  We propose an automated source code autocuration technique that leverages the\ncomplete version history of open-source software projects to improve the\nquality of training data. This approach leverages the version history of all\nOSS projects to identify training data samples that have been modified or have\nundergone changes in at least one OSS project, and pinpoint a subset of samples\nthat include fixes for bugs or vulnerabilities.

The most efficient\nproposals -- including HQC and BIKE, the NIST submissions alluded to above --\nin fact rely on the presumed hardness of decoding structured codes. Of\nparticular relevance to our work, HQC is based on quasi-cyclic codes, which are\ncodes generated by matrices consisting of two cyclic blocks.\n  In particular, the security analysis of HQC requires a precise understanding\nof the Decryption Failure Rate (DFR), whose analysis relies on the following\nheuristic: given random ``sparse'' vectors $e_1,e_2$ (say, each coordinate is\ni.i.d. Bernoulli) multiplied by fixed ``sparse'' quasi-cyclic matrices\n$A_1,A_2$, the weight of resulting vector $e_1A_1+e_2A_2$ is very concentrated\naround its expectation.

To ensure that these\nnetworks are also effective for OOD detection, we develop a novel depression\nmechanism.

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of wind fields within the troposphere is essential for\natmospheric dynamics research and plays a crucial role in extreme weather\nforecasting. Coherent Doppler wind lidar (CDWL) is widely regarded as the most\nsuitable technique for high spatial and temporal resolution wind field\ndetection. However, since coherent detection relies heavily on the\nconcentration of aerosol particles, which cause Mie scattering, the received\nbackscattering lidar signal exhibits significantly low intensity at high\naltitudes. As a result, conventional methods, such as spectral centroid\nestimation, often fail to produce credible and accurate wind retrieval results\nin these regions. To address this issue, we propose LWFNet, the first\nLidar-based Wind Field (WF) retrieval neural Network, built upon Transformer\nand the Kolmogorov-Arnold network. Our model is trained solely on targets\nderived from the traditional wind retrieval algorithm and utilizes radiosonde\nmeasurements as the ground truth for test results evaluation. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that LWFNet not only extends the maximum wind field\ndetection range but also produces more accurate results, exhibiting a level of\nprecision that surpasses the labeled targets. This phenomenon, which we refer\nto as super-accuracy, is explored by investigating the potential underlying\nfactors that contribute to this intriguing occurrence. In addition, we compare\nthe performance of LWFNet with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models,\nhighlighting its superior effectiveness and capability in high-resolution wind\nretrieval. LWFNet demonstrates remarkable performance in lidar-based wind field\nretrieval, setting a benchmark for future research and advancing the\ndevelopment of deep learning models in this domain.",

Furthermore, we suggest improvements to\nChameleon2 that ensure that the complexity remains $O(n^2)$ with minimal to no\nloss of performance. The second failing of Chameleon2 is that it lacks\ntransparency and it does not provide the fine-tuned algorithm parameters used\nto obtain the claimed results. We meticulously provide all such parameter\nvalues to enhance replicability.\n  The improvement which we make in Chameleon2 is that we replace the exact\n$k$-NN search with an approximate $k$-NN search. This further reduces the\nalgorithmic complexity down to $O(n\\log{n})$ without any performance loss.\nHere, we primarily configure three approximate nearest neighbor search\nalgorithms (Annoy, FLANN and NMSLIB) to align with the overarching Chameleon2\nclustering framework.

We therefore revisit the\ndependence of the microlensing differential event rate, and hence exclusion\nlimits, on the DM density and velocity distributions. The constraints on the\nabundance of low- and high-mass PBHs depend, respectively, on the long- and\nshort-duration tails of the differential event rate distribution. Long-duration\nevents are due to PBHs moving close to the line of sight and their rate (and\nhence the constraints on low-mass PBHs) has a fairly weak ($\\sim 10\\%$)\ndependence on the DM density and velocity distributions. Short-duration events\nare due to PBHs close to the observer and their rate (and hence the constraints\non moderate- and high-mass PBHs) depends much more strongly on the DM velocity\ndistribution. An accurate calculation of the local DM velocity distribution is\ntherefore crucial for accurately calculating PBH stellar microlensing\nconstraints.",

Under Gaussian design and covariance matrix with spectrum bounded away\nfrom 0 and $+\\infty$, it is shown that the L2 risk is stochastically bounded if\nand only if the number of selected variables is bounded away from \\( n \\), in\nthe sense that $$\n  (1-\\|\\hat b\\|_0/n)^{-1} = O_P(1)\n  \\Longleftrightarrow\n  \\|\\hat b- b^*\\|_2 = O_P(1) $$ as \\( n,p\\to+\\infty \\). The right-to-left\nimplication rules out constant risk for dense Lasso estimates (estimates with\nclose to $n$ active variables), which can be used to discard tuning parameters\nleading to dense estimates.\n  We then bring back sparsity in the picture, and revisit the precise phase\ntransition characterizing the sparsity patterns of the true regression vector\nleading to unbounded Lasso risk -- or by the above equivalence to dense Lasso\nestimates. This precise phase transition was established by\n\\citet{miolane2018distribution,celentano2020lasso} using fixed-point equations\nin an equivalent sequence model. An alternative proof of this phase transition\nis provided here using simple arguments without relying on the fixed-point\nequations or the equivalent sequence model. A modification of the well-known\nRestricted Eigenvalue argument allows to extend the analysis to any small\ntuning parameter of constant order, leading to a bounded risk on one side of\nthe phase transition.

The essence\nof MH-Net lies in aggregating varying numbers of traffic bits into multiple\ntypes of traffic units, thereby constructing multi-view traffic graphs with\ndiverse information granularities. By accounting for different types of byte\ncorrelations, such as header-payload relationships, MH-Net further endows the\ntraffic graph with heterogeneity, significantly enhancing model performance.\nNotably, we employ contrastive learning in a multi-task manner to strengthen\nthe robustness of the learned traffic unit representations. Experiments\nconducted on the ISCX and CIC-IoT datasets for both the packet-level and\nflow-level traffic classification tasks demonstrate that MH-Net achieves the\nbest overall performance compared to dozens of SOTA methods.",

While RIS have been extensively\nstudied, Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), which extend the RIS concept\nto multi-layered systems, present significant modeling and optimization\nchallenges. This work addresses these challenges by introducing an optimization\nframework for SIM that, unlike previous approaches, is based on a comprehensive\nmodel without relying on specific assumptions, allowing for broader\napplicability of the results. We first present a model based on multi-port\nnetwork theory for characterizing a general electromagnetic collaborative\nobject (ECO) and derive a framework for ECO optimization. We then introduce the\nSIM as an ECO with a specific architecture, offering insights into SIM\noptimization for various configurations and discussing the complexities\nassociated with each case. Finally, we demonstrate that the comprehensive model\nconsidered in this work simplifies to the model traditionally used in the\nliterature when the assumption of unilateral propagation between the levels of\nthe SIM is made, and mutual coupling between the SIM elements is neglected. To\nassess the applicability of these assumptions, a case study focused on the\nrealization of a 2D DFT was undertaken. In this context, we highlight that\nthese assumptions introduce a significant mismatch between the SIM model and\nits behavior as described by the complete model, making these approximations\ninadequate for optimizing the SIM. Conversely, we show that employing the\ncomplete model proposed in this paper can yield excellent performance.",

In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model\nto improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from\nconventional fixed antennas, the proposed RA system can flexibly and\nindependently alter the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each\nantenna to achieve a desired array directional gain pattern. Specifically, we\ninvestigate an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive\nbeamforming and the boresight directions of all RAs at the base station (BS)\nare jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space\npropagation setup, the optimal boresight directions of RAs are derived in\nclosed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the\nBS. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance with an infinite number of\nantennas based on this solution, which theoretically proves that the RA system\ncan achieve a higher array gain than the fixed-antenna system. In the general\nmulti-user and multipath channel setup, we first propose an alternating\noptimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and\nthe boresight directions of RAs in an iterative manner. Then, a two-stage\nalgorithm that solves the formulated problem without the need for iteration is\nproposed to further reduce computational complexity. Simulation results are\nprovided to validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the proposed\nRA system can significantly improve the communication performance as compared\nto other benchmark schemes.",

    "abstract": "Skeleton-based action recognition has gained significant attention for its\nability to efficiently represent spatiotemporal information in a lightweight\nformat. Most existing approaches use graph-based models to process skeleton\nsequences, where each pose is represented as a skeletal graph structured around\nhuman physical connectivity. Among these, the Spatiotemporal Graph\nConvolutional Network (ST-GCN) has become a widely used framework.\nAlternatively, hypergraph-based models, such as the Hyperformer, capture\nhigher-order correlations, offering a more expressive representation of complex\njoint interactions. A recent advancement, termed Taylor Videos, introduces\nmotion-enhanced skeleton sequences by embedding motion concepts, providing a\nfresh perspective on interpreting human actions in skeleton-based action\nrecognition. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both\ntraditional skeleton sequences and Taylor-transformed skeletons using ST-GCN\nand Hyperformer models on the NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets. We compare skeletal\ngraph and hypergraph representations, analyzing static poses against\nmotion-injected poses. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of\nTaylor-transformed skeletons, demonstrating their potential to enhance motion\ndynamics while exposing current challenges in fully using their benefits. This\nstudy underscores the need for innovative skeletal modelling techniques to\neffectively handle motion-rich data and advance the field of action\nrecognition.",

By considering a\nvariable deceleration parameter, we address the expansion history of the\nuniverse, providing a viable description of the transition from deceleration to\nacceleration. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, the parameters of the\nmodel are constrained and we examine the cosmological parameters. A comparison\nis then made with the $\\Lambda$CDM model using the latest observations. We\nexamine the history of the main cosmological parameters, such as the\ndeceleration parameter, jerk parameter, snap parameter, density parameter, and\nequation-of-state parameter, by constraining and interpreting them to reveal\ninsights into what has been dubbed \"dynamical dark energy\" under the\nassumptions made above.

However, its performance can be negatively\naffected in unstructured environments that lack features and geometric\nstructures, leading to low accuracy and poor robustness in localization and\nmapping. It is known that degeneracy caused by the lack of geometric\nconstraints can lead to errors in 6-DOF pose estimation along ill-conditioned\ndirections. Therefore, there is a need for a broader and more fine-grained\ndegeneracy detection and handling method. This paper proposes a new point cloud\nregistration framework, LP-ICP, that combines point-to-line and point-to-plane\ndistance metrics in the ICP algorithm, with localizability detection and\nhandling. Rather than relying solely on point-to-plane localizability\ninformation, LP-ICP enhances the localizability analysis by incorporating a\npoint-to-line metric, thereby exploiting richer geometric constraints. It\nconsists of a localizability detection module and an optimization module. The\nlocalizability detection module performs localizability analysis by utilizing\nthe correspondences between edge points (with low local smoothness) to lines\nand planar points (with high local smoothness) to planes between the scan and\nthe map. The localizability contribution of individual correspondence\nconstraints can be applied to a broader range. The optimization module adds\nadditional soft and hard constraints to the optimization equations based on the\nlocalizability category. This allows the pose to be constrained along\nill-conditioned directions. The proposed method is evaluated on simulation and\nreal-world datasets, showing comparable or better accuracy than the\nstate-of-the art methods in tested scenarios.

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation within the diffusion-denoising paradigm\ndemonstrates impressive generalization ability but suffers from low inference\nspeed. Recent methods adopt a single-step deterministic paradigm to improve\ninference efficiency while maintaining comparable performance. However, they\noverlook the gap between generative and discriminative features, leading to\nsuboptimal results. In this work, we propose DepthMaster, a single-step\ndiffusion model designed to adapt generative features for the discriminative\ndepth estimation task. First, to mitigate overfitting to texture details\nintroduced by generative features, we propose a Feature Alignment module, which\nincorporates high-quality semantic features to enhance the denoising network's\nrepresentation capability. Second, to address the lack of fine-grained details\nin the single-step deterministic framework, we propose a Fourier Enhancement\nmodule to adaptively balance low-frequency structure and high-frequency\ndetails. We adopt a two-stage training strategy to fully leverage the potential\nof the two modules. In the first stage, we focus on learning the global scene\nstructure with the Feature Alignment module, while in the second stage, we\nexploit the Fourier Enhancement module to improve the visual quality. Through\nthese efforts, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of\ngeneralization and detail preservation, outperforming other diffusion-based\nmethods across various datasets.

We find that the singular distribution of the Berry\ncurvature induces an intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity that is significantly\nenhanced compared to an isotropic system.

Existing methods\noften rely on bi-level optimization, requiring extensive GNN training and\nlimiting their scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph\nCondensation via Gaussian Process (GCGP), a novel and computationally efficient\napproach to graph condensation. GCGP utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP), with the\ncondensed graph serving as observations, to estimate the posterior distribution\nof predictions. This approach eliminates the need for the iterative and\nresource-intensive training typically required by GNNs. To enhance the\ncapability of the GCGP in capturing dependencies between function values, we\nderive a specialized covariance function that incorporates structural\ninformation. This covariance function broadens the receptive field of input\nnodes by local neighborhood aggregation, thereby facilitating the\nrepresentation of intricate dependencies within the nodes.

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging analysis.\nTraditional CNN-based methods struggle with modeling long-range dependencies,\nwhile Transformer-based models, despite their success, suffer from quadratic\ncomputational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose KM-UNet, a\nnovel U-shaped network architecture that combines the strengths of\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and state-space models (SSMs). KM-UNet\nleverages the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for efficient feature\nrepresentation and SSMs for scalable long-range modeling, achieving a balance\nbetween accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate KM-UNet on five\nbenchmark datasets: ISIC17, ISIC18, CVC, BUSI, and GLAS. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that KM-UNet achieves competitive performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods in medical image segmentation tasks. To the best of\nour knowledge, KM-UNet is the first medical image segmentation framework\nintegrating KANs and SSMs. This work provides a valuable baseline and new\ninsights for the development of more efficient and interpretable medical image\nsegmentation systems.

The regulations\ncorrespond to two key constraints: the total transmit power of all transmitters\nwithin a spatial region and the cumulative received power at a receiver, which\nwe refer to as ball regulation and shot-noise regulation, respectively. Then we\nprove the equivalence of ball regulation and shot-noise regulation for\nstationary marked point processes and establish a universal lower bound on the\nperformance of all network links under these constraints. This framework is\napplicable to diverse network scenarios, as demonstrated by the analysis of\nperformance guarantees for networks with multi-class users.

Contrary to\nearlier studies suggesting that the AR decreases when the number of metasurface\nlayers increases past a certain point for \\emph{a fixed SIM thickness}, our\nfindings demonstrate consistent increase. To achieve this, we introduce two\nproblem formulations: one based on directly maximizing the AR (RMax) and the\nother focused on minimizing inter-stream interference (IMin). To solve the RMax\nproblem, we apply Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) and weighted minimum\nmean square error (WMMSE) methods to optimize the SIM phase shifts and power\nallocation alternately. For the IMin problem, we derive an efficient algorithm\nthat iteratively updates each meta-atom's phase shift using a closed-form\nexpression while keeping others fixed. Our key contribution is integrating\nthese two approaches, where the IMin solution initializes the SIM phase shifts\nin the first algorithm. This hybrid strategy enhances AR performance across\nvarying numbers of metasurface layers. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithms outperform existing benchmarks.

Recent studies\nsuggest a polyynic ground state and a cumulenic transient state; however, the\ndynamics remain unclear and lack experimental validation. This study presents a\nfirst-principles theoretical investigation of the bond lengths ($R_1$ and\n$R_2$) dependent two-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) of C$_{18}$,\nconcentrating on the ground state and carbon 1s ionized and excited states. We\nexamine the potential of X-ray spectra for determining bond lengths and\nmonitoring transient structures, finding that both X-ray photoelectron (XPS)\nand absorption (XAS) spectra are sensitive to these variations. Utilizing a\nlibrary of ground-state minimum structures optimized with 14 different\nfunctionals, we observe that core binding energies predicted with the\n$\\omega$B97XD functional can vary by 0.9 eV (290.3--291.2 eV). Unlike the\nground state PES, which predicts minima at alternating bond lengths, the C1s\nionized state PES predicts minima with equivalent bond lengths. In the XAS\nspectra, peaks 1$\\pi^*$ and 2$\\pi^*$ show a redshift with increasing bond\nlengths along the line where $R_1 = R_2$. Additionally, increasing $R_2$ (with\n$R_1$ fixed) results in an initial redshift followed by a blueshift, minimizing\nat $R_1 = R_2$. Major peaks indicate that both 1$\\pi^*$ and 2$\\pi^*$ arise from\ntwo channels: C1s$\\rightarrow\\pi^*_{z}$ (out-of-plane) and\nC1s$\\rightarrow\\pi^*_{xy}$ (in-plane) transitions at coinciding energies.",

    "abstract": "Micro-expression recognition (MER) presents a significant challenge due to\nthe transient and subtle nature of the motion changes involved. In recent\nyears, deep learning methods based on attention mechanisms have made some\nbreakthroughs in MER. However, these methods still suffer from the limitations\nof insufficient feature capture and poor dynamic adaptation when coping with\nthe instantaneous subtle movement changes of micro-expressions. Therefore, in\nthis paper, we design an Adaptive Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention Network\n(AHMSA-Net) for MER. Specifically, we first utilize the onset and apex frames\nof the micro-expression sequence to extract three-dimensional (3D) optical flow\nmaps, including horizontal optical flow, vertical optical flow, and optical\nflow strain. Subsequently, the optical flow feature maps are inputted into\nAHMSA-Net, which consists of two parts: an adaptive hierarchical framework and\na multi-scale attention mechanism. Based on the adaptive downsampling\nhierarchical attention framework, AHMSA-Net captures the subtle changes of\nmicro-expressions from different granularities (fine and coarse) by dynamically\nadjusting the size of the optical flow feature map at each layer. Based on the\nmulti-scale attention mechanism, AHMSA-Net learns micro-expression action\ninformation by fusing features from different scales (channel and spatial).\nThese two modules work together to comprehensively improve the accuracy of MER.\nAdditionally, rigorous experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves competitive results on major micro-expression databases, with\nAHMSA-Net achieving recognition accuracy of up to 78.21% on composite databases\n(SMIC, SAMM, CASMEII) and 77.08% on the CASME^{}3 database.",

A detailed investigation of\nsuch signatures would help constrain physical processes during inflation. With\nthis motivation, the goal of this paper is two-fold. First, we conduct a\ndetailed analysis of the effects of bump-like primordial features on the\nsky-averaged 21 cm signal. Using semi-numerical simulations, we demonstrate\nthat the primordial features can significantly alter the ionization history and\nthe global 21 cm profile, making them a promising probe of inflationary models.\nWe found a special scale (namely, the turnover wavenumber, $k^{\\rm turn}$) at\nwhich the effect of primordial bump-like features on the global 21 cm profile\nvanishes. Also, we found that the behaviour of the primordial features on the\nglobal profile and ionization history are quite opposite for $k > k^{\\rm turn}$\nand $k < k^{\\rm turn}$. We trace the root cause of these behaviours to the\neffects of primordial features on the halo mass function at high redshifts.\nFurthermore, we discuss the degeneracy between the astrophysical parameters and\nthe primordial features in detail. Secondly, for a fixed set of astrophysical\nparameters, we derive upper limits on the amplitude of bump-like features in\nthe range $10^{-1} < k\\,[{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}] < 10^2$ using current limits on\noptical depth to reionization from CMB data by Planck.",

This\nbenchmark is designed to guide policymakers and AI agencies, including within\nframeworks such as the EU AI Act, by providing robust, actionable insights into\nAI alignment with human values, public sentiment, and ethical norms at both\nnational and international levels. Future research should further refine the\noperationalization of the SAAS-AI benchmark and systematically evaluate its\neffectiveness through comprehensive empirical testing.",

    "abstract": "Current autonomous driving systems often struggle to balance decision-making\nand motion control while ensuring safety and traffic rule compliance,\nespecially in complex urban environments. Existing methods may fall short due\nto separate handling of these functionalities, leading to inefficiencies and\nsafety compromises. To address these challenges, we introduce UDMC, an\ninterpretable and unified Level 4 autonomous driving framework. UDMC integrates\ndecision-making and motion control into a single optimal control problem (OCP),\nconsidering the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles, pedestrians,\nroad lanes, and traffic signals. By employing innovative potential functions to\nmodel traffic participants and regulations, and incorporating a specialized\nmotion prediction module, our framework enhances on-road safety and rule\nadherence. The integrated design allows for real-time execution of flexible\nmaneuvers suited to diverse driving scenarios. High-fidelity simulations\nconducted in CARLA exemplify the framework's computational efficiency,\nrobustness, and safety, resulting in superior driving performance when compared\nagainst various baseline models.

Next the\nintersection of prime multiple missing graphs for primes 3 and 5 are studied.\nWe prove that these graphs are connected with diameter at most 4 and they are\nalso Hamiltonian for even (>2) vertices.

In affective computing, speech\nsignals serve as effective biomarkers for mental disorder assessment. Current\nresearch, relying on labor-intensive hand-crafted features or simplistic\ntime-frequency representations, often overlooks critical details by not\naccounting for the differential impacts of various frequency bands and temporal\nfluctuations. Therefore, we propose a frequency-aware augmentation network with\ndynamic convolution for depression and ADHD assessment. In the proposed method,\nthe spectrogram is used as the input feature and adopts a multi-scale\nconvolution to help the network focus on discriminative frequency bands related\nto mental disorders. A dynamic convolution is also designed to aggregate\nmultiple convolution kernels dynamically based upon their attentions which are\ninput-independent to capture dynamic information. Finally, a feature\naugmentation block is proposed to enhance the feature representation ability\nand make full use of the captured information. Experimental results on AVEC\n2014 and self-recorded ADHD dataset prove the robustness of our method, an RMSE\nof 9.23 was attained for estimating depression severity, along with an accuracy\nof 89.8\\% in detecting ADHD.",

Our first principles\nanalysis reveals that partially occupied d-orbital states within octahedra\nexhibit a preference for spatial orbital order within a two-dimensional\nlattice. The absence of inversion symmetry, arising from orbital order, serves\nas the driving force introducing additional electric polarization along the\nout-of-plane direction.

The resultant asymmetric\nJahn-Teller distortions are accompanied as the consequence producing additional\nionic polarization.

    "abstract": "For many practical applications, a high computational cost of inference over\ndeep network architectures might be unacceptable. A small degradation in the\noverall inference accuracy might be a reasonable price to pay for a significant\nreduction in the required computational resources. In this work, we describe a\nmethod for introducing \"shortcuts\" into the DNN feedforward inference process\nby skipping costly feedforward computations whenever possible. The proposed\nmethod is based on the previously described BranchyNet (Teerapittayanon et al.,\n2016) and the EEnet (Demir, 2019) architectures that jointly train the main\nnetwork and early exit branches. We extend those methods by attaching branches\nto pre-trained models and, thus, eliminating the need to alter the original\nweights of the network. We also suggest a new branch architecture based on\nconvolutional building blocks to allow enough training capacity when applied on\nlarge DNNs. The proposed architecture includes confidence heads that are used\nfor predicting the confidence level in the corresponding early exits. By\ndefining adjusted thresholds on these confidence extensions, we can control in\nreal-time the amount of data exiting from each branch and the overall tradeoff\nbetween speed and accuracy of our model. In our experiments, we evaluate our\nmethod using image datasets (SVHN and CIFAR10) and several DNN architectures\n(ResNet, DenseNet, VGG) with varied depth. Our results demonstrate that the\nproposed method enables us to reduce the average inference computational cost\nand further controlling the tradeoff between the model accuracy and the\ncomputation cost.",

Its nova remnant is\nelliptical in shape, with multiple knots, and a peculiar ring-like filament\nalong its minor axis. This work aims at unveiling its true 3D\nspatio-kinematical structure to investigate the effects of early shaping and to\nassess its mass and kinetic energy using VLT VIMOS integral field spectroscopic\nobservations. The data cube has been analyzed using 3D visualisations that\nreveal different structural components. FH Ser consists of a tilted prolate\nellisoidal shell, most prominent in H-alpha, and a ring-like structure, most\nprominent in [N II]. The ellipsoidal shell has equatorial and polar velocities\nof 505 and 630 km/s, respectively, with its major axis tilted by 52 deg with\nrespect to the line of sight. The inclination angle of the symmetry axis of the\nring is similar, i.e., it can be described as an equatorial belt of the main\nellipsoidal shell. The ionized mass is 2.6E-4 solar mass, with a kinetic energy\nof 1.6E45 erg. The presence of two different structural components in FH Ser\nwith similar orientation can be linked to a density enhancement along a plane,\nmost likely the orbital plane at the time of the nova event. The acquisition of\nintegral field spectroscopic observations of nova remnants is most required to\ndisentangle different structural components and to assess their 3D physical\nstructure.",

In the second stage, we finetune the above model to support the\ngeneral instructions using all tasks defined in ACE. To promote the widespread\napplication of ACE++ in different scenarios, we provide a comprehensive set of\nmodels that cover both full finetuning and lightweight finetuning, while\nconsidering general applicability and applicability in vertical scenarios. The\nqualitative analysis showcases the superiority of ACE++ in terms of generating\nimage quality and prompt following ability.

It minimizes fill-in during Cholesky\nfactorization using permutation techniques and employs a static scheduler to\nmanage tasks on shared-memory systems with GPU accelerators. sTiles balances\ntile size and parallelism, where larger tiles enhance algorithmic intensity but\nincrease floating-point operations and memory usage, while parallelism is\nconstrained by the arrowhead structure.

On the one hand, according to the nomological view, the wave\nfunction of the universe or the universal wave function is nomological, like a\nlaw of nature. On the other hand, the PBR theorem proves that the wave function\nin quantum mechanics or the effective wave function in Bohmian mechanics is\nontic, representing the ontic state of a physical system in the universe. It is\nusually thought that the nomological view of the universal wave function is\ncompatible with the ontic view of the effective wave function, and thus the PBR\ntheorem has no implications for the nomological view. In this paper, I argue\nthat this is not the case, and these two views are in fact incompatible. This\nmeans that if the effective wave function is ontic as the PBR theorem proves,\nthen the universal wave function cannot be nomological, and the ontology of\nBohmian mechanics cannot consist only in particles. This incompatibility result\nholds true not only for Humeanism and dispositionalism but also for primitivism\nabout laws of nature, which attributes a fundamental ontic role to the\nuniversal wave function. Moreover, I argue that although the nomological view\ncan be held by rejecting one key assumption of the PBR theorem, the rejection\nwill lead to serious problems, such as that the results of measurements and\ntheir probabilities cannot be explained in ontology in Bohmian mechanics.\nFinally, I briefly discuss three psi-ontologies, namely a physical field in a\nfundamental high-dimensional space, a multi-field in three-dimensional space,\nand RDMP (Random Discontinuous Motion of Particles) in three-dimensional space,\nand argue that the RDMP ontology can answer the objections to the psi-ontology\nraised by the proponents of the nomological view.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel Deep Positive-Negative Prototype (DPNP) model\nthat combines prototype-based learning (PbL) with discriminative methods to\nimprove class compactness and separability in deep neural networks. While PbL\ntraditionally emphasizes interpretability by classifying samples based on their\nsimilarity to representative prototypes, it struggles with creating optimal\ndecision boundaries in complex scenarios. Conversely, discriminative methods\neffectively separate classes but often lack intuitive interpretability. Toward\nexploiting advantages of these two approaches, the suggested DPNP model bridges\nbetween them by unifying class prototypes with weight vectors, thereby\nestablishing a structured latent space that enables accurate classification\nusing interpretable prototypes alongside a properly learned feature\nrepresentation. Based on this central idea of unified prototype-weight\nrepresentation, Deep Positive Prototype (DPP) is formed in the latent space as\na representative for each class using off-the-shelf deep networks as feature\nextractors. Then, rival neighboring class DPPs are treated as implicit negative\nprototypes with repulsive force in DPNP, which push away DPPs from each other.\nThis helps to enhance inter-class separation without the need for any extra\nparameters. Hence, through a novel loss function that integrates cross-entropy,\nprototype alignment, and separation terms, DPNP achieves well-organized feature\nspace geometry, maximizing intra-class compactness and inter-class margins. We\nshow that DPNP can organize prototypes in nearly regular positions within\nfeature space, such that it is possible to achieve competitive classification\naccuracy even in much lower-dimensional feature spaces. Experimental results on\nseveral datasets demonstrate that DPNP outperforms state-of-the-art models,\nwhile using smaller networks.",

This problem is particularly practical because it\nreduces the expensive annotation costs by utilizing freely accessible web\nimages with noisy labels. Typically, prototypes are representative images or\nfeatures used to classify or identify other images. However, in the few clean\nand many noisy scenarios, the class prototype can be severely biased due to the\npresence of irrelevant noisy images. The resulting prototypes are less compact\nand discriminative, as previous methods do not take into account the diverse\nrange of images in the noisy web image collections. On the other hand, the\nrelation modeling between noisy and clean images is not learned for the class\nprototype generation in an end-to-end manner, which results in a suboptimal\nclass prototype. In this article, we introduce a similarity maximization loss\nnamed SimNoiPro. Our SimNoiPro first generates noise-tolerant hybrid prototypes\ncomposed of clean and noise-tolerant prototypes and then pulls them closer to\neach other. Our approach considers the diversity of noisy images by explicit\ndivision and overcomes the optimization discrepancy issue. This enables better\nrelation modeling between clean and noisy images and helps extract judicious\ninformation from the noisy image set. The evaluation results on two extended\nfew-shot classification benchmarks confirm that our SimNoiPro outperforms prior\nmethods in measuring image relations and cleaning noisy data.",

These challenges necessitate more\nadvanced approaches for effective object detection in such environments. While\ndeep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in remote sensing object\ndetection, they typically rely on large amounts of labeled data. Acquiring\nsufficient labeled data, particularly for novel or rare objects, is both\nchallenging and time-consuming in remote sensing scenarios, limiting the\ngeneralization capabilities of existing models. To address these challenges,\nfew-shot learning (FSL) has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable\nmodels to learn new classes from limited labeled examples. Building on this\nconcept, few-shot object detection (FSOD) specifically targets object detection\nchallenges in data-limited conditions. However, the generalization capability\nof FSOD models, particularly in remote sensing, is often constrained by the\ncomplex and diverse characteristics of the objects present in such\nenvironments. In this paper, we propose the Generalization-Enhanced Few-Shot\nObject Detection (GE-FSOD) model to improve the generalization capability in\nremote sensing FSOD tasks. Our model introduces three key innovations: the\nCross-Level Fusion Pyramid Attention Network (CFPAN) for enhanced multi-scale\nfeature representation, the Multi-Stage Refinement Region Proposal Network\n(MRRPN) for more accurate region proposals, and the Generalized Classification\nLoss (GCL) for improved classification performance in few-shot scenarios.\nExtensive experiments on the DIOR and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that our model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance for few-shot object detection in remote\nsensing.",

This interaction originates from the\ncoupling between the instantaneous mass quadrupole moment and the mass-current\nquadrupole moment of the objects, induced by fluctuating gravitoelectric and\ngravitomagnetic fields in a vacuum. Using leading-order perturbation theory, we\nderive the explicit expression of the quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic\ninteraction energy, which shows a distance dependence of $r^{-8}$ in the near\nregime and $r^{-11}$ in the far regime, where $r$ is the distance between the\ntwo objects. Remarkably, this interaction energy is positive, indicating that\nthe force is repulsive. Since interactions between objects polarizable in the\nsame gravitoelectric or gravitomagnetic manner are inherently attractive, for\nobjects which are both gravitoelectrically and gravitomagnetically polarizable,\nthe overall quantum gravitational interaction potential is reduced when the\nrepulsive quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction is taken into\naccount.

    "abstract": "Previous visual object tracking methods employ image-feature regression\nmodels or coordinate autoregression models for bounding box prediction.\nImage-feature regression methods heavily depend on matching results and do not\nutilize positional prior, while the autoregressive approach can only be trained\nusing bounding boxes available in the training set, potentially resulting in\nsuboptimal performance during testing with unseen data. Inspired by the\ndiffusion model, denoising learning enhances the model's robustness to unseen\ndata. Therefore, We introduce noise to bounding boxes, generating noisy boxes\nfor training, thus enhancing model robustness on testing data. We propose a new\nparadigm to formulate the visual object tracking problem as a denoising\nlearning process. However, tracking algorithms are usually asked to run in\nreal-time, directly applying the diffusion model to object tracking would\nseverely impair tracking speed. Therefore, we decompose the denoising learning\nprocess into every denoising block within a model, not by running the model\nmultiple times, and thus we summarize the proposed paradigm as an in-model\nlatent denoising learning process. Specifically, we propose a denoising Vision\nTransformer (ViT), which is composed of multiple denoising blocks. In the\ndenoising block, template and search embeddings are projected into every\ndenoising block as conditions. A denoising block is responsible for removing\nthe noise in a predicted bounding box, and multiple stacked denoising blocks\ncooperate to accomplish the whole denoising process. Subsequently, we utilize\nimage features and trajectory information to refine the denoised bounding box.\nBesides, we also utilize trajectory memory and visual memory to improve\ntracking stability. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our\napproach, achieving competitive performance on several challenging datasets.",

Federated learning\noffers a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across\ndistributed data sources without requiring data centralization. However,\ncurrent Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which typically contain billions of\nparameters, pose significant communication challenges for traditional federated\nlearning approaches based on model parameter updates, as they would incur\nsubstantial communication costs. In this paper, we propose FedRSCLIP, the first\nfederated learning framework designed for remote sensing image classification\nbased on a VLM, specifically CLIP. FedRSCLIP addresses the challenges of data\nheterogeneity and large-scale model transmission in federated environments by\nintroducing Prompt Learning, which optimizes only a small set of tunable\nparameters. The framework introduces a dual-prompt mechanism, comprising Shared\nPrompts for global knowledge sharing and Private Prompts for client-specific\nadaptation. To maintain semantic coherence between shared and private prompts,\nwe propose the Dual Prompt Alignment Constraint to balance global consistency\nand local adaptability across diverse client distributions. Additionally, to\nenhance cross-modal representation learning, we introduce the Cross-Modal\nFeature Alignment Constraint to align multimodal features between text and\nimage prompts. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we\nconstruct a Fed-RSIC dataset based on three existing remote sensing image\nclassification datasets, specifically designed to simulate various federated\nlearning configurations.

We analyze\nthe possibility of constraining the non-linear corrections present in\ndistribution functions using the inclusive observables that will be measured in\nfuture electron-ion colliders (EIC and EICc). The results show that non-linear\ncorrections play an important role in heavy nuclear reduced cross sections at\nlow $x$ and low $Q^2$ values. We find that the non-linear corrections provide\nthe correct behavior of the extracted nuclear cross sections and that our\nresults align with data from the nCETQ15 parametrization group.

    "abstract": "Ray tracing is widely employed to model the propagation of radio-frequency\n(RF) signal in complex environment. The modelling performance greatly depends\non how accurately the target scene can be depicted, including the scene\ngeometry and surface material properties. The advances in computer vision and\nLiDAR make scene geometry estimation increasingly accurate, but there still\nlacks scalable and efficient approaches to estimate the material reflectivity\nin real-world environment. In this work, we tackle this problem by learning the\nmaterial reflectivity efficiently from the path loss of the RF signal from the\ntransmitters to receivers. Specifically, we want the learned material\nreflection coefficients to minimize the gap between the predicted and measured\npowers of the receivers. We achieve this by translating the neural reflectance\nfield from optics to RF domain by modelling both the amplitude and phase of RF\nsignals to account for the multipath effects. We further propose a\ndifferentiable RF ray tracing framework that optimizes the neural reflectance\nfield to match the signal strength measurements. We simulate a complex\nreal-world environment for experiments and our simulation results show that the\nneural reflectance field can successfully learn the reflection coefficients for\nall incident angles. As a result, our approach achieves better accuracy in\npredicting the powers of receivers with significantly less training data\ncompared to existing approaches.",

By deriving the Klein-Gordon equation for this setup, we explore two\nscenarios: (i) a mass-modified scalar field with \\(m(\\rho) = m_0 - a/\\rho\\) (an\nexactly solvable case), and (ii) a scenario involving both mass modification\nand an external magnetic field (conditionally exactly solvable). We identify\nquantum critical points (QCPs) associated with the coupling constant \\(a\\). In\nthe first scenario, for massless charged scalar fields, critical points occur\nat \\(a = n + 1/2\\) for all radial quantum numbers \\(n \\geq 0\\) and magnetic\nquantum numbers \\(|m| \\geq 0\\). In the second scenario, these critical points\nshift to \\(a = n + 3/2\\) for \\(n \\geq 0\\) and \\(|m| > 0\\), with the case \\(m =\n0\\) excluded. For massive scalar fields, QCPs emerge at \\(a = (n + 1/2)/2\\),\nleading to non-propagating fields at zero frequency. At these QCPs, the field\nfrequencies drop to zero, marking transitions from stable oscillatory modes to\nnon-propagating states. Below the critical points, the system exhibits\ninstability, characterized by negative imaginary frequencies that suggest rapid\ndecay and high dissipation. Above the critical points, the modes stabilize and\npropagate, indicating a transition to a superconducting-like phase, where\ndissipation vanishes and stable excitations dominate.",

To address this issue, we introduce FOLDER, a simple\nyet effective plug-and-play module designed to reduce the length of the visual\ntoken sequence, mitigating both computational and memory demands during\ntraining and inference. Through a comprehensive analysis of the token reduction\nprocess, we analyze the information loss introduced by different reduction\nstrategies and develop FOLDER to preserve key information while removing visual\nredundancy. We showcase the effectiveness of FOLDER by integrating it into the\nvisual backbone of several MLLMs, significantly accelerating the inference\nphase. Furthermore, we evaluate its utility as a training accelerator or even\nperformance booster for MLLMs. In both contexts, FOLDER achieves comparable or\neven better performance than the original models, while dramatically reducing\ncomplexity by removing up to 70% of visual tokens.",

To address this gap, we propose a novel defense method\ncalled Backdoor Token Unlearning (BTU), which proactively detects and\nneutralizes trigger tokens during the training stage. Our work is based on two\nkey findings: 1) backdoor learning causes distinctive differences between\nbackdoor token parameters and clean token parameters in word embedding layers,\nand 2) the success of backdoor attacks heavily depends on backdoor token\nparameters. The BTU defense leverages these properties to identify aberrant\nembedding parameters and subsequently removes backdoor behaviors using a\nfine-grained unlearning technique. Extensive evaluations across three datasets\nand four types of backdoor attacks demonstrate that BTU effectively defends\nagainst these threats while preserving the model's performance on primary\ntasks.

However, NeRV-based\nmethods are time-consuming when adapting to a large number of diverse videos,\nas each video requires a separate NeRV model to be trained from scratch. In\naddition, NeRV-based methods spatially require generating a high-dimension\nsignal (i.e., an entire image) from the input of a low-dimension timestamp, and\na video typically consists of tens of frames temporally that have a minor\nchange between adjacent frames. To improve the efficiency of video\nrepresentation, we propose Meta Neural Representations for Videos, named\nMetaNeRV, a novel framework for fast NeRV representation for unseen videos.\nMetaNeRV leverages a meta-learning framework to learn an optimal parameter\ninitialization, which serves as a good starting point for adapting to new\nvideos. To address the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of video\nmodality, we further introduce spatial-temporal guidance to improve the\nrepresentation capabilities of MetaNeRV. Specifically, the spatial guidance\nwith a multi-resolution loss aims to capture the information from different\nresolution stages, and the temporal guidance with an effective progressive\nlearning strategy could gradually refine the number of fitted frames during the\nmeta-learning process.

Once the existence\nand regularity theories for the linear case are established, with suitable\nbilinear estimates, the nonlinear existence theory is accomplished.",

    "abstract": "Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, employees from around the world were compelled\nto work remotely from home and, in many cases, without much preparation. A\nsubstantial body of international research has been conducted on the\nexperiences and attitudes of remote workers as well as the implications of this\nphenomenon for organisations. While New Zealand research evidence is growing,\nmost existing inquiry is qualitative. This paper provides a quantitative\nsnapshot of remote working using survey data from participants whose jobs can\nbe done from home (n=415). Data collection took place when the country was\nfacing Covid-related measures.\n  Based on descriptive and inferential statistics, it was found that, not only\nwas remote working common, but that hybrid working arrangements were also more\nprevalent. While half of the participants wanted to work from home more\nfrequently, age, but not gender, was significantly associated with this\npreference. Another relevant finding is that perceived change in the workplace\nculture due to flexible work arrangements was significantly associated with\npreference for working remotely more often. Finally, the most common perceived\nbarriers to working from home were slow internet speed, the need to attend\nface-to-face meetings, and limited space at home to work. The implications of\nthe results are discussed and some directions for future research are proposed.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we perform numerical simulations of forced two-phase isotropic\nturbulence to study the stationary states of a two-phase mixture. We first\nformulate three different approaches to force a two-phase turbulent flow that\nmaintains a constant (a) mixture kinetic energy, (b) mixture kinetic energy +\nsurface energy, and (c) individual phase kinetic energy, and study their effect\non the final stationary state of the system. We show that forcing the two-phase\nsystem eliminates the arbitrariness associated with the initialization of the\nsecond phase in two-phase turbulence simulations. Next, we study the global\nstatistics of the two-phase mixture in the stationary state for varying density\nratios ($10^{-3}$ to $10^3$) and viscosity ratios ($10^{-3}$ to $10^3$), void\nfraction (dilute to dense regimes), and Weber numbers (breakup and non-breakup\nregimes). We utilize a spatial filtering approach, that is applicable for the\ngeneral case of incompressible/compressible two-phase flows, to compute the\nenergy spectra of each of the phases and study the turbulent kinetic energy\ndistribution across scales. We find that the interface behaves as a soft wall,\ninhibiting the accommodation of eddies inside the dispersed phase. Finally, we\nshow that bubbles and drops exhibit different turbulent characteristics for the\nsame global conditions of the carrier phase, with bubbles exhibiting higher\nturbulent intensities inside them and droplets behaving ballistically, similar\nto solid particles. This study acts as a foundational work on stationary\ntwo-phase turbulence, which can be used for further analysis and the\ndevelopment of subgrid-scale models for larger-scale simulations of two-phase\nturbulent flows.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces multidimensional algorithms for simulating multiphase\nflows, leveraging the wave structure of the Euler equations in characteristic\nspace and the physical properties of variables in physical space. The algorithm\napplies different reconstruction schemes to acoustic, vorticity, and entropy\nwaves in characteristic space to enhance accuracy and minimize numerical\nartifacts. In characteristic space, upwind schemes are used for acoustic waves,\ncentral schemes for vorticity and entropy waves, and Tangent of Hyper-bola for\nINterface Capturing (THINC) reconstruction for material interfaces and contact\ndiscontinuities (a subset of entropy waves). This approach prevents spurious\nvortices in periodic shear layers, accurately captures vortical structures in\ngas-gas and gas-liquid interactions, and improves the accuracy of shock-entropy\nwave interactions. In physical space, phasic densities are computed using THINC\nin regions of contact discontinuities and material interfaces, while tangential\nvelocities are calculated with central schemes to improve vortical structures.\nAn adaptive reconstruction technique is also introduced to mitigate\noscillations near shocks, which arise from primitive variable reconstruction,\nby combining primitive and characteristic variable reconstructions with the\nliquid phase being identified using the stiffened gas parameter. The proposed\nmultidimensional upwinding approach outperforms traditional schemes,\ndemonstrating superior accuracy in capturing physical phenomena, reducing\nnumerical artifacts, and better matching experimental results across complex\ntest cases.",

This phenomenon, fundamentally due to inhomogeneous absorption\npatterns and absent in smaller particles, emerges from a complex\nspatio-temporal interplay, between the electron-phonon coupling and competing\nelectronic thermal diffusion. By combining rigorous three-dimensional (3D)\nfinite-element-method-based simulations with practical reduced zero-dimensional\n(0D) analytical models, we identify the electron-phonon coupling coefficient\n($G_{e-p}$) as the critical parameter governing this behavior. An optimal\n$G_{e-p}$ range allows the inversion, whereas a weak or overly strong coupling\nsuppresses it. Among common plasmonic metals, platinum (Pt) exhibits the most\npronounced and long-lived inversion, while gold (Au) and silver (Ag) show no\nsignificant inversion. Moreover, the close agreement between the 0D and 3D\nresults, once an appropriate characteristic length is selected, highlights that\nthe essential physics governing the inversion can be captured without full\nspatial complexity.

We consider a\ndocument relevant only to the prompt that generated it, while other\ndocument-topic pairs are treated as non-relevant. To introduce realistic\nretrieval challenges, we also generated non-relevant documents, ensuring that\nIR systems are tested against a diverse and robust set of materials.
