To\naddress this gap, we introduce NeuS-V, a novel synthetic video evaluation\nmetric that rigorously assesses text-to-video alignment using neuro-symbolic\nformal verification techniques. Our approach first converts the prompt into a\nformally defined Temporal Logic (TL) specification and translates the generated\nvideo into an automaton representation.

Furthermore, we present a dataset of temporally extended prompts\nto evaluate state-of-the-art video generation models against our benchmark. We\nfind that NeuS-V demonstrates a higher correlation by over 5x with human\nevaluations when compared to existing metrics.

Existing bidirectional models mainly focus on sequential data,\nmaking it difficult to scale effectively to higher dimensions. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel multi-dimensional bidirectional neural network\narchitecture, named Nd-BiMamba2, which efficiently handles 1D, 2D, and 3D data.\nNd-BiMamba2 is based on the Mamba2 module and introduces innovative\nbidirectional processing mechanisms and adaptive padding strategies to capture\nbidirectional information in multi-dimensional data while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

To verify the portability and flexibility of Nd-BiMamba2, we\nsuccessfully exported it to ONNX and TorchScript and tested it on different\nhardware platforms (e.g., CPU, GPU, and mobile devices).

Once a potential plume has been detected, it\nneeds to be identified to determine exactly what gas or gases are present in\nthe plume. During identification, the background underneath the plume needs to\nbe estimated and removed to reveal the spectral characteristics of the gas of\ninterest. Current standard practice is to use ``global\" background estimation,\nwhere the average of all non-plume pixels is used to estimate the background\nfor each pixel in the plume. However, if this global background estimate does\nnot model the true background under the plume well, then the resulting signal\ncan be difficult to identify correctly. The importance of proper background\nestimation increases when dealing with weak signals, large libraries of gases\nof interest, and with uncommon or heterogeneous backgrounds. In this paper, we\npropose two methods of background estimation, in addition to three existing\nmethods, and compare each against global background estimation to determine\nwhich perform best at estimating the true background radiance under a plume,\nand for increasing identification confidence using a neural network\nclassification model. We compare the different methods using 640 simulated\nplumes. We find that PCA is best at estimating the true background under a\nplume, with a median of 18,000 times less MSE compared to global background\nestimation.

    "abstract": "It is now accepted that gigatonnes of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) from the\natmosphere are needed to avoid the threat of catastrophic climate change.\nDirect Air Capture (DAC) is a promising scalable CDR with a relatively small\nenvironmental footprint. But questions about DAC cost and energy use remain\nthat are delaying the needed DAC policy decisions to create a mobilization\neffort like was done in the Manhattan Project and to address the Covid crisis.\nGlobal Thermostat (GT) has publicly claimed costs of under 50 dollars per tonne\nfor mature GT technology deployed at a climate relevant scale. Why this low DAC\ncost is achievable will be addressed by a simplified analysis of generic DAC\ncosts and using that analysis combined with experimental data to evaluate GT's\nDAC technology. A detailed cost analysis of different approaches to DAC by the\nNational Academy of Sciences (NAS) found an approach to DAC that had a learning\ncost limit as low as 25 dollars per tonne GT's DAC technology will be shown in\nAppendix 1 to have the same performance characteristics of the lowest-cost DAC\nidentified in the NAS study. Thus, like solar costs, DAC costs can be reduced\nby learning by doing, but in the case of DAC, only one order of magnitude in\ncost reduction is needed. Therefore DAC technology can reach its low learning\nby doing cost limit at a scale much smaller than necessary to address climate\nchange. From a climate perspective, current DAC embodiments costs and scale\nhave less relevance than their learning curve cost limit. While GT's technology\nhas demonstrated the crucial performance parameters to achieve a low-cost DAC,\nno inference should be drawn that other approaches cannot achieve low or lower\ncost, if they can demonstrate the crucial performance parameters. Continued R&D\non those performance parameters is needed.",

The lack of mandatory type\nannotations in such languages can lead to errors that are challenging to\nidentify early with traditional static analysis tools. Recent progress in deep\nneural networks has led to increased use of neural bug detectors. In statically\ntyped languages, a type checker is integrated into the compiler and thus taken\ninto consideration when the neural bug detector is designed for these\nlanguages.\n  Problem: However, prior studies overlook this aspect during the training and\ntesting of neural bug detectors for dynamically typed languages. When an\noptional type checker is used, assessing existing neural bug detectors on bugs\neasily detectable by type checkers may impact their performance estimation.\nMoreover, including these bugs in the training set of neural bug detectors can\nshift their detection focus toward the wrong type of bugs.\n  Contribution: We explore the impact of type checking on various neural bug\ndetectors for variable misuse bugs, a common type targeted by neural bug\ndetectors. Existing synthetic and real-world datasets are type-checked to\nevaluate the prevalence of type-related bugs. Then, we investigate how\ntype-related bugs influence the training and testing of the neural bug\ndetectors.\n  Findings: Our findings indicate that existing bug detection datasets contain\na significant proportion of type-related bugs. Building on this insight, we\ndiscover integrating the neural bug detector with a type checker can be\nbeneficial, especially when the code is annotated with types. Further\ninvestigation reveals neural bug detectors perform better on type-related bugs\nthan other bugs. Moreover, removing type-related bugs from the training data\nhelps improve neural bug detectors' ability to identify bugs beyond the scope\nof type checkers.",

A promising approach to mitigate these issues is to apply a\nwatermark to images and subsequently check if generative models reproduce\nsimilar watermark features. In this paper, we examine the robustness of various\nwatermark-based protection methods applied to text-to-image models.

In\nsharp contrast to strong negative results for the closely related problem of\nlanguage identification, they establish positive results for language\ngeneration in the limit for all countable collections of languages. Follow-up\nwork by Raman & Tewari [RT24] studies bounds on the number of distinct inputs\nrequired by an algorithm before correct language generation is achieved --\nnamely, whether this is a constant for all languages in the collection (uniform\ngeneration) or a language-dependent constant (non-uniform generation).\n  We show that every countable language collection has a generator which has\nthe stronger property of non-uniform generation in the limit. However, while\nthe generation algorithm of [KM24] can be implemented using membership queries,\nwe show that any algorithm cannot non-uniformly generate even for collections\nof just two languages, using only membership queries.\n  We also formalize the tension between validity and breadth in the generation\nalgorithm of [KM24] by introducing a definition of exhaustive generation, and\nshow a strong negative result for exhaustive generation. Our result shows that\na tradeoff between validity and breadth is inherent for generation in the\nlimit. We also provide a precise characterization of the language collections\nfor which exhaustive generation is possible. Finally, inspired by algorithms\nthat can choose to obtain feedback, we consider a model of uniform generation\nwith feedback, completely characterizing language collections for which such\nuniform generation with feedback is possible in terms of a complexity measure\nof the collection.",

In response, we revisit the polymatroid\ngreedoid [KL85a] to characterize it by properties approximating those of\nmatroids, by using the submodularity of its polymatroid representation in\nparticular. Towards doing so, our main contribution is a full description of\nthis class. Specifically, we show that a greedoid is a polymatroid greedoid if\nand only if it is an optimistic interval greedoid whose kernels are closed\nunder intersection. This constitutes the first necessary and sufficient\ncharacterization of the polymatroid greedoid in terms of its combinatorial\nattributes, thereby resolving a central open question of Korte and Lov\\'asz\n[KL85a]. Here, we introduce the optimism property to approximate properties of\na matroid's continuations which are implied by the closure axioms of its span,\nwhich no longer hold for greedoids. And, because the kernels of an interval\ngreedoid are in many ways an extension of a matroid's closed sets, our\ndirection of necessity is a direct generalization of Birkhoff and Edmond's\ncharacterization of the meet in the lattice of a matroid's closed sets [Bir35,\nEdm03]. Towards achieving this result, our main technical insights arise from\nrelating the lattice of flats of a polymatroid greedoid to that of the closed\nsets of its representation through order preserving mappings. Specifically, we\nwill show the novel insight that the notion of polymatroid representation\nconsidered in [KL85a] is equivalent to the existence of a certain Galois\nconnection. As a consequence, the representation of a greedoid via a\npolymatroid is an order theoretic concept in disguise.",

However, most existing image editing\nmodels focus on manipulating intensity and texture features, often overlooking\nobject geometry within images. To address this issue, this paper introduces a\nnovel method, Topology-Preserved Image Editing with text instructions (TPIE),\nthat for the first time ensures the topology and geometry remaining intact in\nedited images through text-guided generative diffusion models. More\nspecifically, our method treats newly generated samples as deformable\nvariations of a given input template, allowing for controllable and\nstructure-preserving edits. Our proposed TPIE framework consists of two key\nmodules: (i) an autoencoder-based registration network that learns latent\nrepresentations of object transformations, parameterized by velocity fields,\nfrom pairwise training images; and (ii) a novel latent conditional geometric\ndiffusion (LCDG) model efficiently capturing the data distribution of learned\ntransformation features conditioned on custom-defined text instructions. We\nvalidate TPIE on a diverse set of 2D and 3D images and compare them with\nstate-of-the-art image editing approaches.

Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic\nreconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye\ncameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene\nremains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel\napproach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera\nmodels for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions\nare two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that\ndistorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to\nfisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian\nsplatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion\ncaused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering\nwhile ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering\nmethod, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation\nfrom multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt\ndifferent camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision\nfrom different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian\nrepresentation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic\ndriving scene understanding. As a result, our approach models multiple sensors\n(pinhole and fisheye cameras) and modalities (depth, semantic, normal and LiDAR\npoint clouds). Our experiments show that our method achieves superior rendering\nquality and fast rendering speed for driving scene simulation.",

This work develops and uses a system dynamics approach to\nunderstand possible adoption pathways of novel vehicle options, i.e.,\nethanol-blended fuel (E85), electric, and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles\nin India. A system dynamics model using a multi-nominal logit model to capture\nconsumer choices has been previously developed for the private road transport\nsector of India. The model has been modified to also include annual vehicular\nemissions as a decisionmaking attribute in addition to the annual cost. Four\ndifferent classes of consumers with different priorities to cost and annual\nemissions are modeled. The model coefficients are identified using historical\ndata. Model simulations over a period of 30 years till 2050 are performed to\ndetermine possible vehicle adoption trends. Different scenarios of changing\nenvironmental awareness, policy interventions, and technology development were\nanalyzed to achieve targets such as COP26 greenhouse gas emission reduction,\nethanol blending, and EV adoption. Simulation results showed that an increase\nin environmental awareness resulted in the adoption of novel vehicle options by\n67.42% and 22.3% of the car and two-wheeler stocks, respectively. However,\nrising environmental awareness was not enough to meet the target values.\nScenario analysis showed that a greater share of renewables in the electricity\ngrid, carbon tax on transport fuel, and reduced vehicle driving together can\npossibly achieve the GHG emissions target in 2030. Battery-related GHG\nemissions were shown to be very important and led to counter-intuitive trends\nin EV adoption. 30% EV sales by 2030 could be achieved with a greener\nelectricity grid and carbon tax.",

To reduce these costs, coreset\nselection aims to find a representative subset of data to train models while\nideally performing on par with the full data training. State-of-the-art coreset\nmethods use carefully-designed criteria to quantify the importance of each data\nexample via ground truth labels and dataset-specific training, then select\nexamples whose scores lie in a certain range to construct a coreset. These\nmethods work well in their respective settings, however, they cannot select\ndata that are unlabeled, which is the majority of real-world data. To that end,\nthis paper motivates and formalizes the problem of unlabeled coreset selection\nto enable greater scale and reduce annotation costs for deep learning.

    "abstract": "Tidal disruption events (TDEs) of giant stars by supermassive black holes\n(SMBH) differ significantly from those of main sequence ones. Most (all for\nSMBH of more than a~ few times 10^5 m_\\odot) giant-TDEs are partial: only a\nfraction of the envelope is torn apart. The dense stellar core and the rest of\nthe envelope remain intact. In this work, we explore, using the stellar\nevolution code MESA, the fate of the remnants. We find that after a short\nperiod, comparable to the thermal time scale, the remnant returns to a giant\nstructure with a radius comparable to the progenitor giant one, a slightly\nlarger luminosity (as compared with a regular giant with the same mass), and a\ncomparable lifetime until it collapses to a white dwarf. If such a giant with a\nmass less than approx 0.9 m_\\odot is discovered, it can be identified as an\noutlier - a giant that is too light for the current age of the Universe. If the\nremnant orbit is not perturbed significantly during the encounter, the remnant\nwill undergo successive partial tidal disruptions until its mass is $0.6-0.7\nm_\\odot$. We expect a few dozen to a few hundred such remnants in the Galactic\nnucleus.",

The\nunique functional properties of this material critically depend on its ability\nto transport charge in the form of polarons, namely narrow electron wavepackets\naccompanied by local distortions of the crystal lattice. It is currently well\nestablished that the most important polymorphs of TiO2, the rutile and anatase\nphases, harbor small electron polarons and small hole polarons, respectively.\nHowever, whether additional polaronic species exist in TiO2, and under which\nconditions, remain open questions. Here, we provide definitive answers to these\nquestions by exploring the rich landscape of polaron quasiparticles in TiO2 via\nrecently developed ab initio techniques. In addition to the already known small\npolarons, we identify three novel species, namely a large hole polaron in\nrutile, a large quasi-two-dimensional electron polaron in anatase, and a large\nexciton polaron in anatase. These findings complete the puzzle on the polaorn\nphysics of TiO2 and pave the way for systematically probing and manipulating\npolarons in a broad class of complex oxides and quantum materials.",

The framework is based on using the degrees\nof freedom associated to a Galerkin discretization as the fundamental lattice\nvariables. We formulate standard concepts in lattice field theory, such as the\npartition function and correlation functions, in terms of the degrees of\nfreedom. For example, using continuous finite element spaces, we show that the\ntwo-point spatial correlation function can be defined between any two points on\nthe domain (as opposed to at just lattice sites) and furthermore, that this\nsatisfies a weak propagator (or Green's function) identity, in analogy to the\ncontinuum case. Furthermore, this framework leads naturally to higher-order\nformulations of lattice field theories by considering higher-order finite\nelement spaces for the Galerkin discretization. We consider analytical and\nnumerical examples of scalar field theory to investigate how increasing the\norder of piecewise polynomial finite element spaces affect the approximation of\nlattice observables.

However, as these\ntechnologies scale, they increase hardware complexity, computing power demands,\nand create significant digital signal processing (DSP) challenges. While\ntransistor miniaturization has improved digital electronic processors, they\nstill face physical bottlenecks, limiting computational throughput and\nincreasing DSP latency. Photonic processors present a promising alternative,\noffering large bandwidth, low loss, parallel processing, and low latency. Yet,\nscalability in photonic processors remains limited by system integration,\ndevice size, and on-chip multiplexing challenges. Here, we introduce a scalable\non-chip hybrid multiplexed photonic processor, combining mode-division\nmultiplexing (MDM) and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). This marks the\nfirst implementation of a monolithically integrated MDM-WDM-compatible\nprocessor, featuring mode multiplexers, multimode microring resonators, and\nmultimode balanced photodetectors. Furthermore, we demonstrate real-time\nunscrambling of 5 Gb/s non-return-to-zero optical MIMO signals and RF\nphase-shift keying signal unjamming. Our system's 30 ps processing latency\nmakes it ideal for real-time MIMO and RF applications.

Here, we study\nthe Kagome-lattice superconductor CsV3Sb5, in which multiband superconductivity\ncoexists with a charge order that substantially reduces the compound's space\ngroup symmetries. Through a combination of thermodynamic as well as electrical\nand thermal transport measurements, we uncover two superconducting regimes with\ndistinct transport and thermodynamic characteristics, while finding no evidence\nfor a phase transition separating them. Thermodynamic measurements reveal\nsubstantial quasiparticle weight in a high-temperature regime. At lower\ntemperatures, this weight is removed via the formation of a second gap. The two\nregimes are sharply distinguished by a pronounced enhancement of the upper\ncritical field at low temperatures and by a switch in the anisotropy of the\nlongitudinal thermal conductivity as a function of in-plane magnetic field\norientation. We argue that the band with a gap opening at lower temperatures\ncontinues to host low-energy quasiparticles, possibly due to a nodal structure\nof the gap. Taken together, our results present evidence for band-selective\nsuperconductivity with remarkable decoupling of the (two) superconducting gaps.\nThe commonly employed multiband scenario, whereby superconductivity emerges in\na primary band and is then induced in other bands appears to fail in this\nunconventional kagome superconductor.

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose HOPER (HOlistic ProtEin Representation), a novel\nmultimodal learning framework designed to enhance protein function prediction\n(PFP) in low-data settings. The challenge of predicting protein functions is\ncompounded by the limited availability of labeled data. Traditional machine\nlearning models already struggle in such cases, and while deep learning models\nexcel with abundant data, they also face difficulties when data is scarce.\nHOPER addresses this issue by integrating three distinct modalities - protein\nsequences, biomedical text, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks - to\ncreate a comprehensive protein representation. The model utilizes autoencoders\nto generate holistic embeddings, which are then employed for PFP tasks using\ntransfer learning. HOPER outperforms existing methods on a benchmark dataset\nacross all Gene Ontology categories, i.e., molecular function, biological\nprocess, and cellular component. Additionally, we demonstrate its practical\nutility by identifying new immune-escape proteins in lung adenocarcinoma,\noffering insights into potential therapeutic targets. Our results highlight the\neffectiveness of multimodal representation learning for overcoming data\nlimitations in biological research, potentially enabling more accurate and\nscalable protein function prediction.

The corresponding gate operations are designed for\npractical implementations, which are relieved from the longtime compression and\ndecompression. Second, for the dense Hadamard gate, which is definitely used to\nconstruct the superposition, we design a customized structure for significant\nmemory saving as a regularity-oriented simulation.

Additionally, we analyze the\nabundance radial gradients to investigate the impact of diffuse ionized gas\n(DIG) decontamination on oxygen abundances over the featuring inner drops.

This aspect sets ScoSh\nmodels apart from the traditional Scalar-on-Function (ScoF) regression models\nthat incorporate full predictor functions. ScoSh is motivated by object data\nanalysis, {\\it, e.g.}, for neuro-anatomical objects, where object morphologies\nare relevant and their parameterizations are arbitrary. ScoSh also differs from\nmethods that arbitrarily pre-register data and uses it in subsequent analysis.\nIn contrast, ScoSh models perform registration during regression, using the\n(non-parametric) Fisher-Rao inner product and nonlinear index functions to\ncapture complex predictor-response relationships. This formulation results in\nnovel concepts of {\\it regression phase} and {\\it regression mean} of\nfunctions.

We\ndemonstrate that in the presence of net vertical field, disks that extend out\nto the 3:1 mean motion resonance grow eccentricity in full MHD in much the same\nway as in hydrodynamical disks. Hence turbulence due to the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI) does not impede the tidally-driven growth of eccentricity in\nany meaningful way. However, we find two important differences with alpha-disk\ntheory. First, in MHD, eccentricity builds up in the inner disk with a series\nof episodes of radial disk breaking into two misaligned eccentric disks,\nseparated by a region of circular orbits. Standing eccentric waves are often\npresent in the inner eccentric disk. Second, the successful spreading of an\naccretion disk with MRI turbulence out to the resonant radius is nontrivial,\nand much harder than spreading an alpha-disk. This is due to the tendency to\ndevelop over-dense rings in which tidal torques overwhelm MRI transport and\ntruncate the disk too early. We believe that the inability to spread the disk\nsufficiently was the reason why our previous attempt to excite eccentricity via\nthe 3:1 mean motion resonance with MHD failed. Exactly how MHD disks\nsuccessfully spread outward in compact binary systems is an important problem\nthat has not yet been understood.",

    "abstract": "Mobile robots are widely used to perform various technological operations in\nseveral sectors of the national economy. These operations are related to\ntransporting goods and equipment, performing work to determine the condition of\na technical object or structure, their construction or repair, performing work\nto study a specific territory and compile relevant maps, etc. Recently, the\nlist of operations that mobile robots can perform has expanded with police and\nmilitary operations. Obviously, the safety of personnel working nearby and the\ntime required to perform the relevant operations depend on such robots' speed\nand accuracy of movement. Therefore, an important task arises to study and form\nthe trajectories of movement of mobile robots. Optimization, adaptation,\nrobustness methods, and the theory of movement stability allow us to consider a\nmobile robot as a dynamic system with several inputs and outputs. The\nmathematical description of such a dynamic system can be used to analyze and\nsynthesize the desired trajectories of movement by solving the corresponding\ndirect and inverse dynamics problems. Therefore, creating a mathematical model\nof a mobile robot is a relevant task, the solution of which allows us to create\nand research robot control systems that ensure movement along predetermined\ndesired trajectories.",

One approach to\ninvestigating this question involves comparing the star-formation rates (SFRs)\nof active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with those of typical star-forming galaxies.\nAt relatively low redshifts ($z\\lesssim 1$), radio AGNs manifest diminished\nSFRs, indicating suppressed star formation, but their behavior at higher\nredshifts is unclear. To examine this, we leveraged galaxy and radio AGN data\nfrom the well-characterized W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1, and XMM-LSS fields. We\nestablished two mass-complete reference star-forming galaxy samples and two\nradio AGN samples, consisting of 1,763 and 6,766 radio AGNs, the former being\nhigher in purity and the latter more complete. We subsequently computed\nstar-forming fractions ($f_{\\text{SF}}$; the fraction of star-forming galaxies\nto all galaxies) for galaxies and radio-AGN-host galaxies and conducted a\nrobust comparison between them up to $z\\approx3$. We found that the tendency\nfor radio AGNs to reside in massive galaxies primarily accounts for their low\n$f_{\\text{SF}}$, which also shows a strong negative dependence upon $M_{\\star}$\nand a strong positive evolution with $z$. To investigate further the\nstar-formation characteristics of those star-forming radio AGNs, we constructed\nthe star-forming main sequence (MS) and investigated the behavior of the\nposition of AGNs relative to the MS at $z\\approx0-3$. Our results reveal that\nradio AGNs display lower SFRs than star-forming galaxies in the low-$z$ and\nhigh-$M_{\\star}$ regime and, conversely, exhibit comparable or higher SFRs than\nMS star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts or lower $M_{\\star}$.",

These structures often\nutilize a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) architecture, similar to a Fabry-Perot\nnanocavity, using noble metals and dielectric or semiconductor spacers for\nnarrow-band light absorption. In reflection mode, they function as band-stop\nfilters, blocking specific wavelengths and reflecting others through\nFabry-Perot resonance. Efficient color reflection requires asymmetric\nFabry-Perot cavities, where metals with differing reflectivities and extinction\ncoefficients enable substantial reflection for non-resonant wavelengths and\nnear-perfect absorption at resonant ones. Unlike narrowband techniques,\nbroadband absorption does not rely on a single resonance phenomenon. Recent\ndevelopments show that integrating an asymmetric Fabry-Perot nanocavity with an\nanti-reflection coating achieves near-unity absorption across a broad\nwavelength range. This study introduces an asymmetric Fabry-Perot nanocavity\nwith a dielectric-semiconductor-dielectric spacer, enabling near-unity color\nreflection. By incorporating silicon, the reflected color can be tuned with\njust a 5 nm thickness variation, while achieving broadband absorption over 70%\nin the 800-1600 nm range. The addition of an anti-reflection coating extends\nbroadband absorption to near unity with minimal impact on reflected color.

The key aspect\nhelping reconcile axion coupling quantization with electric-magnetic duality is\nthe fact that the axion itself undergoes a non-linear transformation under\nelectric-magnetic duality.

    "abstract": "A large body of work in the statistics and computer science communities\ndating back to Huber (Huber, 1960) has led to statistically and computationally\nefficient outlier-robust estimators. Two particular outlier models have\nreceived significant attention: the adversarial and heavy-tailed models. While\nthe former models outliers as the result of a malicious adversary manipulating\nthe data, the latter relaxes distributional assumptions on the data allowing\noutliers to naturally occur as part of the data generating process. In the\nfirst setting, the goal is to develop estimators robust to the largest fraction\nof outliers while in the second, one seeks estimators to combat the loss of\nstatistical efficiency, where the dependence on the failure probability is\nparamount.\n  Despite these distinct motivations, the algorithmic approaches to both these\nsettings have converged, prompting questions on the relationship between the\nmodels. In this paper, we investigate and provide a principled explanation for\nthis phenomenon. First, we prove that any adversarially robust estimator is\nalso resilient to heavy-tailed outliers for any statistical estimation problem\nwith i.i.d data. As a corollary, optimal adversarially robust estimators for\nmean estimation, linear regression, and covariance estimation are also optimal\nheavy-tailed estimators. Conversely, for arguably the simplest high-dimensional\nestimation task of mean estimation, we construct heavy-tailed estimators whose\napplication to the adversarial setting requires any black-box reduction to\nremove almost all the outliers in the data. Taken together, our results imply\nthat heavy-tailed estimation is likely easier than adversarially robust\nestimation opening the door to novel algorithmic approaches for the\nheavy-tailed setting. Additionally, confidence intervals obtained for\nadversarially robust estimation also hold with high-probability.",

However, to meet the high performance and\nconnectivity demands of sixth-generation (6G) networks, future wireless systems\nwill require larger antenna arrays, higher operating frequencies, and advanced\nantenna architectures. This shift changes the propagation model from far-field\nplanar-wave to near-field spherical-wave which necessitates a redesign of\nexisting covert communication systems. Unlike far-field beamforming, which\nrelies only on direction, near-field beamforming depends on both distance and\ndirection, providing additional degrees of freedom for system design. In this\npaper, we aim to utilize those freedoms by proposing near-field Frequency\nDiverse Array (FDA)-based transmission strategies that manipulate the\nbeampattern in both distance and angle, thereby establishing a non-covert\nregion around the legitimate user. Our approach takes advantage of near-field\nproperties and FDA technology to significantly reduce the area vulnerable to\ndetection by adversaries while maintaining covert communication with the\nlegitimate receiver.

At low\ntemperatures below the spectral gap, the quantized thermal Hall response agrees\nwith that expected from conformal field theory and gravitational anomaly\narguments. Our main finding is that in a large temperature window spanning the\nspectral gap and the Curie temperature scales where quantum critical\nfluctuations dominate, $\\kappa_{xy}/T$ obeys a power-law with logarithmic\ncorrections. Our analysis also provides a route to understanding the thermal\nHall response at higher temperatures in the quantum critical regime.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that the gravitational constant $G$ abruptly decreased\naround 130 Myr ago, making Type Ia supernovae (SNe) in the Hubble flow\nintrinsically brighter than those in host galaxies with Cepheid distances. This\nwould make Hubble flow SNe more distant, causing redshifts to rise slower with\ndistance, potentially solving the Hubble tension. We explore a wide range of\nunattractive consequences of this ``$G$ step model'' (GSM). We find that since\nthe luminosities of Sun-like stars scale as approximately $G^{5.6}$, the Solar\nluminosity would have dropped substantially 130 Myr ago in this scenario,\nlikely pushing Earth into a planetary glaciation. However, there was no\nSnowball Earth episode in the last 500 Myr. The GSM also implies that the\nlength of a year would have abruptly increased by about 10%, but the number of\ndays per year has evolved broadly continuously according to geochronometry and\ncyclostratigraphy. The GSM would considerably alter stellar evolution, causing\nthe Sun to have exhausted about 2/3 of its fuel supply rather than 1/2. This\nwould make the Sun's helioseismic age exceed that of the oldest meteorite\nsamples, but these agree excellently in practice. The expected age of the\nUniverse also agrees well with that of the oldest Galactic stars assuming\nconstant $G$. The GSM however implies these stars are younger, creating a lack\nof stars from the first 3 Gyr of cosmic history. These arguments pose\nsignificant challenges to models seeking to resolve the Hubble tension through\na transition in $G$.",

This paper presents the abundance and properties of DAGN produced in\nnine large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We focus on DAGN\npowered by AGN with Lbol > 1e43 erg/s and belonging to distinct galaxies, i.e.\npairs that can be characterised with current and near-future electromagnetic\nobservations. We find that the number density of DAGN separated by a few to 30\nproper kpc varies from 1e-8 (or none) to 1e-3 comoving Mpc^3 in the redshift\nrange z=0-7. At a given redshift, the densities of the DAGN numbers vary by up\nto two orders of magnitude from one simulation to another. However, for all\nsimulations, the DAGN peak is in the range z=1-3, right before the peak of\ncosmic star formation or cosmic AGN activity. The corresponding fractions of\nDAGN (with respect to the total number of AGN) range from 0 to 6 percent. We\nfind that simulations could produce too few DAGN at z=0 (or merge pairs too\nquickly) compared to current observational constraints while being consistent\nwith preliminary constraints at high redshift (z = 3). Next-generation\nobservatories (e.g., AXIS) will be of paramount importance to detect DAGN\nacross cosmic times. We predict the detectability of DAGN with future X-ray\ntelescopes and discuss DAGN as progenitors for future LISA gravitational wave\ndetections.",

Energy correlators, and their associated light-ray operator product\nexpansion (OPE), allow scaling behaviors of the measured spectrum to be\ndirectly mapped to properties of the underlying quantum field theory. Here, we\ndemonstrate for the first time how this mapping occurs in nuclear collisions,\nand highlight how the light-ray OPE characterizes leading nuclear effects. We\nshow that the leading modification to the energy correlator distribution is\ncharacterized by an enhancement of the expectation value of twist-4 light-ray\noperators, resulting in a scaling for the ratio of the two-point correlator in\nnuclear matter to that in vacuum of $\\sim 1+a\\theta^2$ up to quantum\ncorrections.

The regularization is provided by the non-commutative geometry of the\nlowest Landau level filled by electrons, such that the charge is trivially\ngapped due to the Pauli exclusion principle at filling factor $\\nu=1$, while\nthe electron spins encode the desired CFT. Successful applications of the fuzzy\nsphere to paradigmatic CFTs, such as the 3D Ising model, raise an important\nquestion: how finely tuned does the underlying electron system need to be?\nHere, we show that the 3D Ising CFT can also be realized at fractional electron\nfillings. In such cases, the CFT spectrum is intertwined with the\ncharge-neutral spectrum of the underlying fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state\n-- a feature that is trivially absent in the previously studied $\\nu=1$ case.\nRemarkably, we show that the mixing between the CFT spectrum and the FQH\nspectrum is strongly suppressed within the numerically-accessible system sizes.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the CFT critical point is unaffected by the\nexchange statistics of the particles and by the nature of topological order in\nthe charge sector.

    "abstract": "Quantum networking continues to encode information in polarization states due\nto ease and precision. The variable environmental polarization transformations\ninduced by deployed fiber need correction for deployed quantum networking. Here\nwe present a new method for automatic polarization compensation (APC) and\ndemonstrate its performance on a metropolitan quantum network. Designing an APC\ninvolves many design decisions indicated by the diversity of previous solutions\nin the literature. Our design leverages heterodyne detection of\nwavelength-multiplexed dim classical references for continuous high-bandwidth\npolarization measurements used by newly developed multi-axis (non-)linear\ncontrol algorithm(s) for complete polarization channel stabilization with no\ndowntime. This enables continuous relatively high-bandwidth correction without\nsignificant added noise from classical reference signals. We demonstrate the\nperformance of our APC using a variety of classical and quantum\ncharacterizations. Finally, we use C-band and L-band APC versions to\ndemonstrate continuous high-fidelity entanglement distribution on a\nmetropolitan quantum network with average relative fidelity of $0.94\\pm0.03$\nfor over 30 hrs",

We focus on vertically parametrized systems,\nwhich are sparse systems where we allow linear dependencies between\ncoefficients in front of the same monomial. We give a matroid-theoretic\ncharacterization of the maximal-dimensional torus for which all solution sets\nare invariant under componentwise multiplication. Building on this, we provide\nnecessary conditions and sufficient conditions for when the solution sets are\nunions of finitely many or a unique coset.

This paper proposes WildLMa with three\ncomponents to address these issues: (1) adaptation of learned low-level\ncontroller for VR-enabled whole-body teleoperation and traversability; (2)\nWildLMa-Skill -- a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired via\nimitation learning or heuristics and (3) WildLMa-Planner -- an interface of\nlearned skills that allow LLM planners to coordinate skills for long-horizon\ntasks. We demonstrate the importance of high-quality training data by achieving\nhigher grasping success rate over existing RL baselines using only tens of\ndemonstrations. WildLMa exploits CLIP for language-conditioned imitation\nlearning that empirically generalizes to objects unseen in training\ndemonstrations.

By\nestablishing $\\Gamma$-convergence of its variational description, it proves\nconvergence of these solutions to entropy solutions of the nominal problem, in\nthe limit of vanishing regularization parameter.

Those are lower bounds on uncertainties\nof system observables that are time-integrated along stochastic trajectories.\nThe uncertainty is defined as the ratio of the variance to the square of the\naverage, with the latter necessarily shifted by the average in a reference\ndistribution. The derived bounds are observable independent, but rely on the\nreference choice. We show, however, that all OURs originate from a matrix bound\non correlations between times spent in different system configurations, i.e.,\noccupation times. This result is reference independent, and expressed only in\nterms of stationary probability and lifetimes of individual configurations. Any\ndynamics that saturates the matrix bound, is optimal in approximating\nstationary distribution by occupation times; this always occurs for\nunidirectional cycles. Furthermore, using this bound, dynamic correlations can\nbe asymptotically bounded in terms of static correlations, in turn leading to\nthe positivity of dynamic exponents in the thermodynamic limit.

In (2) localized refinement, we enhance video\nalignment by 'repairing' the misaligned regions from the original video while\npreserving the correctly generated areas.

Our study tackles the\npruning techniques for the previously unexplored multi-modal generation models,\nand particularly examines the pruning impact on the textual component and the\nimage generation component separately. We conduct a comprehensive comparison on\npruning the model or the single component of the model in various sparsities.\nOur results yield previously undocumented findings. For example, contrary to\nestablished trends in language model pruning, we discover that simple magnitude\npruning outperforms more advanced techniques in text-to-image context.\nFurthermore, our results show that Stable Diffusion 2 can be pruned to 38.5%\nsparsity with minimal quality loss, achieving a significant reduction in model\nsize. We propose an optimal pruning configuration that prunes the text encoder\nto 47.5% and the diffusion generator to 35%. This configuration maintains image\ngeneration quality while substantially reducing computational requirements. In\naddition, our work uncovers intriguing questions about information encoding in\ntext-to-image models: we observe that pruning beyond certain thresholds leads\nto sudden performance drops (unreadable images), suggesting that specific\nweights encode critical semantics information. This finding opens new avenues\nfor future research in model compression, interoperability, and bias\nidentification in text-to-image models.

Here we investigate the potential\nmechanisms for such observed properties, in BBH mergers via isolated binary\nevolution. We synthesize BBH mergers with the fast binary evolution code BSE.\nThe role of various physical assumptions is explored, including tidal spin-up,\ncompact remnant mass, and mass transfer physics.

The anti-correlation is particularly pronounced for SMT-channel BBH\nmergers that experience a mass-ratio-reversal, i.e., those where the\nsecond-born BH is the more massive member. The anti-correlation arises from the\ndependence of orbital shrinking during mass transfer and the Roche lobe size on\nthe system's mass ratio. This characteristic $\\chi_{\\rm eff}-q$ trend\ndiminishes with increasing metallicity and when the isolated-binary BBH merger\npopulation is mixed with a significant contribution of dynamically formed BBH\nmergers.

Although\nthis is of high interest as well, there are more opportunities to make use of\nthe quantum advantage among non-perfect information games with a limited amount\nof steps within the game. Even though it is not possible to answer the question\nfor the winning move in a specific situation, people are rather interested in\nwhat choice gives the best outcome in the long run. This leads us to the search\nfor the highest number of paths within the game's decision tree despite the\nlack of information and, thus, to a maximum of the payoff-function. We want to\nillustrate on how Quantum Computers can play a significant role in solving\nthese kind of games, using an example of the most popular German card game\nSkat. Therefore we use quantum registers to encode the game's information\nproperly and construct the corresponding quantum gates in order to model the\ngame progress and obey the rules.

    "abstract": "Zebrafish have been used as a model organism in many areas of biology,\nincluding the study of pattern formation. The mean-field survival model is a\ncoupled ODE system describing the expected evolution of chromatophores\ncoordinating to form stripes in zebrafish. This paper presents analysis of the\nmodel focusing on parameters for the number of cells, length of\ndistant-neighbor interactions, and rates related to birth and death of\nchromatophores. We derive the conditions on these parameters for a Turing\nbifurcation to occur and show that the model predicts patterns qualitatively\nsimilar to those in nature.\n  In addition to answering questions about this particular model, this paper\nalso serves as a case study for Turing analysis on coupled ODE systems. The\nqualitative behavior of such coupled ODE models may deviate significantly from\ncontinuum limit models. The ability to analyze such systems directly avoids\nthis concern and allows for a more accurate description of the behavior at\nphysically relevant scales.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we describe an efficient method for providing a regression\nmodel with a sense of curiosity about its data. In the field of machine\nlearning, our framework for representing curiosity is called Active Learning,\nwhich concerns the problem of automatically choosing data points for which to\nquery labels in the semi-supervised setting. The methods we propose are based\non computing a \"regularity tangent\" vector that can be calculated (with only a\nconstant slow-down) together with the model's parameter vector during training.\nWe then take the inner product of this tangent vector with the gradient vector\nof the model's loss at a given data point to obtain a measure of the influence\nof that point on the complexity of the model. In the simplest instantiation,\nthere is only a single regularity tangent vector, of the same dimension as the\nparameter vector. Thus, in the proposed technique, once training is complete,\nevaluating our \"curiosity\" about a potential query data point can be done as\nquickly as calculating the model's loss gradient at that point. The new vector\nonly doubles the amount of storage required by the model. We show that the\nquantity computed by our technique is an example of an \"influence function\",\nand that it measures the expected squared change in model complexity incurred\nby up-weighting a given data point. We propose a number of ways for using this\nand other related quantities to choose new training data points for a\nregression model.",

The leave-one-out\n(LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response\nwhen a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to\nperform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for\nlarge models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques\nfor efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context\nattribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant\noperations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and\nemulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken\ntogether, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to\na target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark\nincrease in performance makes computing context attributions for a given\nresponse 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world\napplications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a\nuser-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM\ninterpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context\nattribution methods.",

Therefore, there is a widespread assumption in the community that\nNeuralPDEs are more trustworthy and generalizable than black box models.\nHowever, like any SciML model, differentiable programming relies predominantly\non high-quality PDE simulations as \"ground truth\" for training. However,\nmathematics dictates that these are only discrete numerical approximations of\nthe true physics. Therefore, we ask: Are NeuralPDEs and differentiable\nprogramming models trained on PDE simulations as physically interpretable as we\nthink? In this work, we rigorously attempt to answer these questions, using\nestablished ideas from numerical analysis, experiments, and analysis of model\nJacobians. Our study shows that NeuralPDEs learn the artifacts in the\nsimulation training data arising from the discretized Taylor Series truncation\nerror of the spatial derivatives. Additionally, NeuralPDE models are\nsystematically biased, and their generalization capability is likely enabled by\na fortuitous interplay of numerical dissipation and truncation error in the\ntraining dataset and NeuralPDE, which seldom happens in practical applications.\nThis bias manifests aggressively even in relatively accessible 1-D equations,\nraising concerns about the veracity of differentiable programming on complex,\nhigh-dimensional, real-world PDEs, and in dataset integrity of foundation\nmodels. Further, we observe that the initial condition constrains the\ntruncation error in initial-value problems in PDEs, thereby exerting\nlimitations to extrapolation.

RED also adopts a spatial-temporal-user joint Embedding scheme to\nencode comprehensive information when preparing the trajectories as model\ninputs. To conduct training, RED adopts Dual-objective task learning}: the\nTransformer encoder predicts the next segment in a trajectory, and the\nTransformer decoder reconstructs the entire trajectory. RED also considers the\nspatial-temporal correlations of trajectories by modifying the attention\nmechanism of the Transformer.

More precisely, we demonstrate that neural\nnetworks with a simple $L^2$-minimizing loss achieve a rate of $n^{-1/(4+r)}$\nin nonparametric density estimation when the underlying density is Markov to a\ngraph whose maximum clique size is at most $r$, and we provide evidence that in\nthe aforementioned applications, this size is typically constant, i.e.,\n$r=O(1)$. We then establish that the optimal rate in $L^1$ is $n^{-1/(2+r)}$\nwhich, compared to the standard nonparametric rate of $n^{-1/(2+d)}$, reveals\nthat the effective dimension of such problems is the size of the largest clique\nin the Markov random field. These rates are independent of the data's ambient\ndimension, making them applicable to realistic models of image, sound, video,\nand text data. Our results provide a novel justification for deep learning's\nability to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, demonstrating\ndimension-independent convergence rates in these contexts.",

If\nthe mean free path of the particles in the fluid is much shorter than the\nbubble wall thickness, the fluid is locally in thermal equilibrium and the\nwall's terminal velocity can be determined by entropy conservation. On the\nother hand, if local thermal equilibrium inside the wall cannot be maintained,\nthe wall velocity can be estimated from the pressure impacted by ballistic\nparticle dynamics at the wall. We find that the latter case leads to slightly\nslower bubble walls. Expectedly, we find the largest differences in the\nterminal velocity when the fluid is entirely ballistic. This observation\nindicates that the non-equilibrium effects inside walls are relevant. To study\nbubble evolution, we perform hydrodynamic lattice simulations in the case of\nlocal thermal equilibrium and $N$-body simulations in the ballistic case to\ninvestigate the dynamical effects during expansion. Both simulations show that\neven if a stationary solution exists in theory it may not be reached depending\non the dynamics of the accelerating bubble walls.",

The goal of this paper is to generate good cutting-planes for such\ninstances using historical data. Gomory mixed integer cuts (GMIC) for a general\nMILP can be parameterized by a vector of weights to aggregate the constraints\ninto a single equality constraint, where each such equality constraint in turn\nyields a unique GMIC. In this paper, we prove that for a family of MILP\ninstances, where the right-hand-side of the instances belongs to a lattice, the\nGMIC closure for every instance in this infinite family can be obtained using\nthe same finite list of aggregation weights. This result motivates us to build\na simple heuristic to efficiently select aggregations for generating GMICs from\nhistorical data of similar instances with varying right-hand-sides and\nobjective function coefficients. For testing our method, we generated families\nof instances by perturbing the right-hand-side and objective functions of\nMIPLIB 2017 instances. The proposed heuristic can significantly accelerate the\nperformance of Gurobi for many benchmark instances, even when taking into\naccount the time required to predict aggregation multipliers and compute the\ncut coefficients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the\nliterature of data-driven cutting plane generation that is able to\nsignificantly accelerate the performance of a commercial state-of-the-art MILP\nsolver, using default solver settings, on large-scale benchmark instances.",

In this paper, we propose a novel OOD\ndetection framework FodFoM that innovatively combines multiple foundation\nmodels to generate two types of challenging fake outlier images for classifier\ntraining.\n  The first type is based on BLIP-2's image captioning capability, CLIP's\nvision-language knowledge, and Stable Diffusion's image generation ability.\nJointly utilizing these foundation models constructs fake outlier images which\nare semantically similar to but different from in-distribution (ID) images. For\nthe second type, GroundingDINO's object detection ability is utilized to help\nconstruct pure background images by blurring foreground ID objects in ID\nimages. The proposed framework can be flexibly combined with multiple existing\nOOD detection methods.\n  Extensive empirical evaluations show that image classifiers with the help of\nconstructed fake images can more accurately differentiate real OOD images from\nID ones.\n  New state-of-the-art OOD detection performance is achieved on multiple\nbenchmarks.

We propose a Leapfrog Latent Consistency Model (LLCM)\nthat is distilled from a retrained diffusion model based on the collected\nMedImgs dataset, which enables our model to generate real-time high-resolution\nimages. We formulate the reverse diffusion process as a probability flow\nordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) and solve it in latent space using the\nLeapfrog algorithm. This formulation enables rapid sampling without\nnecessitating additional iterations. Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art\nperformance in generating medical images. Furthermore, our model can be\nfine-tuned with any custom medical image datasets, facilitating the generation\nof a vast array of images. Our experimental results outperform those of\nexisting models on unseen dog cardiac X-ray images. Source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/lskdsjy/LeapfrogLCM.",

    "abstract": "Supersymmetric models are grounded in the intriguing concept of a\nhypothetical symmetry that relates bosonic and fermionic particles. This\nsymmetry has profound implications, offering valuable extensions to the\nStandard Model of particle physics and fostering connections to theories of\nquantum gravity. However, lattice studies exploring the non-perturbative\nfeatures of these models, such as spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and\nreal-time evolution encounter significant challenges, particularly due to the\ninfamous sign problem.\n  The sign problem obstructs simulations on classical computers, especially\nwhen dealing with high-dimensional lattice systems. While one potential\nsolution is to adopt the Hamiltonian formalism, this approach necessitates an\nexponential increase in classical resources with the number of lattice sites\nand degrees of freedom, rendering it impractical for large systems. In\ncontrast, quantum hardware offers a promising alternative, as it requires in\nprinciple a polynomial amount of resources, making the study of these models\nmore accessible.\n  In this context, we explore the encoding of lower-dimensional supersymmetric\nquantum mechanics onto qubits. We also highlight our ongoing efforts to\nimplement and check the model supersymmetry breaking on an IBM gate-based\nquantum simulator with and without shot noise, addressing the technical\nchallenges we face and the potential implications of our findings for advancing\nour understanding of supersymmetry.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the construction of Planar Maximally Entangled\n(PME) states from phase states. PME states form a class of $n$-partite states\nin which any subset of adjacent particles whose size is less than or equal to\nhalf the total number of particles is in a fully entangled state. This property\nis essential to ensuring the robustness and stability of PME states in various\nquantum information applications. We introduce phase states for a set of\nso-called noninteracting $n$ particles and describe their corresponding\nseparable density matrices. These phase states, although individually\nseparable, serve as a starting point for the generation of entangled states\nwhen subjected to unitary dynamics. Using this method, we suggest a way to make\ncomplex multi-qubit states by watching how unconnected phase states change over\ntime with a certain unitary interaction operator. In addition, we show how to\nderive PME states from these intricate phase states for two-, three-, four-,\nand K-qubit systems. This construction method for PME states represents a\nsignificant advance over absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states, as it\nprovides a more accessible and versatile resource for quantum information\nprocessing. Not only does it enable the creation of a broader class of\nmultipartite entangled states, overcoming the limitations of AME states,\nnotably their restricted availability in low-dimensional systems; for example,\nthe absence of a four-qubit AME state, but it also offers a systematic\nconstruction method for any even number of qudits, paving the way for practical\napplications in key quantum technologies such as teleportation, secret sharing\nand error correction, where multipartite entanglement plays a central role in\nprotocol efficiency.",

Panel data and quasi-experimental methods provide useful tools\nfor causal inference in these settings.

Using difference-in-differences analysis, I show that\nthe policy increased batting average on balls in play and on-base percentage\nfor left-handed batters by a modest amount (nine points). For individual\nplayers, synthetic control analyses identify several players whose offensive\nperformance (on-base percentage, on-base plus slugging percentage, and weighted\non-base average) improved substantially (over 70 points in several cases)\nbecause of the rule change, and other players with previously high shift rates\nfor whom it had little effect.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, it is possible to scan faces and automatically register them with\nhigh quality. However, the resulting face meshes often need further processing:\nwe need to stabilize them to remove unwanted head movement. Stabilization is\nimportant for tasks like game development or movie making which require facial\nexpressions to be cleanly separated from rigid head motion. Since manual\nstabilization is labor-intensive, there have been attempts to automate it.\nHowever, previous methods remain impractical: they either still require some\nmanual input, produce imprecise alignments, rely on dubious heuristics and slow\noptimization, or assume a temporally ordered input. Instead, we present a new\nlearning-based approach that is simple and fully automatic. We treat\nstabilization as a regression problem: given two face meshes, our network\ndirectly predicts the rigid transform between them that brings their skulls\ninto alignment. We generate synthetic training data using a 3D Morphable Model\n(3DMM), exploiting the fact that 3DMM parameters separate skull motion from\nfacial skin motion. Through extensive experiments we show that our approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art both quantitatively and qualitatively on the\ntasks of stabilizing discrete sets of facial expressions as well as dynamic\nfacial performances. Furthermore, we provide an ablation study detailing the\ndesign choices and best practices to help others adopt our approach for their\nown uses.

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) was originally designed for label-agnostic\nmask generation. Does this model also possess inherent semantic understanding,\nof value to broader visual tasks? In this work we follow a multi-staged\napproach towards exploring this question. We firstly quantify SAM's semantic\ncapabilities by comparing base image encoder efficacy under classification\ntasks, in comparison with established models (CLIP and DINOv2). Our findings\nreveal a significant lack of semantic discriminability in SAM feature\nrepresentations, limiting potential for tasks that require class\ndifferentiation. This initial result motivates our exploratory study that\nattempts to enable semantic information via in-context learning with\nlightweight fine-tuning where we observe that generalisability to unseen\nclasses remains limited. Our observations culminate in the proposal of a\ntraining-free approach that leverages DINOv2 features, towards better endowing\nSAM with semantic understanding and achieving instance-level class\ndifferentiation through feature-based similarity. Our study suggests that\nincorporation of external semantic sources provides a promising direction for\nthe enhancement of SAM's utility with respect to complex visual tasks that\nrequire semantic understanding.",

    "abstract": "The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of\nsupermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena.\nHowever, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require\nsubstantial development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated\nastrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids on-board inertial test\nmasses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer\nSolar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances\nof $\\gtrsim 10\\,$AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently\nsmall to potentially achieve gravitational wave sensitivities determined by\nstochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of\n$10-30\\,$AU and $\\sim 10\\,$Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks could be\nachieved with $20\\,$cm mirrors or $5\\,$m radio dishes, although for the laser\ncase this would require lower laser frequency noise relative to the LISA\nlasers. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between\nthe spacecraft, finding that despite the $\\sim10^4\\times$ longer wavelengths,\neven a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic\nbackground-limited sensitivities at $\\lesssim 0.3\\times 10^{-4}$Hz. Operating\nin the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our\nbaseline concept requires two arms to do interferometry. However, if one\nspacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of\n$10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm.\nFinally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave\nsensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is\nanchored to Earth.",

All of these effects are of\nsignificant concern for ongoing and near-future Stage-IV cosmic shear surveys.\nTheir common attribute is that they all introduce a cosmological dependence\ninto the selection of the galaxy shear sample. Here, we show how a simple\nadaptation of the pseudo-$C_\\ell$ method can help to suppress these biases to\nnegligible levels in a model-independent way. Our approach is based on making\npixelised maps of the shear field and then using a uniform weighting of those\nshear maps when extracting power spectra. To produce unbiased measurements, the\nweighting scheme must be independent of the cosmological signal, which makes\nthe commonly-used inverse-variance weighting scheme unsuitable for cosmic shear\nmeasurements. We demonstrate this explicitly. A frequently-cited motivation for\nusing inverse-variance weights is to minimize the errors on the resultant power\nspectra. We find that, for a Stage-IV-like survey configuration, this\nmotivation is not compelling: the precision of power spectra recovered from\nuniform-weighted maps is only very slightly degraded compared to those\nrecovered from an inverse-variance analysis, and we predict no degradation in\ncosmological parameter constraints. We suggest that other 2-point statistics,\nsuch as real-space correlation functions, can be rendered equally robust to\nthese lensing biases by applying those estimators to pixelised shear maps using\na uniform weighting scheme.",

The study reveals that AI can disrupt the ideation phase by\nenabling clients to engage in the design process through rapid visualization of\ntheir own ideas. In turn, the architect's role shifts more towards assessing\nthe feasibility of designs generated conjointly by clients and AI. Our study\nalso shows that while AI can provide valuable feedback on designs, it might\nfail to generate such designs, allowing for interesting connections to\nfoundations in computer science, i.e., NP-completeness. AI's feedback also\ntends to hamper creativity and innovation by suggesting altering novel,\ninnovative approaches toward more standardized designs. Our study also reveals\nthat there is uncertainty among architects about the interpretative sovereignty\nof architecture and loss of meaning and identity when AI increasingly takes\nover authorship in the design process.",

The present article therefore aims to complement and extend our\nprevious work by discussing how the spinorial ball can be used to visualize\nquantum mechanics features.

When the magnitude of the kernel\nperturbation is small in a suitable norm, the situation is shown to be\ngenerally a regular perturbation problem when the diffusivity $D$ is formally\nof O(1) or larger. However when $D$ becomes small, and in particular, of the\nsame order as the magnitude of the perturbation to the kernel, this becomes a\nstrongly singular perturbation problem, with considerable changes in overall\nstructure. This situation is uncovered in detail In terms of its generic\ninterest, the model forms a natural extension to the classical Fisher-KPP\nmodel, with the introduction of the simplest possible nonlocal effect into the\nsaturation term. Nonlocal reaction-diffusion models arise naturally in a\nvariety of (frequently biological or ecological) contexts, and as such it is of\nfundamental interest to examine its properties in detail, and to compare and\ncontrast these with the well known properties of the classical Fisher-KPP\nmodel.",

While existing\nmethods often focus on either spatial features (e.g., object appearance) or\ntemporal dynamics (e.g., motion), they rarely address the need for a\ncomprehensive integration of both. Capturing the rich temporal evolution of\nvideo frames, while preserving their spatial details, is crucial for improving\naccuracy. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Integration and Motion\nEnhancement (TIME) layer, a novel preprocessing technique designed to\nincorporate temporal information. The TIME layer generates new video frames by\nrearranging the original sequence, preserving temporal order while embedding\n$N^2$ temporally evolving frames into a single spatial grid of size $N \\times\nN$. This transformation creates new frames that balance both spatial and\ntemporal information, making them compatible with existing video models. When\n$N=1$, the layer captures rich spatial details, similar to existing methods. As\n$N$ increases ($N\\geq2$), temporal information becomes more prominent, while\nthe spatial information decreases to ensure compatibility with model inputs. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the TIME layer by integrating it into popular\naction recognition models, such as ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, and Video\nMasked Autoencoders, for both RGB and depth video data.

    "abstract": "In multi-agent systems, agent behavior is driven by utility functions that\nencapsulate their individual goals and interactions. Inverse Reinforcement\nLearning (IRL) seeks to uncover these utilities by analyzing expert behavior,\noffering insights into the underlying decision-making processes. However,\nmulti-agent settings pose significant challenges, particularly when rewards are\ninferred from equilibrium observations. A key obstacle is that single (Nash)\nequilibrium observations often fail to adequately capture critical game\nproperties, leading to potential misrepresentations. This paper offers a\nrigorous analysis of the feasible reward set in multi-agent IRL and addresses\nthese limitations by introducing entropy-regularized games, ensuring\nequilibrium uniqueness and enhancing interpretability. Furthermore, we examine\nthe effects of estimation errors and present the first sample complexity\nresults for multi-agent IRL across diverse scenarios.",

The objective is to minimize both travel\ndistance in a route and unvisited patient (penalty) cost.

We tested the\nproposed four variants of the algorithm with the selected problem instances\nfrom the literature. The algorithms provided nearly all optimal solutions for\n30-patient problem instances in 12 seconds on average. Additionally, they\nprovided better solutions to 36 problem instances up to 36% improvement in some\ninstance classes. Moreover, the improved solutions achieved to visit up to 10\nmore patients. The algorithms are also shown to be very robust due to their low\ncoefficient variance of 0.3 on average.

However, current mRAG methods have\ninherent drawbacks, including: 1) Performing retrieval even when external\nknowledge is not needed. 2) Lacking of identification of evidence that supports\nthe query. 3) Increasing model complexity due to additional information\nfiltering modules or rules.

One of the most advanced methods for analyzing\nsuperconducting circuit designs is the energy participation ratio (EPR) method,\nwhich constructs quantum Hamiltonians based on the energy distribution\nextracted from classical electromagnetic simulations. In the EPR approach, we\nextract linear terms from finite element simulations and add nonlinear terms\nusing the energy participation ratio extracted from the classical simulations.\nHowever, the EPR method relies on a low-order expansion of nonlinear terms,\nwhich is prohibitive for accurately describing highly anharmonic circuits. An\nexample of such a circuit is the fluxonium qubit, which has recently attracted\nincreasing attention due to its high lifetimes and low error rates. In this\nwork, we extend the EPR approach to effectively address highly nonlinear\nsuperconducting circuits, and, as a proof of concept, we apply our approach to\na fluxonium qubit. Specifically, we design, fabricate, and experimentally\nmeasure a fluxonium qubit coupled to a readout resonator. We compare the\nmeasured frequencies of both the qubit and the resonator to those extracted\nfrom the EPR analysis, and we find an excellent agreement. Furthermore, we\ncompare the dispersive shift as a function of external flux obtained from\nexperiments with our EPR analysis and a simpler lumped element model.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable success in\ncooperative tasks, demonstrating impressive performance and scalability.\nHowever, deploying MARL agents in real-world applications presents critical\nsafety challenges. Current safe MARL algorithms are largely based on the\nconstrained Markov decision process (CMDP) framework, which enforces\nconstraints only on discounted cumulative costs and lacks an all-time safety\nassurance. Moreover, these methods often overlook the feasibility issue (the\nsystem will inevitably violate state constraints within certain regions of the\nconstraint set), resulting in either suboptimal performance or increased\nconstraint violations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\ntheoretical framework for safe MARL with $\\textit{state-wise}$ constraints,\nwhere safety requirements are enforced at every state the agents visit. To\nresolve the feasibility issue, we leverage a control-theoretic notion of the\nfeasible region, the controlled invariant set (CIS), characterized by the\nsafety value function. We develop a multi-agent method for identifying CISs,\nensuring convergence to a Nash equilibrium on the safety value function. By\nincorporating CIS identification into the learning process, we introduce a\nmulti-agent dual policy iteration algorithm that guarantees convergence to a\ngeneralized Nash equilibrium in state-wise constrained cooperative Markov\ngames, achieving an optimal balance between feasibility and performance.\nFurthermore, for practical deployment in complex high-dimensional systems, we\npropose $\\textit{Multi-Agent Dual Actor-Critic}$ (MADAC), a safe MARL algorithm\nthat approximates the proposed iteration scheme within the deep RL paradigm.\nEmpirical evaluations on safe MARL benchmarks demonstrate that MADAC\nconsistently outperforms existing methods, delivering much higher rewards while\nreducing constraint violations.",

This paper presents an advanced architecture for robotic action\nplanning that integrates communication, perception, and planning with Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). Our system is designed to translate commands expressed\nin natural language into executable robot actions, incorporating environmental\ninformation and dynamically updating plans based on real-time feedback.

By\nleveraging their extensive pre-trained knowledge, LLMs can effectively process\nuser requests without the need to introduce new knowledge on the changing\nenvironment. The modified ReAct framework further enhances the execution space\nby providing real-time environmental perception and the outcomes of physical\nactions. By combining robust and dynamic semantic map representations as graphs\nwith control components and failure explanations, this architecture enhances a\nrobot adaptability, task execution, and seamless collaboration with human users\nin shared and dynamic environments. Through the integration of continuous\nfeedback loops with the environment the system can dynamically adjusts the plan\nto accommodate unexpected changes, optimizing the robot ability to perform\ntasks.

We develop a\ngeneralized lattice sum approximation model to describe this transition and\nreveal its origins: the off-diagonal element of the anisotropic polarizability\ntensor due to near-field coupling, and the anisotropic lattice sums due to\nfar-field coupling. This strong coupling leads to loss-suppressed plasmonic\nresonances with large modulation depths and meanwhile extremely high measured\nquality factors up to 3120 in the near-infrared regime, exceeding the record in\nthe near infrared regime.

The backbone of our method is a\nnormal-map conditioned ControlNet which is operated in a training-free regime.\nThe key observation is that the underlying animation is embedded in the flow of\nthe normal maps. We utilize the flow thus obtained to manipulate the\nself-attention maps of appropriate layers. Specifically, the self-attention\nmaps of a particular layer and frame are recomputed as a linear combination of\nitself and the self-attention maps of the same layer and the previous frame,\nwarped by the flow on the normal maps of the two frames. We show that\nmanipulating the self-attention maps greatly enhances the quality of the\nclothing animation, making it look more natural as well as suppressing the\nbackground artifacts. Through extensive experiments, we show that the method\nproposed beats all baselines both qualitatively in terms of visual results and\nuser study. Specifically, our method is able to alleviate the background\nflickering that exists in other diffusion model-based baselines that we\nconsider.

Motivated by this, we present\nDyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token\nrepresentation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play\ntemporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging\nredundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune\nspatially redundant tokens selectively.

Among these, the quantum electrodynamics\nHartree-Fock framework stands out as an essential mean field approximation for\nelectron-electron and electron-photon interactions, forming the basis for\nadvanced post-Hartree-Fock methods like quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster\nand auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo. However, trivial quantum\nelectrodynamics Hartere-Fock (QEDHF) methods assume a product state ans\\\"atze\nand thus cannot describe the light-matter Entanglement. Furthermore, our\nprevious work on variational ans\\\"atze approaches lacked the capability to\ncapture anharmonic or nonlinear fluctuations, limiting their applicability to\nstrongly coupled systems. To overcome these limitations, we propose an extended\nQEDHF formalism by introducing a variational Squeeze transformation capable of\ndescribing anharmonic quantum fluctuations in photon fields. By optimizing the\nsqueezing parameters, our framework provides a more nuanced and accurate\ncharacterization of photon field quantum fluctuations, significantly enhancing\nthe predictive power of QEDHF in strong coupling regimes. Moreover, this\nformalism enhances the description of light-matter Entanglement, providing a\nfirst-principles framework for understanding light-matter hybridization and\npaving the way for deeper insights into cavity-modified quantum phenomena.",

Based on this\ndetermination of friction coefficient, it is possible to determine the Young's\nangle from its relation to critical contact angles (advancing or receding).

    "abstract": "Zero Trust (ZT) is a security paradigm aiming to curtail an attacker's\nlateral movements within a network by implementing least-privilege and\nper-request access control policies. However, its widespread adoption is\nhindered by the difficulty of generating proper rules due to the lack of\ndetailed knowledge of communication requirements and the characteristic\nbehaviors of communicating entities under benign conditions. Consequently,\nmanual rule generation becomes cumbersome and error-prone. To address these\nproblems, we propose ZT-SDN, an automated framework for learning and enforcing\nnetwork access control in Software-Defined Networks. ZT-SDN collects data from\nthe underlying network and models the network \"transactions\" performed by\ncommunicating entities as graphs. The nodes represent entities, while the\ndirected edges represent transactions identified by different protocol stacks\nobserved. It uses novel unsupervised learning approaches to extract transaction\npatterns directly from the network data, such as the allowed protocol stacks\nand port numbers and data transmission behavior. Finally, ZT-SDN uses an\ninnovative approach to generate correct access control rules and infer strong\nassociations between them, allowing proactive rule deployment in forwarding\ndevices. We show the framework's efficacy in detecting abnormal network\naccesses and abuses of permitted flows in changing network conditions with real\nnetwork datasets.

    "abstract": "As one of the automotive sensors that have emerged in recent years, 4D\nmillimeter-wave radar has a higher resolution than conventional 3D radar and\nprovides precise elevation measurements. But its point clouds are still sparse\nand noisy, making it challenging to meet the requirements of autonomous\ndriving. Camera, as another commonly used sensor, can capture rich semantic\ninformation. As a result, the fusion of 4D radar and camera can provide an\naffordable and robust perception solution for autonomous driving systems.\nHowever, previous radar-camera fusion methods have not yet been thoroughly\ninvestigated, resulting in a large performance gap compared to LiDAR-based\nmethods. Specifically, they ignore the feature-blurring problem and do not\ndeeply interact with image semantic information. To this end, we present a\nsimple but effective multi-stage sampling fusion (MSSF) network based on 4D\nradar and camera. On the one hand, we design a fusion block that can deeply\ninteract point cloud features with image features, and can be applied to\ncommonly used single-modal backbones in a plug-and-play manner. The fusion\nblock encompasses two types, namely, simple feature fusion (SFF) and multiscale\ndeformable feature fusion (MSDFF). The SFF is easy to implement, while the\nMSDFF has stronger fusion abilities. On the other hand, we propose a\nsemantic-guided head to perform foreground-background segmentation on voxels\nwith voxel feature re-weighting, further alleviating the problem of feature\nblurring. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadset\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MSSF. Notably, compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods, MSSF achieves a 7.0% and 4.0% improvement in 3D mean\naverage precision on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets, respectively. It even\nsurpasses classical LiDAR-based methods on the VoD dataset.",

Recent advancements have shown that modeling rich user behaviors can\nsignificantly improve the performance of CTR prediction. Current long-term user\nbehavior modeling algorithms predominantly follow two cascading stages. The\nfirst stage retrieves subsequence related to the target item from the long-term\nbehavior sequence, while the second stage models the relationship between the\nsubsequence and the target item. Despite significant progress, these methods\nhave two critical flaws. First, the retrieval query typically includes only\ntarget item information, limiting the ability to capture the user's diverse\ninterests. Second, relational information, such as sequential and interactive\ninformation within the subsequence, is frequently overlooked. Therefore, it\nrequires to be further mined to more accurately model user interests.\n  To this end, we propose Multi-granularity Interest Retrieval and Refinement\nNetwork (MIRRN). Specifically, we first construct queries based on behaviors\nobserved at different time scales to obtain subsequences, each capturing users'\ninterest at various granularities. We then introduce an noval multi-head\nFourier transformer to efficiently learn sequential and interactive information\nwithin the subsequences, leading to more accurate modeling of user interests.\nFinally, we employ multi-head target attention to adaptively assess the impact\nof these multi-granularity interests on the target item.

    "abstract": "This paper advances the computational efficiency of Deep Hedging frameworks\nthrough the novel integration of Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature\n(K-FAC) optimization. While recent literature has established Deep Hedging as a\ndata-driven alternative to traditional risk management strategies, the\ncomputational burden of training neural networks with first-order methods\nremains a significant impediment to practical implementation. The proposed\narchitecture couples Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with K-FAC\nsecond-order optimization, specifically addressing the challenges of sequential\nfinancial data and curvature estimation in recurrent networks. Empirical\nvalidation using simulated paths from a calibrated Heston stochastic volatility\nmodel demonstrates that the K-FAC implementation achieves marked improvements\nin convergence dynamics and hedging efficacy. The methodology yields a 78.3%\nreduction in transaction costs ($t = 56.88$, $p < 0.001$) and a 34.4% decrease\nin profit and loss (P&L) variance compared to Adam optimization. Moreover, the\nK-FAC-enhanced model exhibits superior risk-adjusted performance with a Sharpe\nratio of 0.0401, contrasting with $-0.0025$ for the baseline model. These\nresults provide compelling evidence that second-order optimization methods can\nmaterially enhance the tractability of Deep Hedging implementations.

We\ninvestigate how string theory can resolve this singularity. First, we study the\nstring-scale version of the static non-uniform black strings that branch off at\nthe instability threshold: \"string-ball strings\", which are linearly extended,\nself-gravitating configurations of string balls obtained in the\nHorowitz-Polchinski (HP) approach to near-Hagedorn string states. We construct\nnon-uniform HP strings in spatial dimensions $d\\leq 6$ and show that, as the\ninhomogeneity increases, they approach localized HP balls. We also examine the\nthermodynamic properties of the different phases in the canonical and\nmicrocanonical ensembles. We find that, for a sufficiently small mass, the\nuniform HP string will be stable and not evolve into a non-uniform or localized\nconfiguration. Building on these results and independent evidence from the\nevolution of the black string instability with $\\alpha'$ corrections, we\npropose that, at least in $d=4,5$, string theory slows and eventually halts the\npinching evolution at a classically stable stringy neck. In $d\\geq 6$ this\ntransition is likely to occur into a puffed-up string ball. The system then\nenters a slower phase in which the neck gradually evaporates into radiation.

We here explore a theoretical model of pilot-wave\nhydrodynamics that relaxes the simplifying assumption of resonance between the\ndroplet and its pilot wave, specifically the assumption of a fixed impact phase\nbetween the bouncing drop and its wave field. The model captures both the\nvertical and horizontal dynamics of the drop, allowing one to examine\nnon-resonant effects for both free and constrained walkers. The model provides\nnew rationale for a number of previously reported but poorly understood\nfeatures of free walker motion in pilot-wave hydrodynamics, including colinear\nswaying at the onset of motion, intermittent walking, and chaotic speed\noscillations, all of which are accompanied by sporadic changes in the impact\nphase of the bouncing drop. The model also highlights the degeneracy in the\ndroplets' vertical dynamics, specifically, the possibility of two distinct\nbouncing phases and of switching between the two. Consideration of this\ndegeneracy is critical to understanding the droplet dynamics and statistics\nemerging in confined geometries at high memory and the interaction of walking\ndroplets with standing Faraday waves.",

Furthermore, the\napproach is general and imposes no restrictions on the hidden domain or the\nnumber or arity of the predicates. The new learning method is based on an\n\\emph{efficient, novel test} that checks whether the assumption that a\npredicate is affected by a set of action patterns, namely, actions with\nspecific argument positions, is consistent with the traces. The predicates and\naction patterns that pass the test provide the basis for the learned domain\nthat is then easily completed with preconditions and static predicates.

This effort is\ndriven by a multidisciplinary interest in understanding aspects of\nself-organizing complex adaptive systems, including elements of agency. Various\nreinforcement learning (RL) models performing active inference have been\nproposed and trained on standard RL tasks using deep neural networks. Recent\nwork has focused on improving such agents' performance in complex environments\nby incorporating the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we take\nan alternative approach. Within the constraints imposed by the FEP and AIF, we\nattempt to model agents in an interpretable way without deep neural networks by\nintroducing Free Energy Projective Simulation (FEPS). Using internal rewards\nonly, FEPS agents build a representation of their partially observable\nenvironments with which they interact. Following AIF, the policy to achieve a\ngiven task is derived from this world model by minimizing the expected free\nenergy. Leveraging the interpretability of the model, techniques are introduced\nto deal with long-term goals and reduce prediction errors caused by erroneous\nhidden state estimation. We test the FEPS model on two RL environments inspired\nfrom behavioral biology: a timed response task and a navigation task in a\npartially observable grid. Our results show that FEPS agents fully resolve the\nambiguity of both environments by appropriately contextualizing their\nobservations based on prediction accuracy only. In addition, they infer optimal\npolicies flexibly for any target observation in the environment.",

However, current methods lack scalability due\nto the need for human intervention or fail to adapt to the specific context of\nthe post. A potential remedy is the use of generative AI, specifically large\nlanguage models (LLMs), to write tailored counterspeech messages. In this\npaper, we analyze whether contextualized counterspeech generated by\nstate-of-the-art LLMs is effective in curbing online hate speech. To do so, we\nconducted a large-scale, pre-registered field experiment (N=2,664) on the\nsocial media platform Twitter/X. Our experiment followed a 2x2 between-subjects\ndesign and, additionally, a control condition with no counterspeech. On the one\nhand, users posting hateful content on Twitter/X were randomly assigned to\nreceive either (a) contextualized counterspeech or (b) non-contextualized\ncounterspeech. Here, the former is generated through LLMs, while the latter\nrelies on predefined, generic messages. On the other hand, we tested two\ncounterspeech strategies: (a) promoting empathy and (b) warning about the\nconsequences of online misbehavior. We then measured whether users deleted\ntheir initial hateful posts and whether their behavior changed after the\ncounterspeech intervention (e.g., whether users adopted a less toxic language).\nWe find that non-contextualized counterspeech employing a\nwarning-of-consequence strategy significantly reduces online hate speech.\nHowever, contextualized counterspeech generated by LLMs proves ineffective and\nmay even backfire.",

This paper\ntakes an initial step towards addressing this question by presenting a\nversatile framework to identify and interpret the semantics within LMMs.\nSpecifically, 1) we first apply a Sparse Autoencoder(SAE) to disentangle the\nrepresentations into human understandable features. 2) We then present an\nautomatic interpretation framework to interpreted the open-semantic features\nlearned in SAE by the LMMs themselves. We employ this framework to analyze the\nLLaVA-NeXT-8B model using the LLaVA-OV-72B model, demonstrating that these\nfeatures can effectively steer the model's behavior. Our results contribute to\na deeper understanding of why LMMs excel in specific tasks, including EQ tests,\nand illuminate the nature of their mistakes along with potential strategies for\ntheir rectification. These findings offer new insights into the internal\nmechanisms of LMMs and suggest parallels with the cognitive processes of the\nhuman brain.",

The numerical implementation of the\nspectral element method is inspired by the related work by Engsig-Karup et al.\n(2016) and is based on nodal Lagrange basis functions, mass matrix-based\nintegration and gradient recovery using global $L^2$ projections. The resulting\nmodel leverages the high-order accurate -- possibly exponential -- error\nconvergence and has support for geometric flexibility allowing for\ncomputationally efficient simulations of nonlinear wave propagation. An\nexplicit fourth-order accurate Runge-Kutta scheme is employed for the temporal\nintegration, and a mixed-stage numerical discretization is the basis for a\npressure-velocity coupling that makes it possible to maintain high-order\naccuracy in both the temporal and spatial discretizations while preserving mass\nconservation. Furthermore, the numerical scheme is accelerated by solving the\ndiscrete Poisson problem using an iterative solver strategy based on a\ngeometric $p$-multigrid method. This problem constitutes the main computational\nbottleneck in INSE models. It is shown through numerical experiments, that the\nmodel achieves spectral convergence in the velocity fields for highly nonlinear\nwaves, and there is excellent agreement with experimental data for the\nsimulation of the classical benchmark of harmonic wave generation over a\nsubmerged bar.

Moreover, they\nstruggle to represent flat surfaces, as they are diffused in space. Without\nhand-crafted regularizers, they tend to disperse irregularly around the actual\nsurface.

The model solving heat and charge transport produced a good agreement\nwith experimental data for the oxygen content in the filament below\nTaO$_{1.3}$, the filament diameter range between 6 and 22 nm, and the gap\noxygen content between TaO$_{1.7}$ and TaO$_{1.85}$. Gap width was not limited\non either low or high sides by the criteria considered in this report. The\nobtained filament composition corresponds to oxygen deficiency an order of\nmagnitude higher than one estimated by other modelling efforts.

Our modelling results imply that a\nlarge fraction of atoms leaves and/or accumulates within the filament to\nproduce large relative concentration change.

Despite recent advancements in multilingual\nmachine translation research, the lack of well-crafted and time-synchronized AD\ndata impedes the development of audio description translation (ADT) systems\nthat address the needs of multilingual countries such as Switzerland.\nFurthermore, since the majority of ADT systems rely solely on text, uncertainty\nexists as to whether incorporating visual information from the corresponding\nvideo clips can enhance the quality of ADT outputs. In this work, we present\nSwissADT, the first ADT system implemented for three main Swiss languages and\nEnglish. By collecting well-crafted AD data augmented with video clips in\nGerman, French, Italian, and English, and leveraging the power of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), we aim to enhance information accessibility for diverse\nlanguage populations in Switzerland by automatically translating AD scripts to\nthe desired Swiss language. Our extensive experimental ADT results, composed of\nboth automatic and human evaluations of ADT quality, demonstrate the promising\ncapability of SwissADT for the ADT task.

    "abstract": "In quantum field theory applied to black hole spacetimes, substantial\nevidence suggests that the Unruh and Hartle-Hawking vacuum states become\nsingular at Cauchy horizons. This raises essential questions regarding the\nimpact of quantum field backreaction on the stability of Cauchy horizons in\nstatic scenarios and inner horizons in evolving spacetimes. To approach this\nproblem, we employ analytic approximations to the renormalized stress-energy\ntensor (RSET) of quantum fields in four dimensions. Specifically, we utilize\nthe anomaly-induced effective action, which generates four-dimensional\napproximate RSETs through a pair of auxiliary scalar fields that satisfy\nhigher-order equations of motion. The boundary conditions imposed on these\nauxiliary fields yield RSETs with leading-order terms that mimic the behaviour\nof different vacuum states. This study presents the first application of the\nanomaly-induced effective action method to Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole\ninteriors, evaluating its accuracy, applicability, and connections with prior\nRSET approximations. Among the range of possible states accessible through this\nmethod, we found none that remain regular at both the event and Cauchy\nhorizons, aligning with theoretical expectations. The method shows strong\nagreement with exact four-dimensional RSET results for the Hartle-Hawking state\nbut does not fully capture the unique characteristics of the Unruh state in\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetimes. We conclude by suggesting possible extensions\nto address these limitations.",

Using the vast knowledge LLMs have about different documents\nand content, our method creates data that reflects the variety found in real\nidentity documents. This data is then encoded into barcode and overlayed on\ntemplates for documents such as Driver's licenses, Insurance cards, Student\nIDs. Our approach simplifies the process of dataset creation, eliminating the\nneed for extensive domain knowledge or predefined fields.

    "abstract": "The RVfpga course offers a solid introduction to computer architecture using\nthe RISC-V instruction set and FPGA technology. It focuses on providing\nhands-on experience with real-world RISC-V cores, the VeeR EH1 and the VeeR\nEL2, developed by Western Digital a few years ago and currently hosted by\nChipsAlliance. This course is particularly aimed at educators and students in\ncomputer science, computer engineering, and related fields, enabling them to\nintegrate practical RISC-V knowledge into their curricula. The course\nmaterials, which include detailed labs and setup guides, are available for free\nthrough the Imagination University Programme website. We have used RVfpga in\ndifferent teaching activities and we plan to continue using it in the future.\nSpecifically, we have used RVfpga as the main experimental platform in several\nbachelor/master degree courses; we have completed several final bachelor/master\ndegree projects based on this platform; we will conduct a microcredential about\nprocessor design based on RVfpga; we have adapted RVfpga to a MOOC in the edX\nplatform; and we have shared RVfpga worldwide through one-day hands-on\nworkshops and tutorials. This paper begins by discussing how the RVfpga course\nmatches the latest IEEE/ACM/AAAI computing curriculum guidelines. It then\ndetails various teaching implementations we have conducted over recent years\nusing these materials. Finally, the paper examines other courses similar to\nRVfpga, comparing their strengths and weaknesses.",

    "abstract": "One of the most promising use-cases for machine learning in industrial\nmanufacturing is the early detection of defective products using a quality\ncontrol system. Such a system can save costs and reduces human errors due to\nthe monotonous nature of visual inspections. Today, a rich body of research\nexists which employs machine learning methods to identify rare defective\nproducts in unbalanced visual quality control datasets. These methods typically\nrely on two components: A visual backbone to capture the features of the input\nimage and an anomaly detection algorithm that decides if these features are\nwithin an expected distribution. With the rise of transformer architecture as\nvisual backbones of choice, there exists now a great variety of different\ncombinations of these two components, ranging all along the trade-off between\ndetection quality and inference time. Facing this variety, practitioners in the\nfield often have to spend a considerable amount of time on researching the\nright combination for their use-case at hand. Our contribution is to help\npractitioners with this choice by reviewing and evaluating current vision\ntransformer models together with anomaly detection methods. For this, we chose\nSotA models of both disciplines, combined them and evaluated them towards the\ngoal of having small, fast and efficient anomaly detection models suitable for\nindustrial manufacturing. We evaluated the results of our experiments on the\nwell-known MVTecAD and BTAD datasets. Moreover, we give guidelines for choosing\na suitable model architecture for a quality control system in practice,\nconsidering given use-case and hardware constraints.",

While the\nERA5 reanalysis dataset provides consistent long-term global precipitation\ninformation that allows investigations of these impacts, it lacks the\nresolution to capture the high spatio-temporal variability of precipitation.\nERA5 misses intense local rainfall events that are crucial drivers of\ndevastating flooding - a critical limitation since extreme weather events\nbecome increasingly frequent. Here, we introduce spateGAN-ERA5, the first deep\nlearning based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global\nscale. SpateGAN-ERA5 uses a conditional generative adversarial neural network\n(cGAN) that enhances the resolution of ERA5 precipitation data from 24 km and 1\nhour to 2 km and 10 minutes, delivering high-resolution rainfall fields with\nrealistic spatio-temporal patterns and accurate rain rate distribution\nincluding extremes. Its computational efficiency enables the generation of a\nlarge ensemble of solutions, addressing uncertainties inherent to the\nchallenges of downscaling. Trained solely on data from Germany and validated in\nthe US and Australia considering diverse climate zones, spateGAN-ERA5\ndemonstrates strong generalization indicating a robust global applicability.\nSpateGAN-ERA5 fulfils a critical need for high-resolution precipitation data in\nhydrological and meteorological research, offering new capabilities for flood\nrisk assessment, AI-enhanced weather forecasting, and impact modelling to\naddress climate-driven challenges worldwide.",

A formal justification for using this combination to\naccess thermal conductivity in anharmonic crystals, beyond the harmonic\napproximation and perturbation theory, is still lacking. In this work, we\nderive a theory of heat transport of anharmonic crystals, using the\nmode-coupling theory of anharmonic lattice dynamics.

    "abstract": "The red macroalgae Porphyra, commonly known as Nori, is widely used as food\naround the world due to its high nutrient content, including the significant\nabundance of coloured phycobiliproteins (PBPs). Among these, R-phycocyanin\n(R-PC) stands out for its vibrant purple colour and numerous bioactive\nproperties, making it a valuable protein for the food industry. However, R-PC's\nlimited thermal stability necessitates alternative processing methods to\npreserve its colour and bioactive properties. Our study aimed to investigate\nthe in-situ stability of oligomeric R-PC under high pressure (HP) conditions\n(up to 4,000 bar) using a combination of absorption, fluorescence, and\nsmall-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques. The unfolding of R-PC is a\nmultiphase process. Initially, low pressure induces conformational changes in\nthe R-PC oligomeric form (trimers). As pressure increases above 1,600 bar,\nthese trimers dissociate into monomers, and at pressures above 3,000 bar, the\nsubunits begin to unfold. When returned to atmospheric pressure, R-PC partially\nrefolds, retaining 50% of its original colour absorbance. In contrast, heat\ntreatment causes irreversible and detrimental effects on R-PC colour,\nhighlighting the advantages of HP treatment in preserving both the colour and\nbioactive properties of R-PC compared to heat treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: HP is a\npowerful probe that reveals intermediate states of proteins through subtle\nstructural changes not accessible by other denaturation methods. By combining\nHP-small-angle-Xray scattering with HP-absorption and fluorescence\nspectroscopy, we elucidate the multiphase unfolding process of R-phycocyanin.\nThis process includes: 1) conformational changes, 2) oligomer dissociation at\nmoderate pressures, and 3) monomer unfolding. Our approach provides new\nopportunities for the structural determination of protein intermediates and\noligomers using HP.",

While\nwindow convolution of the power spectrum is well studied, for the bispectrum\nwith a larger number of degrees of freedom, it poses a significant numerical\nand computational challenge. In this work, we consider the effect of the survey\nwindow in the tripolar spherical harmonic decomposition of the bispectrum and\nlay down a formal procedure for their convolution via a series expansion of\nconfiguration-space three-point correlation functions, which was first proposed\nby Sugiyama et al.

While they have inspired many life-enriching applications, their\npotential for abuse in creating new threats remains largely unexplored. In this\npaper, we reveal that vision-language models (VLMs) can be weaponized to\nenhance gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) in federated learning (FL), where an\nFL server attempts to reconstruct private data samples from gradients shared by\nvictim clients. Despite recent advances, existing GIAs struggle to reconstruct\nhigh-resolution images when the victim has a large local data batch. One\npromising direction is to focus reconstruction on valuable samples rather than\nthe entire batch, but current methods lack the flexibility to target specific\ndata of interest. To address this gap, we propose Geminio, the first approach\nto transform GIAs into semantically meaningful, targeted attacks. It enables a\nbrand new privacy attack experience: attackers can describe, in natural\nlanguage, the data they consider valuable, and Geminio will prioritize\nreconstruction to focus on those high-value samples. This is achieved by\nleveraging a pretrained VLM to guide the optimization of a malicious global\nmodel that, when shared with and optimized by a victim, retains only gradients\nof samples that match the attacker-specified query. Geminio can be launched at\nany FL round and has no impact on normal training (i.e., the FL server can\nsteal clients' data while still producing a high-utility ML model as in benign\nscenarios). Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in pinpointing\nand reconstructing targeted samples, with high success rates across complex\ndatasets and large batch sizes with resilience against defenses.",

While single-vehicle perception systems encounter limitations,\nstemming from incomplete perception due to object occlusion and inherent blind\nspots, cooperative perception systems present their own challenges in terms of\nsensor calibration precision and positioning accuracy. To address these issues,\nwe introduce LET-VIC, a LiDAR-based End-to-End Tracking framework for\nVehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation (VIC). First, we employ Temporal\nSelf-Attention and VIC Cross-Attention modules to effectively integrate\ntemporal and spatial information from both vehicle and infrastructure\nperspectives. Then, we develop a novel Calibration Error Compensation (CEC)\nmodule to mitigate sensor misalignment issues and facilitate accurate feature\nalignment. Experiments on the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that LET-VIC\nsignificantly outperforms baseline models. Compared to LET-V, LET-VIC achieves\n+15.0% improvement in mAP and a +17.3% improvement in AMOTA. Furthermore,\nLET-VIC surpasses representative Tracking by Detection models, including\nV2VNet, FFNet, and PointPillars, with at least a +13.7% improvement in mAP and\na +13.1% improvement in AMOTA without considering communication delays,\nshowcasing its robust detection and tracking performance.

While reasoning strategies like chain-of-thought\n(CoT) have been introduced to enhance performance, they often produce\ninaccurate recommendations due to underutilized user preference information and\ninsufficient reasoning depth. To address these challenges, we propose GOT4Rec,\na novel sequential recommendation method leveraging the graph of thoughts (GoT)\nreasoning strategy.

It enables LLMs to reason independently and\ngenerate recommendations, subsequently aggregating results to derive final\nitems. This method allows LLMs, with enhanced reasoning capabilities, to better\nutilize the user sequence information, producing more accurate recommendations\nand comprehensive explanations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of GOT4Rec, outperforming existing\nstate-of-the-art baselines with an average improvement of 37.11%.

We study electrical, optical and structural\nproperties of VO$_2$ films as well as their composition and switching\ncharacteristics as function of the VO$_2$ layer thickness in VO$_2$/TiO$_2$\ncomposites.

    "abstract": "The optimal beamforming design for multi-user continuous aperture array\n(CAPA) systems is proposed. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete\narray (SPDA), the beamformer for CAPA is a continuous function rather than a\ndiscrete vector or matrix, rendering beamforming optimization a non-convex\nintegral-based functional programming. To address this challenging issue, the\nclosed-form optimal structure of the CAPA beamformer is first derived for\nmaximizing generic system utility functions, by addressing the inversion of\ncontinuous functions and using the Lagrangian duality and the calculus of\nvariations. The derived optimal structure is a linear combination of the\ncontinuous channel responses for CAPA, with the linear weights determined by\nthe channel correlations. As a further advance, a monotonic optimization method\nis proposed for obtaining globally optimal CAPA beamforming based on the\nderived optimal structure. More particularly, a closed-form fixed-point\niteration is proposed to obtain the globally optimal solution to the power\nminimization problem for CAPA beamforming. Furthermore, based on the optimal\nstructure, the low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing\n(ZF), and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) designs for CAPA beamforming are\nderived. It is theoretically proved that: 1) the MRT and ZF designs are\nasymptotically optimal in low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes,\nrespectively, and 2) the MMSE design is optimal for\nsignal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) maximization. Our numerical results\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) CAPA\nachieves significant communication performance gain over SPDA, and ii) the MMSE\ndesign achieves nearly optimal performance in most cases, while the MRT and ZF\ndesigns achieve nearly optimal performance in specific cases",

    "abstract": "Two enigmatic gamma-ray features in the Galactic central region, known as\nFermi Bubbles (FBs), were found from Fermi-LAT data. An energy release (e.g.,\nby tidal disruption events in the Galactic center, GC), generates a cavity with\na shock that expands into the local ambient medium of the Galactic halo. A\ndecade or so ago, a phenomenological model of the FBs was suggested as a result\nof routine star disruptions by the supermassive black hole in the GC which\nmight provide enough energy for large-scale structures, like the FBs. In 2020,\nanalytical and numerical models of the FBs as a process of routine tidal\ndisruption of stars near the GC were developed, which can provide enough\ncumulative energy to form and maintain large scale structures like the FBs. The\ndisruption events are expected to be ten to hundred events per million years,\nproviding the average power of energy release from the GC into the halo of 3E41\nerg/s, which is needed to support the FBs. Analysis of the evolution of\nsuperbubbles in exponentially stratified disks concluded that the FB envelope\nwould be destroyed by the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities at late stages.\nThe shell is composed of a swept-up gas of the bubble, whose thickness is much\nthinner in comparison to the size of the envelope. We assume that hydrodynamic\nturbulence is excited in the FB envelope by the RT instability. In this case,\nthe universal energy spectrum of turbulence may be developed in the inertial\nrange of wavenumbers of fluctuations (the Kolmogorov-Obukhov spectrum). From\nour model we suppose the power of the FBs is transformed partly into the energy\nof hydrodynamic turbulence in the envelope. If so, hydrodynamic turbulence may\ngenerate MHD-fluctuations, which accelerate cosmic rays there and generate\ngamma-ray and radio emission from the FBs. We hope that this model may\ninterpret the observed nonthermal emission from the bubbles.",

    "abstract": "Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are a cornerstone of academic research,\nyet they are often labour-intensive and time-consuming due to the detailed\nliterature curation process. The advent of generative AI and large language\nmodels (LLMs) promises to revolutionize this process by assisting researchers\nin several tedious tasks, one of them being the generation of effective Boolean\nqueries that will select the publications to consider including in a review.\nThis paper presents an extensive study of Boolean query generation using LLMs\nfor systematic reviews, reproducing and extending the work of Wang et al. and\nAlaniz et al. Our study investigates the replicability and reliability of\nresults achieved using ChatGPT and compares its performance with open-source\nalternatives like Mistral and Zephyr to provide a more comprehensive analysis\nof LLMs for query generation.\n  Therefore, we implemented a pipeline, which automatically creates a Boolean\nquery for a given review topic by using a previously defined LLM, retrieves all\ndocuments for this query from the PubMed database and then evaluates the\nresults. With this pipeline we first assess whether the results obtained using\nChatGPT for query generation are reproducible and consistent. We then\ngeneralize our results by analyzing and evaluating open-source models and\nevaluating their efficacy in generating Boolean queries.\n  Finally, we conduct a failure analysis to identify and discuss the\nlimitations and shortcomings of using LLMs for Boolean query generation. This\nexamination helps to understand the gaps and potential areas for improvement in\nthe application of LLMs to information retrieval tasks. Our findings highlight\nthe strengths, limitations, and potential of LLMs in the domain of information\nretrieval and literature review automation.",

The\ndiscrete action space, such as contact point selection, is optimized through\nQ-value function maximization, while the continuous part is guided by a\ndiffusion-based policy.

    "abstract": "A kinetic model for granular mixtures is considered to study three different\nnon-equilibrium situations. The model is based on the equivalence between a gas\nof elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle\nvelocity and a gas of inelastic hard spheres. As a first problem, the\nrelaxation of the velocity moments to their forms in the homogeneous cooling\nstate (HCS) is studied. Then, taking the HCS as the reference state, the\nkinetic model is solved by the Chapman-Enskog method, which is conveniently\nadapted to inelastic collisions. For small spatial gradients, the mass,\nmomentum and heat fluxes of the mixture are determined and exact expressions\nfor the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients are obtained. As a third\nnonequilibrium problem, the kinetic model is solved exactly in the uniform\nshear flow (USF) state, where the rheological properties of the mixture are\ncomputed in terms of the parameter space of the mixture. In addition to the\ntransport properties, the velocity distribution functions of each species are\nalso explicitly obtained. To assess the reliability of the model, its\ntheoretical predictions are compared with both (approximate) analytical results\nand computer simulations of the original Boltzmann equation. In general, the\ncomparison shows a reasonable agreement between the two kinetic equations.\nWhile the diffusion transport coefficients show excellent agreement with the\nBoltzmann results, more quantitative differences appear in the case of the\nshear viscosity coefficient and the heat flux transport coefficients. In the\ncase of the USF, although the model qualitatively captures the shear rate\ndependence of the rheological properties well, the discrepancies increase with\nincreasing inelasticity in collisions.",

To measure the masses\nof the three planets, refine their radii, and investigate whether planets b and\nc are in MMR, we carried out HARPS RV observations and retrieved photometric\ndata from TESS. We extracted the RVs via a skew-normal fit onto the HARPS CCFs\nand performed an MCMC joint analysis of the Doppler measurements and transit\nphotometry, while employing the breakpoint method to remove stellar activity\nfrom the RV time series. We also performed a thorough TTV dynamical analysis of\nthe system. Our analysis confirms that the three planets have similar sizes:\n$R_b=2.004_{-0.047}^{+0.045}R_{\\oplus}$;\n$R_c=1.979_{-0.051}^{+0.054}R_{\\oplus}$;\n$R_d=2.001_{-0.064}^{+0.063}R_{\\oplus}$.

Our results suggest a quite unusual\nsystem architecture, with the outermost planet being the densest. The Doppler\nreflex motion induced by TOI-396c remains undetected in our RV time series,\nlikely due to the proximity of $P_c$ to the star's rotation period\n($P_{\\mathrm{rot}}=6.7\\pm1.3$ d). We also discovered that TOI-396b and c\ndisplay significant TTVs. While the TTV dynamical analysis returns a formally\nprecise mass for TOI-396c\n($M_{c,\\mathrm{dyn}}=2.24^{+0.13}_{-0.67}M_{\\oplus}$), the result might not be\naccurate owing to the poor sampling of the TTV phase.

To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel framework named EADReg for efficient and\nrobust registration of LiDAR point clouds based on autoregressive diffusion\nmodels.

In the fine stage, we treat diffusion-based PCR as\nan autoregressive process to generate robust point correspondences, which are\nthen iteratively refined on upper layers.

When superconducting (SC) pairing correlations are\ninduced in the surface of such a material by putting an $s$-wave superconductor\non the top, the resulting topological superconductivity gives rise to chiral\nMajorana edge-modes. A quantized two-terminal conductance of\n$\\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$ was proposed as a smoking-gun evidence for the topological\nSC phase associated with a single chiral Majorana edge-mode. There have been\nexperiments to address this proposal, but the conclusion remains unclear. Here,\nwe formulate the edge transport in a multi-terminal superconductor-QAHI\nheterostructure using the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism. Compared to the\noriginal proposal for the $\\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$-quantization based on a simple\ntwo-terminal model, our formalism allows for deeper understanding of the origin\nof the quantization. The analysis of our experiments on multi-terminal devices\nunambiguously shows that the half-integer conductance quantization arises from\nthe equilibration of the potentials of the incoming edge states at the SC\nelectrode, and hence it is not of Majorana origin.",

    "abstract": "The dielectric properties of a bulk dipolar liquid have been subjects of\nintense interest during the past decades. A surprising result was the discovery\nof a strong wavenumber dependence in the bulk homogeneous state. Such behaviour\nseems to suggest the possibility of a strong system size dependence of the\ndielectric constant (DC) of a nanoconfined liquid, although details have been\nrevealed only recently. Dielectric properties of nanoconfined water indeed show\nmarked sensitivity not only to the size and shape (dielectric boundaries) of\nconfinement but also to the nature of surface-water interactions. For\ngeometries widely studied, namely, water confined in a narrow slit,\nnanocylinder, and nanospherical cavity, the asymptotic approach to the bulk\nvalue of the DC with the increase in confinement size, is found to be\nsurprisingly slow. This seems to imply the appearance of a dipolar\ncross-correlation length, much larger than the molecular length-scale of water.\nIn narrow slit and narrow cylinder, the dielectric function becomes both\ninhomogeneous and anisotropic, and the longitudinal and transverse components\ndisplay markedly different system size dependencies. This sensitivity can be\ntraced back to the dependence of the DC on the ratio of the mean square dipole\nmoment fluctuation to the volume of the system. The observed sensitivity of\ncollective dipole moment fluctuations to the length scale of confinement points\nto the possibility of using DC to estimate orientational correlation length\nscale which has been an elusive quantity. Furthermore, the determination of\nvolume also requires special consideration when the system size is in\nnanoscale.

Previous approaches face challenges such as high computational\ndemands, training instability, and limited effectiveness with high-dimensional\ndata, potentially leading to the loss of valuable features. To address these\nissues, we hypothesize that an ideal generalized representation should exhibit\nsimilar pattern responses within the same channel across cross-domain images.\nBased on this hypothesis, we use deep features from the source domain as\nqueries, and deep features from the generated domain as keys and values.\nThrough a cross-channel attention mechanism, the original deep features are\nreconstructed into robust regularization representations, forming an explicit\nconstraint that guides the model to learn domain-invariant representations.\nAdditionally, style augmentation is another common method. However, existing\nmethods typically generate new styles through convex combinations of source\ndomains, which limits the diversity of training samples by confining the\ngenerated styles to the original distribution. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose an Adaptive Feature Blending (AFB) method that generates\nout-of-distribution samples while exploring the in-distribution space,\nsignificantly expanding the domain range.

Differential Equations 282, 2021) showed the\nexistence of unique strong solutions in spatial periodic domain (denoted by\n$\\mathbb{T}^3$), whenever the elasticity coefficient is larger than the initial\nvelocity perturbation of the rest state. Motivated by Jiang--Jiang's result, we\nrevisit the Cauchy problem of the compressible viscoelastic fluids in\nLagrangian coordinates. Employing an energy method with temporal weights and an\nadditional asymptotic stability condition of initial density in Lagrangian\ncoordinates, we extend the Jiang--Jiang's result with exponential decay-in-time\nin $\\mathbb{T}^3$ to the one with algebraic decay-in-time in the whole space\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$. Thanks to the algebraic decay of solutions established by the\nenergy method with temporal weights, we can further use the spectral analysis\nto improve the temporal decay rate of solutions. In particular, we find that\nthe $k$-th order spatial derivatives of both the density and deformation\nperturbations converge to zero in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ at a rate of\n$(1+t)^{-\\frac{3}{4}-\\frac{k+1}{2}}$, which is faster than the decay rate $(1\n+t)^{-\\frac{3}{4}-\\frac{k}{2}}$ obtained by Hu--Wu (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 45,\n2013) for $k=0$ and $ 1$. In addition, it's well-known that the decay rate\n$(1+t)^{-\\frac{3}{4}-\\frac{k}{2}}$ of the density perturbation is optimal in\nthe compressible Navier--Stokes equations (A.~Matsumura, T.~Nishida, Proc. Jpn.\nAcad. Ser-A. 55, 1979). Therefore, our faster temporal decay rates indicate\nthat the elasticity accelerates the decay of the density perturbation after the\nrest state of a compressible viscoelastic fluid being perturbed.",

However, empirical evidence has shown that the $\\ell_q$-norm\npenalty (where $0 < q < 1$) often provides better regression compared to the\n$\\ell_1$-norm penalty, demonstrating enhanced robustness in various scenarios.\nIn this paper, we explore a generalized elastic net model that employs a\n$\\ell_r$-norm (where $r \\geq 1$) in loss function to accommodate various types\nof noise, and employs a $\\ell_q$-norm (where $0 < q < 1$) to replace the\n$\\ell_1$-norm in elastic net penalty. Theoretically, we establish the\ncomputable lower bounds for the nonzero entries of the generalized first-order\nstationary points of the proposed generalized elastic net model. For\nimplementation, we develop two efficient algorithms based on the locally\nLipschitz continuous $\\epsilon$-approximation to $\\ell_q$-norm. The first\nalgorithm employs an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), while\nthe second utilizes a proximal majorization-minimization method (PMM), where\nthe subproblems are addressed using the semismooth Newton method (SNN). We also\nperform extensive numerical experiments with both simulated and real data,\nshowing that both algorithms demonstrate superior performance. Notably, the\nPMM-SSN is efficient than ADMM, even though the latter provides a simpler\nimplementation.",

In this paper, we propose to conduct Denoised Distribution Estimation\n(DDE) that explicitly connects intermediate steps to the terminal denoised\ndistribution. Therefore, preference labels can be used for the entire\ntrajectory optimization. To this end, we design two estimation strategies for\nour DDE.

The second\nis single-shot estimation, which converts the model output into the terminal\ndenoised distribution via DDIM modeling.

One difficulty is that this behavior involves different\norders of time differentiation, which leads a long-term memory effect. One of\nthe possible solutions to this problem is the additive interaction law.\nGenerally, mean field models solely use the mean values of stress and strain\nfields per phase, while variational approaches consider the second moments of\nstresses and strains. It is seen that the latter approach improves model\npredictions allowing to account for stress fluctuation within the phases.\nHowever, the complexity of the variational formulations still makes them\ndifficult to apply in the large scale finite element calculations and for\nnon-proportional loadings. Thus, there is a need to include the second moments\nwithin homogenization models based on the additive interaction law. In the\npresent study, the incorporation of the second moments of stresses into the\nformulation of the additive Mori-Tanaka model of two-phase elastic-viscoplastic\nmaterial is discussed. A modified tangent linearization of the viscoplastic law\nis proposed, while the Hill-Mandel's lemma is used to track the evolution of\nsecond moments of stresses.

In this\npaper, we tackle this problem with Schrodinger Bridges (SBs), which are\nstochastic differential equations (SDEs) between distributions with minimal\ntransport cost. We analyze the probability flow ordinary differential equation\n(ODE) formulation of SBs, and observe that we can decompose its vector field\ninto a linear combination of source predictor, target predictor, and noise\npredictor. Inspired by this observation, we propose Latent Schrodinger Bridges\n(LSBs) that approximate the SB ODE via pre-trained Stable Diffusion, and\ndevelop appropriate prompt optimization and change of variables formula to\nmatch the training and inference between distributions.

In\nthis work, we study spectral transitions and photon transmission in a linear\nspinning resonator perturbed by nanoparticles. First, we show that by precisely\ncontrolling the nanoparticle perturbations, the eigenvalues (or spectra) of a\nnon-Hermitian system satisfying anti-$\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can transit to\nthat of a quasi-closed Hermitian system. Second, we outline the essential\nconditions for constructing a quasi-closed system and analyze its dynamic\nbehavior with respect to photon transmission. By adjusting the rotational\nangular velocity of the spinning resonator and the strength of the nanoparticle\nperturbations, the quasi-closed system enables a variety of photon distribution\nbehaviors, which may have significant applications in quantum devices. Our\nfindings offer valuable insights for the design of dissipative quantum devices\nunder realistic conditions and for understanding their responses to external\nperturbations.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has led to great\ninterest in 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Existing approaches mainly rely\non full-length multi-view videos, while there has been limited exploration of\nonline reconstruction methods that enable on-the-fly training and per-timestep\nstreaming. Current 3DGS-based streaming methods treat the Gaussian primitives\nuniformly and constantly renew the densified Gaussians, thereby overlooking the\ndifference between dynamic and static features as well as neglecting the\ntemporal continuity in the scene. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel three-stage pipeline for iterative streamable 4D dynamic spatial\nreconstruction. Our pipeline comprises a selective inheritance stage to\npreserve temporal continuity, a dynamics-aware shift stage to distinguish\ndynamic and static primitives and optimize their movements, and an error-guided\ndensification stage to accommodate emerging objects. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in online 4D reconstruction, demonstrating the\nfastest on-the-fly training, superior representation quality, and real-time\nrendering capability.

Similar signals have been found in data from the European,\nIndian, Parkes, and Chinese PTAs. This signal has been interpreted as\nindicative of the presence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground. To explore the internal consistency of this result we investigate\nhow the recovered signal strength changes as we remove the pulsars one by one\nfrom the data set. We calculate the signal strength using the\n(noise-marginalized) optimal statistic, a frequentist metric designed to\nmeasure correlated excess power in the residuals of the arrival times of the\nradio pulses. We identify several features emerging from this analysis that\nwere initially unexpected. The significance of these features, however, can\nonly be assessed by comparing the real data to synthetic data sets. After\nconducting identical analyses on simulated data sets, we do not find anything\ninconsistent with the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave background in\nthe NANOGrav 15-year data. The methodologies developed here can offer\nadditional tools for application to future, more sensitive data sets.

    "abstract": "Trust and reciprocation of it form the foundation of economic, social and\nother interactions. While the Trust Game is widely used to study these concepts\nfor interactions between two players, often alternating different roles (i.e.,\ninvestor and trustee), its extensions to multi-player scenarios have been\nrestricted to instances where players assume only one role. We propose a\nsymmetric N-player Trust Game, in which players alternate between two roles,\nand the payoff of the player is defined as the average across their two roles\nand drives the evolutionary game dynamics. We find that prosocial strategies\nare harder to evolve with the present symmetric N-player Trust Game than with\nthe Public Goods Game, which is well studied. In particular, trust fails to\nevolve regardless of payoff function nonlinearity in well-mixed populations in\nthe case of the symmetric N-player trust game. In structured populations,\nnonlinear payoffs can have strong impacts on the evolution of trust. The same\nnonlinearity can yield substantially different outcomes, depending on the\nnature of the underlying network. Our results highlight the importance of\nconsidering both payoff structures and network topologies in understanding the\nemergence and maintenance of prosocial behaviours.",

To examine the impact of this variation, we\napproximate the thermal gradient by various isotherm patterns that move with\nconstant velocity following directional solidification. We report the first\nthree-dimensional phase-field simulations to investigate the effects of\nisotherm patterns on the cellular structures typically observed in solidified\nmelt pools. Results indicate that small variations in the isotherm can\nconsiderably impact the microstructural features. We use appropriate\nstatistical characterizations of the solid fraction, solid percolation, and\nsolute partitioning behavior to demonstrate the influence of isotherm patterns\non the dendritic structures and semisolid mushy zones. Consistent with\nexperimental observations, we find that non-planar isotherms produce finer\ncells and reduced microsegregation compared to planar isotherms. Also, we note\nthat a tilt of the isotherm leads to a tilted state of the resulting cellular\narrays. Our findings will help in understanding the qualitative aspects of the\ninfluence of temperature gradient patterns on the evolution of solidification\nmorphologies, mushy zones, and secondary phases, which are crucial for the\nmacroscopic description of the solidified material.",

This study presents\nan AI-driven approach for real-time species detection, focusing on the curlew\n(Numenius arquata), a ground-nesting bird experiencing significant population\ndeclines. A custom-trained YOLOv10 model was developed to detect and classify\ncurlews and their chicks using 3/4G-enabled cameras linked to the Conservation\nAI platform. The system processes camera trap data in real-time, significantly\nenhancing monitoring efficiency. Across 11 nesting sites in Wales, the model\nachieved high performance, with a sensitivity of 90.56%, specificity of 100%,\nand F1-score of 95.05% for curlew detections, and a sensitivity of 92.35%,\nspecificity of 100%, and F1-score of 96.03% for curlew chick detections.

    "abstract": "The coupling of two-level quantum systems to the thermal environment is a\nfundamental problem, with applications ranging from qubit state preparation to\nspin models. However, for the elementary problem of the thermodynamics of an\nensemble of bosons populating a two-level system despite its conceptual\nsimplicity experimental realizations are scarce. Using an optical dye\nmicrocavity platform, we thermalize photons in a two-mode system with tunable\nchemical potential, demonstrating N bosons populating a two-level system\ncoupled to a heat bath. Under pulsed excitation, Josephson oscillations between\nthe two quantum states demonstrate the possibility for coherent manipulation.\nIn contrast, under stationary conditions the thermalization of the two-mode\nsystem is observed. As the energetic splitting between eigenstates is two\norders of magnitude smaller than thermal energy, at low occupations an almost\nequal distribution of the modes occupation is observed, as expected from\nBoltzmann statistics. For larger occupation, we observe efficient population of\nthe ground state and saturation of the upper level at high filling, expected\nfrom quantum statistics. Our experiment holds promise for state preparation in\nquantum technologies as well as for quantum thermodynamics studies.",

However, the non-ideal scattering effect caused by dielectric\nmaterials can significantly deteriorate the imaging quality when using the\nexisting MIMO-SAR fast algorithms. This paper proposes a rapid, high-quality\ndielectric target-enhanced imaging algorithm for a new universal non-uniform\nMIMO-SAR system. The algorithm builds on the existing non-uniform MIMO-SAR\ndielectric target frequency-domain algorithm (DT-FDA) by constructing a forward\nsensing operator and incorporating it into the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) framework. This approach avoids large matrix operations\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. By integrating an optimal\nregularization parameter search, the algorithm enhances the image\nreconstruction quality of dielectric internal structures or defects.\nExperimental results show the proposed algorithm outperforms IBP and DT-FDA,\nachieving better focusing, sidelobe suppression, and 3D imaging accuracy. It\nyields the lowest image entropy (8.864) and significantly improves efficiency\n(imaging time: 15.29 s vs. 23295.3 s for IBP).",

To address these limitations, we propose CAP, a novel\nend-to-end one-stage framework that reimagines cell tracking by treating Cell\nas Point. Unlike traditional methods, CAP eliminates the need for explicit\ndetection or segmentation, instead jointly tracking cells for sequences in one\nstage by leveraging the inherent correlations among their trajectories. This\nsimplification reduces both labeling requirements and pipeline complexity.\nHowever, directly processing the entire sequence in one stage poses challenges\nrelated to data imbalance in capturing cell division events and long sequence\ninference. To solve these challenges, CAP introduces two key innovations: (1)\nadaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling, which prioritizes cell division events to\nmitigate the occurrence imbalance of cell events, and (2) the rolling-as-window\n(RAW) inference strategy, which ensures continuous and stable tracking of newly\nemerging cells over extended sequences. By removing the dependency on\nsegmentation-based preprocessing while addressing the challenges of imbalanced\noccurrence of cell events and long-sequence tracking, CAP demonstrates\npromising cell tracking performance and is 10 to 55 times more efficient than\nexisting methods.

Moreover, video data requires a significantly\nlarger number of tokens for representation, which substantially increases the\ntraining costs for video editing models.

    "abstract": "Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are becoming increasingly important due to\ntheir high electrical efficiency, the flexible choice of fuels and relatively\nlow emissions of pollutants. However, the increasingly growing demands for\nelectrochemical devices require further performance improvements. Since it is\nwell known that the 3D morphology of the electrodes, which is significantly\ninfluenced by the underlying manufacturing process, has a profound impact on\nthe resulting performance, a deeper understanding for the structural changes\ncaused by modifications of the manufacturing process or degradation phenomena\nis desirable. In the present paper, we investigate the influence of the\nannealing time and the operating temperature on the 3D morphology of SOFC\nanodes using 3D image data obtained by focused-ion beam scanning electron\nmicroscopy, which is segmented into gadolinium-doped ceria, nickel and pore\nspace. In addition, structural differences caused by manufacturing the anode\nvia infiltration or powder technology, respectively, are analyzed\nquantitatively by means of various geometrical descriptors such as specific\nsurface area, length of triple phase boundary per unit volume, mean geodesic\ntortuosity, and constrictivity. The computation of these descriptors from 3D\nimage data is carried out both globally as well as locally to quantify the\nheterogeneity of the anode structure.",

Existing methods heavily rely on the supervision\nof labeled datasets to extract viewpoint-invariant features for cross-view\nretrieval. However, these methods have expensive training costs and tend to\noverfit the region-specific cues, showing limited generalizability to new\nregions. To overcome this issue, we propose an unsupervised solution that lifts\nthe scene representation to 3d space from UAV observations for satellite image\ngeneration, providing robust representation against view distortion. By\ngenerating orthogonal images that closely resemble satellite views, our method\nreduces view discrepancies in feature representation and mitigates shortcuts in\nregion-specific image pairing. To further align the rendered image's\nperspective with the real one, we design an iterative camera pose updating\nmechanism that progressively modulates the rendered query image with potential\nsatellite targets, eliminating spatial offsets relative to the reference\nimages. Additionally, this iterative refinement strategy enhances cross-view\nfeature invariance through view-consistent fusion across iterations. As such,\nour unsupervised paradigm naturally avoids the problem of region-specific\noverfitting, enabling generic CVGL for UAV images without feature fine-tuning\nor data-driven training. Experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200\ndatasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves geo-localization\naccuracy while maintaining robustness across diverse regions.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of fine-grained alignment in\nVision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, where robots navigate realistic 3D\nenvironments based on natural language instructions. Current approaches use\ncontrastive learning to align language with visual trajectory sequences.\nNevertheless, they encounter difficulties with fine-grained vision negatives.\nTo enhance cross-modal embeddings, we introduce a novel Bayesian\nOptimization-based adversarial optimization framework for creating fine-grained\ncontrastive vision samples. To validate the proposed methodology, we conduct a\nseries of experiments to assess the effectiveness of the enriched embeddings on\nfine-grained vision negatives. We conduct experiments on two common VLN\nbenchmarks R2R and REVERIE, experiments on the them demonstrate that these\nembeddings benefit navigation, and can lead to a promising performance\nenhancement.

This arbitration is inherently policy-driven, defining critical\nsystem characteristics such as the spectral ordering of microrings.\nFurthermore, to facilitate large-scale deployment, the arbitration algorithms\nmust operate independently of specific wavelength information and be resilient\nto system variability. Addressing these complexities requires a holistic\napproach that encompasses the entire system, from device-level variabilities to\nthe transceiver electrical-to-optical interface - this system-wide perspective\nis the focus of this paper. To support efficient analysis, we develop a\nhierarchical framework incorporating an ideal, wavelength-aware arbitration\nmodel to examine arbitration failures at both the policy and algorithmic\nlevels. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in two ways: by\nanalyzing the robustness of each policy in relation to device variabilities,\nand by developing an algorithm that achieves near-perfect alignment with the\nideal model, offering superior robustness compared to the traditional\nsequential tuning method.

Despite their prevalence, a\nsystematic mathematical theory for finite-sized SNNs remains elusive, even for\nidealized homogeneous networks. The primary challenges are twofold: 1) the\nrich, parameter-sensitive SNN dynamics, and 2) the singularity and\nirreversibility of spikes. These challenges pose significant difficulties when\nrelating SNNs to systems of differential equations, leading previous studies to\nimpose additional assumptions or to focus on individual dynamic regimes. In\nthis study, we introduce a Markov approximation of homogeneous SNN dynamics to\nminimize information loss when translating SNNs into ordinary differential\nequations. Our only assumption for the Markov approximation is the fast\nself-decorrelation of synaptic conductances. The system of ordinary\ndifferential equations derived from the Markov model effectively captures\nhigh-frequency partial synchrony and the metastability of finite-neuron\nnetworks produced by interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations. Besides\naccurately predicting dynamical statistics, such as firing rates, our theory\nalso quantitatively captures the geometry of attractors and bifurcation\nstructures of SNNs.

In this paper, we propose Omnidirectional\nSpectral Mamba (OSMamba), a novel exposure correction network that incorporates\nthe advantages of state space models and generative diffusion models to address\nthese limitations. Specifically, OSMamba introduces an omnidirectional spectral\nscanning mechanism that adapts Mamba to the frequency domain to capture\ncomprehensive long-range dependencies in both the amplitude and phase spectra\nof deep image features, hence enhancing illumination correction and structure\nrecovery. Furthermore, we develop a dual-domain prior generator that learns\nfrom well-exposed images to generate a degradation-free diffusion prior\ncontaining correct information about severely under- and over-exposed regions\nfor better detail restoration.

    "abstract": "Current passive deepfake face-swapping detection methods encounter\nsignificance bottlenecks in model generalization capabilities. Meanwhile,\nproactive detection methods often use fixed watermarks which lack a close\nrelationship with the content they protect and are vulnerable to security\nrisks. Dynamic watermarks based on facial features offer a promising solution,\nas these features provide unique identifiers. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nFacial Feature-based Proactive deepfake detection method (FaceProtect), which\nutilizes changes in facial characteristics during deepfake manipulation as a\nnovel detection mechanism. We introduce a GAN-based One-way Dynamic Watermark\nGenerating Mechanism (GODWGM) that uses 128-dimensional facial feature vectors\nas inputs. This method creates irreversible mappings from facial features to\nwatermarks, enhancing protection against various reverse inference attacks.\nAdditionally, we propose a Watermark-based Verification Strategy (WVS) that\ncombines steganography with GODWGM, allowing simultaneous transmission of the\nbenchmark watermark representing facial features within the image. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our proposed method maintains exceptional detection\nperformance and exhibits high practicality on images altered by various\ndeepfake techniques.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis, a prevalent condition among the aging population worldwide, is\ncharacterized by diminished bone mass and altered bone structure, increasing\nsusceptibility to fractures. It poses a significant and growing global public\nhealth challenge over the next decade. Diagnosis typically involves Dual-energy\nX-ray absorptiometry to measure bone mineral density, yet its mass screening\nutility is limited. The Singh Index (SI) provides a straightforward,\nsemi-quantitative means of osteoporosis diagnosis through plain hip\nradiographs, assessing trabecular patterns in the proximal femur. Although\ncost-effective and accessible, manual SI calculation is time-intensive and\nrequires expertise. This study aims to automate SI identification from\nradiographs using machine learning algorithms. An unlabelled dataset of 838 hip\nX-ray images from Indian adults aged 20-70 was utilized. A custom convolutional\nneural network architecture was developed for feature extraction, demonstrating\nsuperior performance in cluster homogeneity and heterogeneity compared to\nestablished models. Various clustering algorithms categorized images into six\nSI grade clusters, with comparative analysis revealing only two clusters with\nhigh Silhouette Scores for promising classification. Further scrutiny\nhighlighted dataset imbalance and emphasized the importance of image quality\nand additional clinical data availability.

Although some studies have\nattempted to utilize hyper-graphs to represent the topology, they rely on a\nfixed construction strategy, which limits their adaptivity in uncovering the\nintricate latent relationships within the action. In this paper, we address\nthis oversight and explore the merits of an adaptive hyper-graph convolutional\nnetwork (Hyper-GCN) to achieve the aggregation of rich semantic information\nconveyed by skeleton vertices. In particular, our Hyper-GCN adaptively\noptimises the hyper-graphs during training, revealing the action-driven\nmulti-vertex relations. Besides, virtual connections are often designed to\nsupport efficient feature aggregation, implicitly extending the spectrum of\ndependencies within the skeleton. By injecting virtual connections into\nhyper-graphs, the semantic clues of diverse action categories can be\nhighlighted. The results of experiments conducted on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and\nNW-UCLA datasets demonstrate the merits of our Hyper-GCN, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

While\nspecialized segmentation methods have been developed for specific anatomical\nregions, their over-reliance on tailored models hinders broader applicability\nand generalization.

However, developing MLLMs\nfor ECG signals, which are crucial in clinical settings, has been a significant\nchallenge beyond medical imaging. Previous studies have attempted to address\nthis by converting ECGs into several text tags using an external classifier in\na training-free manner. However, this approach significantly compresses the\ninformation in ECGs and underutilizes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In\nthis work, we directly feed the embeddings of ECGs into the LLM through a\nprojection layer, retaining more information about ECGs and better leveraging\nthe reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our method can also effectively handle a\ncommon situation in clinical practice where it is necessary to compare two ECGs\ntaken at different times. Recent studies found that MLLMs may rely solely on\ntext input to provide answers, ignoring inputs from other modalities. We\nanalyzed this phenomenon from a causal perspective in the context of ECG MLLMs\nand discovered that the confounder, severity of illness, introduces a spurious\ncorrelation between the question and answer, leading the model to rely on this\nspurious correlation and ignore the ECG input. Such models do not comprehend\nthe ECG input and perform poorly in adversarial tests where different\nexpressions of the same question are used in the training and testing sets.

However, existing\nC-SLAM datasets do not include the various indoor service environments with the\naforementioned challenges. To close this gap, we introduce a new multi-modal\nC-SLAM dataset for multiple service robots in various indoor service\nenvironments, called C-SLAM dataset in Service Environments (CSE). We use the\nNVIDIA Isaac Sim to generate data in various indoor service environments with\nthe challenges that may occur in real-world service environments. By using\nsimulation, we can provide accurate and precisely time-synchronized sensor\ndata, such as stereo RGB, stereo depth, IMU, and ground truth (GT) poses. We\nconfigure three common indoor service environments (Hospital, Office, and\nWarehouse), each of which includes various dynamic objects that perform motions\nsuitable to each environment. In addition, we drive three robots to mimic the\nactions of real service robots. Through these factors, we generate a more\nrealistic C-SLAM dataset for multiple service robots.

    "abstract": "Channels with synchronization errors, exhibiting deletion and insertion\nerrors, find practical applications in DNA storage, data reconstruction, and\nvarious other domains. Presence of insertions and deletions render the channel\nwith memory, complicating capacity analysis. For instance, despite the\nformulation of an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) deletion\nchannel more than fifty years ago, and proof that the channel is information\nstable, hence its Shannon capacity exists, calculation of the capacity remained\nelusive. However, a relatively recent result establishes the capacity of the\ndeletion channel in the asymptotic regime of small deletion probabilities by\ncomputing the dominant terms of the capacity expansion. This paper extends that\nresult to binary insertion channels, determining the dominant terms of the\nchannel capacity for small insertion probabilities and establishing capacity in\nthis asymptotic regime. Specifically, we consider two i.i.d. insertion channel\nmodels: insertion channel with possible random bit insertions after every\ntransmitted bit and the Gallager insertion model, for which a bit is replaced\nby two random bits with a certain probability. To prove our results, we build\non methods used for the deletion channel, employing Bernoulli(1/2) inputs for\nachievability and coupling this with a converse using stationary and ergodic\nprocesses as inputs, and show that the channel capacity differs only in the\nhigher order terms from the achievable rates with i.i.d. inputs. The results,\nfor instance, show that the capacity of the random insertion channel is higher\nthan that of the Gallager insertion channel, and quantifies the difference in\nthe asymptotic regime.",

In this\nstudy, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of QNNs to patch-based\nadversarial attacks across various quantization levels and architectures,\nfocusing on factors that contribute to the robustness of these attacks. Through\nexperiments analyzing feature representations, quantization strength, gradient\nalignment, and spatial sensitivity, we find that patch attacks consistently\nachieve high success rates across bitwidths and architectures, demonstrating\nsignificant transferability even in heavily quantized models. Contrary to the\nexpectation that quantization might enhance adversarial defenses, our results\nshow that QNNs remain highly susceptible to patch attacks due to the\npersistence of distinct, localized features within quantized representations.\nThese findings underscore the need for quantization-aware defenses that address\nthe specific challenges posed by patch-based attacks. Our work contributes to a\ndeeper understanding of adversarial robustness in QNNs and aims to guide future\nresearch in developing secure, quantization-compatible defenses for real-world\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Efficient tokenization of videos remains a challenge in training vision\nmodels that can process long videos. One promising direction is to develop a\ntokenizer that can encode long video clips, as it would enable the tokenizer to\nleverage the temporal coherence of videos better for tokenization. However,\ntraining existing tokenizers on long videos often incurs a huge training cost\nas they are trained to reconstruct all the frames at once. In this paper, we\nintroduce CoordTok, a video tokenizer that learns a mapping from\ncoordinate-based representations to the corresponding patches of input videos,\ninspired by recent advances in 3D generative models. In particular, CoordTok\nencodes a video into factorized triplane representations and reconstructs\npatches that correspond to randomly sampled $(x,y,t)$ coordinates. This allows\nfor training large tokenizer models directly on long videos without requiring\nexcessive training resources. Our experiments show that CoordTok can\ndrastically reduce the number of tokens for encoding long video clips. For\ninstance, CoordTok can encode a 128-frame video with 128$\\times$128 resolution\ninto 1280 tokens, while baselines need 6144 or 8192 tokens to achieve similar\nreconstruction quality. We further show that this efficient video tokenization\nenables memory-efficient training of a diffusion transformer that can generate\n128 frames at once.",

    "abstract": "GRB$\\,$220831A is a gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration and spectral peak\nenergy that places it at the interface between the distribution of long-soft\nand short-hard GRBs. In this paper, we present the multi-wavelength follow-up\ncampaign to GRB$\\,$220831A and its optical, near-infrared, X-ray and radio\ncounterparts. Our deep optical and near-infrared observations do not reveal an\nunderlying host galaxy, and establish that GRB$\\,$220831A is observationally\nhostless to depth, $m_i\\gtrsim26.6$ AB mag. Based on the Amati relation and the\nnon-detection of an accompanying supernova, we find that this GRB is most\nlikely to have originated from a collapsar at $z>2$, but it could also possibly\nbe a compact object merger at $z<0.4$ with a large separation distance from its\nhost galaxy. Regardless of its origin, we show that its optical and\nnear-infrared counterpart departs from the evolution expected from a forward\nshock dominated synchrotron afterglow, exhibiting a steep post-break temporal\npowerlaw index of $-3.83^{+0.62}_{-0.79}$, too steep to be the jet-break. By\nanalysing a range of models, we find that the observed steep departure from\nforward shock closure relations is likely due to an internal process producing\neither a flare or a plateau.",

Once trained, our model naturally supports various extended\napplications, including text-guided texture inpainting, sparse-view texture\ncompletion, and text-driven texture synthesis.

For\nexample, the length of a buffer never exceeds its capacity. Automatic inference\nof these invariants is particularly challenging because they are often broken\ntemporarily during field updates. In this paper, we present an Abstract\nInterpretation-based solution to infer object invariants. Our key insight is a\nnew object abstraction for memory objects, where memory is divided into\nmultiple memory banks, each containing several objects. Within each bank, the\nobjects are further abstracted by separating the most recently used (MRU)\nobject, represented precisely with strong updates, while the rest are\nsummarized. For an effective implementation of this approach, we introduce a\nnew composite abstract domain, which forms a reduced product of numerical and\nequality sub-domains. This design efficiently expresses relationships between a\nsmall number of variables (e.g., fields of the same abstract object). We\nimplement the new domain in the CRAB abstract interpreter and evaluate it on\nseveral benchmarks for memory safety. We show that our approach is\nsignificantly more scalable for relational properties than the existing\nimplementation of CRAB.

Recently, Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have been widely adopted in molecule understanding and generation, yet\nthe alignments between molecules and their corresponding captions remain a\nsignificant challenge. Previous endeavours often treat the molecule as a\ngeneral SMILES string or molecular graph, neglecting the fine-grained\nalignments between the molecular sub-structures and the descriptive textual\nphrases, which are crucial for accurate and explainable predictions. In this\ncase, we introduce MolReFlect, a novel teacher-student framework designed to\ncontextually perform the molecule-caption alignments in a fine-grained way. Our\napproach initially leverages a larger teacher LLM to label the detailed\nalignments by directly extracting critical phrases from molecule captions or\nSMILES strings and implying them to corresponding sub-structures or\ncharacteristics. To refine these alignments, we propose In-Context Selective\nReflection, which retrieves previous extraction results as context examples for\nteacher LLM to reflect and lets a smaller student LLM select from in-context\nreflection and previous extraction results. Finally, we enhance the learning\nprocess of the student LLM through Chain-of-Thought In-Context Molecule Tuning,\nintegrating the fine-grained alignments and the reasoning processes within the\nChain-of-Thought format. Our experimental results demonstrate that MolReFlect\nenables LLMs like Mistral-7B to significantly outperform the previous\nbaselines, achieving SOTA performance on the ChEBI-20 dataset. This advancement\nnot only enhances the generative capabilities of LLMs in the molecule-caption\ntranslation task, but also contributes to a more explainable framework.",

While leveraging semantic information from LLMs has shown\nsome improvements in the performance of recommender systems, two notable\nlimitations persist in these studies. First, LLM-enhanced recommender systems\nencounter challenges in extracting valuable information from lifelong user\nbehavior sequences within textual contexts for recommendation tasks. Second,\nthe inherent variability in human behaviors leads to a constant stream of new\nbehaviors and irregularly fluctuating user interests. This characteristic\nimposes two significant challenges on existing models. On the one hand, it\npresents difficulties for LLMs in effectively capturing the dynamic shifts in\nuser interests within these sequences, and on the other hand, there exists the\nissue of substantial computational overhead if the LLMs necessitate recurrent\ncalls upon each update to the user sequences. In this work, we propose Lifelong\nUser Behavior Modeling (LIBER) based on large language models, which includes\nthree modules: (1) User Behavior Streaming Partition (UBSP), (2) User Interest\nLearning (UIL), and (3) User Interest Fusion (UIF). Initially, UBSP is employed\nto condense lengthy user behavior sequences into shorter partitions in an\nincremental paradigm, facilitating more efficient processing. Subsequently, UIL\nleverages LLMs in a cascading way to infer insights from these partitions.\nFinally, UIF integrates the textual outputs generated by the aforementioned\nprocesses to construct a comprehensive representation, which can be\nincorporated by any recommendation model to enhance performance.

    "abstract": "Understanding how colloids move in crowded environments is key for gaining\ncontrol over their transport in applications such as drug delivery, filtration,\ncontaminant/microplastic remediation and agriculture. The classical models of\ncolloid transport in porous media rely on geometric characteristics of the\nmedium, and hydrodynamic/non-hydrodynamic equilibrium interactions to predict\ntheir behavior. However, chemical gradients are ubiquitous in these\nenvironments and can lead to the non-equilibrium diffusiophoretic migration of\ncolloids. Here, combining microfluidic experiments, numerical simulations, and\ntheoretical modeling we demonstrate that diffusiophoresis leads to significant\nmacroscopic changes in the dispersion of colloids in porous media. We displace\na suspension of colloids dispersed in a background salt solution with a\nhigher/lower salinity solution and monitor the removal of the colloids from the\nmedium. While mixing weakens the solute gradients, leading to the\ndiffusiophoretic velocities that are orders of magnitude weaker than the\nbackground fluid flow, we show that the cross-streamline migration of colloids\nchanges their macroscopic transit time and dispersion through the medium by an\norder of magnitude compared to the control case with no salinity gradients. Our\nobservations demonstrate that solute gradients modulate the influence of\ngeometric disorder on the transport, pointing to the need for revisiting the\nclassical models of colloid transport in porous media to obtain predictive\nmodels for technological, medical, and environmental applications.",

Our analysis reveals that GNNs cannot\neffectively learn structural information related to the number of common\nneighbors between two nodes, primarily due to the nature of set-based pooling\nof the neighborhood aggregation scheme. Also, our extensive experiments\nindicate that trainable node embeddings can improve the performance of\nGNN-based link prediction models. Importantly, we observe that the denser the\ngraph, the greater such the improvement. We attribute this to the\ncharacteristics of node embeddings, where the link state of each link sample\ncould be encoded into the embeddings of nodes that are involved in the\nneighborhood aggregation of the two nodes in that link sample. In denser\ngraphs, every node could have more opportunities to attend the neighborhood\naggregation of other nodes and encode states of more link samples to its\nembedding, thus learning better node embeddings for link prediction.

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communication is envisioned as a key technology for 6G and\nbeyond wireless systems owing to its multi-GHz bandwidth. To maintain the same\naperture area and the same link budget as the lower frequencies, ultra-massive\nmulti-input and multi-output (UM-MIMO) with hybrid beamforming is promising.\nNevertheless, the hardware imperfections particularly at THz frequencies, can\ndegrade spectral efficiency and lead to a high symbol error rate (SER), which\nis often overlooked yet imperative to address in practical THz communication\nsystems. In this paper, the hybrid beamforming is investigated for THz UM-MIMO\nsystems accounting for comprehensive hardware imperfections, including DAC and\nADC quantization errors, in-phase and quadrature imbalance (IQ imbalance),\nphase noise, amplitude and phase error of imperfect phase shifters and power\namplifier (PA) nonlinearity. Then, a two-stage hardware imperfection\ncompensation algorithm is proposed. A deep neural network (DNN) is developed in\nthe first stage to represent the combined hardware imperfections, while in the\nsecond stage, the digital precoder in the transmitter (Tx) or the combiner in\nthe receiver (Rx) is designed using NN to effectively compensate for these\nimperfections. Furthermore, to balance the performance and network complexity,\nthree slimming methods including pruning, parameter sharing, and removing parts\nof the network are proposed and combined to slim the DNN in the first stage.\nNumerical results show that the Tx compensation can perform better than the Rx\ncompensation. Additionally, using the combined slimming methods can reduce\nparameters by 97.2% and running time by 39.2% while maintaining nearly the same\nperformance in both uncoded and coded systems.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional reasoning capabilities,\noften achieving state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. However, their\nsubstantial computational and memory demands, due to billions of parameters,\nhinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. A promising solution is\nknowledge distillation, where LLMs transfer reasoning capabilities to Small\nLanguage Models (SLMs, $\\le$ 1B parameters), enabling wider deployment on\nlow-resource devices. Existing methods primarily focus on generating\nhigh-quality reasoning rationales for distillation datasets but often neglect\nthe critical role of data quantity and quality. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Feedback-Driven Distillation (FDD) framework to enhance SLMs'\nmathematical reasoning capabilities. In the initialization stage, a\ndistillation dataset is constructed by prompting LLMs to pair mathematical\nproblems with corresponding reasoning rationales. We classify problems into\neasy and hard categories based on SLM performance. For easy problems, LLMs\ngenerate more complex variations, while for hard problems, new questions of\nsimilar complexity are synthesized. In addition, we propose a multi-round\ndistillation paradigm to iteratively enrich the distillation datasets, thereby\nprogressively improving the mathematical reasoning abilities of SLMs.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method can make SLMs achieve SOTA\nmathematical reasoning performance.",

    "abstract": "Entanglement fluctuations associated with Schr\\\"{o}dinger evolution of\nwavefunctions offer a unique perspective on various fundamental issues ranging\nfrom quantum thermalization to state preparation in quantum devices. Very\nrecently, a subset of present authors have shown that in a class of\nfree-fermion lattice models and interacting spin chains, entanglement dynamics\nenters into a new regime at long time, with entanglement probes displaying\npersistent temporal fluctuations, whose statistics falls into the seemingly\ndisparate paradigm of mesoscopic fluctuations in condensed matter physics. This\nmotivate us to revisit here entanglement dynamics of a canonical bosonic model\nin many-body physics, i.e., a coupled harmonic oscillator chain. We find that\nwhen the system is driven out of equilibrium, the long-time entanglement\ndynamics exhibits strictly the same statistical behaviors as that of\nfree-fermion models. Specifically, irrespective of entanglement probes and\nmicroscopic parameters, the statistical distribution of entanglement\nfluctuations is flanked by asymmetric tails: sub-Gaussian for upward\nfluctuations and sub-Gamma for downward; moreover, the variance exhibits a\ncrossover from the scaling $\\sim 1/L$ to $\\sim L_A^3/L^2$, as the subsystem\nsize $L_A$ increases ($L$ the total system size). This insensitivity to the\nparticle statistics, dubbed boson-fermion universality, is contrary to the\ncommon wisdom that statistical phenomena of many-body nature depend strongly on\nparticle statistics. Together with our previous work, the present work\nindicates rich fluctuation phenomena in entanglement dynamics awaiting in-depth\nexplorations.",

Notably, our UFD analogs exhibit a better match to the\nobserved mass-metallicity relation (MZR), showing higher average metallicity\ncompared to other theoretical models. The metallicity distribution functions\n(MDFs) of our simulated UFDs lack high-metallicity stars ($[\\rm Fe/H] > -2.0$)\nwhile containing low-metallicity stars ($[\\rm Fe/H] < -4.0$). Excluding these\nlow-metallicity stars, our results align well with the MDFs of observed UFDs.\nHowever, forming stars with higher metallicity ($-2.0 \\leq [\\rm Fe/H]_{\\rm max}\n\\leq -1.5$) remains a challenge due to the difficulty of sustaining metal\nenrichment during their brief star formation period before cosmic reionization.\nAdditionally, our simulations show extended outer structures in UFDs, resulting\nfrom dry mergers between progenitor halos. To ensure consistency, we adopt the\nsame fitting method commonly used in observations to derive the half-light\nradius. We find that this method tends to produce lower values compared to\ndirect calculations and struggles to accurately describe the extended outer\nstructures.

A generic phase boundary of gapless surfaces in a\nsymmetry-protected state shall be a co-dimension one manifold in an interaction\nparameter space of dimension $D_p$ (where $p$ refers to the parameter space)\nwhere the value of $D_p$ further depends on bulk topologies.

We construct such manifolds explicitly for a\nfew interaction parameter spaces with various $D_p$ values. Most importantly,\nwe further illustrate that in cases with $D_p=3$ and $6$, there are\nsub-manifolds of fixed points that dictate the universalities of surface\ntopological quantum criticality. These infrared stable manifolds are associated\nwith emergent symmetries in the renormalization-group-equation flow naturally\nappearing in the loop expansion. Unlike in the usual order-disorder quantum\ncritical phenomena, typically governed by an isolated Wilson-Fisher fixed\npoint, we find in the one-loop approximation surface topological quantum\ncriticalities are naturally captured by conformal manifolds where the number of\nmarginal operators uniquely determines their co-dimensions. Isolated strong\ncoupling fixed points also appear, usually as the endpoints in the phase\nboundary of surface topological quantum phases. However, their extreme infrared\ninstabilities along multiple directions suggest that they shall be related to\nmulti-critical surface topological quantum critical phenomena rather than\ngeneric surface topological quantum criticality.

In this paper, we present the first study of backdoor\nattacks on multimodal diffusion-based image editing models. We investigate the\nuse of both textual and visual triggers to embed a backdoor that achieves high\nattack success rates while maintaining the model's normal functionality.\nHowever, we identify a critical modality bias. Simply combining triggers from\ndifferent modalities leads the model to primarily rely on the stronger one,\noften the visual modality, which results in a loss of multimodal behavior and\ndegrades editing quality. To overcome this issue, we propose TrojanEdit, a\nbackdoor injection framework that dynamically adjusts the gradient\ncontributions of each modality during training. This allows the model to learn\na truly multimodal backdoor that activates only when both triggers are present.\nExtensive experiments on multiple image editing models show that TrojanEdit\nsuccessfully integrates triggers from different modalities, achieving balanced\nmultimodal backdoor learning while preserving clean editing performance and\nensuring high attack effectiveness.",

We find that the cosmological saddle dominates when the black\nholes are sufficiently large and close together. Our cosmology has a mixed\nstate version where the physics behind the black hole horizons is unspecified\nand the Euclidean construction involves a pair of CFTs with an ensemble of\noperator insertions correlated between the two CFTs. Various purifications\n(adding second asymptotic regions for the black holes) correspond to various\nways to promote this ensemble to an interaction by adding auxiliary degrees of\nfreedom that couple the two CFTs in the Euclidean picture.

The approach involves two stages, taking into account possible\nand practical features such as allowing trains to occupy opposite tracks and\nconsidering infrastructure capacity for train stops. In the first stage,\nimportant nodes within the train network are identified, considering both a\ntopological feature and passenger demand. Subsequently, the network is\naggregated based on these important nodes, employing a digital approach to\nreduce problem complexity. In the second stage, we develop an Integer\nProgramming model for train rescheduling. We then solve this model using the\nCPLEX solver to evaluate its efficiency. The first case study applies this\nmethodology to the Iranian railway, which is known as a sparse rail network.\nThe results show minimal deviation from the initial train timetable due to the\nlow frequency of trips in each block. Although the approach successfully\naddresses the train rescheduling problem for various disruption scenarios on\nthe Iranian railway, the excessive computational time required by the\noptimization model prompts us to make adjustments. Finally, the second case\nstudy demonstrates the implementation of the adjusted model in a busy test\nnetwork.

Here, we present\nthe first in vivo 4D x-ray dark-field lung imaging in mice.

Experimental results demonstrate that the Multiset Transformer\noutperforms existing neural network methods in the realm of persistence diagram\nrepresentation learning.",

    "abstract": "The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important\ninsights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault\ngouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically\ntailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about\ntheir ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general\nloading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for\ndeveloping a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the\nrigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through\nTerracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading\nconditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an\nalternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault\ngouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal\nstress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments,\nthe friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in\ntriaxial conditions and explains the rate-and-state, dilatational behaviour of\nfault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction\nlaw is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the\ncombined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and\nsubsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence\nand field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the\napproach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a\nvariety of materials.",

In this work, we combine state-of-the-art\nquantum vibrational spectral calculation, quantum wavepacket dynamics\nsimulations, and ab initio machine-learning potential to elucidate how the\nvibrational dynamics of water OH stretches can be altered by VSC. Taking the\n(H$_2$O)$_{21}$-cavity system as an example, we show that the collective VSC\nbreaks the localization picture, promotes the delocalization of OH stretches,\nand opens new intermolecular vibrational energy pathways involving both\nneighboring and remote water molecules. The manipulation of the VET process\nrelies on the alignment of the transition dipole moment orientations of the\ncorresponding vibrational states. The emergence of new energy transfer pathways\nis found to be attributed to cavity-induced vibrational resonance involving OH\nstretches across different water molecules, along with alterations in mode\ncoupling patterns. Our fully quantum theoretical calculations not only confirm\nand extend previous findings on cavity-modified energy transfer processes but\nalso provide new insights in energy transfer processes under collective VSC.",

We show that the corresponding optimization problem can be\nefficiently solved using linear programming techniques in real-data\napplications. Explicit formulas for DQ based on expectiles are also derived for\nelliptical and multivariate regularly varying distribution models.

Pebble accretion proceeds\nthrough the settling mechanism, where particles settle to the surface of the\nplanet. This Chapter discusses the key aspects of the pebble accretion\nframework: the accretion regimes, the planet initiation mass, and the planet\nisolation masses. The accretion behavior of loosely coupled $\\tau_s > 1$\nparticles, referred to as \"large pebbles\", is also examined. The pebble\naccretion probability, $\\epsilon$, is shown to be a useful parameter for\nevaluating the efficiency of the process, though this quantity is not\nnecessarily high.

However, the impact mechanism of different\ncombination spacing control strategies on mixed traffic flow has not been\nanalyzed yet. Therefore, this paper proposes various combination spacing\ncontrol strategies for connected automated vehicles (CAVs). First, a mixed\ntraffic flow model was developed to analyze the characteristics of CAV\nplatoons. On this basis, a probability model of vehicle distribution was\nderived, and its effectiveness was verified through simulation. Then, multiple\nspacing combination strategies are proposed based on four spacing control\nstrategies. Finally, numerical experiments were conducted to calculate the\naverage fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of mixed traffic flow under\ndifferent spacing control strategies, and the impact of platoon spacing control\nstrategies on traffic flow fuel consumption and pollutant emissions was further\nanalyzed. Results show that: (1) the differences in average fuel consumption\nand pollutant emissions of traffic flow are relatively small under different\nplatoon spacing control strategies under low traffic density (i.e., 15 veh/km);\n(2) at medium to high traffic densities (i.e., 55-95 veh/km), when the\npenetration rate of CAVs exceeds 80%, VTG1-CS, VTG2-CS, and CTG-CS strategies\ncan effectively ensure traffic flow stability and safety, and significantly\nreduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions.",

    "abstract": "In the inner regions of protoplanetary discs, ionization chemistry controls\nthe fluid viscosity, and is thus key to understanding various accretion,\noutflow and planet formation processes. The ionization is driven by thermal and\nnon-thermal processes in the gas-phase, as well as by dust-gas interactions\nthat lead to grain charging and ionic and thermionic emission from grain\nsurfaces. The latter dust-gas interactions are moreover a strong function of\nthe grain size distribution. However, analyses of chemical networks that\ninclude ionic/thermionic emission have so far only considered grains of a\nsingle size (or only approximately treated the effects of a size distribution),\nwhile analyses that include a distribution of grain sizes have ignored\nionic/thermionic emission. Here, we: (1) investigate a general chemical\nnetwork, widely applicable in inner disc regions, that includes gas-phase\nreactions, ionic and thermionic emission, and an arbitrary grain size\ndistribution; (2) present a numerical method to solve this network in\nequilibrium; and (3) elucidate a general method to estimate the chemical\ntime-scale. We show that: (a) approximating a grain size distribution by an\n\"effective dust-to-gas ratio\" (as done in previous work) can predict\nsignificantly inaccurate grain charges; and (b) grain charging significantly\nalters grain collisional time-scales in the inner disc. For conditions\ngenerally found in the inner disc, this work facilitates: (i) calculation of\nfluid resistivities and viscosity; and (ii) inclusion of the effect of grain\ncharging on grain fragmentation and coagulation (a critical effect that is\noften ignored).",

We first present a novel\nprotocol for implementing long-range CNOT gates that relies on a unitarily\nprepared Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as well as a unitary\ndisentangling step; the protocol natively introduces an error-detection process\nusing the disentangled qubits as flags. We demonstrate that it achieves\nstate-of-the-art gate fidelities of over 85% across up to 40 lattice sites,\nsignificantly and consistently outperforming the best alternative\nmeasurement-based protocol without introducing any additional ancilla qubits.\nWe then apply sparse stabilizer measurements to generate large GHZ states by\ndetecting bit-flip and amplitude-damping errors. Employing this technique in\ncombination with deterministic error suppression, we generate a 75-qubit GHZ\nstate exhibiting genuine multipartite entanglement, the largest reported to\ndate. The generation requires no more than 9 ancilla qubits and the fraction of\nsamples discarded due to errors grows no higher than 78%, far lower than\nprevious discard fractions required for tests using comparable numbers of fully\nencoded qubits.
