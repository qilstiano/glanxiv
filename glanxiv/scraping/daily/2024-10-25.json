This\npaper proposes a novel cooperative multi-agent reasoning framework (CoPlanner)\nby separating reasoning steps and assigning distinct duties to different\nagents. CoPlanner consists of two LLM agents: a planning agent and a reasoning\nagent. The planning agent provides high-level strategic hints, while the\nreasoning agent follows these hints and infers answers. By training the\nplanning agent's policy through the interactive reasoning process via Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO), the LLaMA-3-8B-based CoPlanner outperforms the\nprevious best method by 9.94\\% on LogiQA and 3.09\\% on BBH.

Laser pulses\nemitted from these systems reflect off objects both on and above the ground,\nresulting in a dataset containing the longitude, latitude, and elevation of\neach point, as well as information about the corresponding laser pulse\nstrengths. A widely studied research problem, addressed in many previous works,\nis ground filtering, which involves partitioning the points into ground and\nnon-ground subsets. This research introduces a novel task: detecting and\nidentifying human-made objects amidst natural tree structures. This task is\nperformed on the subset of non-ground points derived from the ground filtering\nstage. Marked Point Fields (MPFs) are used as models well-suited to these\ntasks. The proposed methodology consists of three stages: ground filtering,\nlocal information extraction (LIE), and clustering. In the ground filtering\nstage, a statistical method called One-Sided Regression (OSR) is introduced,\naddressing the limitations of prior ground filtering methods on uneven\nterrains. In the LIE stage, unsupervised learning methods are lacking. To\nmitigate this, a kernel-based method for the Hessian matrix of the MPF is\ndeveloped. In the clustering stage, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is applied\nto the results of the LIE stage to partition the non-ground points into trees\nand human-made objects. The underlying assumption is that LiDAR points from\ntrees exhibit a three-dimensional distribution, while those from human-made\nobjects follow a two-dimensional distribution. The Hessian matrix of the MPF\neffectively captures this distinction. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed ground filtering method outperforms previous techniques, and the\nLIE method successfully distinguishes between points representing trees and\nhuman-made objects.",

    "abstract": "Energy arbitrage is one of the most profitable sources of income for battery\noperators, generating revenues by buying and selling electricity at different\nprices. Forecasting these revenues is challenging due to the inherent\nuncertainty of electricity prices. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerged in\nrecent years as a promising tool, able to cope with uncertainty by training on\nlarge quantities of historical data. However, without access to future\nelectricity prices, DRL agents can only react to the currently observed price\nand not learn to plan battery dispatch. Therefore, in this study, we combine\nDRL with time-series forecasting methods from deep learning to enhance the\nperformance on energy arbitrage. We conduct a case study using price data from\nAlberta, Canada that is characterized by irregular price spikes and highly\nnon-stationary. This data is challenging to forecast even when state-of-the-art\ndeep learning models consisting of convolutional layers, recurrent layers, and\nattention modules are deployed. Our results show that energy arbitrage with\nDRL-enabled battery control still significantly benefits from these imperfect\npredictions, but only if predictors for several horizons are combined. Grouping\nmultiple predictions for the next 24-hour window, accumulated rewards increased\nby 60% for deep Q-networks (DQN) compared to the experiments without forecasts.\nWe hypothesize that multiple predictors, despite their imperfections, convey\nuseful information regarding the future development of electricity prices\nthrough a \"majority vote\" principle, enabling the DRL agent to learn more\nprofitable control policies.",

The Sparse Efficient Neural Depth and Deformation (SENDD) model has\npreviously demonstrated accurate and real-time sparse point tracking, but\nstruggled with occlusion handling. This work extends SENDD to enhance occlusion\ndetection and tracking consistency while maintaining real-time performance.\nMethods: We use the Segment Anything Model2 (SAM2) to detect and mask\nocclusions by surgical tools, and we develop and integrate into SENDD an\nAdaptive Multi-Flow Sparse Tracker (A-MFST) with forward-backward consistency\nmetrics, to enhance occlusion and uncertainty estimation. A-MFST is an\nunsupervised variant of the Multi-Flow Dense Tracker (MFT). Results: We\nevaluate our approach on the STIR dataset and demonstrate a significant\nimprovement in tracking accuracy under occlusion, reducing average tracking\nerrors by 12 percent in Mean Endpoint Error (MEE) and showing a 6 percent\nimprovement in the averaged accuracy over thresholds of 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64\npixels. The incorporation of forward-backward consistency further improves the\nselection of optimal tracking paths, reducing drift and enhancing robustness.\nNotably, these improvements were achieved without compromising the model's\nreal-time capabilities.

By delivering focused ultrasound\nwaves to precise regions anywhere in the brain, TUS enables targeted energy\ndeposition and is being explored in over fifty clinical trials as a treatment\nfor conditions such as opioid addiction, Alzheimer's disease, dementia,\nepilepsy, and glioblastoma. However, effective TUS treatment requires careful\nultrasound parameter design and precise computation of the focal spot's\nlocation and pressure, as skull heterogeneity increases the risk of off-target\nsonication or insufficient energy delivery to neural tissue. In clinical\nsettings, this phase aberration correction must be computed within seconds. To\nachieve this, commercial devices often rely on faster methods, such as ray\ntracing, to predict the focus location and pressure. While computationally\nefficient, these methods may not always provide the high level of accuracy\nneeded for optimal TUS delivery. We present TUSNet, the first end-to-end deep\nlearning approach to solve for both the pressure field and phase aberration\ncorrections without being bound to the inherent trade-off between accuracy and\nefficiency. TUSNet computes the 2D transcranial ultrasound pressure field and\nphase corrections within 21 milliseconds (over $1200\\times$ faster than k-Wave,\na MATLAB-based acoustic simulation package), achieving $98.3\\%$ accuracy in\nestimating peak pressure magnitude at the focal spot with a mean positioning\nerror of only $0.18$ mm compared to ground truth from k-Wave.",

The derived value is T1/2,MFV(HPB) =\n2.8385+0.0022-0.0075 days. This estimate corresponds to a 68.27% confidence\ninterval ranging from 2.8310 to 2.8407 days, and a 95.45% confidence interval\nranging from 2.8036 to 2.8485 days, calculated using the percentile method.\nThis level of uncertainty is significantly lower-over 30 times-than the\nuncertainty in the previously recognized half-life value found in nuclear data\nsheets. Employing an alternate approach to minimization could further cut down\nthe statistical uncertainty by 44% for the 97Ru half-life. In particular, the\nHPB method accounts for uncertainties in small datasets when determining the\nconfidence interval. When the HPB method, in combination with the MFV approach,\nwas used to review a four-element dataset of the specific activity of 39Ar\nbased on underground data, the result was SA_MFV(HPB) = 0.966 +0.027 -0.020\nBq/kg_atmAr.

At the same\ntime, the degree of lower-energy polarization is significantly lower and shows\nno more than mild variability.

    "abstract": "Pretrained foundation models have exhibited extraordinary in-context learning\nperformance, allowing zero-shot generalization to new tasks not encountered\nduring pretraining. In the case of reinforcement learning (RL), in-context RL\n(ICRL) emerges when pretraining FMs on decision-making problems in an\nautoregressive-supervised manner. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art ICRL\nalgorithms, like Algorithm Distillation, Decision Pretrained Transformer and\nDecision Importance Transformer, impose stringent requirements on the\npretraining dataset concerning the source policies, context information, and\naction labels. Notably, these algorithms either demand optimal policies or\nrequire varying degrees of well-trained behavior policies for all pretraining\nenvironments. This significantly hinders the application of ICRL to real-world\nscenarios, where acquiring optimal or well-trained policies for a substantial\nvolume of real-world training environments can be intractable. To overcome this\nchallenge, we introduce a novel approach, termed State-Action Distillation\n(SAD), that allows to generate an effective pretraining dataset guided solely\nby random policies. In particular, SAD selects query states and corresponding\naction labels by distilling outstanding state-action pairs from the entire\nstate and action spaces by using random policies within a trust horizon, and\nthen inherits the classical autoregressive-supervised mechanism during\npretraining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables\neffective ICRL under random policies and random contexts. We also establish\nquantitative analysis of the trustworthiness as well as the performance\nguarantees of SAD. Moreover, our empirical results across multiple popular ICRL\nbenchmark environments demonstrate that, on average, SAD outperforms the best\nbaseline by 236.3% in the offline evaluation and by 135.2% in the online\nevaluation.",

To address such issues, we propose\nGlobalGCE, a novel global-level graph counterfactual explanation method.\nGlobalGCE aims to identify a collection of subgraph mapping rules as\ncounterfactual explanations for the target GNN.

While traditional diffusion\nmodels suggest that individuals are only influenced by their neighbors,\nempirical evidence shows that diffusion alone does not fully explain network\nevolution, and non-diffusion factors play a significant role in network growth.\nWe model network participation and resource-sharing as strategic games\ninvolving boundedly rational players to address this gap between the analytical\nmodels and empirical evidence. Specifically, we employ Log-Linear Learning\n(LLL), a version of noisy best response, to capture players' decision-making\nstrategies. By incorporating stochastic decision models like LLL, our framework\nintegrates both diffusion and non-diffusion dynamics into network evolution\ndynamics. Through equilibrium analysis and simulations, we demonstrate that our\nmodel aligns with theoretical predictions from existing analytical frameworks\nand empirical observations across various initial network configurations. Our\nsecond contribution is a novel method for selecting anchor nodes to enhance\nuser participation. This approach allows system designers to identify anchor\nnodes and compute their incentives in real time under a more realistic\ninformation requirement constraints as compared to the existing approaches. The\nproposed approach adapts to changing network conditions by reallocating\nresources from less impactful to more influential nodes. Furthermore, the\nmethod is resilient to anchor node failures, ensuring sustained and continuous\nnetwork participation.",

The signaler agent has a random, exogenous need and can choose from\nfour different strategies: never signal, always signal, signal when need, and\nsignal when no need. The responder agent can choose to either ignore or respond\nto the signal. We define a reward to both agents when they cooperate to satisfy\nthe signaler's need, and costs associated with communication, response and\nunmet needs. We identify pure Nash equilibria of the game and the conditions\nunder which they occur.

These algorithms\nallow both agents to update beliefs about both the exogenous need and the\nbehavior of the other agent and optimize their own expected reward.

A reference extension method is used to account\nfor varying impact times when comparing states for the feedback gain in noise\ncalculation. The proposed method is demonstrated on an ASLIP hopper system with\nposition measurements. In comparison to the Salted Kalman Filter (SKF), the\nalgorithm presented here achieves a maximum of 63.55% reduction in estimation\nerror magnitude over all state dimensions near impact events.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational-wave (GW) parameter estimation typically assumes that\ninstrumental noise is Gaussian and stationary. Obvious departures from this\nidealization are typically handled on a case-by-case basis, e.g., through\nbespoke procedures to ``clean'' non-Gaussian noise transients (glitches), as\nwas famously the case for the GW170817 neutron-star binary. Although effective,\nmanipulating the data in this way can introduce biases in the inference of key\nastrophysical properties, like binary precession, and compound in unpredictable\nways when combining multiple observations; alternative procedures free of the\nsame biases, like joint inference of noise and signal properties, have so far\nproved too computationally expensive to execute at scale. Here we take a\ndifferent approach: rather than explicitly modeling individual\nnon-Gaussianities to then apply the traditional GW likelihood, we seek to learn\nthe true distribution of instrumental noise without presuming Gaussianity and\nstationarity in the first place. Assuming only noise additivity, we employ\nscore-based diffusion models to learn an empirical noise distribution directly\nfrom detector data and then combine it with a deterministic waveform model to\nprovide an unbiased estimate of the likelihood function. We validate the method\nby performing inference on a subset of GW parameters from 400 mock\nobservations, containing real LIGO noise from either the Livingston or Hanford\ndetectors. We show that the proposed method can recover the true parameters\neven in the presence of loud glitches, and that the inference is unbiased over\na population of signals without applying any cleaning to the data. This work\nprovides a promising avenue for extracting unbiased source properties in future\nGW observations over the coming decade.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Low-field MRI has been assumed to be implant-friendly based on\nlimited studies. However, RF-induced heating due to an implant is a complex\nresonance phenomenon, highly dependent on the implant's configurations and the\napplied RF frequencies. This study aims to evaluate the RF heating of DBS\nimplants during MRI at low-field strengths compared to higher field 1.5 T MRI.\nMethods: A commercial deep brain stimulation (DBS) implant was used in full\nsystem as well as lead only configurations to evaluate and compare RF heating\nduring MR imaging at 0.55 T and 1.5 T. The transfer function of the device at\nboth configurations was measured and validated at each of the frequencies,\nwhich was then used for the in vivo prediction of RF heating for realistic DBS\nconfigurations at head, chest and abdomen imaging landmarks. Results: For the\nlead only case, the RF heating due to the DBS was substantially smaller during\nimaging at 0.55 T compared to that at 1.5 T. However, for the full DBS system\n(longer implant), the RF heating at 0.55 T was comparable to and for some cases\neven higher than that at 1.5 T, reaching a level that poses risk of tissue\ndamage in patients. Conclusions: While RF heating generally tends to be lower\nat low-field MRI, the case with longer implanted leads demands extra caution,\ndue to the higher possibility of matching resonant condition at\nlow-field-strength frequencies. Thus, specific risk evaluation for each implant\nand configuration is required rather than assuming that lower field strength\nimaging is safer.",

SN2023ixf can be explained as an explosion of a massive star with an\nenergy of 0.7e51 erg, however with a greatly reduced envelope mass, probably\nbecause of binary interaction. In our radiative-transfer simulations, the SN\nejecta of 6 Msun interact with circumstellar material (CSM) of ~0.6 Msun\nextending to 1.e15 cm, which results in a light curve (LC) peak matching that\nof SN2023ixf. The origin of this required CSM might be gravity waves\noriginating from convective shell burning, which could enhance wind-like\nmass-loss during the late stages of stellar evolution. The steeply rising,\nlow-luminosity flux during the first hours after observationally confirmed\nnon-detection, however, cannot be explained by the collision of the energetic\nSN shock with the CSM. Instead, we considered it as a precursor that we could\nfit by the emission from ~0.5 Msun of matter that was ejected with an energy of\n1.e49 erg a fraction of a day before the main shock of the SN explosion reached\nthe surface of the progenitor. The source of this energy injection into the\noutermost shell of the stellar envelope could also be dynamical processes\nrelated to the convective activity in the progenitor's interior or envelope.\nAlternatively, the early rise of the LC could point to the initial breakout of\na highly non-spherical SN shock or of fast-moving, asymmetrically ejected\nmatter that was swept out well ahead of the SN shock, potentially in a\nlow-energy, nearly relativistic jet. We also discuss that pre-SN outbursts and\nLC precursors can be used to study or to constrain energy deposition in the\noutermost stellar layers by the decay of exotic particles, such as axions,\nwhich could be produced simultaneously with neutrinos in the newly formed, hot\nneutron star.",

While existing defenses primarily focus on\nmitigating the effects of jailbreak prompts, they often prove inadequate as\njailbreak prompts can take arbitrary, adaptive forms. This paper presents\nRobustKV, a novel defense that adopts a fundamentally different approach by\nselectively removing critical tokens of harmful queries from key-value (KV)\ncaches. Intuitively, for a jailbreak prompt to be effective, its tokens must\nachieve sufficient `importance' (as measured by attention scores), which\ninevitably lowers the importance of tokens in the concealed harmful query.\nThus, by strategically evicting the KVs of the lowest-ranked tokens, RobustKV\ndiminishes the presence of the harmful query in the KV cache, thus preventing\nthe LLM from generating malicious responses. Extensive evaluation using\nbenchmark datasets and models demonstrates that RobustKV effectively counters\nstate-of-the-art jailbreak attacks while maintaining the LLM's general\nperformance on benign queries. Moreover, RobustKV creates an intriguing\nevasiveness dilemma for adversaries, forcing them to balance between evading\nRobustKV and bypassing the LLM's built-in safeguards.

Leveraging the\ncomputational power of attention layers, we prove that a transformer with fixed\nparameters can effectively solve the optimal transport problem in Wasserstein-2\nwith entropic regularization for an arbitrary number of points. Consequently,\nthe transformer can sort lists of arbitrary sizes up to an approximation\nfactor. Our results rely on an engineered prompt that enables the transformer\nto implement gradient descent with adaptive stepsizes on the dual optimal\ntransport. Combining the convergence analysis of gradient descent with Sinkhorn\ndynamics, we establish an explicit approximation bound for optimal transport\nwith transformers, which improves as depth increases. Our findings provide\nnovel insights into the essence of prompt engineering and depth for solving\noptimal transport. In particular, prompt engineering boosts the algorithmic\nexpressivity of transformers, allowing them implement an optimization method.\nWith increasing depth, transformers can simulate several iterations of gradient\ndescent.",

Following Scheiderer, study of real closed spaces fell\nout of fashion and o-minimal geometry became the focus for those at the\nintersection of model theory and geometry. I decided to breathe new life into\nthe theory of real closed rings and spaces, as studied by Schwartz in 1989. In\nSection 1, I build the fundamentals of the theory using as little machinery as\npossible, and presented them as clearly as I could. Hidden gems include a full\nproof that real closed rings are closed under limits and colimits. In Section\n2, I give an introduction to the category of real closed spaces in the first\nhalf. In the second half, I construct an equivalence of topoi between\nScheiderer's sheaves on the real \\'{e}tale site, and sheaves on a real\n\\'{e}tale site $\\rce/X$ of my creation. Since $\\text{Sh}(\\rce/X)$ can be\ndefined without the use of $G$-topoi, the equivalence of topoi renders\nScheiderer's theory computable.

The framework involves two levels of methodologies: at the\nupper level, a zero-, first-, or second-order method will be tailored to\nminimize a smooth approximation; at the lower level, the high-order proximal\nauxiliary problems will be solved inexactly, generating an inexact oracle for\nthe smooth function. As a smoothing technique, we here introduce the high-order\nMoreau envelope (HOME) and study its fundamental features under standard\nassumptions. Next, introducing a boosted high-order proximal-point algorithm\n(Boosted HiPPA) at the upper level using the inexact oracle from the lower\nlevel leads to an instance of ItsOPT. Global convergence rates are established\nunder the Kurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property of the cost and envelope\nfunctions, along with some reasonable conditions for the accuracy of the\nproximal terms. surprisingly, for any KL exponent $\\theta\\in (0,1)$ of the\noriginal cost, setting the regularization order $p=\\frac{1}{1-\\theta}$ ensures\nthat Boosted HiPPA converges linearly to a proximal fixed point, which is the\nfirst algorithm with this property for KL functions.

Second, to\nsupport scalable evaluation of model generations against human-authored\nreference tables, we develop DecontextEval, an automatic evaluation method that\naligns elements of tables with the same underlying aspects despite differing\nsurface forms. Given these tools, we evaluate LMs' abilities to reconstruct\nreference tables, finding this task benefits from additional context to ground\nthe generation (e.g. table captions, in-text references).

Our approach is designed\nto achieve two primary objectives: 1) reducing communication overhead and 2)\nensuring strict privacy guarantees during feature transmission, while\nmaintaining effective inference performance. Additionally, we introduce an\nover-the-air pooling scheme specifically designed for classification tasks,\nwhich provides formal guarantees on the privacy of transmitted features and\nestablishes a lower bound on classification accuracy.",

To date, most of the models developed have\nbeen restricted to the weak-probe regime. However, fulfilling the weak-probe\npower constraint may not always be easy, desired or necessary. Here we present\na model for simulating the spectra of alkali-metal vapours for a variety of\nexperimental parameters, most distinctly at intensities beyond weak laser\nfields. The model incorporates optical pumping effects and transit-time\nbroadening. We test the performance of the model by performing spectroscopy of\nRb-87 in a magnetic field of 0.6 T, where isolated atomic resonances can be\naddressed. We find very good agreement between the model and data for three\ndifferent beam diameters and a variation of intensity of over five orders of\nmagnitude. The non-overlapping absorption lines allow us to differentiate the\nsaturation behaviour of open and closed transitions. While our model was only\nexperimentally verified for the D2 line of rubidium, the software is also\ncapable of simulating spectra of rubidium, sodium, potassium and caesium over\nboth D lines.",

    "abstract": "Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGN) may\nbe major sources of astrophysical gravitational waves (GWs), contributing both\nto the observed LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA population of binary BH mergers and to future\npopulations of LISA-band extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The ability of\nthese BHs to pair up into binaries, inspiral, and produce GWs will be shaped by\nthe existence of migration traps, regions in the AGN where hydrodynamic torques\nvanish. Previous works have studied the existence and location of migration\ntraps in AGN disks. Here, we investigate how individual BHs may escape such\ntraps as an outcome of mergers, potentially suppressing hierarchical growth. We\nfind that while GW recoil kicks are strong enough to kick merged BHs onto\ninclined orbits, gas drag quickly realigns them into the AGN disk. A more\nrobust escape mechanism is gap opening: once a BH grows above a critical mass,\nits gravity disturbs the AGN gas sufficiently to eliminate the trap. In\nlow-mass AGN relevant for LISA, gaps open easily and the resulting ``wet EMRI''\nmasses are unlikely to reflect protracted hierarchical mergers. In combination\nwith our previous work, we find that migration traps only exist in a relatively\nnarrow range of AGN luminosities between [10^{43.5},10^{45.5}] erg/s. We\nidentify an even narrower AGN luminosity range for which stellar mass BHs can\ngrow into the pair instability mass gap and beyond. This characteristic\nluminosity scale may assist in indirect tests of the ``AGN channel'' for binary\nBH mergers.",

Due to the exponential\nincrease of parameters in the system size and due to experimental imperfections\nthis task can be challenging in quantum many-body settings.

In this way, we can engineer target\nHamiltonians that are only limited by the locality of the Pauli terms in the\nsystem Hamiltonian. Based on average Hamiltonian theory and by using robust\ncomposite pulses, we make our schemes robust against errors including finite\npulse time errors and various calibration errors.

We expect the X-ray point-source populations are dominated by X-ray\nbinaries (XRBs), with contributions from supernova remnants near the low\nluminosity end of our observations. Our framework is calibrated using the\ncollective statistical power of 3,731 X-ray detected point-sources within 88\nChandra-observed galaxies at $D <$ 40 Mpc that span broad ranges of metallicity\n($Z \\approx$ 0.03-2 $Z_\\odot$), SFH, and morphology (dwarf irregulars,\nlate-types, and early-types). Our best-fitting models indicate that the XLF\nnormalization per unit stellar mass declines by $\\approx$2-3 dex from 10 Myr to\n10 Gyr, with a slower age decline for low-metallicity populations. The shape of\nthe XLF for luminous X-ray sources ($L < 10^{38}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) significantly\nsteepens with increasing age and metallicity, while the lower-luminosity XLF\nappears to flatten with increasing age. Integration of our models provide\npredictions for X-ray scaling relations that agree very well with past results\npresented in the literature, including, e.g., the $L_{\\rm X}$-SFR-$Z$ relation\nfor high-mass XRBs (HMXBs) in young stellar populations as well as the $L_{\\rm\nX}/M_\\star$ ratio observed in early-type galaxies that harbor old populations\nof low-mass XRBs (LMXBs).

We conduct rigorous ablations to\nempirically prove the success of FISHNET, each agent's importance, and the\noptimized performance of assembling all agents. Our modular architecture can be\nleveraged for a myriad of use-cases, enabling scalability, flexibility, and\ndata integrity that are critical for financial tasks.",

With an active data\ncollection strategy, we establish an error convergence rate in terms of the\ndecay rate of the eigenvalues of the covariance kernel. We can achieve\narbitrarily fast error convergence rates with sufficiently rapid eigenvalue\ndecay of the covariance kernels. This contrasts with the passive (i.i.d.) data\ncollection strategies, where the convergence rate is never faster than linear\ndecay ($\\sim n^{-1}$). In fact, for our setting, we show a \\emph{non-vanishing}\nlower bound for any passive data collection strategy, regardless of the\neigenvalues decay rate of the covariance kernel.

    "abstract": "The path integral of 4D Einstein-Hilbert gravity for the de Sitter-like\nUniverse with fluctuations is investigated, and the transition amplitude from\none boundary configuration to another is computed. The gravitational system is\ndescribed by lapse, scale factor and metric-fluctuation field. Variational\nconsistency demands augmenting the bulk theory with suitable boundary action. A\ngiven boundary choice on scale factor is seen to be achievable via an infinite\nfamily of covariant boundary actions, each restricting the boundary choices for\nthe fluctuation field. General covariance intimately ties the two boundary\nchoices, which no longer can be chosen independently. For vanishing metric\nfluctuations at the boundaries, the gauge-fixed gravitational path integral\ndisintegrates into path integral over scale factor and metric-fluctuation\nfield, connected via only lapse integration. While the former is exactly\ndoable, the latter is computed up to one loop, leading to one-loop corrected\nlapse action. Ultraviolet (UV) divergences are systematically extracted and\nremoved by the addition of suitable counterterms, leading to finite effective\naction for the lapse. The lapse effective action is then utilized for computing\nfinite transition amplitude. Contributions from virtual gravitons are seen to\nbe secularly growing with Universe size, leading to an infrared divergent\ntransition amplitude. The presence of nonvanishing metric fluctuation at the\nboundaries implies that the ``no-boundary'' saddles of the theory without\nmetric fluctuations are no longer the saddles of the one-loop corrected action.\nThe corrected saddles have the Universe starting from a nonzero size.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine Agreement (BA) considers a setting of $n$ parties, out of which up\nto $t$ can exhibit byzantine (malicious) behavior. Honest parties must decide\non a common value (agreement), which must belong to a set determined by the\nhonest inputs (validity). Depending on the use case, this set can grow or\nshrink, leading to various possible desiderata collectively known as validity\nconditions. Varying the validity property requirement can affect the regime\nunder which BA is solvable.\n  Our work investigates how the selected validity property impacts BA\nsolvability in the network-agnostic model, where the network can either be\nsynchronous with up to $t_s$ byzantine parties or asynchronous with up to $t_a\n\\leq t_s$ byzantine parties. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a\nvalidity property to render BA solvable, both for the case with cryptographic\nsetup and for the one without. This traces the precise boundary of solvability\nin the network-agnostic model for every validity property. Our proof of\nsufficiency provides a universal protocol, that achieves BA for a given\nvalidity property whenever the provided conditions are satisfied.\n  We note that, for any non-trivial validity property, the condition $2 \\cdot\nt_s + t_a < n$ is necessary for BA to be solvable, even with cryptographic\nsetup. Specializing this claim to $t_a = 0$ gives that $t < n / 2$ is required\nwhenever one expects a purely synchronous protocol to also work in an\nasynchronous network when there are no corruptions. This is especially\nsurprising given that, for some validity properties, $t < n$ is a sufficient\ncondition without the last stipulation.",

We examine various non-invasive\nindicators of cognitive decline, including speech and language, facial, and\nmotoric mobility. The paper provides an overview of relevant datasets,\nfeature-extracting techniques, and deep-learning architectures applied to this\ndomain. We have analyzed the performance of different methods across modalities\nand observed that speech and language-based methods generally achieved the\nhighest detection performance. Studies combining acoustic and linguistic\nfeatures tended to outperform those using a single modality. Facial analysis\nmethods showed promise for visual modalities but were less extensively studied.\nMost papers focused on binary classification (impaired vs. non-impaired), with\nfewer addressing multi-class or regression tasks. Transfer learning and\npre-trained language models emerged as popular and effective techniques,\nespecially for linguistic analysis. Despite significant progress, several\nchallenges remain, including data standardization and accessibility, model\nexplainability, longitudinal analysis limitations, and clinical adaptation.\nLastly, we propose future research directions, such as investigating\nlanguage-agnostic speech analysis methods, developing multi-modal diagnostic\nsystems, and addressing ethical considerations in AI-assisted healthcare.

In this study, we investigate how neural networks evolve to\ncontrol agents' behavior in a dynamic environment, focusing on the relationship\nbetween the network's complexity and collective behavior patterns. By\nperforming quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that the\ndegree of network non-linearity correlates with the complexity of emergent\nbehaviors. Simpler behaviors, such as lane formation and laminar flow, are\ncharacterized by more linear network operations, while complex behaviors like\nswarming and flocking show highly non-linear neural processing. Moreover,\nspecific environmental parameters, such as moderate noise, broader field of\nview, and lower agent density, promote the evolution of non-linear networks\nthat drive richer, more intricate collective behaviors. These results highlight\nthe importance of tuning evolutionary conditions to induce desired behaviors in\nmulti-agent systems, offering new pathways for optimizing coordination in\nautonomous swarms.

Our study focuses on reconstructing\nthe functional form of the Einstein-Aether Lagrangian component $F(K)$ from\nthese phenomenological dark energy models. Model parameters are constrained\nusing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach based on multiple datasets,\nincluding cosmic chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the\nPantheon+SH0ES compilation. Using best-fit parameters, we analyze various\ncosmological diagnostics: Hubble and deceleration parameter evolution, dark\nenergy equation of state $\\omega_{DE}$, density parameter trajectories,\n$\\omega'_{DE}$--$\\omega_{DE}$ phase space behavior, statefinder diagnostics\n$(r,s^*)$ and $(r,q)$, and Om(z) trajectories. Both models exhibit late-time\nacceleration, with the dark energy sector showing a quintessence-like nature in\nthe current epoch and evolving toward a phantom regime in the future. Stability\nanalysis based on the squared sound speed $v_s^2$ highlights partial\nepoch-dependent stability. While our results demonstrate reasonable agreement\nwith observational data and reveal physically plausible dynamics, the models do\nnot yet offer a fundamentally superior alternative to other dark energy\nreconstructions. Nonetheless, their behavior under modified entropy assumptions\nand their flexibility in dynamical diagnostics provide a useful framework for\nprobing non-standard extensions of Einstein-Aether gravity and dark energy\nphenomenology.",

Unsupervised\nenvironment design (UED) has recently emerged to address this issue by\ngenerating a set of training environments tailored to the agent's capabilities.\nWhile prior works demonstrate that UED has the potential to learn a robust\npolicy, their performance is constrained by the capabilities of the environment\ngeneration. To this end, we propose a novel UED algorithm, adversarial\nenvironment design via regret-guided diffusion models (ADD). The proposed\nmethod guides the diffusion-based environment generator with the regret of the\nagent to produce environments that the agent finds challenging but conducive to\nfurther improvement. By exploiting the representation power of diffusion\nmodels, ADD can directly generate adversarial environments while maintaining\nthe diversity of training environments, enabling the agent to effectively learn\na robust policy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\nsuccessfully generates an instructive curriculum of environments, outperforming\nUED baselines in zero-shot generalization across novel, out-of-distribution\nenvironments.

To make Thompson\nsampling more reliable, we want to make it robust against adversarial reward\npoisoning. The main challenge is that one can no longer compute the actual\nposteriors for the true reward, as the agent can only observe the rewards after\ncorruption.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the inclusion of microservices architecture in the\ndevelopment of scalable and reliable airline reservation systems. Most of the\ntraditional reservation systems are very rigid and centralized which makes them\nprone to bottlenecks and a single point of failure. As such, systems do not\nmeet the requirements of modern airlines which are dynamic. Microservices offer\nbetter resiliency and scalability because the services do not depend on one\nanother and can be deployed independently. The approach is grounded on the\nCircuit Breaker Pattern to maintain fault tolerance while consuming foreign\nresources such as flight APIs and payment systems. This avoided the failure\npropagation to the systems by 60% enabling the systems to function under\nexternal failures. Traffic rerouting also bolstered this with a guarantee of\nabove 99.95% uptime in systems where high availability was demanded. To address\nthis, load balancing was used, particularly the Round-Robin method which\nmanaged to enhance performance by 35% through the equal distribution of user\nrequests among the service instances. Health checks, as well as monitoring in\nreal-time, helped as well with failure management as they helped to contain\nfailures before the users of the system were affected. The results suggest that\nthe use of microservices led to a 40% increase in system scalability, a 50%\ndecrease in downtime and a support for 30% more concurrent users than the use\nof monolithic architectures.

    "abstract": "It has been observed that flattening the mean velocity profile of pipe flow\nby body force can laminarise turbulence, a promising means to reduce frictional\ndrag substantially. To explore whether there is a more efficient body force to\neliminate turbulence, we consider time-independent active body forces with\nvarying spatial dependencies. Results confirm that when using an active force,\na flattened forced laminar profile is needed to eliminate turbulence, and that\na purely streamwise body force is best for laminarisation. While these results\nrequired an expensive nonlinear optimisation, it was also observed that the\noptimal forced profile exhibits reduced linear transient growth (TG). To\ndetermine whether the reduction of linear TG alone is a sufficient target for\nthe laminarisation of turbulence, a linear Lagrange Multiplier technique is\nused to minimise TG of perturbations to the forced laminar profile. The optimal\nvelocity profiles reveal that TG for each azimuthal wavenumber strongly depends\non the radial velocity gradient at some specific radial interval. The optimal\nvelocity profile obtained by minimising TG of perturbations of azimuthal\nwavenumber m = 1 is shown to be able to eliminate turbulence at Re = 2400, but\na more effective reduction of TG, including perturbations of higher m, is\nneeded for laminarisation at higher Reynolds number Re = 3000. The streaks\nformed with the flattened forced laminar profile reveal the mechanism of\nlaminarisation: it is found that the lift-up mechanism in the more flattened\nforced laminar profile creates a lower streak (i.e. closer to the wall) that is\nmore stable, so that turbulence is harder to maintain through streak\ninstability. Further numerical experiments by disturbing a periodic orbit\nvalidated that the breakdown of turbulence self-sustaining mechanisms is mainly\ncaused by suppression of the formation of streaks.",

While the tightest-orbit binaries\nshould host the most dynamically stable and long-lived circumbinary planetary\nsystems, they are also the systems that are expected to experience mass\ntransfer, common envelope evolution, or stellar mergers. In this study, we\nexplore the effect of stable non-conservative mass transfer on the dynamical\nevolution of circumbinary planets. We present a new script that seamlessly\nintegrates binary evolution data from the 1D binary stellar evolution code MESA\ninto the N-body simulation code REBOUND. This integration framework enables a\ncomprehensive examination of the dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets\norbiting mass-transferring binaries, while simultaneously accounting for the\ndetailed stellar structure evolution. In addition, we introduce a recalibration\nmethod to mitigate numerical errors from updates of binary properties during\nthe system's dynamical evolution. We construct a reference binary model in\nwhich a $2.21\\, M_\\odot$ star loses its hydrogen-rich envelope through\nnon-conservative mass transfer to the $1.76\\, M_\\odot$ companion star, creating\na $0.38\\,M_\\odot$ subdwarf. We find the tightest stable orbital separation for\ncircumbinary planets to be $\\simeq 2.5$ times the binary separation after mass\ntransfer. Accounting for tides by using the interior stellar structure, we find\nthat tidal effects become apparent after the rapid mass transfer phase and\nstart to fade away during the latter stage of the slow mass transfer phase. Our\nresearch provides a new framework for exploring circumbinary planet dynamics in\ninteracting binary systems.",

However, the enormous size of\nLLMs poses significant challenges in terms of computational complexity and\nresource requirements. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising\nsolution. However, there exists a gap between the practical performance of\nlow-rank adaptations and its theoretical optimum. In this work, we propose\neXtreme Gradient Boosting LoRA (XGBLoRA), a novel framework that bridges this\ngap by leveraging the power of ensemble learning. Inspired by gradient\nboosting, XGBLoRA iteratively learns and merges a sequence of LoRA adaptations\nto refine model predictions. It achieves better performance than the standard\nLoRA, while enjoying the computational efficiency of rank-1 adaptations. We\nprovide theoretical analysis to show the convergence and optimality of our\napproach, and conduct extensive experiments on a range of natural language\nprocessing tasks. The results demonstrate that XGBLoRA consistently outperforms\nstandard LoRA and achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning with\nsignificantly fewer trainable parameters.

This paper proposes\nthe use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to develop agents who play a card\ngame, Hearthstone, by optimizing a data-driven decision-making mechanism that\ntakes into account all the elements currently in play. Agents feature\nself-learning by means of a competitive coevolutionary training approach,\nwhereby no external sparring element defined by the user is required for the\noptimization process. One of the agents developed through the proposed approach\nwas runner-up (best 6%) in an international Hearthstone Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) competition. Our proposal performed remarkably well, even when it faced\nstate-of-the-art techniques that attempted to take into account future game\nstates, such as Monte-Carlo Tree search. This outcome shows how evolutionary\ncomputation could represent a considerable advantage in developing AIs for\ncollectible card games such as Hearthstone.",

The latest methods learn\nneural SDFs using either a data-driven based or an overfitting-based strategy.\nHowever, these two kinds of methods are with either poor generalization or slow\nconvergence, which limits their capability under challenging scenarios like\nhighly noisy point clouds. To resolve this issue, we propose a method to\npromote pros of both data-driven based and overfitting-based methods for better\ngeneralization, faster inference, and higher accuracy in learning neural SDFs.\nWe introduce a novel statistical reasoning algorithm in local regions which is\nable to finetune data-driven based priors without signed distance supervision,\nclean point cloud, or point normals. This helps our method start with a good\ninitialization, and converge to a minimum in a much faster way.

During the event, SolO and PSP were located at\na similar radial distance of ~0.7 au and were separated by $\\sim$60$^\\circ$ in\nlongitude. The footpoints of both PSP and SolO were west of the flare region\nbut the former was much closer (18$^\\circ$ vs 80$^\\circ$). Such a distribution\nof observers is ideal for studying the longitudinal dependence of the ion\ncomposition with the minimum transport effects of particles along the radial\ndirection. We focus on H, He, O, and Fe measured by both spacecraft in sunward\nand anti-sunward directions. Their spectra are in a double power-law shape,\nwhich is fitted best by the Band function. Notably, the event was Fe-rich at\nPSP, where the mean Fe/O ratio at energies of 0.1 - 10 Mev/nuc was 0.48, higher\nthan the average Fe/O ratio in previous large SEP events. In contrast, the mean\nFe/O ratio at SolO over the same energy range was considerable lower at 0.08.\nThe Fe/O ratio between 0.5 and 10 MeV/nuc at both spacecraft is nearly\nconstant. Although the He/H ratio shows energy dependence, decreasing with\nincreasing energy, the He/H ratio at PSP is still about twice as high as that\nat SolO. Such a strong longitudinal dependence of element abundances and the\nFe-rich component in the PSP data could be attributed to the direct flare\ncontribution. Moreover, the temporal profiles indicate that differences in the\nFe/O and He/H ratios between PSP and SolO persisted throughout the entire event\nrather than only at the start.",

Specifically,\nwe first develop a novel multi-dimensional metric, the immersion of model\n(IoM), which assesses model value comprehensively by considering freshness and\naccuracy of learning models, as well as the amount and potential value of raw\ndata used for training. Then, we design an incentive mechanism to incentivize\nmetaverse users (MUs) to contribute high-value models under resource\nconstraints. The trading interactions between MSPs and MUs are modeled as an\nequilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) to analyze and balance\ntheir costs and gains, where MSPs as leaders determine rewards, while MUs as\nfollowers optimize resource allocation. Furthermore, considering dynamic\nnetwork conditions and privacy concerns, we formulate the reward decisions of\nMSPs as a multi-agent Markov decision process. To solve this, we develop a\nfully distributed dynamic reward algorithm based on deep reinforcement\nlearning, without accessing any private information about MUs and other MSPs.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving improvements in IoM of 38.3% and 37.2%,\nand reductions in training time to reach the target accuracy of 43.5% and\n49.8%, on average, for the MNIST and GTSRB datasets, respectively.",

However, predictive computational models for the intercalant\nordering phase diagram are lacking, complicating experimental pursuits to\ntarget key structural phases. Here we use Density Functional Theory (DFT) to\nconstruct a pairwise lattice model and Monte Carlo to determine its associated\nthermodynamic phase diagram. To circumvent the complexities of modeling\nmagnetic effects, we use the diamagnetic ions Zn$^{2+}$ and Sc$^{3+}$ as\ncomputationally accessible proxies for divalent and trivalent species of\ninterest (Fe$^{2+}$ and Cr$^{3+}$), which provide insights into the\nhigh-temperature thermodynamic phase diagram well above the paramagnetic\ntransition temperature. We find that electrostatic coupling between\nintercalants is almost entirely screened, so the pairwise lattice model\nrepresents a coarse-grained charge density reorganization about the\nintercalated sites. The resulting phase diagram reveals that the\nentropically-favored $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ ordering and coexisting locally\nordered $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ and $2 \\times 2$ domains persist across a\nrange of temperatures and intercalation densities.

This relationship is robust to\nchanges in the distance to the filament if the physical segment length and the\nabsolute magnitude for galaxy selection are held constant. The relationship\nbetween redshift dispersion and mass is similar to that obtained for a simple\nanalytical model where filaments are dynamically relaxed, and we examine the\npossibility that the galaxies are indeed relaxed within the gravitational\npotential of the filament.

Through\ncomparisons on synthetic networks and a real-world network of messaging\nchannels on the Telegram platform, we demonstrate that our method delivers more\nreliable community structures, even when a significant portion of data is\nmissing.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a steady progress towards blending 2D quantum\nmaterials into technology, with future applications often rooted in the\nelectronic structure. Since crossings and inversions of electronic bands with\ndifferent orbital characters determine intrinsic quantum transport properties,\nknowledge of the orbital character is essential. Here, we benchmark\nangle-resolved photoelectron emission spectroscopy (ARPES) as a tool to\nexperimentally derive orbital characters. For this purpose we study the valence\nelectronic structure of two technologically relevant quantum materials,\ngraphene and WSe$_2$, and focus on circular dichroism that is believed to\nprovide sensitivity to the orbital angular momentum. We analyze the\ncontributions related to angular atomic photoionization profiles, interatomic\ninterference, and multiple scattering. Regimes in which initial-state\nproperties could be disentangled from the ARPES maps are critically discussed\nand the potential of using circular-dichroic ARPES as a tool to investigate the\nspin polarization of initial bands is explored. For the purpose of\ngeneralization, results from two additional materials, GdMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and\nPtTe$_2$ are presented in addition. This research demonstrates rich complexity\nof the underlying physics of circular-dichroic ARPES, providing new insights\nthat will shape the interpretation of both past and future circular-dichroic\nARPES studies.",

When illuminated, such structures undergo\nspontaneous bending due to the limited penetration of light. However, the\ngeometry of the shell constrains possible deformation modes: changes in Gauss\ncurvature lead to in-plane stretching, against which shells are very stiff.\nTherefore, there is a complex coupling between the photomechanical actuation\nand the mechanical behavior of a shell. We develop and implement a novel\napproach to study photomechananically active shells.

In metals, this is\nconnected to a well-known instability of the Fermi liquid-the Pomeranchuk\ninstability. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we identified this\ninstability in a highly unusual setting: on the surface of an elemental\ntopological metal, arsenic. By directly visualizing the Fermi surface of the\nsurface state via scanning tunneling spectroscopy and photoemission\nspectroscopy, we find that the Fermi surface gets deformed and becomes\nelliptical at the energies where the nematic state is present. Known instances\nof nematic instability typically need van-Hove singularities or multi-orbital\nphysics as drivers. In contrast, the surface states of arsenic are essentially\nindistinguishable from well-confined isotropic Rashba bands near the Fermi\nlevel, rendering our finding the first realization of Pomeranchuk instability\nof the topological surface state.",

However, their application on\nobject detection is largely overlooked, especially without fine-tuning them. In\nthis work, we show that frozen foundation models can be a versatile feature\nenhancer, even though they are not pre-trained for object detection.\nSpecifically, we explore directly transferring the high-level image\nunderstanding of foundation models to detectors in the following two ways.\nFirst, the class token in foundation models provides an in-depth understanding\nof the complex scene, which facilitates decoding object queries in the\ndetector's decoder by providing a compact context. Additionally, the patch\ntokens in foundation models can enrich the features in the detector's encoder\nby providing semantic details. Utilizing frozen foundation models as\nplug-and-play modules rather than the commonly used backbone can significantly\nenhance the detector's performance while preventing the problems caused by the\narchitecture discrepancy between the detector's backbone and the foundation\nmodel. With such a novel paradigm, we boost the SOTA query-based detector DINO\nfrom 49.0% AP to 51.9% AP (+2.9% AP) and further to 53.8% AP (+4.8% AP) by\nintegrating one or two foundation models respectively, on the COCO validation\nset after training for 12 epochs with R50 as the detector's backbone.",

In this work, we model this scenario as a sequential\nsubset selection problem: we aim to select the smallest set of candidates in\norder to achieve some desired level of accuracy for the system as a whole. Our\nkey observation is that, if there is heterogeneity in the difficulty of the\nprediction problem across the input space, selectively obtaining the labels for\nthe hardest examples in the acquisition pool will leave only the relatively\neasy examples to remain in the inference set, leading to better overall system\nperformance.

This slight modification significantly enhanced the\nexchange bias energy of the AF/FM bilayer for an IrMn layer thickness ranging\nfrom 20{\\AA} to 50{\\AA} and reduced the coercivity of the FM layer.\nCalculations indicate that the boost in exchange bias energy and the reduction\nin coercivity can be attributed to the increased anisotropy energy of the\nantiferromagnet, resulting in more effective pinning of the ferromagnet by\nantiferromagnetic grains. The increase in anisotropy is caused by the diffusion\nof nitrogen from the FM into the AF layer, as established by X-ray diffraction,\nNeutron Reflectometry, and X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism. Our research\nallows to improve magnetic characteristics of exchange-coupled FM/AF structures\nthrough minor modifications in the sputtering process and/or save up to 20% of\nthe costly IrMn$_3$ target by reducing the thickness of the AF layer.",

This paper introduces Temporal Ensembling with\nLearning-based Aggregation, a meta-algorithm designed to mitigate the issue of\nmissing behaviors in trajectory prediction, which leads to inconsistent\npredictions across consecutive frames. Unlike conventional model ensembling,\ntemporal ensembling leverages predictions from nearby frames to enhance spatial\ncoverage and prediction diversity. By confirming predictions from multiple\nframes, temporal ensembling compensates for occasional errors in individual\nframe predictions. Furthermore, trajectory-level aggregation, often utilized in\nmodel ensembling, is insufficient for temporal ensembling due to a lack of\nconsideration of traffic context and its tendency to assign candidate\ntrajectories with incorrect driving behaviors to final predictions. We further\nemphasize the necessity of learning-based aggregation by utilizing mode queries\nwithin a DETR-like architecture for our temporal ensembling, leveraging the\ncharacteristics of predictions from nearby frames.

The plugin collects the parts of proofs marked with the admit\ntactic in a Coq file, i.e., proof holes, and combines LLMs along with\nnon-machine-learning methods to generate proof candidates for the holes. Then,\nCoqPilot checks if each proof candidate solves the given subgoal and, if\nsuccessful, replaces the hole with it. The focus of CoqPilot is twofold.\nFirstly, we want to allow users to seamlessly combine multiple Coq generation\napproaches and provide a zero-setup experience for our tool. Secondly, we want\nto deliver a platform for LLM-based experiments on Coq proof generation. We\ndeveloped a benchmarking system for Coq generation methods, available in the\nplugin, and conducted an experiment using it, showcasing the framework's\npossibilities.

It introduces geometric priors from 2D bounding boxes and 3D\nobject dimensions to reduce the uncertainty of depth estimation. However, due\nto depth errors originating from the object's visual surface, the height of the\nbounding box often fails to represent the actual projected central height,\nwhich undermines the effectiveness of geometric depth. Direct prediction for\nthe projected height unavoidably results in a loss of 2D priors, while\nmulti-depth prediction with complex branches does not fully leverage geometric\ndepth. This paper presents a Transformer-based monocular 3D object detection\nmethod called MonoDGP, which adopts perspective-invariant geometry errors to\nmodify the projection formula. We also try to systematically discuss and\nexplain the mechanisms and efficacy behind geometry errors, which serve as a\nsimple but effective alternative to multi-depth prediction. Additionally,\nMonoDGP decouples the depth-guided decoder and constructs a 2D decoder only\ndependent on visual features, providing 2D priors and initializing object\nqueries without the disturbance of 3D detection. To further optimize and\nfine-tune input tokens of the transformer decoder, we also introduce a Region\nSegment Head (RSH) that generates enhanced features and segment embeddings.

In this paper,\nwe provide an example of such use case, and show the energy consumption due to\nsensing has potential to scale to prohibitive levels. We then propose\narchitectural enhancements to solve this problem, and discuss energy saving and\nenergy efficient strategies in sensing, that can only be properly quantified\nand applied with the proposed architectural enhancements.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in ultra-stable ground-based high-resolution\nspectrographs have propelled ground-based astronomy to the forefront of\nexoplanet detection and characterisation. Retrieving accurate atmospheric\nparameters depends on accurate modelling and removal of the telluric\ncontamination while preserving the faint underlying exoplanet signal. There\nexist many methods to model telluric contamination, whether directly modelling\nthe Earth's transmission spectrum via radiative transfer modelling, or using a\nprincipal component analysis (PCA)-like reconstruction to fit the\ntime-invariant features of a spectrum. We aimed to assess the efficacy of these\nvarious telluric removal methods in preserving the underlying exoplanetary\nspectra. We compared two of the most common telluric modelling and removal\nmethods, molecfit and the PCA-like algorithm SysRem, using planetary\ntransmission spectra injected into three high-resolution optical observations\ntaken with ESPRESSO. These planetary signals were injected at orbital periods\nof P = 2 days and 12 days, resulting in differing changes in radial velocity\nduring transit. We then retrieved various injected atmospheric model parameters\nin order to determine the efficacy of the telluric removal methods. For the\nclose-in, high velocity injected signal, we found that SysRem performed better\nfor species that are also present in the Earth's atmosphere across each of the\ndatasets. As we moved to slower moving signals at larger orbital separations,\nfor one of the three datasets, SysRem dampened the planetary H$_2$O signal. In\ncontrast, the H$_2$O signal was preserved for the telluric modelling method,\nmolecfit. However, this behaviour was not ubiquitous across all three of the\ninjected datasets, with another dataset showing a more precise H$_2$O/Fe ratio\nwhen preprocessed with SysRem.",

The SOI\nwaveguide's dimensions are optimized to support the hybridization of the\nfundamental transverse magnetic ($TM_0$) and the first higher transverse\nelectric ($TE_1$) mode. This design allows for efficient and nearly equal power\ncoupling between these two modes, resulting in high-contrast interference when\nstarting from the amorphous PCM state. The PCM's phase transition induces a\ndifferential change in the modal effective index, enabling high-contrast\ntransmittance modulation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate a multilevel\ntransmission with a high contrast of nearly 14 dB, when the amorphous region's\nlength is varied incrementally, enabling multi-bit storage. The transmittance\nis maximized in the fully crystalline state with an insertion loss below 0.1\ndB.

This impressive distinction\nis attributed to the deformation potential and the elastic compliance matrix.\nThe shear strain breaks the symmetry of the crystalline structure and lifts the\nband degeneracy near the valence band edge, resulting in a significant\nsuppression of interband electron-phonon scattering. Moreover, the hole\nmobility becomes less temperature-dependent due to the decrease of electron\nscatterings from high-frequency acoustic phonons.

In addition, FastPCI proposes a unique Dual-Direction\nMotion-Structure block for more accurate scene flow estimation.

Moreover, unlike\nexisting approaches for auto calibration of triaxial sensors that often result\nin nonlinear optimization problems, the proposed method simplifies the\nestimation of the gyroscope scale factor by employing a linear least squares\nalgorithm.

A vertex partition $\\pi = \\{V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_k\\}$ of\n$G$ is called an \\emph{upper domatic partition} of size $k$ if either $V_i$\ndominates $V_j$ or $V_j$ dominates $V_i$ or both for all $i, j$, where $1\\leq\ni<j\\leq k$. The maximum integer $k$ for which the above partition exists is\ncalled the \\emph{upper domatic number} of $G$, and it is denoted by $D(G)$. The\n\\textsc{Maximum upper domatic number Problem} involves finding an upper domatic\npartition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts.

The proposed\nfine-tuning method achieves a 10% block error rate (BLER) at a 1.85 dB lower\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to pre-training only on simulated TDL\nchannels, illustrating a rough magnitude of the gap that can be closed by\nsite-specific training, and gives the first answer to the question \"how much\ncan fine-tuning the RAN for site-specific channels help?\"",

    "abstract": "In recent advancements in unsupervised visual representation learning, the\nJoint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has emerged as a significant\nmethod for extracting visual features from unlabeled imagery through an\ninnovative masking strategy. Despite its success, two primary limitations have\nbeen identified: the inefficacy of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from I-JEPA\nin preventing entire collapse and the inadequacy of I-JEPA prediction in\naccurately learning the mean of patch representations. Addressing these\nchallenges, this study introduces a novel framework, namely C-JEPA\n(Contrastive-JEPA), which integrates the Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive\nArchitecture with the Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg)\nstrategy. This integration is designed to effectively learn the\nvariance/covariance for preventing entire collapse and ensuring invariance in\nthe mean of augmented views, thereby overcoming the identified limitations.\nThrough empirical and theoretical evaluations, our work demonstrates that\nC-JEPA significantly enhances the stability and quality of visual\nrepresentation learning. When pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset, C-JEPA\nexhibits rapid and improved convergence in both linear probing and fine-tuning\nperformance metrics.",

    "abstract": "The presence of variable renewable energy resources with uncertain outputs in\nday-ahead electricity markets results in additional balancing needs in\nreal-time. Addressing those needs cost-effectively and reliably within a\ncompetitive market with unbundled products is challenging as both the demand\nfor and the availability of flexibility depends on day-ahead energy schedules.\nExisting approaches for reserve procurement usually rely either on\noversimplified demand curves that do not consider how system conditions that\nparticular day affect the value of flexibility, or on bilateral trading of\nhedging instruments that are not co-optimized with day-ahead schedules. This\narticle proposes a new product, `Flexibility Options', to address these two\nlimitations. The demand for this product is endogenously determined in the\nday-ahead market and it is met cost-effectively by considering real-time supply\ncurves for product providers, which are co-optimized with the energy supply. As\nwe illustrate with numerical examples and mathematical analysis, the product\naddresses the hedging needs of participants with imbalances cost-effectively,\nprovides a less intermittent revenue stream for participants with flexible\noutputs, promotes value-driven pricing of flexibility, and ensures that the\nsystem operator is revenue-neutral.

Building\nupon this observation, the sublattice symmetry is uncovered with respect to an\nexcitation energy, which is usually hidden in the bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nHamiltonian.

We\nfacilitate this study by introducing five new benchmark datasets namely O-UCF\nand O-JHMDB consisting of synthetically controlled static/dynamic occlusions,\nOVIS-UCF and OVIS-JHMDB consisting of occlusions with realistic motions and\nReal-OUCF for occlusions in realistic-world scenarios. We formally confirm an\nintuitive expectation: existing models suffer a lot as occlusion severity is\nincreased and exhibit different behaviours when occluders are static vs when\nthey are moving. We discover several intriguing phenomenon emerging in neural\nnets: 1) transformers can naturally outperform CNN models which might have even\nused occlusion as a form of data augmentation during training 2) incorporating\nsymbolic-components like capsules to such backbones allows them to bind to\noccluders never even seen during training and 3) Islands of agreement can\nemerge in realistic images/videos without instance-level supervision,\ndistillation or contrastive-based objectives2(eg. video-textual training). Such\nemergent properties allow us to derive simple yet effective training recipes\nwhich lead to robust occlusion models inductively satisfying the first two\nstages of the binding mechanism (grouping/segregation). Models leveraging these\nrecipes outperform existing video action-detectors under occlusion by 32.3% on\nO-UCF, 32.7% on O-JHMDB & 2.6% on Real-OUCF in terms of the vMAP metric.

    "abstract": "The human brain has long inspired the pursuit of artificial intelligence\n(AI). Recently, neuroimaging studies provide compelling evidence of alignment\nbetween the computational representation of artificial neural networks (ANNs)\nand the neural responses of the human brain to stimuli, suggesting that ANNs\nmay employ brain-like information processing strategies. While such alignment\nhas been observed across sensory modalities--visual, auditory, and\nlinguistic--much of the focus has been on the behaviors of artificial neurons\n(ANs) at the population level, leaving the functional organization of\nindividual ANs that facilitates such brain-like processes largely unexplored.\nIn this study, we bridge this gap by directly coupling sub-groups of artificial\nneurons with functional brain networks (FBNs), the foundational organizational\nstructure of the human brain. Specifically, we extract representative patterns\nfrom temporal responses of ANs in large language models (LLMs), and use them as\nfixed regressors to construct voxel-wise encoding models to predict brain\nactivity recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This\nframework links the AN sub-groups to FBNs, enabling the delineation of\nbrain-like functional organization within LLMs. Our findings reveal that LLMs\n(BERT and Llama 1-3) exhibit brain-like functional architecture, with\nsub-groups of artificial neurons mirroring the organizational patterns of\nwell-established FBNs. Notably, the brain-like functional organization of LLMs\nevolves with the increased sophistication and capability, achieving an improved\nbalance between the diversity of computational behaviors and the consistency of\nfunctional specializations. This research represents the first exploration of\nbrain-like functional organization within LLMs, offering novel insights to\ninform the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) with human\nbrain principles.",

We then apply it to chiral\nmodels and utilize exterior differential calculations, instead of the\nsophisticated \\emph{K}-theory, to show that the winding number of bulk system\nequals to the Fredholm index of 1D edge Hamiltonian, or to the sum of edge\nwinding numbers for higher odd dimensions. Moreover, this result is inherited\nto the even-dimensional Chern insulators as each of them can be mapped to an\nodd-dimensional chiral model. It is revealed that the Chern number of bulk\nsystem is identical to the spectral flow of 2D edge Hamiltonian, or to the\nnegative sum of edge Chern numbers for higher even dimensions.

Most existing approaches are designed either to process short\nsequences or to handle long-range sequences. This dichotomy can be attributed\nto gradient issues with recurrent networks, computational costs associated with\ntransformers, and limited expressiveness of state space models. Towards a\nunified generative model for varying-length time series, we propose in this\nwork to transform sequences into images. By employing invertible transforms\nsuch as the delay embedding and the short-time Fourier transform, we unlock\nthree main advantages: i) We can exploit advanced diffusion vision models; ii)\nWe can remarkably process short- and long-range inputs within the same\nframework; and iii) We can harness recent and established tools proposed in the\ntime series to image literature. We validate the effectiveness of our method\nthrough a comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks, including\nunconditional generation, interpolation, and extrapolation. We show that our\napproach achieves consistently state-of-the-art results against strong\nbaselines. In the unconditional generation tasks, we show remarkable mean\nimprovements of 58.17% over previous diffusion models in the short\ndiscriminative score and 132.61% in the (ultra-)long classification scores.\nCode is at https://github.com/azencot-group/ImagenTime.",

Under the condition of high dynamic viscosity ratio, the analytical\nsolution of DI model may be significantly different from that of the sharp\ninterface (SI) model, and the degree of deviation depends on the dynamic\nviscosity model and the interface thickness. Therefore, the numerical\nsimulation of layered Poiseuille flow with DI model should be compared with the\nanalytical solution of DI model with the same dynamic viscosity model. A direct\ncomparison of the numerical solution results with the SI analytical solution\ncould misinterpret the model error with the numerical error. In addition, the\ndirect numerical simulation data and the DI analytical solutions agree well,\nwhich validates the theoretical results. Finally, a new set of symmetrical\ndynamic viscosity models is proposed and recommended for the simulation of\ntwo-phase flows in the DI model, which makes both the viscosity profiles and\nvelocity profiles close to the SI model.",

The quantum optical formulation leads to equations of motion\nfor the generated light field in which the quantum optical field couples to the\ntime-dependent current of the electronic medium irrespectively of the specifics\nof the electronic system being an atom, molecule, or solid. These equations of\nmotion are not solvable for any realistic system and accurate and verified\napproximations are hence needed. In this work, we present a hierarchy of\napproximations for the equations of motion for the photonic state. At each\nlevel in this hierarchy, we compare it to the previous level justifying the\nvalidity using the Fermi-Hubbard model as an example of an electronic system\nwith correlations. This model allows us to perform an accurate simulation of\nthe electron motion of all the required states. We find that for the typical\nexperimental situation of weak quantized-light-matter-coupling constant and at\nintensities well below the damage threshold, an explicit expression for the\ngenerated quantum light, referred to as the Markov-state approximation (MSA),\ncaptures the high-harmonic spectrum quantitatively and describes the\nsingle-mode quantum properties of the generated light as characterized by the\nMandel-Q parameter and the degree of squeezing qualitatively.",

Assuming $\\dot{X}=f(X,I)$ for some smooth\nfunction $f$ defines a \"replacement number dynamics\" (RND). Choosing\ntransmission coefficients $\\beta_1>\\beta_2$, any such system uniquely maps to\nan isomorphic \"SSISS model\", i.e. an abstract SIR-type 3-compartment model.\nExtending to negative values $\\beta_i<0$ takes care of demographic dynamics\nwith compartment dependent birth and death rates. Fixing $f$ and varying\n$\\beta_i$ generates a family of isomorphic SSISS systems, the \"SSISS fiber\"\n$\\cal{F}(f)$}. A symmetry group $G_\\sigma$ acts freely and transitively on\nfibers $\\cal{F}(f)$, so SSISS systems become a principal $G_\\sigma$-fiber\nbundle over the space of RND systems.

    "abstract": "We present a framework for modeling liver regrowth on the organ scale that is\nbased on three components: (1) a multiscale perfusion model that combines\nsynthetic vascular tree generation with a multi-compartment homogenized flow\nmodel, including a homogenization procedure to obtain effective parameters; (2)\na poroelastic finite growth model that acts on all compartments and the\nsynthetic vascular tree structure; (3) an evolution equation for the local\nvolumetric growth factor, driven by the homogenized flow rate into the\nmicrocirculation as a measure of local hyperperfusion and well-suited for\ncalibration with available data. We apply our modeling framework to a\nprototypical benchmark and a full-scale patient-specific liver, for which we\nassume a common surgical cut. Our simulation results demonstrate that our model\nrepresents hyperperfusion as a consequence of partial resection and accounts\nfor its reduction towards a homeostatic perfusion state, exhibiting overall\nregrowth dynamics that correspond well with clinical observations. In addition,\nour results show that our model also captures local hypoperfusion in the\nvicinity of orphan vessels, a key requirement for the prediction of ischemia or\nthe preoperative identification of suitable cut patterns.",

    "abstract": "Developing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent often involves identifying\nvalues for numerous parameters, covering the policy, reward function,\nenvironment, and agent-internal architecture. Since these parameters are\ninterrelated in complex ways, optimizing them is a black-box problem that\nproves especially challenging for nonexperts. Although existing\noptimization-as-a-service platforms (e.g., Vizier and Optuna) can handle such\nproblems, they are impractical for RL systems, since the need for manual user\nmapping of each parameter to distinct components makes the effort cumbersome.\nIt also requires understanding of the optimization process, limiting the\nsystems' application beyond the machine learning field and restricting access\nin areas such as cognitive science, which models human decision-making. To\ntackle these challenges, the paper presents AgentForge, a flexible low-code\nplatform to optimize any parameter set across an RL system. Available at\nhttps://github.com/feferna/AgentForge, it allows an optimization problem to be\ndefined in a few lines of code and handed to any of the interfaced optimizers.\nWith AgentForge, the user can optimize the parameters either individually or\njointly. The paper presents an evaluation of its performance for a challenging\nvision-based RL problem.",

In the present work, a simple model based on momentum theory is derived\nfor the situation of an actuator disc (AD) operating in a background flow field\nwith a constant velocity gradient. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)\nsimulations of this scenario are performed, showing that a positive\nacceleration yields a reduction of induction and vice versa, a negative\nacceleration leads to an increase of induction. The new model accurately\ncaptures this behavior and reduces the prediction error by eighty percent\ncompared to classical momentum theory where the effect of the background flow\nacceleration is disregarded. Further analysis suggests that the model can be\nextended to a formulation in which an even higher prediction accuracy can be\nachieved.",

The second is a purely Lagrangian scheme\ndesigned for situations where remeshing is not appropriate. The second is a\npurely Lagrangian scheme that is applicable when remeshing is not adapted.\nThese methods are evaluated using a one-dimensional advection-diffusion model\nwith periodic boundaries. Performance benchmarks for the one-dimensional\nscenario are conducted against a grid-based assimilation filter Subsequently,\nassimilation schemes are applied to a non-linear two-dimensional incompressible\nflow problem, solved via the Vortex-In-Cell method.

A\nremarkable property of disordered mosaic lattices is the persistence of\nextended states at some resonance frequencies that prevent complete Anderson\nlocalization, even in the strong disorder regime.

We derive the\nHamiltonian for a spinning axisymmetric satellite in the gravitational\npotential of a planet without assuming planar or principal axis rotation and\nwithout averaging over the spin period. Using this model, we demonstrate the\nemergence of resonances between the nutation and orbital frequencies that act\nas the primary drivers of the spin dynamics. This analysis reveals that,\ncontrary to long-held belief, Hyperion is not tumbling chaotically. Instead, it\nlies near or in a nutation-orbit resonance that is first-order in eccentricity,\nallowing it to rotate quasi-regularly. The most reliable observations are\nconsistent with either nonchaotic motion or chaos that is orders of magnitude\nsmaller than originally claimed. A separate phenomenon, the so-called barrel\ninstability, is shown to be related to a different set of nutation-orbit\nresonances that generalize the planar spin-orbit resonances.

    "abstract": "The tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect is one of the representative\nphenomena in spintronics. Ferromagnets, which have a net spin polarization,\nhave been utilized for the TMR effect. Recently, by contrast, the TMR effect\nwith antiferromagnets, which do not possess a macroscopic spin polarization,\nhas been proposed, and also been observed in experiments. In this topical\nreview, we discuss recent developments in the TMR effect, particularly focusing\non the TMR effect with antiferromagnets. First, we review how the TMR effect\ncan occur in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. The Julliere model, which has\nbeen conventionally utilized to grasp the TMR effect with ferromagnets, breaks\ndown for the antiferromagnetic TMR effect. Instead, we see that the momentum\ndependent spin splitting explains the antiferromagnetic TMR effect. After that,\nwe revisit the TMR effect from viewpoint of the local density of states (LDOS).\nWe particularly focus on the LDOS inside the barrier, and show that the product\nof the LDOS will qualitatively capture the TMR effect not only in the\nferromagnetic tunnel junctions but also in the ferrimagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This method is expected to work usefully\nfor designing magnetic tunnel junctions.",

Recently,\ndeveloping generative models for these MTPP models have seen rapid development\ndue to their powerful generative capability and less restrictive functional\nforms. However, existing generative MTPP models are usually challenged in\njointly modeling events' timestamps and types since: (1) mainstream methods\ndesign the generative mechanisms for timestamps only and do not include event\ntypes; (2) the complex interdependence between the timestamps and event types\nare overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel generative MTPP model called\nBMTPP. Unlike existing generative MTPP models, BMTPP flexibly models marked\ntemporal joint distributions using a parameter-based approach. Additionally, by\nadding joint noise to the marked temporal data space, BMTPP effectively\ncaptures and explicitly reveals the interdependence between timestamps and\nevent types. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our approach\nover other state-of-the-art models and its ability to effectively capture\nmarked-temporal interdependence.",

    "abstract": "SSP reductions are a type of polynomial reductions that also preserve the\nsolutions of the instances. This means there is a mapping from each solution in\nthe original instance to one in the reduced instance, allowing direct deduction\nof an original solution from a solution in the reduced instance. SSP reductions\ncan be used to show SSP-NP completeness of a problem, which is interesting\nbecause it has been proven that two min-max variants of SSP-NP complete\nproblems are $\\Sigma_2^p$-complete. Min-max optimization problems are\noptimization problems with the objective of minimizing the maximum outcome. An\nexample is a power network prone to attack by terrorists. Lets say the\ngovernment wants to minimize the damage that can be achieved by the terrorists,\ne.g. by protecting the electricity poles which were found to be most important\nfor distributing power. Most theoretical computer scientists assume min-max\noptimization problems to generally be $\\Sigma_2^p$-complete, and with the help\nof the SSP-framework, this was shown for network interdiction and min-max\nregret robust optimization. This paper is devoted to the exploration of SSP\nreductions and the collection of SSP-NP-complete problems as well as SSP\nreductions. Additionally, a compendium website is developed, in which the\nSSP-NP-complete problems and SSP reductions are displayed in a graph, so that\nit becomes easy to understand the relations between the problems. The website\nis also extendable to include problems from other complexity classes and\nreductions that are not SSP reductions, such as gap-preserving reductions,\nfixed parameter tractable reductions or fine-grained reductions. Overall, 19\nnew SSP reductions are found, resulting in eight new SSP-NP-completeness\nproofs, and the compendium website is developed to enable theoretical computer\nscientists to easily access the results and provide a knowledge base for future\nresearch.",

The m6A RNA methylation is a\nconserved and dynamically reversible mechanism controlling gene expression in a\nmyriad of biological processes. The role of m6A methylation in sexual\nmaturation, however, has remained largely unexplored and has never been studied\nin Atlantic salmon. While the maturation process is known to be affected by\nmany genetic and environmental factors, the molecular mechanisms causing\nvariation in the timing of maturation are still poorly understood. Hence,\ninvestigation of whether a widespread mechanism like m6A methylation could be\ninvolved in controlling of the maturation timing is warranted. In salmon, two\ngenes, also associated with age at maturity in humans, vgll3 and six6, have\nbeen shown to play an important role in maturation timing. In this study, we\ninvestigated the expression of 16 genes involved in the regulation of m6A RNA\nmethylation in the hypothalamus of Atlantic salmon with different homozygous\ncombinations of late and early alleles for vgll3 and six6 genes. We found\ndifferential expression of ythdf2.2, an m6A reader promoting mRNA degradation,\nwith higher expression in six6*LL compared to other genotypes as well as in\nimmature compared to mature males. In addition, we found that the expression\nlevels of genes coding for an eraser, alkbh5, and for a reader, ythdf1, were\nhigher in the hypothalamus of females than in males across all the different\ngenotypes studied. However the total m6A levels between the whole hypothalamus\nof males and females were similar. Our results indicate a potential role of the\nm6A methylation process in sexual maturation of salmon, and provide the first\nevidence for such regulatory mechanism in the hypothalamus of any vertebrate",

However, achieving both high DR accuracy\nand strong explainability remains a fundamental challenge, especially for users\ndealing with high-dimensional data. Traditional DR methods often face a\ntrade-off between precision and transparency, where optimizing for performance\ncan lead to reduced explainability, and vice versa. This limitation is\nespecially prominent in real-world applications such as image, tabular, and\ntext data analysis, where both accuracy and explainability are critical. To\naddress these challenges, this work introduces the MOE-based Explainable Deep\nManifold Transformation (DMT-ME). The proposed approach combines hyperbolic\nembeddings, which effectively capture complex hierarchical structures, with\nMixture of Experts (MOE) models, which dynamically allocate tasks based on\ninput features. DMT-ME enhances DR accuracy by leveraging hyperbolic embeddings\nto represent the hierarchical nature of data, while also improving\nexplainability by explicitly linking input data, embedding outcomes, and key\nfeatures through the MOE structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDMT-ME consistently achieves superior performance in both DR accuracy and model\nexplainability, making it a robust solution for complex data analysis.

The\ntopological descriptors for the benes derived network are also determined in\nthis work. Further, the benes network and augmented benes network undergoes a\ncomparative analysis based on few network parameters, which helps to understand\nthe efficiency of newly derived benes network.

    "abstract": "The capabilities of multi-antenna technology have recently been significantly\nenhanced by the proliferation of extra large array architectures. The high\ndimensionality of these systems implies that communications take place in the\nnearfield regime, which poses some questions as to their effective perfomrance\neven under simple line of sight configurations. In order to study these\nlimitations, a uniform linear array (ULA) is considered here, the elements of\nwhich are three infinitesimal dipoles transmitting different signals in the\nthree spatial dimensions. The receiver consists of a single element with three\northogonal infinitesimal dipoles and full channel state information is assumed\nto be available at both ends. A capacity analysis is presented when the number\nof elements of the ULA increases without bound while the interelement distance\nconverges to zero, so that the total aperture length is kept asymptotically\nfixed. In particular, the total number of available spatial eigenmodes is shown\nto depend crucially on the receiver position in space, and closed form\nexpressions are provided for the different achievability regions. From the\nanalysis it can be concluded that the use of three orthogonal polarizations at\nthe transmitter guarantees the almost universal availability of two spatial\nstreams, whereas the use of only two polarizations results in a more extensive\nregion where maximum multiplexing gain is available.",

Following an exploration of the phase diagram of the two theories\nwith Wilson fermions and additional Pauli-Villars fields, we tune the bare\nfermion mass to near the chiral limit, and subsequently generate ensembles at\nfive lattice volumes and a range of lattice spacings.",

This definition yields a\nyes-or-no determination of whether extraction was successful with respect to a\nsingle query. Though efficient to compute, we show that this definition is\nunreliable because it does not account for non-determinism present in more\nrealistic (non-greedy) sampling schemes, for which LLMs produce a range of\noutputs for the same prompt. We introduce probabilistic discoverable\nextraction, which, without additional cost, relaxes discoverable extraction by\nconsidering multiple queries to quantify the probability of extracting a target\nsequence.

We\nfollow the evolution of a halo from the Aquarius project and the formation of\nits maximal satellite population with the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy\nformation. This population consists of all subhalos able to form stars through\nefficient gas cooling before or after reionization, which effectively selects\nsystems with peak circular velocities exceeding a critical threshold of roughly\n15-20 km/s. The total number of luminous satellites is sensitive to the assumed\nredshift of reionization, but the shape of the GALFORM satellite stellar mass\nfunction is robust, peaking at the stellar mass (10^3Msun) of a halo just above\nthe critical threshold. Subhalos are prone to artificial disruption in the\ntidal field of the main halo, with the number of surviving satellites\nincreasing with resolution. Even in the highest resolution simulation (Aq-L1,\nwith particle mass of 10^3Msun), a substantial number of satellite subhalos are\ndisrupted, leaving behind ``orphan'' galaxies tracked in GALFORM by the\nsubhalo's most-bound particle before disruption. When orphans are included (and\nthe effects of tidal stripping on stars neglected), all simulations that\nadequately resolve the critical threshold yield a converged maximal satellite\nstellar mass function. Most orphans were accreted early, are found in the\ncentral regions of the main halo, and make up roughly half of all satellites in\nAq-L1. Taking orphans into account there is no need to populate subhalos below\nthe critical threshold with satellites to fit the radial distribution of MW\nsatellites, as has been argued in recent work. Our model predicts that orphans\ndominate the ultra-faint population and that many more satellites with small\napocentric radii should be detected in upcoming deep wide-field surveys.",

To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly\nefficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic\ncausal structures.

DGPL\ntransforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic\ncausal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that\nLOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's\npotential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.",

Non-empty faces of the\nsupermodular cone then correspond to normal fans of those polytopes. This\n(basically) geometric way of description of faces of the cone then leads to the\ncombinatorial ways of their description. The first combinatorial way is to\nidentify the faces with certain partitions of the set of enumerations of $N$,\nknown as rank tests in context of algebraic statistics. The second\ncombinatorial way is to identify faces with certain collections of posets on\n$N$, known as (complete) fans of posets in context of polyhedral geometry. The\nthird combinatorial way is to identify the faces with certain coverings of the\npower set of $N$, introduced relatively recently in context of cooperative game\ntheory under name core structures. The fourth combinatorial way is to identify\nthe faces with certain formal conditional independence structures, introduced\nformerly in context of multivariate statistics under name structural\nsemi-graphoids. The fifth way is to identify the faces with certain subgraphs\nof the permutohedral graph, whose nodes are enumerations of $N$. We prove the\nequivalence of those six ways of description of non-empty faces of the\nsupermodular cone. This result also allows one to describe the faces of the\npolyhedral cone of (rank functions of) polymatroids over $N$ and the faces of\nthe submodular cone over $N$.",

    "abstract": "Although fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multilingual data can\nrapidly enhance the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit a\nperformance gap between the dominant language (e.g., English) and non-dominant\nones due to the imbalance of training data across languages. To further enhance\nthe performance of non-dominant languages, we propose ShifCon, a Shift-based\nmultilingual Contrastive framework that aligns the internal forward process of\nother languages toward that of the dominant one. Specifically, it shifts the\nrepresentations of non-dominant languages into the dominant language subspace,\nallowing them to access relatively rich information encoded in the model\nparameters. The enriched representations are then shifted back into their\noriginal language subspace before generation. Moreover, we introduce a subspace\ndistance metric to pinpoint the optimal layer area for shifting representations\nand employ multilingual contrastive learning to further enhance the alignment\nof representations within this area. Experiments demonstrate that our ShifCon\nframework significantly enhances the performance of non-dominant languages,\nparticularly for low-resource ones. Further analysis offers extra insights to\nverify the effectiveness of ShifCon and propel future research.",

However, the research on fMRI-to-video reconstruction\nremains limited since decoding the spatiotemporal perception of continuous\nvisual experiences is formidably challenging. We contend that the key to\naddressing these challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level\nsemantics and low-level perception flows, as perceived by the brain in response\nto video stimuli. To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to\ndecode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a\nsemantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic\naccuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture\nlow-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it\nadopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and\nlow-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly\navailable fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video\nreconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM\nand an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics.

However, most existing research has\nfocused on single-agent settings, with limited exploration of the multi-agent\nextension, i.e., Offline-to-Online Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (O2O\nMARL). In O2O MARL, two critical challenges become more prominent as the number\nof agents increases: (i) the risk of unlearning pre-trained Q-values due to\ndistributional shifts during the transition from offline-to-online phases, and\n(ii) the difficulty of efficient exploration in the large joint state-action\nspace. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel O2O MARL framework called\nOffline Value Function Memory with Sequential Exploration (OVMSE). First, we\nintroduce the Offline Value Function Memory (OVM) mechanism to compute target\nQ-values, preserving knowledge gained during offline training, ensuring\nsmoother transitions, and enabling efficient fine-tuning. Second, we propose a\ndecentralized Sequential Exploration (SE) strategy tailored for O2O MARL, which\neffectively utilizes the pre-trained offline policy for exploration, thereby\nsignificantly reducing the joint state-action space to be explored. Extensive\nexperiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) demonstrate that\nOVMSE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior sample\nefficiency and overall performance.",

Previous methods seek to\nmutually mimic cross-modal outputs in each domain, which enforces a class\nprobability distribution that is agreeable in different domains. However, they\noverlook the complementarity brought by the heterogeneous fusion in cross-modal\nlearning. In light of this, we propose a novel fusion-then-distillation (FtD++)\nmethod to explore cross-modal positive distillation of the source and target\ndomains for 3D semantic segmentation. FtD++ realizes distribution consistency\nbetween outputs not only for 2D images and 3D point clouds but also for\nsource-domain and augment-domain. Specially, our method contains three key\ningredients. First, we present a model-agnostic feature fusion module to\ngenerate the cross-modal fusion representation for establishing a latent space.\nIn this space, two modalities are enforced maximum correlation and\ncomplementarity. Second, the proposed cross-modal positive distillation\npreserves the complete information of multi-modal input and combines the\nsemantic content of the source domain with the style of the target domain,\nthereby achieving domain-modality alignment. Finally, cross-modal debiased\npseudo-labeling is devised to model the uncertainty of pseudo-labels via a\nself-training manner.

We discuss and\nexemplify benefits of this framework, such as the determination of reliable\nthresholds to distinguish ordered from chaotic trajectories. Our extensive\nparametric study quantitatively assesses the accuracy and sensitivity of both\nthe finite differences and differential arithmetic approaches by focusing on\nparadigmatic discrete models of Hamiltonian chaos, namely the Chirikov's\nstandard map and coupled $4$-dimensional variants. Our results demonstrate that\nfinite difference techniques for $\\vert\\vert \\Delta \\rm{LD} \\vert\\vert$ might\nlead to significant misclassification rate, up to $20\\%$ when the phase space\nsupports thin resonant webs, due to the difficulty to determine appropriate\nthresholds.

The idea that\nwith an ultra short laser pulse a temporal (transient) state of electrons in a\nmetal can be created in which electrons after absorbing energy from the laser\npulse heat up and their temperature becomes substantially greater than that of\nlattice was originated in the work of S. I. Anisimov, B. L. Kapeliovich, and T.\nL. Perel'man in 1974. The heated electron sub-system (\"hot\" electrons) loses\nits energy to phonon sub-system via electron-phonon scattering (relaxation) and\nthermodynamic equilibrium re-establishes over a time scale of a few\npico-seconds (psecs) in metals. This field saw great developments in the 1980s\nand 1990s with the advent of femto-second (fsec) pump-probe spectroscopy. And\nfrom 2000 onwards focus shifted from non-equilibrium phenomena in simple metals\nto that in more complex systems including strongly correlated systems such as\nhigh Tc cuprate superconductors.

This paper thus proposes an image-based\nvisual servoing approach for enhancing the cooperation of a dual-arm\nmanipulation system. On top of the classical control, the visual servoing\ncontroller lets each manipulator use its carried camera to measure the image\nfeatures of the other's marker and adapt its end-effector pose with the\ncounterpart on the move. Because visual measurements are robust to kinematic\nerrors, the proposed control can reduce the end-effector pose synchronization\nerrors and the fluctuations of the interaction forces of the pair of\nmanipulators on the move.

    "abstract": "Generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promise in sequential recommendation\ntasks. However, they face challenges, including posterior collapse and limited\nrepresentation capacity. The work by Li et al. (2023) introduces a novel\napproach that leverages diffusion models to address these challenges by\nrepresenting item embeddings as distributions rather than fixed vectors. This\napproach allows for a more adaptive reflection of users' diverse interests and\nvarious item aspects. During the diffusion phase, the model converts the target\nitem embedding into a Gaussian distribution by adding noise, facilitating the\nrepresentation of sequential item distributions and the injection of\nuncertainty. An Approximator then processes this noisy item representation to\nreconstruct the target item. In the reverse phase, the model utilizes users'\npast interactions to reverse the noise and finalize the item prediction through\na rounding operation. This research introduces enhancements to the DiffuRec\narchitecture, particularly by adding offset noise in the diffusion process to\nimprove robustness and incorporating a cross-attention mechanism in the\nApproximator to better capture relevant user-item interactions. These\ncontributions led to the development of a new model, DiffuRecSys, which\nimproves performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three public benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that these modifications enhance item representation,\neffectively capture diverse user preferences, and outperform existing baselines\nin sequential recommendation research.",

In this work,\nwe propose a stochastic optimization technique to tackle this problem.

This vulnerability is exacerbated in the era of large models, where\nextensive (pre-)training on web-crawled datasets is susceptible to compromise.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel two-step defense framework named Expose\nBefore You Defend (EBYD). EBYD unifies existing backdoor defense methods into a\ncomprehensive defense system with enhanced performance. Specifically, EBYD\nfirst exposes the backdoor functionality in the backdoored model through a\nmodel preprocessing step called backdoor exposure, and then applies detection\nand removal methods to the exposed model to identify and eliminate the backdoor\nfeatures. In the first step of backdoor exposure, we propose a novel technique\ncalled Clean Unlearning (CUL), which proactively unlearns clean features from\nthe backdoored model to reveal the hidden backdoor features. We also explore\nvarious model editing/modification techniques for backdoor exposure, including\nfine-tuning, model sparsification, and weight perturbation.

This\nprocess, often called paint bucket colorization, involves two main tasks:\nkeyframe colorization, where colors are applied according to the character's\ncolor design sheet, and consecutive frame colorization, where these colors are\nreplicated across adjacent frames. Current automated colorization methods\nprimarily focus on reference-based and segment-matching approaches. However,\nreference-based methods often fail to accurately assign specific colors to each\nregion, while matching-based methods are limited to consecutive frame\ncolorization and struggle with issues like significant deformation and\nocclusion. In this work, we introduce inclusion matching, which allows the\nnetwork to understand the inclusion relationships between segments, rather than\nrelying solely on direct visual correspondences. By integrating this approach\nwith segment parsing and color warping modules, our inclusion matching pipeline\nsignificantly improves performance in both keyframe colorization and\nconsecutive frame colorization. To support our network's training, we have\ndeveloped a unique dataset named PaintBucket-Character, which includes rendered\nline arts alongside their colorized versions and shading annotations for\nvarious 3D characters.

As the atomic number increases, the\nbandgap of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) continually decreases until it shrinks to a\npoint where, when SOC is considered, band inversion occurs, leading to a\nreopening of the bandgap with nontrivial topological phases. In conjunction\nwith band inversion, pz orbitals near the Fermi level can introduce double\nRashba splitting featuring a distinctive hybrid spin texture, which can be\nfurther effectively adjusted through small biaxial strains and show a\ncontinuous evolution of topological to non-topological accompanied by different\nspin textures.

A fault domain\nthat has been widely studied in the literature on black-box conformance testing\nis the class of finite state machines (FSMs) with at most $m$ states. Numerous\nstrategies for generating test suites have been proposed that guarantee fault\ncoverage for this class. These so-called $m$-complete test suites grow\nexponentially in $m-n$, where $n$ is the number of states of the specification,\nso one can only run them for small values of $m-n$. But the assumption that\n$m-n$ is small is not realistic in practice. In his seminal paper from 1964,\nHennie raised the challenge to design checking experiments in which the number\nof states may increase appreciably. In order to solve this long-standing open\nproblem, we propose (much larger) fault domains that capture the assumption\nthat all states in an implementation can be reached by first performing a\nsequence from some set $A$ (typically a state cover for the specification),\nfollowed by $k$ arbitrary inputs, for some small $k$. The number of states of\nFSMs in these fault domains grows exponentially in $k$. We present a sufficient\ncondition for $k$-$A$-completeness of test suites with respect to these fault\ndomains. Our condition implies $k$-$A$-completeness of two prominent\n$m$-complete test suite generation strategies, the Wp and HSI methods. Thus\nthese strategies are complete for much larger fault domains than those for\nwhich they were originally designed, and thereby solve Hennie's challenge.

Results from experiments demonstrate that our LSTM model,\ncompared to commonly used template fitting and machine learning approaches,\nrequires minimal input parameters and achieves high precision in photo-$z$\nestimation. For instance, when trained on the same dataset and provided only\nwith photometric fluxes as input features, the proposed LSTM model yields\none-third of the outliers $f_{out}$ observed with a Multi-Layer Perceptron\nNeural Network (MLP) model, while the normalized median absolute deviation $\\rm\n\\sigma_{NMAD}$ is only two-thirds that of the MLP model.

    "abstract": "Obtaining well-calibrated photometric redshift probability densities for\ngalaxies without a spectroscopic measurement remains a challenge. Deep learning\ndiscriminative models, typically fed with multi-band galaxy images, can produce\noutputs that mimic probability densities and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy.\nHowever, such models may be affected by miscalibration that would result in\ndiscrepancies between the model outputs and the actual distributions of true\nredshifts. Our work develops a novel method called the Contrastive Learning and\nAdaptive KNN for Photometric Redshift (CLAP) that resolves this issue. It\nleverages supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and k-nearest neighbours (KNN)\nto construct and calibrate raw probability density estimates, and implements a\nrefitting procedure to resume end-to-end discriminative models ready to produce\nfinal estimates for large-scale imaging data. The harmonic mean is adopted to\ncombine an ensemble of estimates from multiple realisations for improving\naccuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that CLAP takes advantage of both deep\nlearning and KNN, outperforming benchmark methods on the calibration of\nprobability density estimates and retaining high accuracy and computational\nefficiency. With reference to CLAP, we point out that miscalibration is\nparticularly sensitive to the method-induced excessive correlations among data\ninstances in addition to the unaccounted-for epistemic uncertainties. Reducing\nthe uncertainties may not guarantee the removal of miscalibration due to the\npresence of such excessive correlations, yet this is a problem for conventional\ndeep learning methods rather than CLAP. These discussions underscore the\nrobustness of CLAP for obtaining photometric redshift probability densities\nrequired by astrophysical and cosmological applications. This is the first\npaper in our series on CLAP.",

Despite\nthese successes, LLMs often produce inaccuracies, commonly referred to as\nhallucinations. Prompt engineering, the process of designing and formulating\ninstructions for LLMs to perform specific tasks, has emerged as a key approach\nto mitigating hallucinations. This paper provides a comprehensive empirical\nevaluation of different prompting strategies and frameworks aimed at reducing\nhallucinations in LLMs. Various prompting techniques are applied to a broad set\nof benchmark datasets to assess the accuracy and hallucination rate of each\nmethod. Additionally, the paper investigates the influence of tool-calling\nagents (LLMs augmented with external tools to enhance their capabilities beyond\nlanguage generation) on hallucination rates in the same benchmarks.

To address this, prior work has proposed a\nframework that learns a matching mechanism from examples, using a parameterized\nfamily that satisfies properties such as stability. However, despite its\nusefulness, this framework does not guarantee strategy-proofness (SP), and\ncannot handle varying numbers of agents or incorporate publicly available\ncontextual information about agents, both of which are crucial in real-world\napplications. In this paper, we propose a new parametrized family of matching\nmechanisms that always satisfy strategy-proofness, are applicable for an\narbitrary number of agents, and deal with public contextual information of\nagents, based on the serial dictatorship (SD). This family is represented by\nNeuralSD, a novel neural network architecture based on SD, where agent rankings\nin SD are treated as learnable parameters computed from agents' contexts using\nan attention-based sub-network. To enable learning, we introduce tensor serial\ndictatorship (TSD), a differentiable relaxation of SD using tensor operations.\nThis allows NeuralSD to be trained end-to-end from example matchings while\nsatisfying SP.

    "abstract": "Unlike quasi-static robotic manipulation tasks like pick-and-place, dynamic\ntasks such as non-prehensile manipulation pose greater challenges, especially\nfor vision-based control. Successful control requires the extraction of\nfeatures relevant to the target task. In visual imitation learning settings,\nthese features can be learnt by backpropagating the policy loss through the\nvision backbone. Yet, this approach tends to learn task-specific features with\nlimited generalizability. Alternatively, learning world models can realize more\ngeneralizable vision backbones. Utilizing the learnt features, task-specific\npolicies are subsequently trained. Commonly, these models are trained solely to\npredict the next RGB state from the current state and action taken. But\nonly-RGB prediction might not fully-capture the task-relevant dynamics. In this\nwork, we hypothesize that direct supervision of target dynamic states (Dynamics\nMapping) can learn better dynamics-informed world models. Beside the next RGB\nreconstruction, the world model is also trained to directly predict position,\nvelocity, and acceleration of environment rigid bodies. To verify our\nhypothesis, we designed a non-prehensile 2D environment tailored to two tasks:\n\"Balance-Reaching\" and \"Bin-Dropping\". When trained on the first task, dynamics\nmapping enhanced the task performance under different training configurations\n(Decoupled, Joint, End-to-End) and policy architectures (Feedforward,\nRecurrent). Notably, its most significant impact was for world model\npretraining boosting the success rate from 21% to 85%. Although frozen\ndynamics-informed world models could generalize well to a task with in-domain\ndynamics, but poorly to a one with out-of-domain dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The autonomous exploration of environments by multi-robot systems is a\ncritical task with broad applications in rescue missions, exploration\nendeavors, and beyond. Current approaches often rely on either greedy frontier\nselection or end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, yet these\nmethods are frequently hampered by limitations such as short-sightedness,\noverlooking long-term implications, and convergence difficulties stemming from\nthe intricate high-dimensional learning space. To address these challenges,\nthis paper introduces an innovative integration strategy that combines the\nlow-dimensional action space efficiency of frontier-based methods with the\nfar-sightedness and optimality of DRL-based approaches. We propose a\nthree-tiered planning framework that first identifies frontiers in free space,\ncreating a sparse map representation that lightens data transmission burdens\nand reduces the DRL action space's dimensionality. Subsequently, we develop a\nmulti-graph neural network (mGNN) that incorporates states of potential targets\nand robots, leveraging policy-based reinforcement learning to compute\naffinities, thereby superseding traditional heuristic utility values. Lastly,\nwe implement local routing planning through subsequence search, which avoids\nexhaustive sequence traversal.

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the problem of finding Pareto optimal policies in\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning problems with cooperative reward structures.\nWe show that any algorithm where each agent only optimizes their reward is\nsubject to suboptimal convergence. Therefore, to achieve Pareto optimality,\nagents have to act altruistically by considering the rewards of others. This\nobservation bridges the multi-objective optimization framework and multi-agent\nreinforcement learning together. We first propose a framework for applying the\nMultiple Gradient Descent algorithm (MGDA) for learning in multi-agent\nsettings. We further show that standard MGDA is subjected to weak Pareto\nconvergence, a problem that is often overlooked in other learning settings but\nis prevalent in multi-agent reinforcement learning. To mitigate this issue, we\npropose MGDA++, an improvement of the existing algorithm to handle the weakly\noptimal convergence of MGDA properly. Theoretically, we prove that MGDA++\nconverges to strong Pareto optimal solutions in convex, smooth bi-objective\nproblems. We further demonstrate the superiority of our MGDA++ in cooperative\nsettings in the Gridworld benchmark. The results highlight that our proposed\nmethod can converge efficiently and outperform the other methods in terms of\nthe optimality of the convergent policies.

We utilize the matched filter algorithm to identify extratidal structures\nin the surrounding sky of NGC 4147.

    "abstract": "When machine learning is used for Android malware detection, an app needs to\nbe represented in a numerical format for training and testing. We identify a\nwidespread occurrence of distinct Android apps that have identical or nearly\nidentical app representations. In particular, among app samples in the testing\ndataset, there can be a significant percentage of apps that have an identical\nor nearly identical representation to an app in the training dataset. This will\nlead to a data leakage problem that inflates a machine learning model's\nperformance as measured on the testing dataset. The data leakage not only could\nlead to overly optimistic perceptions on the machine learning models' ability\nto generalize beyond the data on which they are trained, in some cases it could\nalso lead to qualitatively different conclusions being drawn from the research.\nWe present two case studies to illustrate this impact. In the first case study,\nthe data leakage inflated the performance results but did not impact the\noverall conclusions made by the researchers in a qualitative way. In the second\ncase study, the data leakage problem would have led to qualitatively different\nconclusions being drawn from the research. We further examine the real-world\nimpact of the data leakage by dissecting the capability of memorization and the\ncapability of generalization of a machine learning model, and show that by\nremoving leakage from testing data, the evaluation results better reflect the\nmachine learning model's utility in real-world Android malware detection\nscenarios.",

With\nsuch consideration, an effective automatic classification of these\nabnormalities from a video capsule endoscopy (VCE) frame is crucial for\nimprovement in diagnostic workflows.\n  The work presents the process of developing and evaluating a novel model\ndesigned to classify gastrointestinal anomalies from a VCE video frame.\nIntegration of Omni Dimensional Gated Attention (OGA) mechanism and Wavelet\ntransformation techniques into the model's architecture allowed the model to\nfocus on the most critical areas in the endoscopy images, reducing noise and\nirrelevant features. This is particularly advantageous in capsule endoscopy,\nwhere images often contain a high degree of variability in texture and color.\nWavelet transformations contributed by efficiently capturing spatial and\nfrequency-domain information, improving feature extraction, especially for\ndetecting subtle features from the VCE frames. Furthermore, the features\nextracted from the Stationary Wavelet Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform\nare concatenated channel-wise to capture multiscale features, which are\nessential for detecting polyps, ulcerations, and bleeding. This approach\nimproves classification accuracy on imbalanced capsule endoscopy datasets. The\nproposed model achieved 92.76% and 91.19% as training and validation accuracies\nrespectively.

Further, we propose a novel dynamic working process exploiting the\ntrained MADRL algorithm, which enables distributed RISs to configure their own\npassive precoding independently. Simulation results show that our algorithm\nsubstantially reduces the computational complexity by a time reduction of three\norders of magnitude at the cost of 3% performance degradation, compared with\nthe optimization-based method, and achieves 6% performance improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art MADRL algorithms.",

In contrast, Bayesian inference-based algorithms excel in providing\ninterpretable predictions and reliable uncertainty estimation in these\nscenarios. While many state-of-the-art in-memory computing (IMC) architectures\nleverage emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies to offer unparalleled\ncomputing capacity and energy efficiency for neural network workloads, their\napplication in Bayesian inference is limited. This is because the core\noperations in Bayesian inference differ significantly from the\nmultiplication-accumulation (MAC) operations common in neural networks,\nrendering them generally unsuitable for direct implementation in most existing\nIMC designs. In this paper, we propose FeBiM, an efficient and compact Bayesian\ninference engine powered by multi-bit ferroelectric field-effect transistor\n(FeFET)-based IMC. FeBiM effectively encodes the trained probabilities of a\nBayesian inference model within a compact FeFET-based crossbar. It maps\nquantized logarithmic probabilities to discrete FeFET states. As a result, the\naccumulated outputs of the crossbar naturally represent the posterior\nprobabilities, i.e., the Bayesian inference model's output given a set of\nobservations. This approach enables efficient in-memory Bayesian inference\nwithout the need for additional calculation circuitry. As the first FeFET-based\nin-memory Bayesian inference engine, FeBiM achieves an impressive storage\ndensity of 26.32 Mb/mm$^{2}$ and a computing efficiency of 581.40 TOPS/W in a\nrepresentative Bayesian classification task.

    "abstract": "High dimensional dynamics play a vital role in brain function, ecological\nsystems, and neuro-inspired machine learning. Where and how these dynamics are\nconfined in the phase space remains challenging to solve. Here, we provide an\nanalytic argument that the confinement region is an M-shape when the neural\ndynamics show a diversity, with two sharp boundaries and a flat low-density\nregion in between. Despite increasing synaptic strengths in a neural circuit,\nthe shape remains qualitatively the same, while the left boundary is\ncontinuously pushed away. However, in deep chaotic regions, an arch-shaped\nconfinement gradually emerges. Our theory is supported by numerical simulations\non finite-sized networks. This analytic theory opens up a geometric route\ntowards addressing fundamental questions about high dimensional non-equilibrium\ndynamics.",

    "abstract": "Holographic displays are a promising technology for immersive visual\nexperiences, and their potential for compact form factor makes them a strong\ncandidate for head-mounted displays. However, at the short propagation\ndistances needed for a compact, head-mounted architecture, image contrast is\nlow when using a traditional phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM). Although\na complex SLM could restore contrast, these modulators require bulky lenses to\noptically co-locate the amplitude and phase components, making them poorly\nsuited for a compact head-mounted design. In this work, we introduce a novel\narchitecture to improve contrast: by adding a low resolution amplitude SLM a\nshort distance away from the phase modulator, we demonstrate peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio improvement up to 31 dB in simulation compared to\nphase-only, even when the amplitude modulator is 60$\\times$ lower resolution\nthan its phase counterpart. We analyze the relationship between diffraction\nangle and amplitude modulator pixel size, and validate the concept with a\nbenchtop experimental prototype. By showing that low resolution modulation is\nsufficient to improve contrast, we pave the way towards practical high-contrast\nholography in a compact form factor.",

We validate our model\nusing commonly used seismological metrics, and performance metrics from image\ngeneration studies. Our results demonstrate that our openly available model can\ngenerate distributions of realistic high-frequency seismic waveforms across a\nwide range of input parameters, even in data-sparse regions. For the scalar\nground motion statistics commonly used in seismic hazard and earthquake\nengineering studies, we show that the model accurately reproduces both the\nmedian trends of the real data and its variability.

This paper addresses the problem of VPR, which involves\naccurately recognizing the location corresponding to a given query image. A\npopular approach to vision-based place recognition relies on low-level visual\nfeatures. Despite significant progress in recent years, place recognition based\non low-level visual features is challenging when there are changes in scene\nappearance. To address this, end-to-end training approaches have been proposed\nto overcome the limitations of hand-crafted features.

These rare processes are largely suppressed in the Standard Model\n(SM) and are strong indicators for new physics scenarios beyond the SM. In our\nstudy, we have analyzed the cross sections of the $ \\gamma q {\\rightarrow} t\n{\\gamma}$ subprocess for two different center-of-mass energies, 17.3 TeV and\n24.5 TeV, at the Future Circular Collider (FCC-${\\mu}$p) collider.

In light of these\nfindings, it can be stated that the FCC-${\\mu}$p collider offers significant\npotential for discovering new physics which represents a sensitivity\nimprovement over the current experimental limits from CMS, enhancing\nsensitivity by approximately 30\\%.Moreover, it has been demonstrated that\nhigher centre-of-mass energies and integrated luminosity values significantly\nenhance the discovery potential of these rare processes.

    "abstract": "Double difference earthquake relocation is an essential component of many\nearthquake catalog development workflows. This technique produces\nhigh-resolution relative relocations between events by minimizing differential\nmeasurements of the arrival times of waves from nearby sources, which\nhighlights the resolution of faults and improves interpretation of seismic\nactivity. The inverse problem is typically solved iteratively using\nconjugate-gradient minimization, however the cost scales significantly with the\ntotal number of sources and stations considered. Here we propose a Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) based earthquake double-difference relocation framework, Graph\nDouble Difference (GraphDD), that is trained to minimize the double-difference\nresiduals of a catalog to locate earthquakes. Through batching and sampling the\nmethod can scale to arbitrarily large catalogs. Our architecture uses one graph\nto represent the stations, a second graph to represent the sources, and creates\nthe Cartesian product graph between the two graphs to capture the relationships\nbetween the stations and sources (e.g., the residuals and travel time partial\nderivatives). This key feature allows a natural architecture that can be used\nto minimize the double-difference residuals. We implement our model on several\ndistinct test cases including seismicity from northern California, Turkiye, and\nnorthern Chile, which have highly variable data quality, and station and source\ndistributions. We obtain high resolution relocations in these tests, and our\nmodel shows adaptability to variable types of loss functions and location\nobjectives, including learning station corrections and mapping into the\nreference frame of a different catalog. Our results suggest that a GNN approach\nto double-difference relocation is a promising direction for scaling to very\nlarge catalogs and gaining new insights into the relocation problem.",

    "abstract": "The limited context window of contemporary large language models (LLMs)\nremains a huge barrier to their broader application across various domains.\nWhile continual pre-training on long-context data is a straightforward and\neffective solution, it incurs substantial costs in terms of data acquisition\nand computational resources. To alleviate this issue, we propose SharedLLM, a\nnovel approach grounded in the design philosophy of multi-grained context\ncompression and query-aware information retrieval. SharedLLM is composed of two\nshort-context LLMs such as LLaMA-2, termed upper model and lower model. The\nlower model functions as a compressor while the upper model acts as a decoder.\nThe upper model receives compressed, multi-grained context information from the\nlower model and performs context-aware modeling on the running text.\nInformation transfer between the compressor and decoder occurs only at the\nlowest layers to refrain from long forward paths in the lower model and\nredundant cross-attention modules in the upper model. Based on this\narchitecture, we introduce a specialized tree-style data structure to\nefficiently encode, store and retrieve multi-grained contextual information for\ntext chunks. This structure, combined with a search algorithm, enables rapid\nencoding and retrieval of relevant information from various levels of the tree\nbased on the input query. This entire process, wherein the sender and receiver\nare derived from the same LLM layer, is referred to as self-injection.",

    "abstract": "The growing use of large language model (LLM)-based chatbots has raised\nconcerns about fairness. Fairness issues in LLMs can lead to severe\nconsequences, such as bias amplification, discrimination, and harm to\nmarginalized communities. While existing fairness benchmarks mainly focus on\nsingle-turn dialogues, multi-turn scenarios, which in fact better reflect\nreal-world conversations, present greater challenges due to conversational\ncomplexity and potential bias accumulation. In this paper, we propose a\ncomprehensive fairness benchmark for LLMs in multi-turn dialogue scenarios,\n\\textbf{FairMT-Bench}. Specifically, we formulate a task taxonomy targeting LLM\nfairness capabilities across three stages: context understanding, user\ninteraction, and instruction trade-offs, with each stage comprising two tasks.\nTo ensure coverage of diverse bias types and attributes, we draw from existing\nfairness datasets and employ our template to construct a multi-turn dialogue\ndataset, \\texttt{FairMT-10K}. For evaluation, GPT-4 is applied, alongside bias\nclassifiers including Llama-Guard-3 and human validation to ensure robustness.\nExperiments and analyses on \\texttt{FairMT-10K} reveal that in multi-turn\ndialogue scenarios, current LLMs are more likely to generate biased responses,\nand there is significant variation in performance across different tasks and\nmodels. Based on this, we curate a challenging dataset, \\texttt{FairMT-1K}, and\ntest 15 current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on this dataset. The results show\nthe current state of fairness in LLMs and showcase the utility of this novel\napproach for assessing fairness in more realistic multi-turn dialogue contexts,\ncalling for future work to focus on LLM fairness improvement and the adoption\nof \\texttt{FairMT-1K} in such efforts.",

Existing frameworks accelerate training by applying FP8 computation\nto linear layers while leaving optimizer states and activations in higher\nprecision, which fails to fully optimize memory usage. This paper introduces\nCOAT (Compressing Optimizer States and Activations for FP8 Training), a novel\nFP8 training framework designed to significantly reduce memory footprint when\ntraining large models. COAT addresses current limitations through two key\ninnovations: (1) Dynamic Range Expansion, which aligns optimizer state\ndistributions more closely with the FP8 representation range, thereby reducing\nquantization error, and (2) Mixed-Granularity Activation Quantization, which\noptimizes activation memory using a combination of per-tensor and per-group\nquantization strategies. Experiments demonstrate that COAT effectively reduces\nend-to-end training memory footprint by 1.54x compared to BF16 while achieving\nnearly lossless performance across various tasks, such as Large Language Model\npretraining and fine-tuning and Vision Language Model training. COAT also\nachieves a 1.43x end-to-end training speedup compared to BF16, performing on\npar with or surpassing TransformerEngine's speedup.

To do so, TEARS uses a modern LLM to generate user\nsummaries based on user preferences. We find the summaries capture user\npreferences uniquely. Using these summaries, we take a hybrid approach where we\nuse an optimal transport procedure to align the summaries' representation with\nthe learned representation of a standard VAE for collaborative filtering.

Although\nthere is a growing literature on the importance of numerical resolution for the\naccurate recovery of the mass loss rates of dark matter (DM) haloes, there has\nbeen no comparable investigation into the numerical resolution required to\naccurately recover stellar mass loss rates in galaxy clusters.\n  Using N-body simulations of satellite galaxies orbiting in a cluster halo\nrepresented by a static external potential, we conduct a set of convergence\ntests in order to explore the role of numerical resolution and force softening\nlength on stellar stripping efficiency. We consider a number of orbital\nconfigurations, satellite masses and satellite morphologies. We find that\nstellar mass resolution is of minor importance relative to DM resolution.\nResolving the central regions of satellite DM halos is critical to accurately\nrecover stellar mass loss rates. Poorly resolved DM haloes develop cored inner\nprofiles and, if this core is of comparable size to the stellar component of\nthe satellite galaxy, this leads to significant over-stripping.

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning in stock prediction has become an important branch.\nImage-based methods show potential by capturing complex visual patterns and\nspatial correlations, offering advantages in interpretability over time series\nmodels. However, image-based approaches are more prone to overfitting,\nhindering robust predictive performance. To improve accuracy, this paper\nproposes a novel method, named Sequence-based Multi-scale Fusion Regression\nConvolutional Neural Network (SMSFR-CNN), for predicting stock price movements\nin the China A-share market.\n  By utilizing CNN to learn sequential features and combining them with image\nfeatures, we improve the accuracy of stock trend prediction on the A-share\nmarket stock dataset. This approach reduces the search space for image\nfeatures, stabilizes, and accelerates the training process. Extensive\ncomparative experiments on 4,454 A-share stocks show that the model achieves a\n61.15% positive predictive value and a 63.37% negative predictive value for the\nnext 5 days, resulting in a total profit of 165.09%.",

In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy called\nPrereq-Tune to address this knowledge inconsistency and reduce hallucinations.\nFundamentally, Prereq-Tune disentangles the learning of skills and knowledge,\nso the model learns only the task skills without being impacted by the\nknowledge inconsistency. To achieve this, Prereq-Tune introduces an additional\nprerequisite learning stage to learn the necessary knowledge for SFT, allowing\nsubsequent SFT to focus only on task skills. Prereq-Tune can also be combined\nwith fictitious synthetic data to enhance the grounding of LLM outputs to their\ninternal knowledge.

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) is a non-invasive imaging\ntechnique for studying metabolism and has become a crucial tool for\nunderstanding neurological diseases, cancers and diabetes. High spatial\nresolution MRSI is needed to characterize lesions, but in practice MRSI is\nacquired at low resolution due to time and sensitivity restrictions caused by\nthe low metabolite concentrations. Therefore, there is an imperative need for a\npost-processing approach to generate high-resolution MRSI from low-resolution\ndata that can be acquired fast and with high sensitivity. Deep learning-based\nsuper-resolution methods provided promising results for improving the spatial\nresolution of MRSI, but they still have limited capability to generate accurate\nand high-quality images. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated superior\nlearning capability than other generative models in various tasks, but sampling\nfrom diffusion models requires iterating through a large number of diffusion\nsteps, which is time-consuming. This work introduces a Flow-based Truncated\nDenoising Diffusion Model (FTDDM) for super-resolution MRSI, which shortens the\ndiffusion process by truncating the diffusion chain, and the truncated steps\nare estimated using a normalizing flow-based network. The network is\nconditioned on upscaling factors to enable multi-scale super-resolution. To\ntrain and evaluate the deep learning models, we developed a 1H-MRSI dataset\nacquired from 25 high-grade glioma patients. We demonstrate that FTDDM\noutperforms existing generative models while speeding up the sampling process\nby over 9-fold compared to the baseline diffusion model. Neuroradiologists'\nevaluations confirmed the clinical advantages of our method, which also\nsupports uncertainty estimation and sharpness adjustment, extending its\npotential clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is an advanced area of computing that leverages the\nprinciples of quantum mechanics. Quantum computing holds the potential to\nrevolutionize various fields by handling problems that are currently\nintractable for classical computers. This research focuses on Variational\nQuantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.\nWe introduce and evaluate over-rotation and under-rotation errors in the\nmeasurement process, which are critical for obtaining accurate expectation\nvalues of Hamiltonians. Our study aims to determine the extent to which these\nerrors affect the estimated ground state energy and the computational cost in\nterms of optimization iterations. We conducted experiments on H2 and HeH+\nmolecules, varying the rotation angle, and recorded the estimated energy and\noptimization iterations. Our findings indicate that the pulse-level VQE\nalgorithm exhibits resilience to quantum errors in terms of accuracy.\nAdditionally, our results suggest that less frequent calibration of measurement\nrotation pulses may be sufficient, thereby saving substantial time and\ncomputational resources. However, it is important to note that while accuracy\nremains stable, the iteration count may still vary, necessitating a trade-off\nbetween calibration frequency and computational cost. Our work complements\nprevious research by focusing on the observable aspect of VQEs, which has been\nlargely overlooked.

    "abstract": "Current multimodal recommendation models have extensively explored the\neffective utilization of multimodal information; however, their reliance on ID\nembeddings remains a performance bottleneck. Even with the assistance of\nmultimodal information, optimizing ID embeddings remains challenging for\nID-based Multimodal Recommender when interaction data is sparse. Furthermore,\nthe unique nature of item-specific ID embeddings hinders the information\nexchange among related items and the spatial requirement of ID embeddings\nincreases with the scale of item. Based on these limitations, we propose an\nID-free MultimOdal TOken Representation scheme named MOTOR that represents each\nitem using learnable multimodal tokens and connects them through shared tokens.\nSpecifically, we first employ product quantization to discretize each item's\nmultimodal features (e.g., images, text) into discrete token IDs. We then\ninterpret the token embeddings corresponding to these token IDs as implicit\nitem features, introducing a new Token Cross Network to capture the implicit\ninteraction patterns among these tokens. The resulting representations can\nreplace the original ID embeddings and transform the original ID-based\nmultimodal recommender into ID-free system, without introducing any additional\nloss design. MOTOR reduces the overall space requirements of these models,\nfacilitating information interaction among related items, while also\nsignificantly enhancing the model's recommendation capability. Extensive\nexperiments on nine mainstream models demonstrate the significant performance\nimprovement achieved by MOTOR, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing\nmultimodal recommendation systems.",

While lightweight LLMs\nhave been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model\naccuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by\nselectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full\nmodel in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are\ncritically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with\nsevere IOPS constraints.\n  In this paper, we propose Ripple, a novel approach that accelerates LLM\ninference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Ripple\nleverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently\nactivated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize\ndata transfer efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an\noffline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation\npatterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching\nstrategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted\non a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to\n5.93x improvements in I/O latency compared to the state-of-the-art.

The imaging using sparse u-v\ndata requires detailed scrutiny of the PSF. The estimated shadow diameter (48.7\n+- 7 muas) is equal to the spacing between the main beam and the first sidelobe\nof the PSF (49.09 muas), which immediately suggests a potential problem in the\ndeconvolution of the PSF. We show that the ring image can be derived from\nnon-ring simulated datasets (noise only; point source) with a narrow\nField-of-View (FOV) and an assumed self-calibration suggesting the EHT2017's\nu-v coverage is insufficient for reliable imaging. The EHTC analysis, based on\ncalibrations with assumptions about the source's size and properties, selected\nthe final image by prioritizing appearance rate of the similar structure from a\nlarge imaging parameter space over data consistency. Our independent analysis\nwith the conventional hybrid mapping reveals an elongated east-west structure,\nconsistent with previous observations. We believe it to be more reliable than\nthe EHTC image, due to half the residuals in normalized visibility amplitude.\nThe eastern half is brighter, possibly due to a Doppler boost from the rapid\nrotating disk.

In\nthis paper we show that finite temperature can assist in accessing parts of the\nphase diagram that otherwise appear hard to realise due to excessively large\ndensities and number of atoms being required. These include honeycomb and\nstripe phases both in the thermodynamic limit as well as with a finite extent\nusing both variational and numerical calculations. We account for the effect of\nthermal fluctuations by means of Bogoliubov theory employing the local density\napproximation.

We consider that the observed high [Ba/Fe] ($\\sim$ 1.3)\nis due to the chemical enrichment of giant molecular clouds by either\ncollapsars, neutron star mergers, or magneto-rotational supernovae, and thereby\ninvestigate which of the three polluters can best reproduce the observed\n[Ba/Fe]. Since it is found that collapsars can best reproduce such an extremely\nhigh Ba abundance, we numerically investigate the star cluster formation in\nNGC1569 using chemodynamical simulations of merging dwarf galaxies with\nchemical enrichment by collapsars. The principal results are as follows. First,\na cluster of the same scale as NGC1569-B was found to match both the observed\n[Ba/Fe] and [Fe/H] values, the best cluster having [Ba/Fe]= 1.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 and\n[Fe/H] = $-$0.7 $\\pm$ 0.2. This simulation used a core-collapse supernova per\ncollapsar rate of 70, a standard initial mass function and an initial\nmetallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.5. Second, a prediction of the Eu abundance of\nNGC1569-B is made: [Eu/Fe]= 1.9 $\\pm$ 0.2. These results are shown to be\ninvariant under a change in the orbit parameters used for the merger. The need\nfor a merger to promote the star formation that leads to the synthesis of the\nBa and the star cluster formation is confirmed. Collapsars can not only better\nexplain [Ba/Fe] but also be consistent with the observed star formation rate\nand stellar mass of the dwarf galaxy.",

Given a quasi-metric $D$\non a set $T$ of terminals, does there exist a directed Okamura-Seymour graph\nthat realizes $D$ as the (directed) shortest-path distance metric on $T$? We\nshow that, if we are further given the circular ordering of terminals lying on\nthe boundary, then Monge property is a sufficient and necessary condition. This\ngeneralizes previous results for undirected Okamura-Seymour instances.\n  With the circular ordering, we give a greedy algorithm for constructing a\ndirected Okamura-Seymour instance that realizes the input quasi-metric. The\nalgorithm takes the dual perspective concerning flows and routings, and is\nbased on a new way of analyzing graph structures, by viewing graphs as\n\\emph{paths and their intersections}. We believe this new understanding is of\nindependent interest and will prove useful in other problems in graph theory\nand graph algorithms.\n  We also design an efficient algorithm for finding such a circular ordering\nthat makes $D$ satisfy Monge property, if one exists. Combined with our result\nabove, this gives an efficient algorithm for the distance realization problem.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based\napproaches have demonstrated strong problem-solving capabilities across various\ndomains. However, in automatic programming, a single LLM is typically limited\nto function-level code generation, while multi-agent systems composed of\nmultiple LLMs often suffer from inefficient task planning. This lack of\nstructured coordination can lead to cascading hallucinations, where accumulated\nerrors across agents result in suboptimal workflows and excessive computational\ncosts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MaCTG (Multi-Agent\nCollaborative Thought Graph), a novel multi-agent framework that employs a\ndynamic graph structure to facilitate precise task allocation and controlled\ncollaboration among LLM agents. MaCTG autonomously assigns agent roles based on\nprogramming requirements, dynamically refines task distribution through\ncontext-aware adjustments, and systematically verifies and integrates\nproject-level code, effectively reducing hallucination errors and improving\noverall accuracy. MaCTG enhances cost-effectiveness by implementing a hybrid\nLLM deployment, where proprietary models handle complex reasoning, while\nopen-source models are used for routine coding and validation tasks. To\nevaluate MaCTG's effectiveness, we applied it to traditional image processing\nauto-programming tasks, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 83.33%.\nAdditionally, by leveraging its hybrid LLM configuration, MaCTG significantly\nreduced operational costs by 89.09% compared to existing multi-agent\nframeworks, demonstrating its efficiency, scalability, and real-world\napplicability.",

In particular, independence of each element of the\nhigh-dimensional covariates plays an important role. In this study, we focus on\nhigh-dimensional linear models and covariates with block dependencies, where\nelements of covariates only within a block can be dependent, then show that\nestimators for the model maintain the universality. Specifically, we prove that\na distribution of estimators with Gaussian covariates is approximated by an\nestimator with non-Gaussian covariates with same moments, with the setup of\nblock dependence.

Its relatively low\nefficiency, however, has thus far precluded its use in a power-autonomous\nvehicle; leveraging the efficiency benefits of operation close to a fixed\nsurface is a potential solution. While proximity effects like the ground and\nceiling effects have been well-investigated for rotorcraft and flapping wing\nmicro air vehicles, they have not been for electroaerodynamically-propelled\nfliers. In this work, we investigate the change in performance when\ncentimeter-scale thrusters are operated close to a \"ceiling\" plane about the\ninlet. We show a surprising and, until now, unreported effect; a major\nelectrostatic attractive component, analogous to electroadhesive pressure but\ninstead mediated by a stable atmospheric plasma. The isolated electrostatic and\nfluid dynamic components of the ceiling effect are shown for different\ndistances from the plane and for different materials. We further show that a\nflange attached to the inlet can vastly increase both components of force. A\npeak efficiency improvement of 600% is shown close to the ceiling.

    "abstract": "The development of person search techniques has been greatly promoted in\nrecent years for its superior practicality and challenging goals. Despite their\nsignificant progress, existing person search models still lack the ability to\ncontinually learn from increaseing real-world data and adaptively process input\nfrom different domains. To this end, this work introduces the continual person\nsearch task that sequentially learns on multiple domains and then performs\nperson search on all seen domains. This requires balancing the stability and\nplasticity of the model to continually learn new knowledge without catastrophic\nforgetting. For this, we propose a Prompt-based Continual Person Search (PoPS)\nmodel in this paper. First, we design a compositional person search transformer\nto construct an effective pre-trained transformer without exhaustive\npre-training from scratch on large-scale person search data. This serves as the\nfundamental for prompt-based continual learning. On top of that, we design a\ndomain incremental prompt pool with a diverse attribute matching module. For\neach domain, we independently learn a set of prompts to encode the\ndomain-oriented knowledge. Meanwhile, we jointly learn a group of diverse\nattribute projections and prototype embeddings to capture discriminative domain\nattributes. By matching an input image with the learned attributes across\ndomains, the learned prompts can be properly selected for model inference.\nExtensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method for\ncontinual person search.

    "abstract": "We propose and analyze a new data-driven trade-off (TRO) approach for\nmodeling uncertainty that serves as a middle ground between the optimistic\napproach, which adopts a distributional belief, and the pessimistic\ndistributionally robust optimization approach, which hedges against\ndistributional ambiguity. We equip the TRO model with a TRO ambiguity set\ncharacterized by a size parameter controlling the level of optimism and a shape\nparameter representing distributional ambiguity. We first show that\nconstructing the TRO ambiguity set using a general star-shaped shape parameter\nwith the empirical distribution as its star center is necessary and sufficient\nto guarantee the hierarchical structure of the sequence of TRO ambiguity sets.\nThen, we analyze the properties of the TRO model, including quantifying\nconservatism, quantifying bias and generalization error, and establishing\nasymptotic properties. Specifically, we show that the TRO model could generate\na spectrum of decisions, ranging from optimistic to conservative decisions.\nAdditionally, we show that it could produce an unbiased estimator of the true\noptimal value. Furthermore, we establish the almost-sure convergence of the\noptimal value and the set of optimal solutions of the TRO model to their true\ncounterparts. We exemplify our theoretical results using an inventory control\nproblem and a portfolio optimization problem.",

Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a\nreinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in\nthe decoding phase.

We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets\nusing proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and\nMixtral-8*7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the\nproxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in\nan average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of\n90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our\nstrategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative\ndecrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches\n91.3%.

HLS enables FPGA design with software\nprogramming languages by compiling the source code into an FPGA circuit. The\nsource code includes a program (called \"kernel\") and several pragmas that\ninstruct hardware synthesis, such as parallelization, pipeline, etc. While it\nis relatively easy for software developers to design the program, it heavily\nrelies on hardware knowledge to design the pragmas, posing a big challenge for\nsoftware developers. Recently, different machine learning algorithms, such as\nGNNs, have been proposed to automate the pragma design via performance\nprediction. However, when applying the trained model on new kernels, the\nsignificant domain shift often leads to unsatisfactory performance. We propose\na more domain-generalizable model structure: a two-level hierarchical Mixture\nof Experts (MoE), that can be flexibly adapted to any GNN model. Different\nexpert networks can learn to deal with different regions in the representation\nspace, and they can utilize similar patterns between the old kernels and new\nkernels. In the low-level MoE, we apply MoE on three natural granularities of a\nprogram: node, basic block, and graph. The high-level MoE learns to aggregate\nthe three granularities for the final decision. To train the hierarchical MoE\nstably, we further propose a two-stage training method to avoid expert\npolarization. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nhierarchical MoE.

For concreteness, we consider the $N$naturalness model, which\nis a proposed mechanism to solve the Higgs hierarchy problem. In this\nframework, the sector of particles of the Standard Model is copied $N$ times\nwhere the Higgs mass-squared value is the only parameter that changes between\nsectors. The other sectors are similar to our own, except their particles are\nproportionally heavier and cooler compared to the Standard Model sector. Since\neach sector is extremely weakly coupled to other sectors, direct observations\nof the new particles are not expected. The addition of new photon-like species\nand new neutrino-like species, however, can be detected through the CMB and in\nLSS data. These additional neutrinos form a tower of states with increasing\nmass and decreasing temperature compared to the SM neutrinos. This tower causes\na more gradual suppression of the matter power spectrum across different\ncomoving wavenumbers than a single warm dark matter state would. We\nquantitatively explore these effects in the $N$naturalness model and compute\nthe parameter space allowed by the Planck 2018, weak lensing, and\nLyman-$\\alpha$ datasets. Depending on the underlying parameters, Planck 2018\nand weak lensing data can require $N$naturalness to be tuned at the $10\\%$\nlevel for Dirac neutrinos and at the $5\\%$ level for Majorana neutrinos. The\nadditional neutrino states are crucial in constraining the model, particularly\nthrough their suppression of the power spectrum at small scales.

    "abstract": "As service robots become more general-purpose, they will need to adapt to\ntheir users' preferences over a large set of all possible tasks that they can\nperform. This includes preferences regarding which actions the users prefer to\ndelegate to robots as opposed to doing themselves. Existing personalization\napproaches require task-specific data for each user. To handle diversity across\nall household tasks and users, and nuances in user preferences across tasks, we\npropose to learn a task adaptation function independently, which can be used in\ntandem with any universal robot policy to customize robot behavior. We create\nTask Adaptation using Abstract Concepts (TAACo) framework. TAACo can learn to\npredict the user's preferred manner of assistance with any given task, by\nmediating reasoning through a representation composed of abstract concepts\nbuilt based on user feedback. TAACo can generalize to an open set of household\ntasks from small amount of user feedback and explain its inferences through\nintuitive concepts. We evaluate our model on a dataset we collected of 5\npeople's preferences, and show that TAACo outperforms GPT-4 by 16% and a\nrule-based system by 54%, on prediction accuracy, with 40 samples of user\nfeedback.",

    "abstract": "Academic paper search is an essential task for efficient literature discovery\nand scientific advancement. While dense retrieval has advanced various ad-hoc\nsearches, it often struggles to match the underlying academic concepts between\nqueries and documents, which is critical for paper search. To enable effective\nacademic concept matching for paper search, we propose Taxonomy-guided Semantic\nIndexing (TaxoIndex) framework. TaxoIndex extracts key concepts from papers and\norganizes them as a semantic index guided by an academic taxonomy, and then\nleverages this index as foundational knowledge to identify academic concepts\nand link queries and documents. As a plug-and-play framework, TaxoIndex can be\nflexibly employed to enhance existing dense retrievers. Extensive experiments\nshow that TaxoIndex brings significant improvements, even with highly limited\ntraining data, and greatly enhances interpretability.",
