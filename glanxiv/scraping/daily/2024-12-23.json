    "abstract": "Benchmarking modern large language models (LLMs) on complex and realistic\ntasks is critical to advancing their development. In this work, we evaluate the\nfactual accuracy and citation performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on the task\nof Question Answering (QA) in ambiguous settings with source citations. Using\nthree recently published datasets-DisentQA-DupliCite, DisentQA-ParaCite, and\nAmbigQA-Cite-featuring a range of real-world ambiguities, we analyze the\nperformance of two leading LLMs, GPT-4o-mini and Claude-3.5. Our results show\nthat larger, recent models consistently predict at least one correct answer in\nambiguous contexts but fail to handle cases with multiple valid answers.\nAdditionally, all models perform equally poorly in citation generation, with\ncitation accuracy consistently at 0. However, introducing conflict-aware\nprompting leads to large improvements, enabling models to better address\nmultiple valid answers and improve citation accuracy, while maintaining their\nability to predict correct answers. These findings highlight the challenges and\nopportunities in developing LLMs that can handle ambiguity and provide reliable\nsource citations. Our benchmarking study provides critical insights and sets a\nfoundation for future improvements in trustworthy and interpretable QA systems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the null and approximate controllability, along with\nthe existence of insensitizing controls, for a class of coupled systems\ndescribed by two linear forward stochastic parabolic equations. The first\nobjective is to identify controls that achieve the null and approximate\ncontrollability for these systems at a fixed final control time. The second\ngoal is to find controls such that a functional of the states becomes locally\ninsensitive to perturbations in the initial data. To achieve this, we introduce\nthree controls: one localized in space to affect the drift term of the first\nequation, and two additional controls that influence the diffusion terms of\nboth equations. Moreover, we reduce the insensitizing control problem to a null\ncontrollability problem for a cascade system of coupled forward-backward\nstochastic parabolic systems. By the classical duality argument, our\ncontrollability problem for the forward system (resp., forward-backward\nsystems) is equivalent to an observability problem for the corresponding\nadjoint backward system (resp., backward-forward systems). The observability\nproblems are then addressed by deriving new global Carleman estimates.",

HUCA employs hierarchical\nactor-critic networks to dynamically reduce electricity costs in buildings,\naccounting for the needs of EV charging in the dynamic pricing scenario.

Experiments on real-world\nelectricity datasets under both simulated certain and uncertain departure\nscenarios demonstrate that HUCA outperforms baselines in terms of total\nelectricity costs while maintaining competitive performance in fulfilling EV\ncharging requirements.

In this\npaper, we propose a practical inference framework for extracting\nstatus-to-event knowledge within smart building. Our proposal includes\nIoT-based API integration, ontology model design, and time probability\ndependent knowledge extraction methods. The Building Topology Ontology (BOT)\nwas leveraged to construct spatial relations among sensors and spaces within\nthe building. We utilized Apache Jena Fuseki's SPARQL server for storing and\nquerying the RDF triple data. Two types of knowledge could be extracted:\ntimestamp-based probability for abnormal event detection and time\ninterval-based probability for conjunction of multiple events. We conducted\nexperiments (over a 78-day period) in a real smart building environment. The\ndata of light and elevator states has been collected for evaluation.

This has the advantage that a GAN creates\ndata in a significantly reduced computing time. N training events for a GAN can\nresult in GN generated events with the gain factor, G, being more than one.\nThis appears to violate the principle that one cannot get information for free.\nThis is not the only way to amplify data so this process will be referred to as\ndata amplification which is studied using information theoretic concepts.

    "abstract": "Automated source code refactoring, particularly extract method refactoring,\nis a crucial and frequently employed technique during software development.\nDespite its importance and frequent use by practitioners, current automated\ntechniques face significant limitations. These approaches often rely on\ndevelopers to identify the precise bounds of refactoring opportunities in terms\nof source code statements. Also, they often do not capture the semantic\ncontext, resulting in offering no automated means to suggest meaningful method\nname, for instance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nreinforcement learning-based approach for fine-tuning and aligning code\nlanguage models to perform automated, intelligent extract method refactoring on\nJava source code. Our approach fine-tunes sequence-to-sequence generative\nmodels and aligns them using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.\nWe utilize code compilation and presence of the refactoring in the generated\ncode as reward signals, providing a code-centric optimization process. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the\nperformance of large language models in code refactoring, as evidenced by both\nquantitative evaluation metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and CodeBLEU, and\nqualitative measures including syntactical and functional correctness. The\nsupervised fine-tuned model, further aligned with PPO, surpasses traditional\nsupervised fine-tuning by 11.96% and 16.45% in terms of BLEU and CodeBLEU\nscores, respectively. When subjected to a suite of 122 unit tests, the number\nof successful tests increased from 41 to 66 for the reinforcement learning\naligned fine-tuned Code-T5 model, highlighting the effectiveness of our\napproach in producing functionally correct refactorings.",

Unlike established benchmarks, where each\nticker has only around two earnings, DEC provides 20 earnings records per\nticker. Using DEC, we reveal that post-earnings volatility undergoes\nsignificant shifts, with each ticker displaying a distinct volatility\ndistribution. To leverage historical post-earnings volatility and capture\nticker-specific patterns, we propose two training-free baselines: Post-earnings\nVolatility (PEV) and Same-ticker Post-earnings Volatility (STPEV). These\nbaselines surpass all transcripts-based models on DEC as well as on established\nbenchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate that current transcript\nrepresentations predominantly capture ticker identity rather than offering\nfinancially meaningful insights specific to each earnings. This is evidenced by\ntwo key observations: earnings representations from the same ticker exhibit\nsignificantly higher similarity compared to those from different tickers, and\npredictions from transcript-based models show strong correlations with prior\npost-earnings volatility.",

    "abstract": "Fundamental research on two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems based on van\nder Waals materials has been gaining traction rapidly since their recent\ndiscovery. With the increase of recent knowledge, it has become clear that such\nmaterials have also a strong potential for applications in devices that combine\nmagnetism with electronics, optics, and nanomechanics. Nonetheless, many\nchallenges still lay ahead. Several fundamental aspects of 2D magnetic\nmaterials are still unknown or poorly understood, such as their\noften-complicated electronic structure, optical properties, and magnetization\ndynamics, and their magnon spectrum. To elucidate their properties and\nfacilitate integration in devices, advanced characterization techniques and\ntheoretical frameworks need to be developed or adapted. Moreover, developing\nsynthesis methods which increase critical temperatures and achieve large-scale,\nhigh-quality homogeneous thin films is crucial before these materials can be\nused for real-world applications. Therefore, the field of 2D magnetic materials\nprovides many challenges and opportunities for the discovery and exploration of\nnew phenomena, as well as the development of new applications. This Roadmap\npresents the background, challenges, and potential research directions for\nvarious relevant topics in the field on the fundamentals, synthesis,\ncharacterization, and applications. We hope that this work can provide a strong\nstarting point for young researchers in the field and provide a general\noverview of the key challenges for more experienced researchers.",

    "abstract": "Equipment used for site investigation activities like drill rigs are\ntypically large and heavy to provide sufficient reaction mass to overcome the\nsoil's penetration resistance. The need for large and heavy equipment creates\nchallenges for performing site investigations at sites with limited\naccessibility, such as urban centres, vegetated areas, locations with height\nrestrictions and surficial soft soils, and steep slopes. Also, mobilization of\nlarge equipment to the project site is responsible for a significant portion of\nthe carbon footprint of site investigations. Successful development of self\nburrowing technology can have enormous implications for geotechnical site\ninvestigation, ranging from performance of in situ tests to installation of\ninstrumentation without the need of heavy equipment. During the last decade\nthere has been an acceleration of research in the field of bioinspired\ngeotechnics, whose premise is that certain animals and plants have developed\nefficient strategies to interact with geomaterials in ways that are analogous\nto those in geotechnical engineering. This paper provides a synthesis of\nadvances in bioinspired site investigation related to the reduction of\npenetration resistance by means of modifying the tip shape, expanding a shaft\nsection near the probe tip, applying motions to the tip like rotation and\noscillation, and injecting fluids and generation of reaction forces with\ntemporary anchors that enable self burrowing. Examples of prototypes that have\nbeen tested experimentally are highlighted. However, there are important\nresearch gaps associated with testing in a broader range of conditions,\ninterpretation of results, and development of hardware that need to be\naddressed to develop field ready equipment that can provide useful data for\ngeotechnical design.",

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel modular\nreconfigurable topology for AC batteries with coupled inductors between\nadjacent submodules. This approach dynamically manages energy distribution\nbetween energy and power modules. Under normal conditions, energy modules\noperate in series or parallel configurations to deliver stable voltage and\ncurrent, ensuring efficient power delivery. During heavy loads, such as during\nelectric-vehicle acceleration, power modules seamlessly meet additional power\ndemands beyond the energy modules' capacity. The use of mutual inductors\nreduces inductance along the load path for faster response times while\nproviding sufficient inductance to regulate circulating currents and enable\nefficient energy transfer among modules. The system's AC load further\ncomplicates control, necessitating a simple yet effective feedforward-feedback\ncontrol strategy to maintain satisfactory performance.",

Cycling DA provides a statistically optimal estimate\nof model initial conditions, given observations and previous model forecasts.\nHere, real surface pressure observations are assimilated into several popular\nML models using an ensemble Kalman filter, where accurate ensemble covariance\nestimation is essential to constrain unobserved state variables from sparse\nobservations.

We study the properties of GC candidates in\n1.25 $\\times$ 1.03 sq. degrees area centred on NGC 5018 group of galaxies using\ndeep, wide field and multi-band observations obtained with VST. We derived\nphotometric catalogues of compact and extended sources and identified GC\ncandidates using a set of photometric and morphometric selection parameters. A\nGC candidates catalogue is inspected using a statistical background\ndecontamination technique. The 2D distribution map of GC candidates reveals an\noverdensity of sources on brightest member of group, NGC 5018. No significant\nGC overdensities are observed in other bright galaxies of group. We report\ndiscovery of a candidate local nucleated LSB dwarf galaxy possibly in tidal\ninteraction with NGC 5018. The 2D map also reveals an intra-group GC population\naligning with bright galaxies and along intra-group light component. Radial\ndensity profile of GC candidates in NGC 5018 follows galaxy surface brightness\nprofile. Colour profile of GC candidates centred on this galaxy shows no\nevidence of well-known colour bimodality, which is instead observed in\nintra-group population. From GC luminosity function (GCLF) analysis, we find a\nlow specific frequency $S_{\\!\\rm N}=0.59 \\pm 0.27$ for NGC 5018, consistent\nwith previous results. This relatively low $S_{\\!\\rm N}$ and lack of colour\nbimodality might be due to a combination of observational data limitations and\nthe post-merger status of NGC 5018, which might host a population of relatively\nyoung GCs. For intra-group GC population, we obtain a lower limit of $S_{\\!\\rm\n{N,gr}}\\sim0.6$.

For example it is known to hold for a broad range of\nvariational problems with random input. Much less is known about the\nuniversality of the performance of specific algorithms for solving such\nvariational problems. Namely, do algorithms tuned to specific variational tasks\nproduce the same asymptotic answer regardless of the underlying distribution?\n  In this paper we show that the answer is yes for a class of models, which\nincludes spin glass models and constraint satisfaction problems on sparse\ngraphs, provided that an algorithm can be coded as a low-degree polynomial\n(LDP). We illustrate this specifically for the case of the Max-Cut problem in\nsparse Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi graph $\\mathbb{G}(n, d/n)$. We use the fact that the\nApproximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm, which is an effective algorithm\nfor finding near-ground state of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, is\nwell approximated by an LDP. We then establish our main universality result:\nthe performance of the LDP based algorithms exhibiting certain connectivity\nproperty, is the same in the mean-field (SK) and in the random graph\n$\\mathbb{G}(n, d/n)$ setting, up to an appropriate rescaling. The main\ntechnical challenge which we address in this paper is showing that the output\nof the LDP algorithm on $\\mathbb{G}(n, d/n)$ is truly discrete, namely it is\nclose to the set of points in the binary cube.",

We show that such t-structures\nare tensor t-structures and conversely every tensor t-structure on\n$\\mathbf{D}^b (X)$ arises in this way. We achieve this by first characterising\ntensor t-structures in terms of Thomason-Cousin filtrations which generalises\nearlier results of Alonso, Jerem\\'ias and Saor\\'in, from Noetherian rings to\nschemes. We also show that for a smooth projective curve $C$, the derived\ncategory $\\mathbf{D}^b (C)$ has no non-trivial tensor weight structures, this\nextends our earlier result on the projective line to higher genus curves.",

However, constructing a CH is an expensive\ntask. Existing solutions, including parallel ones, may suffer from long\nconstruction time. Especially, in our experiments, we observe that existing\nparallel solutions demonstrate unsatisfactory scalability, and have performance\nclose to sequential algorithms.\n  We present SPoCH (Scalable Parallelization of Contraction Hierarchies), an\nefficient and scalable CH construction algorithm in parallel. To address the\nchallenges in previous work, our improvements focus on both redesigning the\nalgorithm and leveraging parallel data structures. We compare SPoCH with the\nstate-of-the-art sequential and parallel implementations on 16 graphs of\nvarious types. Our experiments show that SPoCH achieves speedups of 11 to 68\ntimes over the best sequential baseline and 3.8 to 41 times over the best\nparallel baseline in CH construction, while maintaining competitive query\nperformance and CH graph size.

Entropy provides insights into the\nequilibrium thermodynamic properties of both ground and excited states beyond\ntransport measurements.

This observation is in agreement with previous direct transport\nmeasurements and confirms the applicability of this novel method. For the\ntwo-carrier regime, the extracted entropy indicates a non-degenerate ground\nstate at zero magnetic field, contrary to previous studies suggesting a\nthree-fold degeneracy.

In this paper, we apply the shifted composition rule--an\ninformation-theoretic principle introduced in our earlier work--in order to\nadapt coupling arguments to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Our framework\ncombine the strengths of two previously disparate approaches: local error\nanalysis and Girsanov's theorem. Akin to the former, it yields tight bounds by\nincorporating the so-called weak error, and is user-friendly in that it only\nrequires easily verified local assumptions; and akin to the latter, it yields\nKL divergence guarantees and applies beyond Wasserstein contractivity.\n  We apply this framework to the problem of sampling from a target distribution\n$\\pi$. Here, the two stochastic processes are the Langevin diffusion and an\nalgorithmic discretization thereof. Our framework provides a unified analysis\nwhen $\\pi$ is assumed to be strongly log-concave (SLC), weakly log-concave\n(WLC), or to satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality (LSI). Among other results, this\nyields KL guarantees for the randomized midpoint discretization of the Langevin\ndiffusion. Notably, our result: (1) yields the optimal $\\tilde O(\\sqrt\nd/\\epsilon)$ rate in the SLC and LSI settings; (2) is the first result to hold\nbeyond the 2-Wasserstein metric in the SLC setting; and (3) is the first result\nto hold in \\emph{any} metric in the WLC and LSI settings.",

In contrast to the bimodal behavior for the\nunbiased case, we show that the probability of last return decays monotonically\nthroughout the walk beyond a critical bias. We obtain a simple expression for\nthe critical bias as a function of the walk length, and show that it saturates\nat $1/\\sqrt{3}$ for infinitely long walks.

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of machine learning in financial risk\nmanagement, conventional wisdom suggests that longer training periods and more\nfeature variables contribute to improved model performance. This paper,\nfocusing on mortgage default prediction, empirically discovers a phenomenon\nthat contradicts traditional knowledge: in time series prediction, increased\ntraining data timespan and additional non-critical features actually lead to\nsignificant deterioration in prediction effectiveness. Using Fannie Mae's\nmortgage data, the study compares predictive performance across different time\nwindow lengths (2012-2022) and feature combinations, revealing that shorter\ntime windows (such as single-year periods) paired with carefully selected key\nfeatures yield superior prediction results. The experimental results indicate\nthat extended time spans may introduce noise from historical data and outdated\nmarket patterns, while excessive non-critical features interfere with the\nmodel's learning of core default factors. This research not only challenges the\ntraditional \"more is better\" approach in data modeling but also provides new\ninsights and practical guidance for feature selection and time window\noptimization in financial risk prediction.",

In recent years, Neural-Network (NN) controllers\nhave been demonstrating great promise. Unfortunately, such learned controllers\nare often not certified and can cause the system to suffer from unpredictable\nor unsafe behavior. To mitigate this issue, a great effort has been dedicated\nto automated verification of systems. Specifically, works in the category of\n``black-box testing'' rely on repeated system simulations to find a falsifying\ncounterexample of a system run that violates a specification. As running\nhigh-fidelity simulations is computationally demanding, the goal of\nfalsification approaches is to minimize the simulation effort (NN inference\nqueries) needed to return a falsifying example. This often proves to be a great\nchallenge, especially when the tested controller is well-trained. This work\ncontributes a novel falsification approach for autonomous systems under formal\nspecification operating in uncertain environments. We are especially interested\nin CPS operating in rich, semantically-defined, open environments, which yield\nhigh-dimensional, simulation-dependent sensor observations. Our approach\nintroduces a novel reformulation of the falsification problem as the problem of\nplanning a trajectory for a ``meta-system,'' which wraps and encapsulates the\nexamined system; we call this approach: meta-planning. This formulation can be\nsolved with standard sampling-based motion-planning techniques (like RRT) and\ncan gradually integrate domain knowledge to improve the search. We support the\nsuggested approach with an experimental study on falsification of an\nobstacle-avoiding autonomous car with a NN controller, where meta-planning\ndemonstrates superior performance over alternative approaches.",

Results: We\ndemonstrate highly dexterous 7 DoF position-based regression for prosthesis\ncontrol from EMG signals, with significantly lower error rates than traditional\napproaches (p < 0.001) and nearly zero prediction response time delay (p <\n0.001).

Most real-world tasks we\nlearn and perform (e.g., driving cars, operating complex machines, solving\nmathematical problems) are difficult to learn because they are complex, and the\nbest strategies are difficult to find from many possibilities. However, how we\nlearn such complex tasks remains a partially solved mystery, as we cannot\nexplain how the strategies evolve with practice due to the difficulties of\ncollecting and modeling complex behavioral data. As complex tasks are generally\nnetworks of many elementary subtasks, we model task performance as networks or\ngraphs of subtasks and investigate how the networks change with expertise. We\ndevelop the networks by processing the text in a large archive of operator logs\nfrom 14 years of operations using natural language processing and machine\nlearning. The network changes are examined using a set of measures at four\nlevels of granularity - individual subtasks, interconnections among subtasks,\ngroups of subtasks, and the whole complex task. We find that the operators\nconsistently change with expertise at the subtask, the interconnection, and the\nwhole-task levels, but they show remarkable similarity in how subtasks are\ngrouped. These results indicate that the operators of all stages of expertise\nadopt a common divide-and-conquer approach by breaking the complex task into\nparts of manageable complexity, but they differ in the frequency and structure\nof nested subtasks. Operational logs are common data sources from real-world\nsettings where people collaborate with hardware and software environments to\nexecute complex tasks, and the network models investigated in this study can be\nexpanded to accommodate multi-modal data.

In\nthis context, microring modulators (MRMs) emerge as a promising solution.\nNevertheless, their potential is curtailed by inherent challenges, such as\npronounced frequency chirp and dynamic non-linearity. Moreover, a comprehensive\nunderstanding of their coherent dynamics is still lacking, which further\nconstrains their applicability and efficiency. Consequently, these constraints\nhave confined their use to spectrally inefficient intensity-modulation\ndirect-detection links. In this work, we present a thorough study of MRM\ncoherent dynamics, unlocking phase as a new dimension for MRM-based high-speed\ndata transmission in advanced modulation formats. We demonstrate that the phase\nand intensity modulations of MRMs exhibit distinct yet coupled dynamics,\nlimiting their direct application in higher-order modulation formats. This\nchallenge can be addressed by embedding a pair of MRMs within a Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer in a push-pull configuration, enabling a bistable phase response\nand unchirped amplitude modulation. Furthermore, we show that its amplitude\nfrequency response exhibits a distinct dependency on frequency detuning\ncompared to phase and intensity modulations of MRMs, without strong peaking\nnear resonance. Harnessing the ultra-fast coherent dynamics, we designed and\nexperimentally demonstrated an ultra-compact, ultra-wide-bandwidth\nin-phase/quadrature (I/Q) modulator on a silicon chip fabricated using a\nCMOS-compatible photonic process.

The\n$\\sim$30-hour integration represents one of the longest exposures yet taken on\na single pointing with the ACA 7-m. The low-resolution ACA data\n($21.0''\\,{\\times}\\,12.2''$) reveal a 75% excess CO(4-3) flux compared to the\nsum of individual sources detected in higher-resolution Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array (ALMA) data ($1.0''\\,{\\times}\\,0.8''$). Our work also reveals\na similar result by tapering the ALMA data to $10''$. In contrast, the 3.2mm\ndust continuum shows little discrepancy between ACA and ALMA. A single-dish\n[CII] spectrum obtained by APEX/FLASH supports the ACA CO(4-3) result,\nrevealing a large excess in [CII] emission relative to ALMA. The missing flux\nis unlikely due to undetected faint sources but instead suggests that\nhigh-resolution ALMA observations might miss extended and\nlow-surface-brightness gas. Such emission could originate from the\ncircum-galactic medium (CGM) or the pre-heated proto-intracluster medium\n(proto-ICM). If this molecular gas reservoir replenishes the star formation\nfuel, the overall depletion timescale will exceed 400Myr, reducing the\nrequirement for the simultaneous SMG activity in SPT2349$-$56. Our results\nhighlight the role of an extended gas reservoir in sustaining a high star\nformation rate (SFR) in SPT2349$-$56, and potentially establishing the ICM\nduring the transition phase to a mature cluster.",

However, despite its widespread success, phase field\nmodeling remains largely driven by phenomenological justifications except in a\nhandful of instances. In this work, we leverage a recently developed\nstatistical mechanics framework for non-equilibrium phenomena, called\nStochastic Thermodynamics with Internal Variables (STIV), to provide the first\nderivation of a phase field model for front propagation in a one dimensional\nelastic medium without appeal to phenomenology or fitting to experiments or\nsimulation data. In the resulting model, the variables obey a gradient flow\nwith respect to a non-equilibrium free energy, although notably, the dynamics\nof the strain and phase variables are coupled, and while the free energy\nfunctional is non-local in the phase field variable, it deviates from the\ntraditional Landau-Ginzburg form. Moreover, in the systems analyzed here, the\nmodel accurately captures stress induced nucleation of transition fronts\nwithout the need to incorporate additional physics.

    "abstract": "Automating high-volume unstructured data processing is essential for\noperational efficiency. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is critical but\noften struggles with accuracy and efficiency in complex layouts and ambiguous\ntext. These challenges are especially pronounced in large-scale tasks requiring\nboth speed and precision. This paper introduces LMV-RPA, a Large Model\nVoting-based Robotic Process Automation system to enhance OCR workflows.\nLMV-RPA integrates outputs from OCR engines such as Paddle OCR, Tesseract OCR,\nEasy OCR, and DocTR with Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA 3 and\nGemini-1.5-pro. Using a majority voting mechanism, it processes OCR outputs\ninto structured JSON formats, improving accuracy, particularly in complex\nlayouts. The multi-phase pipeline processes text extracted by OCR engines\nthrough LLMs, combining results to ensure the most accurate outputs. LMV-RPA\nachieves 99 percent accuracy in OCR tasks, surpassing baseline models with 94\npercent, while reducing processing time by 80 percent. Benchmark evaluations\nconfirm its scalability and demonstrate that LMV-RPA offers a faster, more\nreliable, and efficient solution for automating large-scale document processing\ntasks.",

However, it is\ngenerally acknowledged within the field that Chamfer Distance (CD) is\nvulnerable to the presence of outliers, which can consequently lead to the\nconvergence on suboptimal models. In divergence from the existing literature,\nwhich largely concentrates on resolving such concerns in the realm of Euclidean\nspace, we put forth a notably uncomplicated yet potent metric specifically\ndesigned for point cloud completion tasks: {Hyperbolic Chamfer Distance\n(HyperCD)}. This metric conducts Chamfer Distance computations within the\nparameters of hyperbolic space.

    "abstract": "In high-risk environments where unlawful surveillance is prevalent, securing\nconfidential communications is critical. This study introduces a novel\nsteganographic game-theoretic model to analyze the strategic interactions\nbetween a defending company and an adversary. By framing the scenario as a\nnon-cooperative game, there is systematic evaluation of optimal strategies for\nboth parties, incorporating costs and benefits such as implementation expenses,\npotential data leaks, and operational advantages. The derived equilibrium\nprobabilities enable the assessment of success rates, illustrating conditions\nunder which the company benefits from hiding messages or faces increased risks\nwhen not implementing steganography. Sensitivity analysis explores how changes\nin key parameters impact these strategies, enhancing the understanding of\ndecision-making in secure communications. Furthermore, the introduction of an\nadversary model that quantifies the adversary's advantage using conditional\nprobabilities derived from success rates allows for a quantitative measure of\nthe adversary's effectiveness based on the defender's strategies. By\nintegrating the adversary's advantage into a novel risk analysis framework and\nemploying Monte Carlo simulations, dynamic interactions are captured across\nadvantage scenarios, considering factors like impact factor, steganography\neffectiveness, and equilibrium probabilities. This comprehensive framework\noffers practical insights into optimizing security strategies by quantifying\npotential risk reductions when the adversary is disadvantaged, providing a\nclear methodology for assessing and mitigating adversarial threats in complex\nsecurity environments.",

We consider deformations preserving the\naxial and equatorial mirror symmetries of the vesicles. The configurations of\nthe vesicle are determined employing the spontaneous curvature model subject to\nthe constraints imposed by the ring as well as of having constant area or\nvolume. We determine two expressions of the force exerted by the ring, one\ninvolving a discontinuity in the derivative of the curvature of the membrane\nacross the ring, and another one in terms of the global quantities of the\nvesicle. For small enough values of the spontaneous curvature there is only one\nsequence of configurations for either fixed area or volume. The behavior of\nconstricted vesicles is similar for both constraints, they follow a transition\nfrom prolate to dumbbell shapes, which culminates in two quasispherical\nvesicles connected by a small catenoid-like neck. We analyze the geometry and\nthe force of the small neck employing a perturbative analysis about the\ncatenoid. A stretched vesicle initially adopts an oblate shape for either\nconstraint. If the area is fixed the vesicle increasingly flattens until it\nattains a disclike shape, which we examine using an asymptotic analysis. If the\nvolume is fixed the poles approach until they touch and the vesicle adopts a\ndiscocyte shape. When the spontaneous curvature of the vesicle is close to the\nmean curvature of the constricted quasispherical vesicles, the sequences of\nconfigurations of both constraints develop bifurcations, and some of the\nconfigurations corresponding to one of their branches have the lowest energy.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized as\neffective platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base\nStations (BSs), enabling low-cost, agile, and flexible wireless networks with\nhigh Quality of Service (QoS). The next generation of wireless communications\nwill rely on increasingly higher frequencies, which are easily obstructed by\nobstacles. One of the most critical concepts yet to be fully addressed is\npositioning the UAV at optimal coordinates while accounting for obstacles. To\nensure a line of sight (LoS) between UAVs and user equipment (UE), improve QoS,\nand establish reliable wireless links with maximum coverage, obstacles must be\nintegrated into the proposed placement algorithms. This paper introduces a\nsimulation-based measurement approach for characterizing an air-to-ground (AG)\nchannel in a simple scenario. By considering obstacles, we present a novel\nperspective on channel characterization. The results, in terms of throughput,\npacket delivery, packet loss, and delay, are compared using the proposed\npositioning approach.",

Recent experimental progress allowed to rule out any possible\nloopholes in these tests, and opened up the possibility of applications in\ncryptography envisaged more than three decades ago. A prominent example of such\nan application is device-independent quantum key distribution, which has\nrecently been demonstrated. One remaining gap in all existing experiments,\nhowever, is that access to perfect randomness is assumed. To tackle this\nproblem, the concept of randomness amplification has been introduced, allowing\nto generate such randomness from a weak source -- a task impossible in\nclassical physics. In this work, we demonstrate the amplification of imperfect\nrandomness coming from a physical source. It is achieved by building on two\nrecent developments: The first is a theoretical protocol implementing the\nconcept of randomness amplification within an experimentally realistic setup,\nwhich however requires a combination of the degree of Bell inequality violation\n(S-value) and the amount of data not attained previously. The second is\nexperimental progress enabling the execution of a loophole-free Bell test with\nsuperconducting circuits, which offers a platform to reach the necessary\ncombination. Our experiment marks an important step in achieving the\ntheoretical physical limits of privacy and randomness generation.",

Our result allows for large initial data,\nand it is the first decay statement for higher order derivatives of the scalar\nfield.\n  Solutions to this model generically develop a singularity in the black hole\ninterior. Indeed, Luk--Oh (arxiv:1702.05715, arxiv:1702.05716) identify a\ngeneric class of initial data that produces $C^2$-future-inextendible\nsolutions. However, they leave open the question of mass inflation: does the\nHawking mass become identically infinite at the Cauchy horizon? By work of\nLuk--Oh--Shlapentokh-Rothman (arxiv:2201.12294), our decay result implies mass\ninflation for sufficiently regular solutions in the generic class considered by\nLuk--Oh (arxiv:1702.05715, arxiv:1702.05716).\n  Together with the methods and results of Luk--Oh (arXiv:2404.02220), our\nestimates imply a late-time tails result for the scalar field.

Here we develop an\napproach that captures both photoinhibition and this plateau. We test six new\nmodels of photoinhibition and ten more photoinhibition models from the\nliterature against a database of 1808 photosynthesis-irradiance curves\nexhibiting photoinhibition. The best model improves adjusted R2 by 6-37% and\nreduces RMSE by 15-70% compared to existing models. In the best model,\nphotoinhibition is phenomenologically described by multiplication by a\nsaturating function of the reciprocal of irradiance, simplifies to the\nwidely-used Jassby & Platt photosynthesis-irradiance curve in the absence of\nphotoinhibition, and only requires one new parameter. This photoinhibition\nparameter identifies the onset of photoinhibition and is the rate of decrease\nin photosynthetic rate at that irradiance.

    "abstract": "Simulation is critical for safety evaluation in autonomous driving,\nparticularly in capturing complex interactive behaviors. However, generating\nrealistic and controllable traffic scenarios in long-tail situations remains a\nsignificant challenge. Existing generative models suffer from the conflicting\nobjective between user-defined controllability and realism constraints, which\nis amplified in safety-critical contexts. In this work, we introduce the Causal\nCompositional Diffusion Model (CCDiff), a structure-guided diffusion framework\nto address these challenges. We first formulate the learning of controllable\nand realistic closed-loop simulation as a constrained optimization problem.\nThen, CCDiff maximizes controllability while adhering to realism by\nautomatically identifying and injecting causal structures directly into the\ndiffusion process, providing structured guidance to enhance both realism and\ncontrollability. Through rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets and in a\nclosed-loop simulator, CCDiff demonstrates substantial gains over\nstate-of-the-art approaches in generating realistic and user-preferred\ntrajectories. Our results show CCDiff's effectiveness in extracting and\nleveraging causal structures, showing improved closed-loop performance based on\nkey metrics such as collision rate, off-road rate, FDE, and comfort.",

    "abstract": "We characterize the overdensity (spike) of fermionic dark matter (DM)\nparticles around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) within a general relativistic\nanalysis. The initial DM halo distribution is obtained by solving the\nequilibrium equations of a self-gravitating system of massive fermions at a\nfinite temperature, according to the Ruffini-Arg\\\"uelles-Rueda (RAR) model. The\nfinal fermionic DM spike is calculated around a Schwarzschild SMBH. We explore\ntwo possible interpretations for the origin and evolution of the SMBH seed. One\ncorresponds to the traditional scenario proposed by Gondolo & Silk (1999),\nwhere a small BH mass of baryonic origin sits at the halo's center and grows\nadiabatically. The other one, from DM origin, where the dense and degenerate\nfermion core predicted by the RAR model grows adiabatically by capturing\nbaryons until its gravitational collapse, providing a heavy SMBH seed, whose\nspecific value depends on the fermion mass. We study different initial\nfermionic DM profiles that the theory allows. We show that overall dilute\n(i.e., Boltzmannian) fermionic DM develops the well-known spike with density\nprofile $\\rho \\sim r^{-3/2}$. Instead, for semi-degenerate fermions with a\ndense and compact core surrounded by a diluted halo, we find novel spike\nprofiles that depend on the particle mass and nature. In the more general case,\nfermionic spikes do not develop a simple power-law profile. Furthermore, the\nSMBH does not always imply an enhancement of the surrounding DM density; it\nmight also deplete it. Thus, the self-consistent inclusion of the DM candidate\nnature and mass in determining the structure and distribution of DM in\ngalaxies, including the DM spikes around SMBHs, is essential for the\nspecification of DM astrophysical probes such as BH mergers, gravitational\nwaves, or stellar orbits.",

    "abstract": "The impact of cell segregation and margination in blood disorders on\nmicrocirculatory hemodynamics within bifurcated vessels are physiologically\nsignificant, yet poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive\ncomputational investigation of red blood cell (RBC) suspension dynamics, with a\nfocus on a model of sickle cell disease (SCD) as an example of a disorder\nassociated with subpopulations of aberrant RBCs. The findings reveal how cell\nmargination influences cellular partitioning and distributions as well as\nvessel wall shear stress (WSS) at vascular bifurcations. Normal RBCs, which\nmigrate toward the channel center, exhibit the Zweifach-Fung effect,\npreferentially entering high-flow-rate branches. In contrast, sickle cells,\nwhich marginate near the vessel wall, demonstrate an anti-Zweifach-Fung effect,\nfavoring lower-flow-rate branches due to their position within the cell-free\nlayer (CFL). The upstream segregation of cells remains downstream through the\nbifurcation, where sickle cells accumulate along the outer branch walls. This\naccumulation of sickle cells increases the frequency of high WSS events via\ndirect physical interactions, particularly on the outer side of high-velocity\nbranches, potentially contributing to the vascular damage and endothelial\ndisruption observed in many disorders that affect RBCs. In geometrically\nasymmetric bifurcations, cells preferentially enter branches with larger radii,\nunderscoring the influence of geometric complexity on microcirculatory blood\nflow. These findings provide insights into microvascular hemodynamics in SCD\nand other blood disorders.",

We study the GWs produced by such\nparticle distributions, showing that GWs arise from the quadrupolar anisotropy\nin the radiation emitted from the bubble collisions, and present a\nsemi-analytical calculation of the two-point correlation function for the\nassociated energy distributions. We find that this new contribution can\nqualitatively modify the overall GW signal from such phase transitions,\ncreating a distinct shift in the spectral slope at low frequencies that could\nbe observed by future GW experiments.

In particular, sufficiently large random field is expected\nto prohibit any finite temperature ordering. Here, we show that this is not\nnecessarily true. We provide physically motivated examples of systems in which\ndisorder induces an ordering that is *infinitely stable* in the sense that: (1)\nthere exists ordering at arbitrarily large disorder strength and (2) the\ntransition temperature remains, asymptotically, nonzero in the limit of\ninfinite disorder. The ordering is spatially localized on the boundary of a\ndisorder-induced, emergent percolating fractal structure. The examples we give\nare most naturally described when the spatial dimension $d \\ge 3$, but can also\nbe formulated when $d=2$, provided that the underlying graph is non-planar.",

In this work, we propose a novel\ntransformer attention operator whose computational complexity scales linearly\nwith the number of tokens.

TSSA has linear\ncomputational and memory complexity and radically departs from the typical\nattention architecture that computes pairwise similarities between tokens.\nExperiments on vision, language, and long sequence tasks show that simply\nswapping TSSA for standard self-attention, which we refer to as the Token\nStatistics Transformer (ToST), achieves competitive performance with\nconventional transformers while being significantly more computationally\nefficient and interpretable.

    "abstract": "Understanding the geometric properties of quantum states and their\nimplications in fundamental physical phenomena is at the core of modern\nphysics. The Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT) is a central physical object in\nthis regard, encoding complete information about the geometry of the quantum\nstate. The imaginary part of the QGT is the well-known Berry curvature, which\nplays a fundamental role in the topological magnetoelectric and optoelectronic\nphenomena. The real part of the QGT is the quantum metric, whose importance has\ncome to prominence very recently, giving rise to a new set of quantum geometric\nphenomena, such as anomalous Landau levels, flat band superfluidity, excitonic\nLamb shifts, and nonlinear Hall effect. Despite the central importance of the\nQGT, its experimental measurements have been restricted only to artificial\ntwo-level systems. In this work, we develop a framework to measure the QGT\n(both quantum metric and Berry curvature) in crystalline solids using\npolarization-, spin-, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Using this\nframework, we demonstrate the effective reconstruction of the QGT in solids in\nthe archetype kagome metal CoSn, which hosts topological flat bands. The key\nidea is to introduce another geometrical tensor, the quasi-QGT, whose\ncomponents, the band Drude weight and orbital angular momentum, are\nexperimentally accessible and can be used for extracting the QGT. Establishing\nsuch a momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopic probe of the QGT is poised\nto significantly advance our understanding of quantum geometric responses in a\nwide range of crystalline systems.",

However, the widely adopted uniform point sampling\nstrategy in Shape VAE training often leads to a significant loss of geometric\ndetails, limiting the quality of shape reconstruction and downstream generation\ntasks. We present Dora-VAE, a novel approach that enhances VAE reconstruction\nthrough our proposed sharp edge sampling strategy and a dual cross-attention\nmechanism. By identifying and prioritizing regions with high geometric\ncomplexity during training, our method significantly improves the preservation\nof fine-grained shape features. Such sampling strategy and the dual attention\nmechanism enable the VAE to focus on crucial geometric details that are\ntypically missed by uniform sampling approaches. To systematically evaluate VAE\nreconstruction quality, we additionally propose Dora-bench, a benchmark that\nquantifies shape complexity through the density of sharp edges, introducing a\nnew metric focused on reconstruction accuracy at these salient geometric\nfeatures. Extensive experiments on the Dora-bench demonstrate that Dora-VAE\nachieves comparable reconstruction quality to the state-of-the-art dense\nXCube-VAE while requiring a latent space at least 8$\\times$ smaller (1,280 vs.\n> 10,000 codes).",

In contrast to existing scene\nreconstruction and SfM methods that lack metric scale information, our method\nestimates approximate metric scale by leveraging a human statistical model.\nFurthermore, it reconstructs multiple human meshes within the same world\ncoordinate system alongside the scene point cloud, effectively capturing\nspatial relationships among individuals and their positions in the environment.\nWe initialize the reconstruction of humans, scenes, and cameras using robust\nfoundational models and jointly optimize these elements.

We\ncompare our method to existing approaches on two challenging benchmarks,\nEgoHumans and EgoExo4D, demonstrating significant improvements in human\nlocalization accuracy within the world coordinate frame (reducing error from\n3.51m to 1.04m in EgoHumans and from 2.9m to 0.56m in EgoExo4D).

    "abstract": "Learning a robust video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is essential for\nreducing video redundancy and facilitating efficient video generation. Directly\napplying image VAEs to individual frames in isolation can result in temporal\ninconsistencies and suboptimal compression rates due to a lack of temporal\ncompression. Existing Video VAEs have begun to address temporal compression;\nhowever, they often suffer from inadequate reconstruction performance. In this\npaper, we present a novel and powerful video autoencoder capable of\nhigh-fidelity video encoding. First, we observe that entangling spatial and\ntemporal compression by merely extending the image VAE to a 3D VAE can\nintroduce motion blur and detail distortion artifacts. Thus, we propose\ntemporal-aware spatial compression to better encode and decode the spatial\ninformation. Additionally, we integrate a lightweight motion compression model\nfor further temporal compression. Second, we propose to leverage the textual\ninformation inherent in text-to-video datasets and incorporate text guidance\ninto our model. This significantly enhances reconstruction quality,\nparticularly in terms of detail preservation and temporal stability. Third, we\nfurther improve the versatility of our model through joint training on both\nimages and videos, which not only enhances reconstruction quality but also\nenables the model to perform both image and video autoencoding.

In conventional\nfield-theoretic models, a much larger mass scale than the electroweak (EW)\nscale is typically introduced to spontaneously break Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry\nwith a large enough axion decay constant, $f_a$, thereby avoiding constraints\nfrom star cooling. In this paper, I propose an alternative approach to\nachieving the large decay constant: a PQ scalar field with a large wave\nfunction renormalization constant, analogous to a feebly coupled gauge theory.\nOther dimensionless parameters are ${O}(1)$ in the unit of the EW scale for the\nnaturalness. This framework predicts a light PQ Higgs boson with a mass $\\sim\n(\\mathrm{EW~scale})^2 / f_a$. Exotic particles associated with the PQ anomaly\nare expected to have masses around the EW scale. The proposed model alleviates\nboth the PQ quality and EW scale fine-tuning problems and introduces\ninteresting axion-PQ Higgs cosmologies, encompassing: slim axion DM from a fat\nstring network, heavy axion DM from PQ Higgs condensate fragmentation, PQ Higgs\nDM, and axion-PQ Higgs co-DM scenarios.

Motivated by concerns of AI deception, we study a\nqualitatively new phenomenon made possible by partial observability: would an\nAI assistant ever have an incentive to interfere with the human's observations?\nFirst, we prove that sometimes an optimal assistant must take\nobservation-interfering actions, even when the human is playing optimally, and\neven when there are otherwise-equivalent actions available that do not\ninterfere with observations. Though this result seems to contradict the classic\ntheorem from single-agent decision making that the value of information is\nnonnegative, we resolve this seeming contradiction by developing a notion of\ninterference defined on entire policies.

Second, we prove that if the human is simply\nmaking decisions based on their immediate outcomes, the assistant might need to\ninterfere with observations as a way to query the human's preferences. We show\nthat this incentive for interference goes away if the human is playing\noptimally, or if we introduce a communication channel for the human to\ncommunicate their preferences to the assistant. Third, we show that if the\nhuman acts according to the Boltzmann model of irrationality, this can create\nan incentive for the assistant to interfere with observations. Finally, we use\nan experimental model to analyze tradeoffs faced by the AI assistant in\npractice when considering whether or not to take observation-interfering\nactions.",

Memory enables\nuniversal computation through two fundamental capabilities: recursive state\nmaintenance and reliable history access. We formally prove these requirements\nare both necessary and sufficient for universal computation. This principle\nmanifests across scales, from cellular computation to neural networks to\nlanguage models. Complex behavior emerges not from sophisticated processing\nunits but from maintaining and accessing state across time. We demonstrate how\nparallel systems like neural networks achieve universal computation despite\nlimitations in their basic units by maintaining state across iterations. This\ntheoretical framework reveals a universal pattern: computational advances\nconsistently emerge from enhanced abilities to maintain and access state rather\nthan from more complex basic operations. Our analysis unifies understanding of\ncomputation across biological systems, artificial intelligence, and human\ncognition, reminding us that humanity's own computational capabilities have\nevolved in step with our technical ability to remember through oral traditions,\nwriting, and now computing.",

In most cases, SSA relies on\na combination of Hankel or Toeplitz matrices and Singular Value Decomposition\n(SVD). Like Fourier and Wavelet analysis, SSA has its limitations. The main\nbottleneck of the method can be summarized in three points. The first is the\ndiagonalization of the Hankel/Toeplitz matrix, which can become a major problem\nfrom a memory and/or computational point of view if the time series to be\nanalyzed is very long or heavily sampled. The second point concerns the size of\nthe analysis window, typically denoted as 'L', which will affect the detection\nof patterns in the time series as well as the dimensions of the Hankel/Toeplitz\nmatrix.

    "abstract": "Trapped-ion systems are a promising route toward the realization of both\nnear-term and universal quantum computers. However, one of the pressing\nchallenges is improving the fidelity of two-qubit entangling gates. These\noperations are often implemented by addressing individual ions with laser\npulses using the Molmer-Sorensen (MS) protocol. Amplitude modulation (AM) is a\nwell-studied extension of this protocol, where the amplitude of the laser\npulses is controlled as a function of time. We present an analytical study of\nAM, using a Fourier series expansion to maintain the generality of the laser\namplitude's functional form. We then apply this general AM method to\ngate-timing errors by imposing conditions on these Fourier coefficients,\nproducing trade-offs between the laser power and fidelity at a fixed gate time.\nThe conditions derived here are linear and can be used, in principle, to\nachieve arbitrarily high orders of insensitivity to gate-timing errors.\nNumerical optimization is then employed to identify the minimum-power pulse\nsatisfying these constraints. Our central result is that the leading order\ndependence on gate timing errors is improved from $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^6)$ with the addition of one linear constraint on the\nFourier coefficients and to $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^{10})$ with two linear\nconstraints without a significant increase in the average laser power.

    "abstract": "Multidimensional optical spectroscopy observes transient excitation dynamics\nthrough the time evolution of spectral correlations. Its action-detected\nvariants offer several advantages over the coherent detection and are thus\nbecoming increasingly widespread. Nevertheless, a drawback of action-detected\nspectra is the presence of a large stationary background of so-called\nincoherent mixing of excitations from independent states that resembles a\nproduct of ground-state absorption spectra and obscures the excited-state\nsignal. This issue is especially problematic in fluorescence-detected\ntwo-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (F-2DES) and fluorescence-detected\npump--probe spectroscopy (F-PP) of extended systems, where large incoherent\nmixing arises from efficient exciton--exciton annihilation. In this work, we\ndemonstrate on the example of F-2DES and F-PP an inherent spectro-temporal\nsymmetry of action-detected spectra, which allows general, system-independent\nsubtraction of any stationary signals including incoherent mixing. We derive\nthe expressions for spectra with normal and reversed time ordering of the\npulses, relating these to the symmetry of the system response. As we\ndemonstrate both analytically and numerically, the difference signal\nconstructed from spectra with normal and reversed pulse ordering is free of\nincoherent mixing and highlights the excitation dynamics. We further verify the\napproach on the experimental F-PP spectra of a molecular squaraine heterodimer\nand the F-2DES spectra of the photosynthetic antenna LH2 of purple bacteria.\nThe approach is generally applicable to action-detected 2DES and pump--probe\nspectroscopy without experimental modifications and independent of the studied\nsystem, enabling their application to large systems such as molecular\ncomplexes.",

However,\nthe abundant text within such images may increase the model's sensitivity to\nlanguage. This raises the need to evaluate LVLM performance on cross-lingual\ntext-rich visual inputs, where the language in the image differs from the\nlanguage of the instructions. To address this, we introduce XT-VQA\n(Cross-Lingual Text-Rich Visual Question Answering), a benchmark designed to\nassess how LVLMs handle language inconsistency between image text and\nquestions. XT-VQA integrates five existing text-rich VQA datasets and a newly\ncollected dataset, XPaperQA, covering diverse scenarios that require faithful\nrecognition and comprehension of visual information despite language\ninconsistency. Our evaluation of prominent LVLMs on XT-VQA reveals a\nsignificant drop in performance for cross-lingual scenarios, even for models\nwith multilingual capabilities. A mutual information analysis suggests that\nthis performance gap stems from cross-lingual questions failing to adequately\nactivate relevant visual information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nMVCL-MI (Maximization of Vision-Language Cross-Lingual Mutual Information),\nwhere a visual-text cross-lingual alignment is built by maximizing mutual\ninformation between the model's outputs and visual information. This is\nachieved by distilling knowledge from monolingual to cross-lingual settings\nthrough KL divergence minimization, where monolingual output logits serve as a\nteacher. Experimental results on the XT-VQA demonstrate that MVCL-MI\neffectively reduces the visual-text cross-lingual performance disparity while\npreserving the inherent capabilities of LVLMs, shedding new light on the\npotential practice for improving LVLMs. Codes are available at:\nhttps://github.com/Stardust-y/XTVQA.git",

    "abstract": "Anyonic chains provide lattice realizations of a rich set of quantum field\ntheories in two space-time dimensions. The latter play a central role in the\ninvestigation of generalized symmetries, renormalization group flows and\nnumerous exotic phases of strongly-correlated systems. Here, a variational\nquantum simulation scheme is presented for the analysis of those anyonic chains\nwhich can be mapped to the restricted solid-on-solid~(RSOS) models of Andrews,\nBaxter and Forrester. An~$L_R$ site RSOS model associated with a Dynkin diagram\ncontaining~$p$ nodes is realized with~$L_R\\lceil\\ln_2 p\\rceil$ qubits,\nwhere~$\\lceil x\\rceil$ is the smallest integer~$\\geq x$. The scheme is\nbenchmarked by realizing the ground states of RSOS Hamiltonians in the~$A_p$\nfamily for~$4\\leq p\\leq8$ using a variational quantum-classical algorithm. The\nlatter is based on the Euler-Cartan circuit ansatz. Topological symmetry\noperators are analyzed for the RSOS models at the quantum-critical points.\nMeasurement of observables acting on~$\\lceil\\ln_2 p\\rceil$ qubits is shown to\ncapture the anyonic nature of the Hilbert space. The described quantum\nsimulation scheme provides a systematic approach to give rise to a large family\nof quantum field theories which have largely eluded physical realizations.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for Network Stochastic Differential Equations\n(N-SDE), where each node in a network is governed by an SDE influenced by\ninteractions with its neighbors. The evolution of each node is driven by the\ninterplay of three key components: the node's intrinsic dynamics\n(\\emph{momentum effect}), feedback from neighboring nodes (\\emph{network\neffect}), and a \\emph{stochastic volatility} term modeled by Brownian motion.\nOur primary objective is to estimate the parameters of the N-SDE system from\nhigh-frequency discrete-time observations. The motivation behind this model\nlies in its ability to analyze very high-dimensional time series by leveraging\nthe inherent sparsity of the underlying network graph. We consider two distinct\nscenarios: \\textit{i) known network structure}: the graph is fully specified,\nand we establish conditions under which the parameters can be identified,\nconsidering the linear growth of the parameter space with the number of edges.\n\\textit{ii) unknown network structure}: the graph must be inferred from the\ndata. For this, we develop an iterative procedure using adaptive Lasso,\ntailored to a specific subclass of N-SDE models. In this work, we assume the\nnetwork graph is oriented, paving the way for novel applications of SDEs in\ncausal inference, enabling the study of cause-effect relationships in dynamic\nsystems.

The lowest excited states of the diradicals differ\nqualitatively from those of TTM: two novel low-lying states emerge in the\ndiradical, due to charge resonance (CR) between the two radical units. The\nlowest CR state is a dark state for symmetric diradicals.

A sharp\nEuclidean one arm exponent was proven recently in (Cai and Ding, 2023), and\nsubsequently in (Ganguly and Nam, 2024) other results about the chemical one\narm exponent, volume growth and the Alexander-Orbach conjecture were\nestablished for all $d>20.$\n  In this article, we introduce new methods to obtain several sharp estimates\nabout the intrinsic geometry which hold for all $d>6$. We develop two primary\ncomparison methods. The first involves a comparison of the extrinsic\n(Euclidean) and intrinsic metrics allowing estimates about the former to be\ntransferrable to the latter. The second compares intrinsic geodesics to a class\nof modified paths which are non-backtracking in a certain loop sense. The\nlatter is amenable to analysis using methods of bond percolation. We finally\nprove that such non-backtracking paths are not much longer than geodesics\nallowing us to establish comparable estimates for the geodesic. As applications\nof such methods, we establish, for all $d>6,$ the chemical one-arm exponent, as\nwell as an averaged version of a conjecture from (Werner, 2021) which asserts\nthat deletion of loops with diameter larger than $r^{6/d}$ do not affect the\nconnection probabilities between points at Euclidean distance $r.$ An important\ningredient of independent interest is a local connectivity estimate which\nasserts that the connection probability between two points at distance $r$\nremains, up to constants, unchanged even if the connecting path is confined to\na ball of diameter comparable to $r.$",

    "abstract": "The radio pulsar PSR J0742-2822 is known to exhibit rapid changes between\ndifferent pulse profile states that correlate with changes in its spin-down\nrate. However, the connection between these variations and the glitch activity\nof the pulsar remains unclear. We aim to study the evolution of the pulse\nprofile and spin-down rate of PSR J0742-2822 in the period MJD 58810-60149\n(November 2019 to July 2023), which includes the glitch on MJD 59839 (September\n2022). In particular, we look for pulse profile or spin-down changes associated\nwith the 2022 glitch. We observed PSR J0742-2822 with high cadence from the\nArgentine Institute of Radio astronomy (IAR) between November 2019 and July\n2023. We used standard timing tools to characterize the times of arrival of the\npulses and study the pulsar rotation, and particularly, the oscillations of\n$\\dot \\nu$. We also study the evolution of the pulse profile. For both of them,\nwe compare their behavior before and after the 2022 glitch. With respect to\n$\\dot \\nu$, we found oscillations diminished in amplitude after the glitch. We\nfound four different components contributing to the pre-glitch $\\dot \\nu$\noscillations, and only one component after the glitch. About the emission, we\nfound the pulse profile has two main peaks. We detected an increase in the\n$W_{50}$ of the total pulse profile of $\\sim$12% after the glitch and we found\nthe amplitude of the trailing peak increased with respect to the amplitude of\nthe leading one after the glitch. We found significant changes in the pulse\nprofile and the spin-down rate of PSR J0742-2822 after its 2022 glitch. These\nresults suggest that there is a strong coupling between the internal superfluid\nof the neutron star and its magnetosphere, and that pulse profile changes may\nbe led by this coupling instead of being led purely by magnetospheric effects.",

Traditional approaches such as Grid\nSearch and Random Search suffer from inefficiency and limited scalability,\nwhile surrogate models like Sequential Model-based Bayesian Optimization (SMBO)\nrely heavily on heuristic predictions that can lead to suboptimal results. This\npaper presents a novel perspective on HPO by formulating it as a sequential\ndecision-making problem and leveraging Q-learning, a reinforcement learning\ntechnique, to optimize hyperparameters. The study explores the works of H.S.\nJomaa et al. and Qi et al., which model HPO as a Markov Decision Process (MDP)\nand utilize Q-learning to iteratively refine hyperparameter settings. The\napproaches are evaluated for their ability to find optimal or near-optimal\nconfigurations within a limited number of trials, demonstrating the potential\nof reinforcement learning to outperform conventional methods. Additionally,\nthis paper identifies research gaps in existing formulations, including the\nlimitations of discrete search spaces and reliance on heuristic policies, and\nsuggests avenues for future exploration.

To\ninvestigate the topological signatures of the driven $\\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices,\nwe examine the Berry phase through anomalous magnetic and thermal responses.\nNotably, at $\\alpha = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, we find that the orbital magnetic moments\nassociated with both corrugated and flat bands exhibit opposite signs, along\nwith their Berry curvatures. For values of $0 < \\alpha < 1$, off-resonant light\ninduces deformations in the bands near the Dirac points, leading to two equally\nsized gaps in the quasi-energy spectrum. The position of the chemical potential\nwithin these gaps significantly influences the orbital magnetization.

In this paper, we cast the problem of\ncombining multiple pre-trained diffusion models at the generation stage under a\nnovel proposed framework termed superposition. Theoretically, we derive\nsuperposition from rigorous first principles stemming from the celebrated\ncontinuity equation and design two novel algorithms tailor-made for combining\ndiffusion models in SuperDiff. SuperDiff leverages a new scalable It\\^o density\nestimator for the log likelihood of the diffusion SDE which incurs no\nadditional overhead compared to the well-known Hutchinson's estimator needed\nfor divergence calculations. We demonstrate that SuperDiff is scalable to large\npre-trained diffusion models as superposition is performed solely through\ncomposition during inference, and also enjoys painless implementation as it\ncombines different pre-trained vector fields through an automated re-weighting\nscheme. Notably, we show that SuperDiff is efficient during inference time, and\nmimics traditional composition operators such as the logical OR and the logical\nAND.

    "abstract": "We show how to take the first step in the conformal program for constructing\ngeneral matter couplings to Carroll gravity. In particular, we couple a single\nmassless electric/magnetic scalar to conformal Carroll gravity with isotropic\ndilatations and show how, upon gauge-fixing, we obtain a (non-conformal version\nof) electric/magnetic Carroll gravity. We determine the full Carroll\ntransformation rules paying special attention to the way the so-called\nintrinsic torsion tensors occur in these transformation rules. A noteworthy\nfeature in the magnetic case is that the Lagrange multiplier present in the\nLagrangian gets absorbed, after coupling to conformal Carroll gravity and\ngauge-fixing, into one of the independent spin-connections of magnetic Carroll\ngravity. Our results form a convenient starting point for constructing general\nmatter couplings to Carroll gravity. Surprisingly, we find that the same\nrelation between dynamical matter and gravity, which forms the basis of the\nconformal program, does not work in the usual way in the Galilei case.",

    "abstract": "Group testing, a problem with diverse applications across multiple\ndisciplines, traditionally assumes independence across nodes' states. Recent\nresearch, however, focuses on real-world scenarios that often involve\ncorrelations among nodes, challenging the simplifying assumptions made in\nexisting models. In this work, we consider a comprehensive model for arbitrary\nstatistical correlation among nodes' states. To capture and leverage these\ncorrelations effectively, we model the problem by hypergraphs, inspired by\n[GLS22], augmented by a probability mass function on the hyper-edges.\n  Using this model, we first design a novel greedy adaptive algorithm capable\nof conducting informative tests and dynamically updating the distribution.\nPerformance analysis provides upper bounds on the number of tests required,\nwhich depend solely on the entropy of the underlying probability distribution\nand the average number of infections. We demonstrate that the algorithm\nrecovers or improves upon all previously known results for group testing\nsettings with correlation. Additionally, we provide families of graphs where\nthe algorithm is order-wise optimal and give examples where the algorithm or\nits analysis is not tight. We then generalize the proposed framework of group\ntesting with general correlation in two directions, namely noisy group testing\nand semi-non-adaptive group testing. In both settings, we provide novel\ntheoretical bounds on the number of tests required.",

Existing models of EDL in\nsolid electrolytes focus predominantly on the space charge layer and lack a\ncomplete treatment of the core layer which is an integral part of the EDL. The\ncore layer exhibits significant variations in defect properties, such as defect\nformation energy (DFE), which influence the ionic charge carrier distribution\nin the space charge layer. In this work, we develop a general framework for\ntreating both the core and space charge layer in solid electrolytes under\ndilute and concentrated regimes. We incorporate functional forms of the DFE\nvariation in the core layer and defect-defect interactions that are consistent\nwith previous first-principles simulations of solid electrolytes at surfaces\nand interfaces. Our simulations reveal that the core layer significantly\nimpacts the potential distribution and defect concentrations in the solid\nelectrolyte. In addition, the core contributes substantially to the\nconductivity when the surface DFE is much lower than the bulk DFE.

However, the standard approaches generate sequences\nof discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur\nsignificant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that\noperates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the\ncache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of\nsubsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss\nfrom the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself\nfrozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end\ndifferentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its\nkv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate\noffline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the\ncoprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra\ncomputation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder\nachieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even\nwithout any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache\naugmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a\nrange of reasoning-intensive tasks.",

    "abstract": "Conventional deep networks rely on one-way backpropagation that overlooks\nreconciling high-level predictions with lower-level representations. We propose\n\\emph{Contextual Feedback Loops} (CFLs), a lightweight mechanism that\nre-injects top-down context into earlier layers for iterative refinement.\nConcretely, CFLs map the network's prediction to a compact \\emph{context\nvector}, which is fused back into each layer via gating adapters. Unrolled over\nmultiple feedback steps, CFLs unify feed-forward and feedback-driven inference,\nletting top-level outputs continually refine lower-level features. Despite\nminimal overhead, CFLs yield consistent gains on tasks including CIFAR-10,\nImageNet-1k, SpeechCommands, and GLUE SST-2. Moreover, by a Banach Fixed Point\nargument under mild Lipschitz conditions, these updates converge stably.\nOverall, CFLs show that even modest top-down feedback can substantially improve\ndeep models, aligning with cognitive theories of iterative perception.",

Analytical equations based in the patched conics\napproximation are showed and they allow to calculate the variation in velocity,\nangular momentum, energy and inclination of the spacecraft that is involved in\nthis maneuver. Based on that, it is possible to obtain expressions for\nparticular cases, like the planar and the polar maneuver. The most important\nproperties of this maneuver can demonstrated using thos equations, like: in the\ncase of planar maneuver the variation in inclination can be only 180, 0, and\n-180 degrees; the variation in inclination is symmetric with respect to the out\nof plane angle; a passage by the poles changes only the y-component of the\nangular momentum, keeping the energy and the inclination of the trajectory\nunchanged. The results show several maneuvers.",

By bringing to bear the\ngradient descent (GD) method and leveraging the principle of algorithm\nunrolling, we truncate and re-interpret each GD iteration as a layer in a graph\nneural network (GNN) that is trained to approximate the ASE. Accordingly, we\ncall the resulting embeddings and our parametric model Learned ASE (LASE),\nwhich is interpretable, parameter efficient, robust to inputs with unobserved\nedges, and offers controllable complexity during inference. LASE layers combine\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) and fully-connected Graph Attention Network\n(GAT) modules, which is intuitively pleasing since GCN-based local aggregations\nalone are insufficient to express the sought graph eigenvectors. We propose\nseveral refinements to the unrolled LASE architecture (such as sparse attention\nin the GAT module and decoupled layerwise parameters) that offer favorable\napproximation error versus computation tradeoffs; even outperforming\nheavily-optimized eigendecomposition routines from scientific computing\nlibraries. Because LASE is a differentiable function with respect to its\nparameters as well as its graph input, we can seamlessly integrate it as a\ntrainable module within a larger (semi-)supervised graph representation\nlearning pipeline. The resulting end-to-end system effectively learns\n``discriminative ASEs'' that exhibit competitive performance in supervised link\nprediction and node classification tasks, outperforming a GNN even when the\nlatter is endowed with open loop, meaning task-agnostic, precomputed spectral\npositional encodings.",

However, traditional FL approaches often face\nlimitations in scalability and efficiency due to their reliance on synchronous\nclient updates, which can result in significant delays and increased\ncommunication overhead, particularly in heterogeneous and dynamic environments.\nTo address these challenges in this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Federated\nLearning (AFL) algorithm, which allows clients to update the global model\nindependently and asynchronously. Our key contributions include a comprehensive\nconvergence analysis of AFL in the presence of client delays and model\nstaleness. By leveraging martingale difference sequence theory and variance\nbounds, we ensure robust convergence despite asynchronous updates. Assuming\nstrongly convex local objective functions, we establish bounds on gradient\nvariance under random client sampling and derive a recursion formula\nquantifying the impact of client delays on convergence.\n  The proposed AFL algorithm addresses key limitations of traditional FL\nmethods, such as inefficiency due to global synchronization and susceptibility\nto client drift. It enhances scalability, robustness, and efficiency in\nreal-world settings with heterogeneous client populations and dynamic network\nconditions.

One popular class of scores is kernel-based generalized score\nfunctions, which can adapt to a wide range of scenarios and work well in\npractice because they circumvent assumptions about causal mechanisms and data\ndistributions. Despite these advantages, kernel-based generalized score\nfunctions pose serious computational challenges in time and space, with a time\ncomplexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ and a memory complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$,\nwhere $n$ is the sample size. In this paper, we propose an approximate\nkernel-based generalized score function with $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and space\ncomplexities by using low-rank technique and designing a set of rules to handle\nthe complex composite matrix operations required to calculate the score, as\nwell as developing sampling algorithms for different data types to benefit the\nhandling of diverse data types efficiently.

The magnetic field threading the ISF\nseen in the JCMT POL-2 map appears as a tale of three: pinched for OMC-1,\ntwisted for OMC-2, and nearly uniform for OMC-3. A multi-scale analysis shows\nthat the magnetic field structure in OMC-3 is very consistent at all the\nscales, whereas the field structure in OMC-2 shows no correlation across\ndifferent scales. In OMC-1, the field retains its mean orientation from large\nto small scales, but shows some deviations at small scales. Histograms of\nrelative orientations between the magnetic field and filaments reveal a bimodal\ndistribution for OMC-1, a relatively random distribution for OMC-2, and a\ndistribution with a predominant peak at 90$^\\circ$ for OMC-3. Furthermore, the\nmagnetic fields in OMC-1 and OMC-3 both appear to be aligned perpendicular to\nthe fibers, which are denser structures within the filament, but the field in\nOMC-2 is aligned along with the fibers. All these suggest that gravity,\nturbulence, and magnetic field are each playing a leading role in OMC-1, 2, and\n3, respectively. While OMC-2 and 3 have almost the same gas mass, density, and\nnon-thermal velocity dispersion, there are on average younger and fewer young\nstellar objects in OMC-3, providing evidence that a stronger magnetic field\nwill induce slower and less efficient star formation in molecular clouds.",

GaussianPainter introduces an\ninnovative feed-forward approach to overcome the limitations of time-consuming\ntest-time optimization in 3D Gaussian splatting. Our method addresses a\ncritical challenge in the field: the non-uniqueness problem inherent in the\nlarge parameter space of 3D Gaussian splatting. This space, encompassing\nrotation, anisotropic scales, and spherical harmonic coefficients, introduces\nthe challenge of rendering similar images from substantially different Gaussian\nfields. As a result, feed-forward networks face instability when attempting to\ndirectly predict high-quality Gaussian fields, struggling to converge on\nconsistent parameters for a given output. To address this issue, we propose to\nestimate a surface normal for each point to determine its Gaussian rotation.\nThis strategy enables the network to effectively predict the remaining Gaussian\nparameters in the constrained space. We further enhance our approach with an\nappearance injection module, incorporating reference image appearance into\nGaussian fields via a multiscale triplane representation. Our method\nsuccessfully balances efficiency and fidelity in 3D Gaussian generation,\nachieving high-quality, diverse, and robust 3D content creation from point\nclouds in a single forward pass.",

AGN disks are conducive to forming both long and short Gamma-Ray\nBursts (GRBs), and their anticipated cosmological occurrence within these disks\nhas potential to serve as an independent tool for probing and calibrating the\npopulation of stars and compact objects within them, and their contribution to\nthe GW-detected population. In this study, we employ Monte Carlo methods in\nconjunction with models for GRB electromagnetic emission in extremely dense\nmedia to simulate the cosmological occurrence of both long and short GRBs\nwithin AGN disks, while also estimating their detectability across a range of\nwavelengths, from gamma-rays to radio. We investigate two extreme scenarios:\n``undiffused\", in which the radiation escapes without significant scattering\n(i.e. if the progenitor has excavated a funnel within the disk), and\n``diffused\", in which the radiation is propagated through the high-density\nmedium, potentially scattered and absorbed. In the diffused case, we find that\nthe majority of detectable GRBs, which are at most a few percent of the total,\nare likely to originate from lower redshifts, and from the outermost regions of\nlarge supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, $\\gtrsim 10^{7.5} \\rm M_{\\odot}$.\nIn the undiffused case, which has a GRB detection probability $\\sim 40-50\\%$,\nwe expect a similar trend, but with a considerable contribution from the\nintermediate regions of lower SMBH masses. Detectable emission is generally\nexpected to be dominant in prompt $\\gamma$-rays if diffusion is not dominant,\nand X-ray afterglow if diffusion is important; however, the nature of the\ndominant observable signal highly depends on the specific AGN disk model, hence\nmaking GRBs in AGN disks also potential probes of the disk structures.",

The broker, however, only observes aggregate\nprices and cannot distinguish between underlying trends and volatility. Both\nthe broker and the informed trader aim to maximize their penalized expected\nwealth. Using convex analysis, we characterize the Nash equilibrium and\ndemonstrate its existence and uniqueness.

For short enough time horizons, we prove that a\nunique solution of this system exists. Finally, under quite general\nassumptions, we show that the solution to the FBSDE system admits a polynomial\napproximation in the strength of the transient impact to arbitrary order, and\nprove that the error is controlled.",

In\ncooperative MARL settings, the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) has\ngained prominence as a benchmark for algorithms following centralized training\nwith decentralized execution paradigm. However, with continual advancements in\nSMAC, many algorithms now exhibit near-optimal performance, complicating the\nevaluation of their true effectiveness. To alleviate this problem, in this\nwork, we highlight a critical issue: the default opponent policy in these\nenvironments lacks sufficient diversity, leading MARL algorithms to overfit and\nexploit unintended vulnerabilities rather than learning robust strategies. To\novercome these limitations, we propose SMAC-HARD, a novel benchmark designed to\nenhance training robustness and evaluation comprehensiveness. SMAC-HARD\nsupports customizable opponent strategies, randomization of adversarial\npolicies, and interfaces for MARL self-play, enabling agents to generalize to\nvarying opponent behaviors and improve model stability. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a black-box testing framework wherein agents are trained without\nexposure to the edited opponent scripts but are tested against these scripts to\nevaluate the policy coverage and adaptability of MARL algorithms. We conduct\nextensive evaluations of widely used and state-of-the-art algorithms on\nSMAC-HARD, revealing the substantial challenges posed by edited and mixed\nstrategy opponents. Additionally, the black-box strategy tests illustrate the\ndifficulty of transferring learned policies to unseen adversaries.

In this work,\nwe propose an enhanced circuit cutting framework ShotQC with effective sampling\noverhead reduction.

The former employs\nan adaptive Monte Carlo method to dynamically allocate more quantum resources\nto subcircuit configurations that contribute more to variance in the final\noutcome. The latter leverages additional degrees of freedom in postprocessing\nto further suppress variance.

Our goal is to\nmaterialize such theories - here called microtheories (a linguistic analog of\nlogical microtheories) - as a set of sentences encapsulating an LM's core\nknowledge about a topic. These statements systematically work together to\nentail answers to a set of questions to both engender trust and improve\nperformance. Our approach is to first populate a knowledge store with\n(model-generated) sentences that entail answers to training questions and then\ndistill those down to a core microtheory that is concise, general, and\nnon-redundant. We show that, when added to a general corpus (e.g., Wikipedia),\nmicrotheories can supply critical, topical information not necessarily present\nin the corpus, improving both a model's ability to ground its answers to\nverifiable knowledge (i.e., show how answers are systematically entailed by\ndocuments in the corpus, fully grounding up to +8% more answers), and the\naccuracy of those grounded answers (up to +8% absolute). We also show that, in\na human evaluation in the medical domain, our distilled microtheories contain a\nsignificantly higher concentration of topically critical facts than the\nnon-distilled knowledge store. Finally, we show we can quantify the coverage of\na microtheory for a topic (characterized by a dataset) using a notion of\n$p$-relevance. Together, these suggest that microtheories are an efficient\ndistillation of an LM's topic-relevant knowledge, that they can usefully\naugment existing corpora, and can provide both performance gains and an\ninterpretable, verifiable window into the model's knowledge of a topic.",

While\nthis has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO\nloss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as\ndeveloping new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a\ntechnical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics\nof these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing\nDPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given\nan existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that\ncharacterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing\npreference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and\nidentify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we\nshow how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the\nsize and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only\nrigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but\nalso to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from\nfirst principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful\nguidance to those working on human AI alignment.",

However, it\nrarely offers practical insight into magneto-thermoelectric properties. Here,\nwe report the field dependence of thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in a highly\ncompensated semimetal NbSb$_2$, where we find the Seebeck and Nernst\ncoefficients increase quadratically and linearly with applied magnetic field,\nrespectively. Such field dependence was predicted in previous work that studied\na system of two parabolic bands, within semiclassical Boltzmann transport\ntheory when the following two conditions are simultaneously met:$\\omega_c\\tau\n\\gg 1$ and $\\tan\\theta_H \\ll 1$. Under these conditions, we find the field\ndependence of the TE coefficients directly provides a relation between the\nelectron-like ($n_e$) and hole-like ($n_h$) carrier densities, which in turn\ncan be used to refine two-band model fitting. With this, we find the\ncompensation factor ($\\frac{|\\Delta n|}{n_e}$) of NbSb$_2$ is two orders of\nmagnitude smaller than what was found in unrestricted fitting, resulting in a\nlarger saturation field scale for magnetoresistance. Within the same framework\nof the semiclassical theory, we also deduce that the thermoelectric Hall angle\n$\\tan\\theta_{\\gamma} = \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ can be expressed as\n$\\big(\\frac{|\\Delta n|}{n_e} \\times \\omega_c\\tau\\big)^{-1}$, which serves as a\nparameter to predict the degree of compensation.

Our results\nreveal that Dy incorporation enhances magnetic anisotropy, modulates TC, and\ncan create quasi-1D ferromagnetic chains that arise from competing\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Additionally, we investigate\nthe properties of DySBr, DySI and DySeI monolayers, which are isostructural to\nthe CrSBr. Our results reveal the feasibility of exfoliating them down to the\nsingle-layer and the presence of long-range magnetic order at low temperatures,\nrelying on the combination of both weak exchange interactions and large\nspin-orbit coupling. This work provides insights into tuning the properties of\nCrSBr through rare earth doping, unlocking new possibilities for advanced\napplications at the 2D limit.",

We call an indecomposable object $X$ of $\\mathcal C$ non-negligible if\nthere exists $Y\\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $\\bf 1$ is a direct summand of\n$Y\\otimes X$. We prove that every non-negligible object $X\\in \\mathcal{C}$ such\nthat ${\\rm dim}{\\rm End}(X^{\\otimes n})<n!$ for some $n$ is automatically\nrigid. In particular, if $\\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple of moderate growth and\nweakly rigid, then $\\mathcal{C}$ is rigid. As applications, we simplify Huang's\nproof of rigidity of representation categories of certain vertex operator\nalgebras, and we get that for a finite semisimple monoidal category\n$\\mathcal{C}$, the data of a $\\mathcal{C}$-modular functor is equivalent to a\nmodular fusion category structure on $\\mathcal{C}$, answering a question of\nBakalov and Kirillov. Finally, we show that if $\\mathcal{C}$ is rigid and has\nmoderate growth, then the quantum trace of any nilpotent endomorphism in\n$\\mathcal{C}$ is zero. Hence $\\mathcal{C}$ admits a semisimplification, which\nis a semisimple braided tensor category of moderate growth. Finally, we discuss\nrigidity in braided r-categories which are not semisimple, which arise in\nlogarithmic conformal field theory. These results allow us to simplify a number\nof arguments of Kazhdan and Lusztig.",

As the number of modalities\ngrows, these methods become increasingly inefficient due to parameter\nredundancy. To address these issues, we propose Evidence-based\nParameter-Efficient Prompting (EPE-P), a novel and parameter-efficient method\nfor pretrained multimodal networks.

Furthermore, we\npropose an Evidence-based Loss function to better handle the uncertainty\nassociated with missing modalities, improving the model's decision-making.

It approximates an image based on first and\nsecond order statistics using a data term, that is built of a Mahalanobis\ndistance plus a covariance regularization, and the total variation as spatial\nregularization. Moreover, to achieve feasibility, the appearing matrices are\nrestricted to symmetric positive definite ones with eigenvalues exceeding a\ncertain threshold. This threshold is chosen in advance as a data-independent\nparameter. In this article, we study theoretical properties of the model. In\nparticular, we prove the existence of minimizers of the functional and show its\n$\\Gamma$-convergence when the threshold regularizing the eigenvalues of the\nmatrices tends to zero. It turns out that in the $\\Gamma$-limit we lose the\nguaranteed existence of minimizers; and we give an example of an image where\nthe $\\Gamma$-limit indeed has no minimizer. Finally, we derive a formula for\nthe minimum eigenvalues of the covariance matrices appearing in the functional\nthat hints under which conditions the functional is able to handle the data\nwithout regularizing the eigenvalues.

Originally\ndevised for sample-efficient, multi-objective active search approaches in\ncomputationally expensive Beyond Standard Model (BSM) phenomenology, the\nlibrary currently integrates three Machine Learning (ML)-based approaches: a\nConstraint Active Search (CAS) algorithm, a multi-objective Active Search (AS)\nmethod (called b-CASTOR), and a self-exploration method named Machine Learning\nScan (MLScan). These approaches address the challenge of multi-objective\noptimisation in high-dimensional BSM scenarios by employing surrogate models\nand strategically exploring parameter spaces to identify regions that satisfy\ncomplex objectives with fewer evaluations. Additionally, a Markov-Chain Monte\nCarlo method using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (MCMC-MH) is implemented\nfor method comparison. The library also includes a High Energy Physics (HEP)\nmodule based on SPheno as the spectrum calculator. However, the library modules\nand functionalities are designed to be easily extended and used also with other\nexternal software for phenomenology. This manual provides an introduction on\nhow to use the main functionalities of hep-aid and describes the design and\nstructure of the library.

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a single-celled parasite and natural\nmicroswimmer, is responsible for fatal sleeping sickness in infected mammals,\nincluding humans. Understanding how T. brucei interacts with fluid environments\nand navigates through confining spaces is crucial not only for medical and\nclinical applications but also for a fundamental understanding of how life\norganizes in a confined microscopic world. Using a hybrid multi-particle\ncollision dynamics (MPCD)--molecular dynamics (MD) approach, we present our\ninvestigations on the locomotion of an in silico T. brucei in three types of\nfluid environments: bulk fluid, straight cylindrical microchannels, and\nmicrochannels with constrictions. We observe that the helical swimming\ntrajectory of the in silico T. brucei becomes rectified in straight cylindrical\nchannels compared to bulk fluid. The swimming speed for different channel\nwidths is governed by the diameter of the helical trajectory. The speed first\nslightly increases as the channel narrows and then decreases when the helix\ndiameter is compressed. An optimal swimming speed is achieved, when the channel\nwidth is approximately twice the bulk helix diameter. It results from an\ninterplay of the trypanosome's hydrodynamic interactions with the cylindrical\nchannel walls and the high deformability of the parasite. In microchannels with\nconstrictions, the motions of the anterior and posterior ends, the end-to-end\ndistance, and the log-rolling motion of the cell body are characterized and\nshow salient differences compared to the straight-channel case. Depending on\nthe constriction length and width, we observe characteristic slip, stuck, and\nstuck-slip motions of the model T. brucei within the constriction. Our findings\nmay provide some mechanical insights into how T. brucei moves through blood\nvessels and tissues, and across the blood-brain barrier.",

Euclid's Early Release Observations\n(ERO) demonstrate this potential with a field of view that includes several\ngalaxies in the Dorado group. In this paper, we aim to derive from this image a\nmass assembly scenario for its main galaxies: NGC 1549, NGC 1553, and NGC 1546.\nWe detect internal and external diffuse structures, and identify candidate\nglobular clusters (GCs). By analysing the colours and distributions of the\ndiffuse structures and candidate GCs, we can place constraints on the galaxies'\nmass assembly and merger histories. The results show that feature morphology,\nsurface brightness, colours, and GC density profiles are consistent with\ngalaxies that have undergone different merger scenarios. We classify NGC 1549\nas a pure elliptical galaxy that has undergone a major merger. NGC 1553 appears\nto have recently transitioned from a late-type galaxy to early type, after a\nseries of radial minor to intermediate mergers. NGC 1546 is a rare specimen of\ngalaxy with an undisturbed disk and a prominent diffuse stellar halo, which we\ninfer has been fed by minor mergers and then disturbed by the tidal effect from\nNGC 1553. Finally, we identify limitations specific to the observing conditions\nof this ERO, in particular stray light in the visible and persistence in the\nnear-infrared bands. Once these issues are addressed and the extended emission\nfrom LSB objects is preserved by the data-processing pipeline, the Euclid Wide\nSurvey will allow studies of the local Universe to be extended to statistical\nensembles over a large part of the extragalactic sky.",

A well-designed forensic detector should detect generator specific\nartifacts rather than reflect data biases. To this end, we propose B-Free, a\nbias-free training paradigm, where fake images are generated from real ones\nusing the conditioning procedure of stable diffusion models. This ensures\nsemantic alignment between real and fake images, allowing any differences to\nstem solely from the subtle artifacts introduced by AI generation. Through\ncontent-based augmentation, we show significant improvements in both\ngeneralization and robustness over state-of-the-art detectors and more\ncalibrated results across 27 different generative models, including recent\nreleases, like FLUX and Stable Diffusion 3.5. Our findings emphasize the\nimportance of a careful dataset design, highlighting the need for further\nresearch on this topic.

Via extensive molecular\ndynamics simulations, We show that activity enhances density fluctuations more\nstrongly than its passive counterpart. Increasing activity beyond a limit\nresults in the sub-Arrhenieus-type relaxation behavior in active glasses. We\nalso propose a unified scaling theory that can rationalize the relaxation\nspectrum over a broad parameter range using the concept of an effective\ntemperature.

We describe their shape through effective length,\ndetour (maximum distance of FP from a straight line), inness (signed area\nbetween FP and straight line), and their performance through a novel metric\nmeasuring how fast and how far an agent travels toward its destination. The\nentire network is characterized by analyzing the distribution of the\nperformance metric (and its Gini coefficient) across uniformly sampled paths.\nThe study focuses on the traffic loading phenomenon that takes place during the\nmorning peak hour for eight major cities: Networks start with empty edges that\nare progressively populated by the FPs of single vehicles. As vehicle density\ngrows, the interactions among selfish agents becomes stronger at edge level,\nand travel speed linearly decreases, thus optimal paths dynamically change with\ntraffic. We fully characterize the transition to congestion and discuss the\ncommon aspects among the cities (and some peculiarities), in particular we were\nable to pinpoint a critical traffic level (or a sequence) for which path shape,\nrejection ratio, and inequality of the performance degradation, show a\nconcurrent qualitative change. For all cities we observe large peaks for both\ndetour and inness (and their variance) in the proximity of the critical traffic\nlevel. Inness shows that paths are slightly attracted by city centers with\nlight traffic, but switch to a strong repulsion immediately beyond the\ntransition.

Typically, quasi-static electric, magnetic, or strain\nfields are exploited to transform or pole ferroic domains. In contrast,\nmetallurgy makes use of fast thermal quenches across phase transitions to\ncreate new functional states and domain structures. This approach employs the\nrapid temporal evolution of systems far from equilibrium to overcome the\nconstraints imposed by comparably slow interactions. However, guiding the\nnonequilibrium evolution of domains towards otherwise inaccessible\nconfigurations remains largely unexplored in ferroics. Here, we harness thermal\nquenches to exert control over a ferroic domain pattern. Cooling at variable\nspeed triggers transitions between two ferroic phases in a rare-earth\northoferrite, with transient domain evolution enabling the selection of the\nfinal domain pattern. Specifically, by tuning the quench rate, we can either\ngenerate the intrinsic domain structure of the low-temperature phase or\ntransfer the original pattern of the high-temperature phase - creating a hidden\nmetastable domain configuration inaccessible at thermal equilibrium. Real-time\nimaging during rapid quenching reveals two distinct time scales governing\ndomain evolution: a fast fragmentation phase, followed by a slower relaxation\ntowards a new pattern or back to the original one.

The numerical method belongs to the class of Eulerian unfitted finite\nelement methods. It employs a cutFEM discretization in space and a standard BDF\ntime-stepping scheme, enabled by a discrete extension of the solution from the\nphysical domain into the ambient space using ghost-penalty stabilization. To\ninvestigate the origin of spurious temporal pressure oscillations, we revisit a\nfinite element stability analysis for the steady domain case and extend it to\nderive a stability estimate for the pressure in the $L^\\infty(L^2)$-norm that\nis uniform with respect to discretization parameters. By identifying where the\narguments fail in the context of a moving domain, we propose a variant of the\nmethod that ensures unconditional stability of the instantaneous pressure. As a\nresult, the modified method eliminates spurious pressure oscillations. We also\npresent extensive numerical studies aimed at illustrating our findings and\nexploring the effects of fluid viscosity, geometry approximation, mass\nconservation, discretization and stabilization parameters, and the choice of\nfinite element spaces on the occurrence and magnitude of spurious temporal\npressure oscillations. The results of the experiments demonstrate a significant\nimprovement in the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method compared to\nexisting approaches.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a class of network models capable of\nprocessing spatiotemporal information, with event-driven characteristics and\nenergy efficiency advantages. Recently, directly trained SNNs have shown\npotential to match or surpass the performance of traditional Artificial Neural\nNetworks (ANNs) in classification tasks. However, in object detection tasks,\ndirectly trained SNNs still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to\nANNs when tested on frame-based static object datasets (such as COCO2017).\nTherefore, bridging this performance gap and enabling directly trained SNNs to\nachieve performance comparable to ANNs on these static datasets has become one\nof the key challenges in the development of SNNs.To address this challenge,\nthis paper focuses on enhancing the SNN's unique ability to process\nspatiotemporal information. Spiking neurons, as the core components of SNNs,\nfacilitate the exchange of information between different temporal channels\nduring the process of converting input floating-point data into binary spike\nsignals. However, existing neuron models still have certain limitations in the\ncommunication of temporal information. Some studies have even suggested that\ndisabling the backpropagation in the time dimension during SNN training can\nstill yield good training results. To improve the SNN handling of temporal\ninformation, this paper proposes replacing traditional 2D convolutions with 3D\nconvolutions, thus directly incorporating temporal information into the\nconvolutional process. Additionally, temporal information recurrence mechanism\nis introduced within the neurons to further enhance the neurons' efficiency in\nutilizing temporal information.Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod enables directly trained SNNs to achieve performance levels comparable\nto ANNs on the COCO2017 and VOC datasets.",

As models are recursively trained on generated data\nfrom previous rounds, their ability to capture the nuances of the original\nhuman-generated data may degrade. This is often referred to as \\emph{model\ncollapse}. In this work, we ask how fast model collapse occurs for some\nwell-studied distribution families under maximum likelihood (ML or near ML)\nestimation during recursive training. Surprisingly, even for fundamental\ndistributions such as discrete and Gaussian distributions, the exact rate of\nmodel collapse is unknown. In this work, we theoretically characterize the rate\nof collapse in these fundamental settings and complement it with experimental\nevaluations. Our results show that for discrete distributions, the time to\nforget a word is approximately linearly dependent on the number of times it\noccurred in the original corpus, and for Gaussian models, the standard\ndeviation reduces to zero roughly at $n$ iterations, where $n$ is the number of\nsamples at each iteration.

To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel method, termed Hierarchical Vector\nQuantization (HVQ), that consists of two subsequent vector quantization\nmodules.

To this end, we introduce a new metric based on the\nJensen-Shannon Distance (JSD) for unsupervised temporal action segmentation.

However, methods to evaluate and\nbenchmark the performance of different Video LLMs, especially their\nfine-grained, temporal visual capabilities, remain very limited. On one hand,\ncurrent benchmarks use relatively simple videos (e.g., subtitled movie clips)\nwhere the model can understand the entire video by processing just a few\nframes. On the other hand, their datasets lack diversity in task format,\ncomprising only QA or multi-choice QA, which overlooks the models' capacity for\ngenerating in-depth and precise texts. Sports videos, which feature intricate\nvisual information, sequential events, and emotionally charged commentary,\npresent a critical challenge for Video LLMs, making sports commentary an ideal\nbenchmarking task. Inspired by these challenges, we propose a novel task:\nsports video commentary generation, developed $\\textbf{SCBench}$ for Video\nLLMs. To construct such a benchmark, we introduce (1) $\\textbf{SCORES}$, a\nsix-dimensional metric specifically designed for our task, upon which we\npropose a GPT-based evaluation method, and (2) $\\textbf{CommentarySet}$, a\ndataset consisting of 5,775 annotated video clips and ground-truth labels\ntailored to our metric.

    "abstract": "Applying Gaussian Splatting to perception tasks for 3D scene understanding is\nbecoming increasingly popular. Most existing works primarily focus on rendering\n2D feature maps from novel viewpoints, which leads to an imprecise 3D language\nfield with outlier languages, ultimately failing to align objects in 3D space.\nBy utilizing masked images for feature extraction, these approaches also lack\nessential contextual information, leading to inaccurate feature representation.\nTo this end, we propose a Language-Embedded Surface Field (LangSurf), which\naccurately aligns the 3D language fields with the surface of objects,\nfacilitating precise 2D and 3D segmentation with text query, widely expanding\nthe downstream tasks such as removal and editing. The core of LangSurf is a\njoint training strategy that flattens the language Gaussian on the object\nsurfaces using geometry supervision and contrastive losses to assign accurate\nlanguage features to the Gaussians of objects. In addition, we also introduce\nthe Hierarchical-Context Awareness Module to extract features at the image\nlevel for contextual information then perform hierarchical mask pooling using\nmasks segmented by SAM to obtain fine-grained language features in different\nhierarchies. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary 2D and 3D semantic\nsegmentation demonstrate that LangSurf outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method LangSplat by a large margin. As shown in Fig. 1, our\nmethod is capable of segmenting objects in 3D space, thus boosting the\neffectiveness of our approach in instance recognition, removal, and editing,\nwhich is also supported by comprehensive experiments.\n\\url{https://langsurf.github.io}.",

In the first stage, we fix the VAE and\nfine-tune the denoiser in latent space, which yields substantial shadow removal\nbut may lose some high-frequency details.

Moreover, EAs often depend on\nmanual parameter settings, which can disrupt the exploration-exploitation\nbalance.To address these issues, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a\nnovel EA framework. GNE represents the population as a graph, where nodes\nrepresent individuals, and edges capture their relationships, enabling global\ninformation usage. GNE utilizes spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) to\ndecompose evolutionary signals into frequency components, applying a filtering\nfunction to fuse these components. High-frequency components capture diverse\nglobal information, while low-frequency ones capture more consistent\ninformation. This explicit frequency filtering strategy directly controls\nglobal-scale features through frequency components, overcoming the limitations\nof manual parameter settings and making the exploration-exploitation control\nmore interpretable and effective.Extensive tests on nine benchmark functions\n(e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) show that GNE outperforms classical (GA,\nDE, CMA-ES) and advanced algorithms (SDAES, RL-SHADE) under various conditions,\nincluding noise-corrupted and optimal solution deviation scenarios.

The selection task is commonly\naddressed by identifying the model that maximizes an evaluation score based on\nthe diversity and quality of the generated data. However, such a best-model\nidentification approach overlooks the possibility that a mixture of available\nmodels can outperform each individual model. In this work, we numerically show\nthat a mixture of generative models on benchmark image datasets can indeed\nachieve a better evaluation score (based on FID and KID scores), compared to\nthe individual models. This observation motivates the development of efficient\nalgorithms for selecting the optimal mixture of the models. To address this, we\nformulate a quadratic optimization problem to find an optimal mixture model\nachieving the maximum of kernel-based evaluation scores including kernel\ninception distance (KID) and R\\'enyi kernel entropy (RKE). To identify the\noptimal mixture of the models using the fewest possible sample queries, we view\nthe selection task as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and propose the\nMixture Upper Confidence Bound (Mixture-UCB) algorithm that provably converges\nto the optimal mixture of the involved models. More broadly, the proposed\nMixture-UCB can be extended to optimize every convex quadratic function of the\nmixture weights in a general MAB setting.

Existing\nFSAD methods usually find anomalies by directly designing complex text prompts\nto align them with visual features under the prevailing large vision-language\nmodel paradigm. However, these methods, almost always, neglect intrinsic\ncontextual information in visual features, e.g., the interaction relationships\nbetween different vision layers, which is an important clue for detecting\nanomalies comprehensively. To this end, we propose a kernel-aware graph prompt\nlearning framework, termed as KAG-prompt, by reasoning the cross-layer\nrelations among visual features for FSAD. Specifically, a kernel-aware\nhierarchical graph is built by taking the different layer features focusing on\nanomalous regions of different sizes as nodes, meanwhile, the relationships\nbetween arbitrary pairs of nodes stand for the edges of the graph. By message\npassing over this graph, KAG-prompt can capture cross-layer contextual\ninformation, thus leading to more accurate anomaly prediction. Moreover, to\nintegrate the information of multiple important anomaly signals in the\nprediction map, we propose a novel image-level scoring method based on\nmulti-level information fusion. Extensive experiments on MVTecAD and VisA\ndatasets show that KAG-prompt achieves state-of-the-art FSAD results for\nimage-level/pixel-level anomaly detection.

They are commonly used for text\ngeneration, but also widely used to assist with code generation [3], and even\nanalysis of security information, as Microsoft Security Copilot demonstrates\n[18].

How do LLMs differ in\nvulnerabilities from traditional ML models? 2. What are the attack objectives\nin LLMs? 3. How complex it is to assess the risks posed by the vulnerabilities\nof LLMs? 4. What is the supply chain in LLMs, how data flow in and out of\nsystems and what are the security implications? We conclude with an overview of\nopen challenges and outlook.",

    "abstract": "Traditional analyses of gradient descent optimization show that, when the\nlargest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian - often referred to as the sharpness -\nis below a critical learning-rate threshold, then training is 'stable' and\ntraining loss decreases monotonically. Recent studies, however, have suggested\nthat the majority of modern deep neural networks achieve good performance\ndespite operating outside this stable regime. In this work, we demonstrate that\nsuch instabilities, induced by large learning rates, move model parameters\ntoward flatter regions of the loss landscape. Our crucial insight lies in\nnoting that, during these instabilities, the orientation of the Hessian\neigenvectors rotate. This, we conjecture, allows the model to explore regions\nof the loss landscape that display more desirable geometrical properties for\ngeneralization, such as flatness. These rotations are a consequence of network\ndepth, and we prove that for any network with depth > 1, unstable growth in\nparameters cause rotations in the principal components of the Hessian, which\npromote exploration of the parameter space away from unstable directions. Our\nempirical studies reveal an implicit regularization effect in gradient descent\nwith large learning rates operating beyond the stability threshold. We find\nthese lead to excellent generalization performance on modern benchmark\ndatasets.",

    "abstract": "The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an intriguing electronic spin\nsystem with applications in quantum radiometry, sensing and computation. In\nthose experiments, a bias magnetic field is commonly applied along the NV\nsymmetry axis to eliminate the triplet ground state manifold's degeneracy\n(S=1). In this configuration, the eigenvectors of the NV spin's projection\nalong its axis are called strong-axial field states. Conversely, in some\nexperiments a weak magnetic field is applied orthogonal to the NV symmetry\naxis, leading to eigenstates that are balanced linear superpositions of\nstrong-axial field states, referred to as dressed states. The latter are\nsensitive to environmental magnetic noise at the second order, allowing to\nperform magnetic field protected measurements while providing increased\ncoherence times. However, if a small axial magnetic field is added in this\nregime, the linear superposition of strong-axial field states becomes\nunbalanced. This paper presents a comprehensive study of Free Induction Decay\n(FID) measurements performed on a NV center ensemble in the presence of strain\nand weak orthogonal magnetic field, as a function of a small magnetic field\napplied along the NV symmetry axis. The simultaneous detection of dressed\nstates and unbalanced superpositions of strong-axial field states in a single\nFID measurement is shown, gaining insight about coherence time, nuclear spin\nand the interplay between temperature and magnetic field sensitivity. The\ndiscussion concludes by describing how the simultaneous presence of\nmagnetically-sensitive and -insensitive states opens up appealing possibilities\nfor both sensing and quantum computation applications.",

To help understand the mechanisms that\ndetermine the structure of and the diversity within these colonies, various\nnumerical modeling techniques have been applied. The most commonly used ones\nare continuum models, agent-based models, and lattice models. Continuum models\nare usually computationally fast, but disregard information at the level of the\nindividual, which can be crucial to understanding diversity in a colony.\nAgent-based models resolve local details to a greater level, but are\ncomputationally costly. Lattice-based approaches strike a balance between these\ntwo limiting cases. However, this is known to come at the price of introducing\nundesirable artifacts into the structure of the colonies. For instance, square\nlattices tend to produce square colonies even where an isotropic shape is\nexpected. Here, we aim to overcome these limitations and therefore study\nlattice-induced orientational symmetry in a class of hybrid numerical methods\nthat combine aspects of lattice-based and continuum descriptions. We\ncharacterize these artifacts and show that they can be circumvented through the\nuse of a disordered lattice which derives from an unstructured fluid. The main\nadvantage of this approach is that the lattice itself does not imbue the colony\nwith a preferential directionality. We demonstrate that our implementation\nenables the study of colony growth involving millions of individuals within\nhours of computation time on an ordinary desktop computer, while retaining many\nof the desirable features of agent-based models.

    "abstract": "We propose a large structural VAR which is identified by higher moments\nwithout the need to impose economically motivated restrictions. The model\nscales well to higher dimensions, allowing the inclusion of a larger number of\nvariables. We develop an efficient Gibbs sampler to estimate the model. We also\npresent an estimator of the deviance information criterion to facilitate model\ncomparison. Finally, we discuss how economically motivated restrictions can be\nadded to the model. Experiments with artificial data show that the model\npossesses good estimation properties. Using real data we highlight the benefits\nof including more variables in the structural analysis. Specifically, we\nidentify a monetary policy shock and provide empirical evidence that prices and\neconomic output respond with a large delay to the monetary policy shock.",

    "abstract": "The chaotic nature of ocean motion is a major challenge that hinders the\ndiscovery of spatio-temporal current routes that govern the transport of\nmaterial. Certain material, such as oil spills, pose significant environmental\nthreats and these are enhanced by the fact that they evolve in a chaotic sea,\nin a way which still nowadays is far from being systematically anticipated.\nRecently such an oil spill event has affected the Mediterranean coast of\nseveral Middle Eastern countries. No accidents were reported for these spills\nprevious to their arrival at the coast, and therefore there was no hint of\ntheir origin. Modelling such an event, in which uncertainties are increased due\nto the lack of information on where and when the spills was produced, stretches\navailable technologies to their limits, and requires the use of novel ideas\nthat help to understand the essential features of oil and tar transport by\nocean currents. In this regard Lagrangian Coherent Structures enable us to find\norder within ocean chaos and provide powerful insights into chaotic events and\ntheir relationships over different locations and times like the one addressed.\nUsing the observed locations of the oil impacting the coast at specific times,\nwe seek to determine its original location and the time it was released in the\nopen ocean. We have determined both using a combination of earlier satellite\nobservations and computational modelling of the time evolution. The observed\nagreement between modeled cases and satellite observations highlights the power\nof these ideas.",

Drawing\nfrom Guilford's creativity theory, our benchmark employs a dynamic panel of\nstate-of-the-art LLMs to assess generated ideas across five key dimensions:\noriginality, feasibility, fluency, flexibility, and clarity. Through extensive\nexperimentation with over 40 leading models across 1,180 keywords spanning 22\nscientific domains, we reveal that the scientific idea generation capabilities\nmeasured by our benchmark, are poorly predicted by standard metrics of general\nintelligence. Our results demonstrate that models like QwQ-32B-preview achieve\ncreative performance comparable to top-tier models such as\nclaude-3.7-sonnet:thinking, despite significant gaps in their general\nintelligence scores.

It comprises ten domains, including\nmodel characteristics, accuracy, reproducibility, and fairness and bias. The\naccompanying checklist translates the framework into actionable reporting\nitems. To illustrate its use, the framework was applied to two published HEOR\nstudies: one focused on systematic literature review tasks and the other on\neconomic modeling.\n  Results: The ELEVATE GenAI framework offers a comprehensive structure for\nreporting LLM-assisted HEOR research, while the checklist facilitates practical\nimplementation. Its application to the two case studies demonstrates its\nrelevance and usability across different HEOR contexts.\n  Limitations: Although the framework provides robust reporting guidance,\nfurther empirical testing is needed to assess its validity, completeness,\nusability, as well as its generalizability across diverse HEOR use cases.\n  Conclusion: The ELEVATE GenAI framework and checklist address a critical gap\nby offering structured guidance for transparent, accurate, and reproducible\nreporting of LLM-assisted HEOR research.

A significant\nchallenge in ISAC systems is the degradation of localization accuracy due to\npoor propagation conditions, such as multipath effects and non-line-of-sight\n(NLoS) scenarios. These conditions result in outlier measurements that can\nseverely impact localization performance. This paper investigates the\nenhancement of target localization accuracy in multistatic ISAC systems under\nboth line-of-sight (LoS) and NLoS conditions.

We introduce a\nnovel algorithm to improve localization accuracy by mitigating the impact of\noutliers in range measurements, while also accounting for errors due to PRS\nrange resolution. Eventually, through simulation results, we demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method over previous approaches. Indeed, we achieve\nup to 28% and 20% improvements in average localization error over least squares\n(LS) and iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) methods, respectively.\nAdditionally, we observe up to 16% and 13% enhancements in the 90th percentile\nof localization error compared to LS and IRLS, respectively.

At ambient pressure, YbCuS2 exhibits a magnetic transition at TN\n~ 0.95 K, forming an incommensurate helical magnetic order.

Analytical mean-field equations\nare derived, finding excellent agreement with agent-based simulations on a\ncomplete graph.

These learning-based methods typically model\ndistributions on simple yet explicit scene representations using generative\nmodels. However, due to the oversimplified explicit representations that\noverlook detailed information and the lack of guidance from multimodal\nrelationships within the scene, most learning-based methods struggle to\ngenerate indoor scenes with realistic object arrangements and styles. In this\npaper, we introduce a new method, Scene Implicit Neural Field (S-INF), for\nindoor scene synthesis, aiming to learn meaningful representations of\nmultimodal relationships, to enhance the realism of indoor scene synthesis.\nS-INF assumes that the scene layout is often related to the object-detailed\ninformation. It disentangles the multimodal relationships into scene layout\nrelationships and detailed object relationships, fusing them later through\nimplicit neural fields (INFs). By learning specialized scene layout\nrelationships and projecting them into S-INF, we achieve a realistic generation\nof scene layout. Additionally, S-INF captures dense and detailed object\nrelationships through differentiable rendering, ensuring stylistic consistency\nacross objects. Through extensive experiments on the benchmark 3D-FRONT\ndataset, we demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance under different types of ISS.",

There is striking evidence that the nonlocal quantum\nexchange interactions between particles persist up to a distance of 10 meters\nat temperatures above 00C. The forces which govern the collective memory effect\nand shape the macroscopic structure therefore allow to visualize quantum\nphenomena which extend the classical causality notion into an expanded nonlocal\nreality in which the quantum fields of the particles exist simultaneously at\nseparated points in space. We propose that the observations are attributed to\nchiral electronic states dependent van der Waals interactions coupled to vacuum\nfluctuations.",

    "abstract": "In standard quantum theory, the causal relations between operations are\nfixed. One can relax this notion by allowing for dynamical arrangements, where\noperations may influence the causal relations of future operations, as\ncertified by violation of fixed-order inequalities, e.g., the k-cycle\ninequalities. Another, non-causal, departure further relaxes these limitations,\nand is certified by violations of causal inequalities. In this paper, we\nexplore the interplay between dynamic and indefinite causality. We study the\nk-cycle inequalities and show that the quantum switch violates these\ninequalities without exploiting its indefinite nature. We further introduce\nnon-adaptive strategies, which effectively remove the dynamical aspect of any\nprocess, and show that the k-cycle inequalities become ovel causal\ninequalities; violating k-cycle inequalities under the restriction of\nnon-adaptive strategies requires non-causal setups. The quantum switch is known\nto be incapable of violating causal inequalities, and it is believed that a\ndevice-independent certification of its causal indefiniteness requires extended\nsetups incorporating spacelike separation. This work reopens the possibility\nfor a device-independent certification of the quantum switch in isolation via\nfixed-order inequalities instead of causal inequalities. The inequalities we\nstudy here, however, turn out to be unsuitable for such a device-independent\ncertification.",

However, this progress has also made\nVLMs vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks, raising concerns about\ntheir reliability. The objective of this paper is to assess the resilience of\nVLMs against jailbreak attacks that can compromise model safety compliance and\nresult in harmful outputs. To evaluate a VLM's ability to maintain its\nrobustness against adversarial input perturbations, we propose a novel metric\ncalled the \\textbf{Retention Score}. Retention Score is a multi-modal\nevaluation metric that includes Retention-I and Retention-T scores for\nquantifying jailbreak risks in visual and textual components of VLMs. Our\nprocess involves generating synthetic image-text pairs using a conditional\ndiffusion model. These pairs are then predicted for toxicity score by a VLM\nalongside a toxicity judgment classifier. By calculating the margin in toxicity\nscores, we can quantify the robustness of the VLM in an attack-agnostic manner.\nOur work has four main contributions. First, we prove that Retention Score can\nserve as a certified robustness metric. Second, we demonstrate that most VLMs\nwith visual components are less robust against jailbreak attacks than the\ncorresponding plain VLMs. Additionally, we evaluate black-box VLM APIs and find\nthat the security settings in Google Gemini significantly affect the score and\nrobustness. Moreover, the robustness of GPT4V is similar to the medium settings\nof Gemini. Finally, our approach offers a time-efficient alternative to\nexisting adversarial attack methods and provides consistent model robustness\nrankings when evaluated on VLMs including MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA.",

    "abstract": "Smartwatches have become popular for monitoring physiological parameters\noutside clinical settings. Using reflective photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors,\nsuch watches can non-invasively estimate heart rate (HR) in everyday\nenvironments and throughout a patient's day. However, achieving consistently\nhigh accuracy remains challenging, particularly during moments of increased\nmotion or due to varying device placement. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nsensor fusion method for estimating HR that flexibly combines samples from\nmultiple PPG sensors placed across the patient's body, including wrist, ankle,\nhead, and sternum (chest). Our method first estimates signal quality across all\ninputs to dynamically integrate them into a joint and robust PPG signal for HR\nestimation. We evaluate our method on a novel dataset of PPG and ECG recordings\nfrom 14 participants who engaged in real-world activities outside the\nlaboratory over the course of a whole day. Our method achieves a mean HR error\nof 2.4\\,bpm, which is 46\\% lower than the mean error of the best-performing\nsingle device (4.4\\,bpm, head).",

There are two variants for this pre-training. In the local context-only\nbase scheme (CiteBART-Base), the citation token in a local context is masked to\nlearn to predict the citation. The global version (CiteBART-Global) extends the\nlocal context with the citing paper's title and abstract to enrich the learning\nsignal. CiteBART-Global achieves state-of-the-art performance on LCR benchmarks\nexcept for the FullTextPeerRead dataset, which is quite small to see the\nadvantage of generative pre-training.

We perform comprehensive experiments,\nincluding an ablation study, a qualitative analysis, and a taxonomy of\nhallucinations with detailed statistics.

Exploring textual backdoor attacks not only helps reveal the potential\nsecurity risks of models, but also promotes innovation and development of\ndefense mechanisms. Currently, most textual backdoor attack methods are based\non a single trigger. For example, inserting specific content into text as a\ntrigger or changing the abstract text features to be a trigger. However, the\nadoption of this single-trigger mode makes the existing backdoor attacks\nsubject to certain limitations: either they are easily identified by the\nexisting defense strategies, or they have certain shortcomings in attack\nperformance and in the construction of poisoned datasets. In order to solve\nthese issues, a dual-trigger backdoor attack method is proposed in this paper.\nSpecifically, we use two different attributes, syntax and mood (we use\nsubjunctive mood as an example in this article), as two different triggers. It\nmakes our backdoor attack method similar to a double landmine which can have\ncompletely different trigger conditions simultaneously. Therefore, this method\nnot only improves the flexibility of trigger mode, but also enhances the\nrobustness against defense detection. A large number of experimental results\nshow that this method significantly outperforms the previous methods based on\nabstract features in attack performance, and achieves comparable attack\nperformance (almost 100\\% attack success rate) with the insertion-based method.\nIn addition, in order to further improve the attack performance, we also give\nthe construction method of the poisoned dataset.The code and data of this paper\ncan be obtained at https://github.com/HoyaAm/Double-Landmines.",

It is posited that integrating SDNs and\nblockchain into IoE leads to performance enhancements, improves security,\nenables decentralized operations, and eliminates single points of failure in\nthe SDN control plane.

As a partially unsaturated molecule, CH3CHO can have links with more\nhydrogenated species, like ethanol (C2H5OH) or with more unsaturated ones, like\nketene (H2CCO). We used highly accurate quantum chemical calculations to\ndetermine the reaction rate constants for the CH3CHO + H/D reaction. Our\ntheoretical results are confronted against our experiments on the hydrogenation\nand deuteration of CH3CHO ice. We find that acetaldehyde resists hydrogenation,\nwith only a 10\\% of conversion to products different than CH3CHO. This is due\nto a predominance of H-abstraction at the HCO moiety, with reaction rate\nconstants up to four orders of magnitude higher than the next possible reaction\nchannel, that is hydrogenation at the aldehydic carbon. The formed CH3CO\nradical experiences barrierless or nearly barrierless reactions in all possible\nreaction positions, reforming CH3CHO and creating a closed loop that protects\nthe molecule against hydrogenation. We constrain the branching ratios for the\nsecond reaction from experiments. Our experiments agree with the calculations\nand from the combination of both we can explain the presence of H2CCO, CO, CH4,\nC2H5OH, H2CO or CH3OH as minor products at the end of the reaction. We provide\nrecommendations for future modeling efforts. Our results show limited\ndestruction of acetaldehyde, reinforcing the vision of this molecule as an\nabundant and resilient COM. From the experiments, we are not able to observe\nthe reactive desorption of this molecule. Our results align with other modeling\nworks, showing that the link between CH3CHO and C2H5OH is not direct. Finally,\nour results can explain the excess of CH3CDO found in prestellar cores.",

Our method employs a\nsequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) text diffusion model as a generator,\nconditioning on the original prompt and guiding the denoising process with a\nnovel attack loss. Unlike previous approaches that use autoregressive LLMs to\ngenerate jailbreak prompts, which limit the modification of already generated\ntokens and restrict the rewriting space, DiffusionAttacker utilizes a seq2seq\ndiffusion model, allowing more flexible token modifications. This approach\npreserves the semantic content of the original prompt while producing harmful\ncontent. Additionally, we leverage the Gumbel-Softmax technique to make the\nsampling process from the diffusion model's output distribution differentiable,\neliminating the need for iterative token search. Extensive experiments on\nAdvbench and Harmbench demonstrate that DiffusionAttacker outperforms previous\nmethods across various evaluation metrics, including attack success rate (ASR),\nfluency, and diversity.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates photon orbits around Kerr-MOG black holes. The\nequation of photon of motion around the Kerr-MOG black hole is derived by\nsolving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, expressed as a sixth-order polynomial\ninvolving the inclination angle $v$, the rotation parameter $u$, and the\ndeformation parameter $\\alpha$ that characterizes modified gravity. We find\nthat $\\alpha$ constrains the rotation of the black hole, modifying its\ngravitational field and leading to distinct photon orbital characteristics.\nNumerical analysis reveals that the polar plane ($v=1$) has two effective\norbits: one outside and one inside the event horizon, while the equatorial\nplane ($v=0$) has four effective orbits: two outside and two inside the event\nhorizon. Moreover, we derive the exact formula for general photon orbits\nbetween the polar and equatorial planes ($0<v<1$). In the extremal case, the\nrotation speed significantly impacts general photon orbits. A slowly rotating\nextremal black hole has two general photon orbits outside the event horizon,\nwhereas a rapidly rotating extremal black hole has only one such orbit. In the\nnon-extremal case, a critical inclination angle $v_{cr}$ exists in the\nparameter space $\\left(v, u, \\alpha \\right)$. Below $v_{cr}$, there are four\ngeneral photon orbits, while above $v_{cr}$, there are two orbits. At the\ncritical inclination angle, three solutions are found: two photon orbits\noutside and one inside the event horizon. Additionally, the results indicate\nthat all orbits are radially unstable. Furthermore, by analyzing photon impact\nparameter, we argue that $\\alpha$ influences observational properties of the\nblack hole.",

Notably, this approach is independent of\nthe initial state, exact for arbitrary evolution times, and it holds for\nHermitian as well as non-Hermitian systems. The ensemble behavior resembles\nthat of an open quantum system, whose decoherence function or rates are\ndetermined by the disorder distribution and the periodicity of the Hamiltonian.\nDepending on the underlying distribution, the dynamics can display\nnon-Markovian characteristics detectable through non-Markovian witnesses.

The\nmagneto-mechanical torque manifests due to a misalignment of the external\nmagnetic field vector with the built-in magnetic anisotropy axis, as opposed to\na magnetic force, and complicates the measurement scheme. In this work, we\ndeveloped a method using a commercially available Atomic Force Microscopy setup\nand cantilevers to quantify the torque generated by a single synthetic\nantiferromagnetic (SAF) nanoplatelet with high perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy.

This measured torque and derived force of the\nSAF nanoplatelets is strong enough for most applications in mechanobiology; for\nexample, it can be used to rupture (cancer) cell membranes.

Our goal\nis to investigate the relationship between regions of low radial action\nidentified in simulated discs and the location of the spiral arms, such as that\nsuggested in Palicio et al.

For a sample of 23 simulated\nspiral galaxies, we modelled the axisymmetric component of their gravitational\npotential to compute the radial action of their stellar particles using the\nStaeckel fudge. The spatial distribution of the radial action was then compared\nto the location of the spiral arms, identified as overdensities in the stellar\nsurface density using a kernel density estimator. Our analysis reveals a strong\ncorrelation between the radial action distribution and the spiral arms in 18 of\n23 simulated galaxies. However, notable discrepancies are observed in the\nremaining five, since they are profoundly out-of-equilibrium systems, such as\ngalaxies influenced by external interactions or spiral arms still in the\nprocess of winding up. We have confirmed that, in general, there is a tendency\nof spatial correlation between spiral arms and stellar populations featuring\nlow values of the radial action, as discussed in Palicio et al.

In this paper, we investigate a resampling approach to the NANCOVA\nframework, which is a fully nonparametric model based on relative effects that\nallows for an arbitrary number of covariates and groups, where both outcome\nvariable (endpoint) and covariates can be metric or ordinal.

Resampling\nNANCOVA also provided consistently high power: up to 26% higher than the test\nwithout covariate adjustment in a small sample scenario with 4 groups and two\ncovariates. Moreover, we prove that resampling NANCOVA provides an\nasymptotically exact testing procedure, which makes it the first one in the\nNANCOVA framework.

    "abstract": "Accurate uncertainty information associated with essential climate variables\n(ECVs) is crucial for reliable climate modeling and understanding the\nspatiotemporal evolution of the Earth system. In recent years, geoscience and\nclimate scientists have benefited from rapid progress in deep learning to\nadvance the estimation of ECV products with improved accuracy. However, the\nquantification of uncertainties associated with the output of such deep\nlearning models has yet to be thoroughly adopted. This survey explores the\ntypes of uncertainties associated with ECVs estimated from deep learning and\nthe techniques to quantify them. The focus is on highlighting the importance of\nquantifying uncertainties inherent in ECV estimates, considering the dynamic\nand multifaceted nature of climate data. The survey starts by clarifying the\ndefinition of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties and their roles in a\ntypical satellite observation processing workflow, followed by bridging the gap\nbetween conventional statistical and deep learning views on uncertainties.\nThen, we comprehensively review the existing techniques for quantifying\nuncertainties associated with deep learning algorithms, focusing on their\napplication in ECV studies. The specific need for modification to fit the\nrequirements from both the Earth observation side and the deep learning side in\nsuch interdisciplinary tasks is discussed. Finally, we demonstrate our findings\nwith two ECV examples, snow cover and terrestrial water storage, and provide\nour perspectives for future research.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal machine learning models, such as those that combine text and image\nmodalities, are increasingly used in critical domains including public safety,\nsecurity, and healthcare. However, these systems inherit biases from their\nsingle modalities. This study proposes a systemic framework for analyzing\ndynamic multimodal bias interactions. Using the MMBias dataset, which\nencompasses categories prone to bias such as religion, nationality, and sexual\norientation, this study adopts a simulation-based heuristic approach to compute\nbias scores for text-only, image-only, and multimodal embeddings. A framework\nis developed to classify bias interactions as amplification (multimodal bias\nexceeds both unimodal biases), mitigation (multimodal bias is lower than both),\nand neutrality (multimodal bias lies between unimodal biases), with\nproportional analyzes conducted to identify the dominant mode and dynamics in\nthese interactions. The findings highlight that amplification (22\\%) occurs\nwhen text and image biases are comparable, while mitigation (11\\%) arises under\nthe dominance of text bias, highlighting the stabilizing role of image bias.\nNeutral interactions (67\\%) are related to a higher text bias without\ndivergence. Conditional probabilities highlight the text's dominance in\nmitigation and mixed contributions in neutral and amplification cases,\nunderscoring complex modality interplay. In doing so, the study encourages the\nuse of this heuristic, systemic, and interpretable framework to analyze\nmultimodal bias interactions, providing insight into how intermodal biases\ndynamically interact, with practical applications for multimodal modeling and\ntransferability to context-based datasets, all essential for developing fair\nand equitable AI models.",

To relieve the issues above, this paper proposes Human\nFeedback and Product Consistency (HFPC), which can automatically assess the\ngenerated product images based on two modules. Firstly, to solve inappropriate\nbackgrounds, human feedback on 44,000 automated inpainting product images is\ncollected to train a reward model based on multi-modal features extracted from\nBLIP and comparative learning. Secondly, to filter generated product images\ncontaining inconsistent products, a fine-tuned segmentation model is employed\nto segment the product of the original and generated product images and then\ncompare the differences between the above two. Extensive experiments have\ndemonstrated that HFPC can effectively evaluate the quality of generated\nproduct images and significantly reduce the expense of manual annotation.\nMoreover, HFPC achieves state-of-the-art(96.4% in precision) in comparison to\nother open-source visual-quality-assessment models.

In this paper, we introduce DRT, an\nattempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT).\nSpecifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and\nmetaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in\npractice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often\nfails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human\ntranslators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics\nthroughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in\nMT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing\nliterature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these\nsentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used\nto iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by\nan advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is\nalso employed to quantify the translation quality in each round. In this way,\nwe collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train\nour DRT. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT models can learn the\nthought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as well\nas LLMs which are simply fine-tuning on the paired sentences without long\nthought, showing its effectiveness.

To address these issues, we first propose a novel\nStructure Guided Dehazing Network (SGDN) that leverages the superior structural\nproperties of YCbCr features over RGB.

To the best of our knowledge,\nthe unbalanced-ness of lexicographical-based minimizer partitions has never\nbeen investigated from a theoretical point of view. In this article, we aim to\nfill this gap and determine, for a given minimizer, how many $k$-mers would\nadmit the chosen minimizer -- i.e. what would be the size of the bucket\nassociated to the chosen minimizer in the worst case, where all $k$-mers would\nbe seen in the data. We show that this number can be computed in $O(km)$ space\nand $O(km^2)$ time. We further introduce approximations that can be computed in\n$O(k)$ space and $O(km)$ time. We also show on genomic datasets that the\npractical number of $k$-mers associated to a minimizer are closely correlated\nto the theoretical expected number. We introduce two conjectures that could\nhelp closely approximating the total number of $k$-mers sharing a minimizer. We\nbelieve that characterising the distribution of the number of $k$-mers per\nminimizer will help devise efficient lexicographic-based minimizer bucketting.",

Given that these\nlong-tail events are extremely rare in real-world traffic data, there is a\ngrowing body of work dedicated to the automatic traffic scenario generation.\nHowever, nearly all existing algorithms for generating safety-critical\nscenarios rely on snippets of previously recorded traffic events, transforming\nnormal traffic flow into accident-prone situations directly. In other words,\nsafety-critical traffic scenario generation is hindsight and not applicable to\nnewly encountered and open-ended traffic events.In this paper, we propose the\nDeep Motion Factorization (DeepMF) framework, which extends static\nsafety-critical driving scenario generation to closed-loop and interactive\nadversarial traffic simulation. DeepMF casts safety-critical traffic simulation\nas a Bayesian factorization that includes the assignment of hazardous traffic\nparticipants, the motion prediction of selected opponents, the reaction\nestimation of autonomous vehicle (AV) and the probability estimation of the\naccident occur. All the aforementioned terms are calculated using decoupled\ndeep neural networks, with inputs limited to the current observation and\nhistorical states. Consequently, DeepMF can effectively and efficiently\nsimulate safety-critical traffic scenarios at any triggered time and for any\nduration by maximizing the compounded posterior probability of traffic risk.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DeepMF excels in terms of risk\nmanagement, flexibility, and diversity, showcasing outstanding performance in\nsimulating a wide range of realistic, high-risk traffic scenarios.",

They leverage a hybrid approach that integrates\nclassical and quantum computing resources to solve high-dimensional problems\nthat are challenging for classical approaches alone. In the training process of\nvariational circuits, constructing an accurate probability distribution for\neach epoch is not always necessary, creating opportunities to reduce\ncomputational costs through shot reduction. However, existing shot-allocation\nmethods that capitalize on this potential often lack adaptive feedback or are\ntied to specific classical optimizers, which limits their applicability to\ncommon VQAs and broader optimization techniques. Our observations indicate that\nthe information entropy of a quantum circuit's output distribution exhibits an\napproximately exponential relationship with the number of shots needed to\nachieve a target Hellinger distance. In this work, we propose a\ndistribution-adaptive dynamic shot (DDS) framework that efficiently adjusts the\nnumber of shots per iteration in VQAs using the entropy distribution from the\nprior training epoch. Our results demonstrate that the DDS framework sustains\ninference accuracy while achieving a ~50% reduction in average shot count\ncompared to fixed-shot training, and ~60% higher accuracy than recently\nproposed tiered shot allocation methods. Furthermore, in noisy simulations that\nreflect the error rates of actual IBM quantum systems, DDS achieves\napproximately a ~30% reduction in the total number of shots compared to the\nfixed-shot method with minimal degradation in accuracy, and offers about ~70%\nhigher computational accuracy than tiered shot allocation methods.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is an non-invasive method to record the\nelectrical activity of the brain. The EEG signals are low bandwidth and\nrecorded from multiple electrodes simultaneously in a time synchronized manner.\nTypical EEG signal processing involves extracting features from all the\nindividual channels separately and then fusing these features for downstream\napplications. In this paper, we propose a signal transformation, using basic\nsignal processing, to combine the individual channels of a low-bandwidth\nsignal, like the EEG into a single-channel high-bandwidth signal, like audio.\nFurther this signal transformation is bi-directional, namely the high-bandwidth\nsingle-channel can be transformed to generate the individual low-bandwidth\nsignals without any loss of information. Such a transformation when applied to\nEEG signals overcomes the need to process multiple signals and allows for a\nsingle-channel processing. The advantage of this signal transformation is that\nit allows the use of pre-trained single-channel pre-trained models, for\nmulti-channel signal processing and analysis. We further show the utility of\nthe signal transformation on publicly available EEG dataset.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, high-quality images are pursued by both humans for better viewing\nexperience and by machines for more accurate visual analysis. However, images\nare usually compressed before being consumed, decreasing their quality. It is\nmeaningful to predict the perceptual quality of compressed images for both\nhumans and machines, which guides the optimization for compression. In this\npaper, we propose a unified approach to address this. Specifically, we create a\ndeep learning-based model to predict Satisfied User Ratio (SUR) and Satisfied\nMachine Ratio (SMR) of compressed images simultaneously. We first pre-train a\nfeature extractor network on a large-scale SMR-annotated dataset with human\nperception-related quality labels generated by diverse image quality models,\nwhich simulates the acquisition of SUR labels. Then, we propose an\nMLP-Mixer-based network to predict SUR and SMR by leveraging and fusing the\nextracted multi-layer features. We introduce a Difference Feature Residual\nLearning (DFRL) module to learn more discriminative difference features. We\nfurther use a Multi-Head Attention Aggregation and Pooling (MHAAP) layer to\naggregate difference features and reduce their redundancy. Experimental results\nindicate that the proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SUR\nand SMR prediction methods. Moreover, our joint learning scheme of human and\nmachine perceptual quality prediction tasks is effective at improving the\nperformance of both.",

Thin epitaxial\nlayers of the quaternary (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) compound, containing up to 1% Bi and 6%\nMn atoms, and the reference ternary (Ga,Mn)As compound, have been grown under\neither a compressive or tensile biaxial misfit strain by the low-temperature\nmolecular-beam epitaxy technique with precisely optimized growth conditions.\nThe high-resolution X-ray diffractometry measurements and transmission electron\nmicroscopy imaging of cross-sections across the sample interfaces have\nevidenced for high structural perfection of the DFS layers and sharp interfaces\nwith the substrate. An addition of bismuth into the layers causes a small\ndecrease in their ferromagnetic Curie temperature and a distinct increase in\nthe coercive fields, as revealed by the superconducting quantum interference\ndevice magnetometry investigations. Most of all, the incorporation of a small\natomic fraction of heavy Bi atoms, substituting As atoms in the layer,\npredominantly enhances the spin-orbit coupling strength in its valence band,\nconsiderably affecting electromagnetic properties of the layers. Investigations\nof magnetotransport properties of the DFS layers, performed on micro-Hall-bars\nprepared from the layers using electron-beam lithography patterning, reveal, as\na result of Bi addition to the layers, significantly enhanced magnitudes of\nmagnetoresistance, anomalous and planar Hall effects as well as the spin-orbit\ntorque effect.

Such a (total-)dominating\nset endowed with a separation property is often referred to as a \"code\" of the\ngraph. The problems of determining such codes of minimum cardinality are all\nshown to be NP-hard. A typical line to attack such problems is, therefore, to\nprovide bounds on the cardinalities of the studied codes.\n  In this paper, we are interested in extremal graphs for lower bounds in terms\nof the order of the graph. For some codes, logarithmic lower bounds are known\nfrom the literature. We provide for eight different identification problems a\ngeneral construction of extremal graphs minimizing the cardinality of a minimum\ncode compared to the order of the graph.

Due to the\nrisk of overfitting when learning from a single class, anomaly synthesis\nstrategies are introduced to enhance detection capability by generating\nartificial anomalies. However, existing strategies heavily rely on anomalous\ntextures from auxiliary datasets. Moreover, their limitations in the coverage\nand directionality of anomaly synthesis may result in a failure to capture\nuseful information and lead to significant redundancy. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel Progressive Boundary-guided Anomaly Synthesis (PBAS)\nstrategy, which can directionally synthesize crucial feature-level anomalies\nwithout auxiliary textures. It consists of three core components: Approximate\nBoundary Learning (ABL), Anomaly Feature Synthesis (AFS), and Refined Boundary\nOptimization (RBO). To make the distribution of normal samples more compact,\nABL first learns an approximate decision boundary by center constraint, which\nimproves the center initialization through feature alignment. AFS then\ndirectionally synthesizes anomalies with more flexible scales guided by the\nhypersphere distribution of normal features. Since the boundary is so loose\nthat it may contain real anomalies, RBO refines the decision boundary through\nthe binary classification of artificial anomalies and normal features.\nExperimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance\nand the fastest detection speed on three widely used industrial datasets,\nincluding MVTec AD, VisA, and MPDD.

    "abstract": "This study explores the use of Large language models to analyze therapist\nremarks in a psychotherapeutic setting. The paper focuses on the application of\nBERTopic, a machine learning-based topic modeling tool, to the dialogue of two\ndifferent groups of therapists (classical and modern), which makes it possible\nto identify and describe a set of topics that consistently emerge across these\ngroups. The paper describes in detail the chosen algorithm for BERTopic, which\nincluded creating a vector space from a corpus of therapist remarks, reducing\nits dimensionality, clustering the space, and creating and optimizing topic\nrepresentation. Along with the automatic topical modeling by the BERTopic, the\nresearch involved an expert assessment of the findings and manual topic\nstructure optimization. The topic modeling results highlighted the most common\nand stable topics in therapists speech, offering insights into how language\npatterns in therapy develop and remain stable across different therapeutic\nstyles. This work contributes to the growing field of machine learning in\npsychotherapy by demonstrating the potential of automated methods to improve\nboth the practice and training of therapists. The study highlights the value of\ntopic modeling as a tool for gaining a deeper understanding of therapeutic\ndialogue and offers new opportunities for improving therapeutic effectiveness\nand clinical supervision.",

In this study, we selected $\\sim$ 12,000\nELM WDs or their candidates, and searched for ellipsoidal-like lightcurves with\norbital periods shorter than one day, by using the public data from Zwicky\nTransient Facility. Finally 23 such systems were found, with 17 being newly\ndiscovered. We selected nine high-priority targets likely to evolve from the\nRoche-lobe overflow channel and estimated their companion masses from the\nextracted ellipsoidal variation amplitude. Among them, the four targets have\ncompanion masses exceeding 1 $M_{\\odot}$. We performed a search for radio\npulsations from six of these targets by using Five-hundred-meter Aperture\nSpherical radio Telescope. However, no convincing radio pulsed signals were\nfound, resulting in upper limits for the radio flux at around 8 $\\mu$Jy. Given\nthe non-detection of radio pulsations from a total of 11 similar systems, the\nfraction of ellipsoidal ELM WDs around MSPs is estimated to be below\n15$^{+6}_{-3}$%.

    "abstract": "Modeling the propagation of cracks at the microscopic level is fundamental to\nunderstand the effect of the microstructure on the fracture process.\nNevertheless, microscopic propagation is often unstable and when using phase\nfield fracture poor convergence is found or, in the case of using staggered\nalgorithms, leads to the presence of jumps in the evolution of the cracks. In\nthis work, a novel method is proposed to perform micromechanical simulations\nwith phase field fracture imposing monotonic increases of crack length and\nallowing the use of monolithic implementations, being able to resolve all the\nsnap-backs during the unstable propagation phases. The method is derived for\nFFT based solvers in order to exploit its very high numerical performance n\nmicromechanical problems, but an equivalent method is also developed for Finite\nElements (FE) showing the equivalence of both implementations. It is shown that\nthe stress-strain curves and the crack paths obtained using the crack control\nmethod are superposed in stable propagation regimes to those obtained using\nstrain control with a staggered scheme. J-integral calculations confirm that\nduring the propagation process in the crack control method, the energy release\nrate remains constant and equal to an effective fracture energy that has been\ndetermined as function of the discretization for FFT simulations. Finally, to\nshow the potential of the method, the technique is applied to simulate crack\npropagation through the microstructure of composites and porous materials\nproviding an estimation of the effective fracture toughness.",

    "abstract": "The scale-invariant inverse energy cascade is a hallmark of 2D turbulence,\nwith its theoretical energy spectrum observed in both direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments. Under this scale-invariance\nassumption, the effective diffusivity of a 2D turbulent flow is dimensionally\ncontrolled by the energy flux and the friction coefficient only. Surprisingly,\nhowever, we show that such scaling predictions are invalidated by numerical\nsolutions of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation forced at intermediate wave number\nand damped by weak linear or quadratic drag. We derive alternate scaling-laws\nfor the effective diffusivity based on the emergence of intense, isolated\nvortices causing spatially inhomogeneous frictional dissipation localized\nwithin the small vortex cores. The predictions quantitatively match DNS data.\nThis study points to a universal large-scale organization of 2D turbulent flows\nin physical space, bridging standard 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence with\nlarge-scale geophysical turbulence.",

    "abstract": "LLMs demonstrate significant potential across various software engineering\ntasks. However, they still face challenges in generating correct code on the\nfirst attempt when addressing complex requirements. Introducing a discriminator\nto select reliable outputs from multiple generated results is an effective way\nto enhance their reliability and stability. Currently, these discriminators\nfall into two categories: execution-based discriminators and\nnon-execution-based discriminators. Execution-based discriminators face\nflexibility challenges due to difficulties in obtaining test cases and security\nconcerns, while non-execution-based discriminators, although more flexible,\nstruggle to capture subtle differences in code details. To maintain flexibility\nwhile improving the model's ability to capture fine-grained code details, this\npaper proposes Condor. We first design contrastive learning to optimize the\ncode representations of the base model, enabling it to reflect differences in\ncode details. Then, we leverage intermediate data from the code modification\nprocess to further enrich the discriminator's training data, enhancing its\nability to discern code details. Experimental results indicate that on the\nsubtle code difference dataset (i.e., CodeNanoFix), Condor significantly\noutperforms other discriminators in discriminative performance: Condor (1.3B)\nimproves the discriminative F1 score of DeepSeek-Coder (1.3B) from 67% to 73%.\nIn discriminating LLM-generated outputs, Condor (1.3B) and Condor (110M) raise\nthe Pass@1 score of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the CodeNanoFix dataset\nfrom 52.64% to 62.63% and 59.64%, respectively. Moreover, Condor demonstrates\nstrong generalization capabilities on the MBPP and APPS datasets. For example,\nCondor (1.3B) improves the Pass@1 of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the APPS\ndataset by 147.05%.",

The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are\ndesigned to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We\nobtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are\npredicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as\nthe prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we\npropose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the\nmixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of\nthe sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected\nparameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem\ninto a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight\noptimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed STEM-KL and\nGEM-KL schemes can achieve more accurate channel prediction. This indicates\nthat EIT can improve the performance of wireless system efficiently.",

The need for interdisciplinary studies is stressed\nthat helps to understand the physical mechanisms of coupling the electrical,\nmechanical, and thermal effects in nerves. Based on the analysis of structural\nproperties of axons and possible mechanisms of interaction between different\nphysical phenomena, a set of assumptions and hypotheses is formulated. As a\nproof of concept, a rather general mathematical model is presented for\ndescribing a wave ensemble in unmyelinated axons. This model is composed of\nseveral governing equations (\"building blocks\") which are coupled by forces\ndescribing the interaction between the effects. The numerical simulation using\nthe dimensionless variables demonstrated a rather good qualitative match with\nexperiments. The further generalisation of this model in physical units for the\nprocesses in myelinated axons permits a closer match to measurements.

Thus, we design an flexible framework to silence the\ncontribution of noisy pixels to loss function, called Silencer. We take the\nnonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and deep NMF methods as examples since\nthey are the prime models for community detection. We first prove the\nconvergence of Silencer in NMF.

A large-scale dynamo is driven by an $\\alpha$ effect of\nopposite signs in the two hemispheres. In the presence of shear, the\nhemispheric magnetic helicity flux from small-scale fields becomes important\nand can even overcompensate for the magnetic helicity transferred by the\n$\\alpha$ effect between large and small scales. This effect has not previously\nbeen observed in nonshearing simulations. Our numerical simulations show that\nthe hemispheric magnetic helicity fluxes are nearly independent of the magnetic\nReynolds number, but those between large and small scales, and the consequent\ndynamo effect, are still found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number --\njust like in nonshearing dynamos. However, in contrast to nonshearing dynamos,\nwhere the generated mean magnetic field declines with increasing magnetic\nReynolds number, it is now found to remain independent of it.

However, the number\nof identified RSGs within the Milky Way is still limited mainly due to the\ndifficulty of measuring stellar extinction and distance. The release of\napproximately one million RVS spectra in Gaia DR3 presents new opportunity for\nidentifying Galactic RSGs, because the equivalent width of the calcium triplet\nlines (EW(CaT)) in the spectra is an excellent indicator of stellar surface\ngravity. This work uses the RVS spectra with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\ngreater than 100 to search for the Galactic RSGs. The dwarf stars and red\ngiants are removed and the RSG candidates are selected by the location in the\nEW(CaT) vs. BP-RP diagram. The early-type RSG candidates (K0-M2) are then\nidentified by BP-RP > 1.584 and EW(CaT) > 1.1 nm. To identify late-type RSG\ncandidates (after M2), the criteria of the average equivalent widths of TiO in\nthe XP spectra (EW(TiO)) > 10 nm, the color index K-W3 < 0.5 and the\nperiod-amplitude sequence from Gaia DR3 LPV catalog are further applied to\nreduce the contamination of late-type red giants and asymptotic giant branch\nstars. This method yields 30 early-type (K0-M2) and 6196 late-type (after M2)\nRSG candidates, which is a significant increase to the present Galactic RSG\nsample. The application of this approach to the spectra with SNR > 50 results\nin 48 early-type and 11,491 late-type RSG candidates.

First, they do not occupy resources for empty spaces and therefore can\navoid trade-offs between resolution and field-of-view for voxel-based 3D\nconvolutional networks (CNNs) - leading to smaller and robust models. Second,\nthey provide a modality agnostic representation of anatomical surfaces and\nshapes to avoid domain gaps for generic geometric models. Third, they remove\nidentifiable patient-specific information and may increase privacy preservation\nwhen publicly sharing data. Despite their benefits, point clouds are still\nunderexplored in medical imaging compared to volumetric 3D CNNs and vision\ntransformers. To date both datasets and stringent studies on comparative\nstrengths and weaknesses of methodological choices are missing. Interactions\nand information exchange of spatially close points - e.g. through k-nearest\nneighbour graphs in edge convolutions or point transformations - within points\nclouds are crucial for learning geometrically meaningful features but may incur\ncomputational bottlenecks. This work presents a hybrid approach that combines\npoint-wise operations with intermediate differentiable rasterisation and dense\nlocalised CNNs. For deformable point cloud registration, we devise an early\nfusion scheme for coordinate features that joins both clouds within a common\nreference frame and is coupled with an inverse consistent, two-step alignment\narchitecture. Our extensive experiments on three different datasets for\nsegmentation and registration demonstrate that our method, PointVoxelFormer,\nenables very compact models that excel with threefold speed-ups, fivefold\nmemory reduction and over 30% registration error reduction against edge\nconvolutions and other state-of-the-art models in geometric deep learning.",

    "abstract": "The burgeoning field of foundation models necessitates advanced data\nprocessing mechanisms capable of harnessing vast and valuable data with various\ntypes used by these models. Nevertheless, the current landscape presents unique\nchallenges that traditional data processing frameworks struggle to handle\neffectively, particularly in handling the complexity of multimodal data. In\nresponse, we present Data-Juicer 2.0, a data processing system backed by 100+\ndata processing operators spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities,\nsupporting more critical tasks including data analysis, synthesis, annotation,\nand foundation model post-training. With seamless compatibility and dedicated\noptimization for popular dataset hubs like Hugging Face and computing engines\nlike Ray, it improves upon its predecessor in terms of usability, efficiency,\nand programmability. It features an easily accessible user interface layer that\nsupports decoupled Python interactions, RESTful APIs, and conversational\ncommands. It contains a new runtime layer optimized for adaptive execution and\nmanagement across varying dataset scales, processing demands, and computational\nenvironments, while hiding unnecessary system details. Extensive empirical\nevaluations demonstrate Data-Juicer 2.0's remarkable performance and\nscalability, highlighting its capability to efficiently process TB-level data\nwith 10k+ CPU cores. The system is publicly available and has been widely\nadopted in diverse research fields and real-world products such as Alibaba\nCloud PAI. We actively maintain it and share insights from practical feedback,\nwith the goal of facilitating research and application of next-generation\nfoundation models.",

    "abstract": "Global warming is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases,\nparticularly carbon dioxide (CO2). A metric used to quantify the change in CO2\nemissions is the marginal emission factor, defined as the marginal change in\nCO2 emissions resulting from a marginal change in electricity demand over a\nspecified period. This paper aims to present two methodologies to estimate the\nmarginal emission factor in a decarbonized electricity system with high\ntemporal resolution. First, we present an energy systems model that\nincrementally calculates the marginal emission factors. Second, we examine a\nMarkov Switching Dynamic Regression model, a statistical model designed to\nestimate marginal emission factors faster and use an incremental marginal\nemission factor as a benchmark to assess its precision. For the German\nelectricity market, we estimate the marginal emissions factor time series\nhistorically (2019, 2020) using Agora Energiewende and for the future (2025,\n2030, and 2040) using estimated energy system data. The results indicate that\nthe Markov Switching Dynamic Regression model is more accurate in estimating\nmarginal emission factors than the Dynamic Linear Regression models, which are\nfrequently used in the literature. Hence, the Markov Switching Dynamic\nRegression model is a simpler alternative to the computationally intensive\nincremental marginal emissions factor, especially when short-term marginal\nemissions factor estimation is needed. The results of the marginal emission\nfactor estimation are applied to an exemplary low-emission vehicle charging\nscenario to estimate CO2 savings by shifting the charge hours to those\ncorresponding to the lower marginal emissions factor. By implementing this\nemission-minimized charging approach, an average reduction of 31% in the\nmarginal emission factor was achieved over the 5 years.",

Although existing simulation-based motion imitation methods can enhance\nthe physical quality of daily motions estimated from monocular video capture,\nextending this capability to high-difficulty motions remains an open challenge.\nThis can be attributed to some flawed motion clips in video-based motion\ncapture results and the inherent complexity in modeling high-difficulty\nmotions.

The number of resets depends on the configuration of the physical\nenvironment; thus, inappropriate object placement can lead to frequent resets,\ncausing motion sickness and degrading presence. However, estimating the number\nof resets based on the physical layout is challenging. It is difficult to\nmeasure reset frequency with real users repeatedly testing different layouts,\nand virtual simulations offer limited real-time verification. As a result,\nwhile rearranging objects can reduce resets, users have not been able to fully\ntake advantage of this opportunity, highlighting the need for rapid assessment\nof object placement. To address this, in Study 1, we collected simulation data\nand analyzed the average number of resets for various object placements.

To minimize fuel consumption while ensuring the safety of\nsatellites, enforcing a chance constraint, which poses an upper bound in\ncollision probability with debris, can serve as an intuitive safety measure.\nHowever, accurately evaluating collision probability, which is critical for the\neffective implementation of chance constraints, remains a non-trivial task.\nThis difficulty arises because uncertainty propagation in nonlinear orbit\ndynamics typically provides only limited information, such as finite samples or\nmoment estimates about the underlying arbitrary non-Gaussian distributions.\nFurthermore, even if the full distribution were known, it remains unclear how\nto effectively compute chance constraints with such non-Gaussian distributions.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a distributionally robust\nchance-constrained collision avoidance algorithm that provides a sufficient\ncondition for collision probabilities under limited information about the\nunderlying non-Gaussian distribution. Our distributionally robust approach\nsatisfies the chance constraint for all debris position distributions sharing a\ngiven mean and covariance, thereby enabling the enforcement of chance\nconstraints with limited distributional information. To achieve computational\ntractability, the chance constraint is approximated using a Conditional\nValue-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint, which gives a conservative and tractable\napproximation of the distributionally robust chance constraint.

Thus, condensing multiple scale graphs\nsimultaneously is the core of achieving efficient training in different\non-device scenarios. Existing efficient works for multi-scale graph dataset\ncondensation mainly perform efficient approximate computation in scale order\n(large-to-small or small-to-large scales). However, for non-Euclidean\nstructures of sparse graph data, these two commonly used paradigms for\nmulti-scale graph dataset condensation have serious scaling down degradation\nand scaling up collapse problems of a graph. The main bottleneck of the above\nparadigms is whether the effective information of the original graph is fully\npreserved when consenting to the primary sub-scale (the first of multiple\nscales), which determines the condensation effect and consistency of all\nscales. In this paper, we proposed a novel GNN-centric Bi-directional\nMulti-Scale Graph Dataset Condensation (BiMSGC) framework, to explore unifying\nparadigms by operating on both large-to-small and small-to-large for\nmulti-scale graph condensation.

To achieve the first objective, we propose a\npenalized approach that regularizes the Lagrange multipliers, significantly\nreducing the dimensionality of the problem while accommodating a comprehensive\nset of model conditions. For the second objective, our study designs and\nthoroughly investigates two popular sampling schemes within the BPEL context.\nWe demonstrate that the BPEL framework is highly flexible and efficient,\nenhancing the adaptability and practicality of EL methods. Our study highlights\nthe practical advantages of using sampling techniques over traditional\noptimization methods for EL problems, showing rapid convergence to the global\noptima of posterior distributions and ensuring the effective resolution of\ncomplex statistical inference challenges.",

In addition, society imposes varying degrees\nof punishment for behaviors that harm the interests of groups with different\nreputations. However, conventional pairwise interaction rules and the\npunishment mechanism overlook this aspect. Building on this observation, this\npaper enhances a spatial public goods game in two key ways: 1) We set a\nreputation threshold and use punishment to regulate the defection behavior of\nplayers in low-reputation groups while allowing defection behavior in\nhigh-reputation game groups. 2) Differently from pairwise interaction rules, we\ncombine reputation and payoff as the fitness of individuals to ensure that\nplayers with both high payoff and reputation have a higher chance of being\nimitated. Through simulations, we find that a higher reputation threshold,\ncombined with a stringent punishment environment, can substantially enhance the\nlevel of cooperation within the population.

    "abstract": "Data mining and knowledge discovery are essential aspects of extracting\nvaluable insights from vast datasets. Neural topic models (NTMs) have emerged\nas a valuable unsupervised tool in this field. However, the predominant\nobjective in NTMs, which aims to discover topics maximizing data likelihood,\noften lacks alignment with the central goals of data mining and knowledge\ndiscovery which is to reveal interpretable insights from large data\nrepositories. Overemphasizing likelihood maximization without incorporating\ntopic regularization can lead to an overly expansive latent space for topic\nmodeling. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to NTMs that\naddresses this misalignment by introducing contrastive learning measures to\nassess topic interpretability. We propose a novel NTM framework, named\nContraTopic, that integrates a differentiable regularizer capable of evaluating\nmultiple facets of topic interpretability throughout the training process. Our\nregularizer adopts a unique topic-wise contrastive methodology, fostering both\ninternal coherence within topics and clear external distinctions among them.\nComprehensive experiments conducted on three diverse datasets demonstrate that\nour approach consistently produces topics with superior interpretability\ncompared to state-of-the-art NTMs.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs), which store an extensive number of relational facts,\nserve various applications. Recently, personalized knowledge graphs (PKGs) have\nemerged as a solution to optimize storage costs by customizing their content to\nalign with users' specific interests within particular domains. In the real\nworld, on one hand, user queries and their underlying interests are inherently\nevolving, requiring PKGs to adapt continuously; on the other hand, the\nsummarization is constantly expected to be as small as possible in terms of\nstorage cost. However, the existing PKG summarization methods implicitly assume\nthat the user's interests are constant and do not shift. Furthermore, when the\nsize constraint of PKG is extremely small, the existing methods cannot\ndistinguish which facts are more of immediate interest and guarantee the\nutility of the summarized PKG. To address these limitations, we propose\nAPEX$^2$, a highly scalable PKG summarization framework designed with robust\ntheoretical guarantees to excel in adaptive summarization tasks with extremely\nsmall size constraints. To be specific, after constructing an initial PKG,\nAPEX$^2$ continuously tracks the interest shift and adjusts the previous\nsummary. We evaluate APEX$^2$ under an evolving query setting on benchmark KGs\ncontaining up to 12 million triples, summarizing with compression ratios $\\leq\n0.1\\%$.

    "abstract": "In social science research, understanding latent structures in populations\nthrough survey data with categorical responses is a common and important task.\nTraditional methods like Factor Analysis and Latent Class Analysis have\nlimitations, particularly in handling categorical data and accommodating mixed\nmemberships in latent structures, respectively. Moreover, choosing the number\nof factors or latent classes is often subjective and can be challenging in the\npresence of missing values. This study introduces a Hierarchical Dirichlet\nProcess Mixture of Products of Multinomial Distributions (HDPMPM) model, which\nleverages the flexibility of nonparametric Bayesian methods to address these\nlimitations. The HDPMPM model allows for multiple latent classes within\nindividuals and avoids fixing the number of mixture components at an arbitrary\nnumber. Additionally, it incorporates missing data imputation directly into the\nmodel's Gibbs sampling process. By applying a truncated stick-breaking\nrepresentation of the Dirichlet process, we can derive a Gibbs sampling scheme\nfor posterior inference. An application of the HDPMPM model to the 2016\nAmerican National Election Study (ANES) data demonstrates its effectiveness in\nidentifying political profiles and handling missing data scenarios, including\nthose that are missing at random (MAR) and missing completely at random (MCAR).\nThe results show that the HDPMPM model successfully recovers dominant profiles\nand manages complex latent structures in survey data, providing an alternative\ntool for social science researchers in dealing with categorical data with\nmissing values.",

Instead of starting each\nnew evaluation from scratch, we propose a computationally efficient method that\nupdates the outcomes of previous evaluations using the Woodbury matrix\nidentity. To enable this method, we begin by identifying a closed-form approach\ncapable of evaluating arbitrarily complex connection schemes of multi-port\nnetworks. We pedagogically present unified equivalence principles for\ninterpretations of system connections, as well as techniques to reduce the\ncomputational burden of the closed-form approach using these equivalence\nprinciples. Along the way, we also achieve the closed-form retrieval of the\npower waves traveling through connected ports. We illustrate our techniques\nconsidering a complex meta-network involving serial, parallel and cyclic\nconnections between multi-port subsystems. We further validate all results with\nphysics-compliant calculations considering graph-based subsystems, and we\nconduct exhaustive statistical analyses of computational benefits originating\nfrom the reducibility and updatability enabled by our approach. Finally, we\nfind that working with scattering parameters (as opposed to impedance or\nadmittance parameters) presents a fundamental advantage regarding an important\nclass of connection schemes whose closed-form analysis requires the treatment\nof some connections as delayless, lossless, reflectionless and reciprocal\ntwo-port scattering systems.

This review delves into advanced methodologies for\ndomain adaptation, including adversarial learning, discrepancy-based,\nmulti-domain, teacher-student, ensemble, and Vision Language Models techniques,\nemphasizing their efficacy in reducing domain gaps and enhancing model\nrobustness. Feature-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for addressing\nthese challenges by harmonizing feature representations across domains. These\ntechniques, such as Feature Alignment, Feature Augmentation/Reconstruction, and\nFeature Transformation, are employed alongside or as integral parts of other\ndomain adaptation strategies to minimize domain gaps and improve model\nperformance. Special attention is given to strategies that minimize the\nreliance on extensive labeled data and using unlabeled data, particularly in\nscenarios involving synthetic-to-real domain shifts. Applications in fields\nsuch as autonomous driving and medical imaging are explored, showcasing the\npotential of these methods to ensure reliable object detection in diverse and\ncomplex settings. By providing a thorough analysis of state-of-the-art\ntechniques, challenges, and future directions, this work offers a valuable\nreference for researchers striving to develop resilient and adaptable object\ndetection frameworks, advancing the seamless deployment of artificial\nintelligence in dynamic environments.",

Existing edit\ndistance metrics, such as Levenshtein, BLEU, ROUGE, and TER, often fail to\naccurately measure the effort required for post-editing, especially when edits\ninvolve substantial modifications, such as block operations. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel compression-based edit distance metric grounded in the\nLempel-Ziv-77 algorithm, designed to quantify the amount of post-editing\napplied to LLM-generated texts. Our method leverages the properties of text\ncompression to measure the informational difference between the original and\nedited texts.

We also show that LLMs exhibit an implicit understanding of editing\nspeed, that aligns well with our metric. Furthermore, we compare our metric\nwith existing ones, highlighting its advantages in capturing complex edits with\nlinear computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Ecologists have long argued about the strength of density dependence and\npopulation regulation, respectively defined as the short-term and long-term\nrates of return to equilibrium. Here, I give three arguments for the\nintractability of population regulation. First, the ecological literature\nflip-flops on the strength of evidence for population regulation; by simple\ninduction, population regulation should remain uncertain. Second, there is an\nanalogous debate in economics about whether shocks to Gross Domestic Product\nhave transient or permanent effects. This literature is extensive and\nsophisticated, yet there is no consensus, implying that more research will not\nresolve the issue in ecology. Third, using a variety of time series models and\nthe Global Population Dynamics Database, I show that one's conclusions about\npopulation regulation are almost entirely dependent on model structure. This\ninsurmountable model uncertainty explains why the strength of regulation is\nunresolved despite decades of research. However, it is possible to achieve the\nmore modest goal of estimating density dependence. I introduce a novel measure\nof density dependence -- the effective autoregressive parameter -- which is\nconceptually intuitive and easy to calculate with simulations. The strength of\ndensity dependence varies significantly across populations, with an average\nthat can be characterized as moderate: perturbations have an average half-life\nof 3 years. Rather than a universal balance of nature, stability varies widely\nacross populations in ways that correlate with life history and taxonomy.",

Current Pareto set\nlearning methods for such problems often rely on surrogate models like Gaussian\nprocesses to approximate the objective functions. These surrogate models can\nbecome fragmented, resulting in numerous small uncertain regions between\nexplored solutions. When using acquisition functions such as the Lower\nConfidence Bound (LCB), these uncertain regions can turn into pseudo-local\noptima, complicating the search for globally optimal solutions. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel approach called SVH-PSL, which integrates\nStein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) with Hypernetworks for efficient\nPareto set learning. Our method addresses the issues of fragmented surrogate\nmodels and pseudo-local optima by collectively moving particles in a manner\nthat smooths out the solution space. The particles interact with each other\nthrough a kernel function, which helps maintain diversity and encourages the\nexploration of underexplored regions. This kernel-based interaction prevents\nparticles from clustering around pseudo-local optima and promotes convergence\ntowards globally optimal solutions. Our approach aims to establish robust\nrelationships between trade-off reference vectors and their corresponding true\nPareto solutions, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. Through\nextensive experiments across both synthetic and real-world MOO benchmarks, we\ndemonstrate that SVH-PSL significantly improves the quality of the learned\nPareto set, offering a promising solution for expensive multi-objective\noptimization problems.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems create enormous value for businesses and their consumers.\nThey increase revenue for businesses while improving the consumer experience by\nrecommending relevant products amidst huge product base. Product bundling is an\nexciting development in the field of product recommendations. It aims at\ngenerating new bundles and recommending exciting and relevant bundles to their\nconsumers. Unlike traditional recommender systems that recommend single items\nto consumers, product bundling aims at targeting a bundle, or a set of items,\nto the consumers. While bundle recommendation has attracted significant\nresearch interest recently, extant literature on bundle generation is scarce.\nMoreover, metrics to identify if a bundle is popular or not is not well\nstudied. In this work, we aim to fulfill this gap by introducing new bundle\npopularity metrics based on sales, consumer experience and item diversity in a\nbundle. We use these metrics in the methodology proposed in this paper to\ngenerate new bundles for mobile games using content aware and context aware\nembeddings. We use opensource Steam Games dataset for our analysis. Our\nexperiments indicate that we can generate new bundles that can outperform the\nexisting bundles on the popularity metrics by 32% - 44%.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises solutions to classically difficult and new-found\nproblems through controlling the subtleties of quantum computing. The Quantum\nApproximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a recently proposed quantum\nalgorithm designed to tackle difficult combinatorial optimisation problems\nutilising both quantum and classical computation. The hybrid nature, generality\nand typically low gate-depth make it a strong candidate for near-term\nimplementation in quantum computing. Finding the practical limits of the\nalgorithm is currently an open problem. Until now, no tools to facilitate the\ndesign and validation of probabilistic quantum optimisation algorithms such as\nthe QAOA on a non-trivial scale exist. Graph similarity is a long standing\nclassically difficult problem withstanding decades of research from academia\nand industry. Determining the maximal edge overlap between all possible node\nlabel permutations is an NP-Complete task and provides an apt measure of graph\nsimilarity. We introduce a novel quantum optimisation simulation package\nfacilitating investigation of all constituent components of the QAOA from\ndesktop to cluster scale using graph similarity as an example. Our simulation\nprovides flexibility and performance. We investigate eight classical\noptimisation methods each at six levels of decomposition. Moreover an encoding\nfor permutation based problems such as graph similarity through edge overlap to\nthe QAOA allows for significant quantum memory savings at the cost of\nadditional operations. This compromise extends into the classical portion of\nthe algorithm as the inclusion of infeasible solutions creates a challenging\ncost-function landscape. We present performance analysis of our simulation and\nof the QAOA setting a precedent for investigating and validating numerous other\ndifficult problems to the QAOA as we move towards realising practical quantum\ncomputation.",

We identified key challenges in prompt engineering: only 21.9% of\nprompt changes are documented in commit messages, changes can introduce logical\ninconsistencies, and misalignment often occurs between prompt changes and LLM\nresponses. These insights emphasize the need for specialized testing\nframeworks, automated validation tools, and improved documentation practices to\nenhance the reliability of LLM-integrated applications.",

    "abstract": "Existing efforts to boost multimodal fusion of 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD)\nprimarily concentrate on devising more effective multimodal fusion strategies.\nHowever, little attention was devoted to analyzing the role of multimodal\nfusion architecture (topology) design in contributing to 3D-AD. In this paper,\nwe aim to bridge this gap and present a systematic study on the impact of\nmultimodal fusion architecture design on 3D-AD. This work considers the\nmultimodal fusion architecture design at the intra-module fusion level, i.e.,\nindependent modality-specific modules, involving early, middle or late\nmultimodal features with specific fusion operations, and also at the\ninter-module fusion level, i.e., the strategies to fuse those modules. In both\ncases, we first derive insights through theoretically and experimentally\nexploring how architectural designs influence 3D-AD. Then, we extend SOTA\nneural architecture search (NAS) paradigm and propose 3D-ADNAS to\nsimultaneously search across multimodal fusion strategies and modality-specific\nmodules for the first time.Extensive experiments show that 3D-ADNAS obtains\nconsistent improvements in 3D-AD across various model capacities in terms of\naccuracy, frame rate, and memory usage, and it exhibits great potential in\ndealing with few-shot 3D-AD tasks.",

This study examined the effects of gaze and\nannotation guidance on the spatiotemporal characteristics of eye movements and\nthe skill transfer of expert evaluation techniques in karate kata performances.\n28 non-expert participants were assigned to three groups: a gaze guidance\ngroup, an annotation guidance group, and a control group.

Before and after instruction, participants were asked to evaluate\nkarate kata performance videos performed by practitioners with different skill\nlevels. The results showed that the annotation guidance group exhibited an\neffect of directing gaze toward the presented areas of focus, with a trend of\nincreased total number of fixation areas. On the other hand, while the gaze\nguidance group was not encouraged to make fixations on multiple areas, the\npossibility of promoting peripheral vision was inferred based on measurements\nfrom the eye-tracking system.

Compared with the traditional\nmulti-modal conversations, MMC requires stronger character-centered\nunderstanding abilities as there are many interlocutors appearing in both the\nvisual and textual context. To facilitate the study of this problem, we present\nFriends-MMC in this paper, an MMC dataset that contains 24,000+ unique\nutterances paired with video context. To explore the character-centered\nunderstanding of the dialogue, we also annotate the speaker of each utterance,\nthe names and bounding bboxes of faces that appear in the video. Based on this\nFriends-MMC dataset, we further study two fundamental MMC tasks: conversation\nspeaker identification and conversation response prediction, both of which have\nthe multi-party nature with the video or image as visual context. For\nconversation speaker identification, we demonstrate the inefficiencies of\nexisting methods such as pre-trained models, and propose a simple yet effective\nbaseline method that leverages an optimization solver to utilize the context of\ntwo modalities to achieve better performance. For conversation response\nprediction, we fine-tune generative dialogue models on Friend-MMC, and analyze\nthe benefits of speaker information. The code and dataset is publicly available\nat https://github.com/yellow-binary-tree/Friends-MMC and thus we call for more\nattention on modeling speaker information when understanding conversations.",

The\neffect, referred to as the acoustic spin Hall effect, was understood by\nassuming a SAW-induced ac spin current rectified by the oscillation of the FM\nlayer magnetization and the inverse spin Hall effect.

Here we measure the acoustic\nvoltage as a function of the SAW propagation direction relative to the\ncrystalline orientation of a LiNbO$_3$ substrate. We find that the magnetic\nfield angle dependence of the acoustic voltage exhibits a phase shift depending\non the SAW propagation direction.

The companion star is 2.65$\\pm$0.35 R$_{\\odot}$ in\nradius as an evolved giant star stripped of its outer hydrogen envelope. The\norbital period immediately before the 2000 eruption was $P_{\\rm\npre}$=1.871843$\\pm$0.000014 days, with a steady period change of\n(-0.17$\\pm$0.06)$\\times$10$^{-8}$ from 1896--1995.

Further, for\nV445 Pup and helium novae in general, I collect observations from 136 normal\nSNIa, for which any giant or sub-giant companion star would have been detected,\nyet zero companions are found.

Our approach is based on the\nflat minima principle, i,e., models located in the flat minima region in the\nparameter space usually exhibit excellent generalization ability. However,\ntraditional methods require labeled data to evaluate how well a model is\nlocated in the flat minima region, which is unrealistic for the DAOD task.\nTherefore, we design a Detection Adaptation Score (DAS) approach to\napproximately measure the flat minima without using target labels. We show via\na generalization bound that the flatness can be deemed as model variance, while\nthe minima depend on the domain distribution distance for the DAOD task.\nAccordingly, we propose a Flatness Index Score (FIS) to assess the flatness by\nmeasuring the classification and localization fluctuation before and after\nperturbations of model parameters and a Prototypical Distance Ratio (PDR) score\nto seek the minima by measuring the transferability and discriminability of the\nmodels. In this way, the proposed DAS approach can effectively evaluate the\nmodel generalization ability on the target domain. We have conducted extensive\nexperiments on various DAOD benchmarks and approaches, and the experimental\nresults show that the proposed DAS correlates well with the performance of DAOD\nmodels and can be used as an effective tool for model selection after training.",

The framework employs wind axes for linear-momentum equations and body\naxes for angular-momentum equations, incorporates two flight path angles, and\nprovides formulas for aerodynamic force and moment coefficients. Key advantages\ninclude improved computational efficiency, elimination of Euler angle\nsingularities, and independence from symmetry assumptions with regard to the\naircraft's moments of inertia.

Existing methods\ntypically rely on fine-tuning or adversarial training to correct errors, which\nhave achieved significant success. However, these methods exhibit poor\ngeneralization performance due to the difference in data distribution between\ntraining data and real-world scenarios, known as the exposure bias problem. In\nthis paper, we propose a self-correct adversarial training framework for\n\\textbf{L}earn\\textbf{I}ng from \\textbf{MI}s\\textbf{T}akes (\\textbf{LIMIT}),\nwhich is a task- and model-independent framework to correct unnatural errors or\nmistakes.

This training method not only simulates potential\nerrors in real application scenarios, but also mitigates the exposure bias of\nthe traditional training process. Meanwhile, we design a novel decoding\nintervention strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Extensive experimental\nresults on Chinese unnatural text error correction datasets show that our\nproposed method can correct multiple forms of errors and outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art text correction methods.

We propose an analytic strategy to correct biases\narising from violation of two model assumptions, namely, population homogeneity\nand event-independent treatment. Study Design and Setting: We reformulate PERR\nestimation by embedding a treatment-by-period interaction term in an analytic\nmodel for recurrent event data, which is robust to bias arising from unobserved\nheterogeneity. Based on this model, we propose a set of methods to examine the\npresence of event-dependent treatment and to correct the resultant bias. We\nevaluate the proposed methods by simulation and apply it to a de-identified\ndataset on palliative care and emergency department visits in patients with\nadvanced cancer. Results: Simulation results showed that the proposed method\ncould mitigate the two sources of bias in PERR. In the palliative care study,\nanalysis by the Cox model showed that patients who had started receiving\npalliative care had higher incidence of emergency department visits than their\nmatch controls (hazard ratio 3.31; 95% confidence interval 2.78 to 3.94). Using\nPERR without the proposed bias control strategy indicated a 19% reduction of\nthe incidence (0.81; 0.64 to 1.02). However, there was evidence of\nevent-dependent treatment. The proposed correction method showed no effect of\npalliative care on ED visits (1.00; 0.79 to 1.26). Conclusions: The proposed\nanalytic strategy can control two sources of biases in the PERR approach. It\nenriches the armamentarium for real-world evidence research.",

In this paper, we\npropose an asymmetric lightweight learned image compression (AsymLLIC)\narchitecture with a novel training scheme, enabling the gradual substitution of\ncomplex decoding modules with simpler ones. Building upon this approach, we\nconduct a comprehensive comparison of different decoder network structures to\nstrike a better trade-off between complexity and compression performance.\nExperiment results validate the efficiency of our proposed method, which not\nonly achieves comparable performance to VVC but also offers a lightweight\ndecoder with only 51.47 GMACs computation and 19.65M parameters. Furthermore,\nthis design methodology can be easily applied to any LIC models, enabling the\npractical deployment of LIC techniques.",

Both active and passive STAR-RISs are\nconsidered. Passive STAR-RISs can be cost-efficiently fabricated to large\naperture sizes with significant near-field regions, but the design flexibility\nis limited by the coupled phase-shifts. Active STAR-RISs can further amplify\nsignals and have independent phase-shifts, but their aperture sizes are\nrelatively small due to the high cost. To characterize and compare their\nperformance, a power consumption minimization problem is formulated by jointly\ndesigning the beamforming at the access point (AP) and the STAR-RIS, subject to\nboth the power and information quality-of-service requirements. To solve the\nresulting highly-coupled non-convex problem, the original problem is first\ndecomposed into simpler subproblems and then an alternating optimization\nframework is proposed. For the passive STAR-RIS, the coupled phase-shift\nconstraint is tackled by employing a vector-driven weight penalty method. While\nfor the active STAR-RIS, the independent phase-shift is optimized with AP\nbeamforming via matrix-driven semidefinite programming, and the amplitude\nmatrix is updated using convex optimization techniques in each iteration.\nNumerical results show that: 1) given the same aperture sizes, the active\nSTAR-RIS exhibits superior performance over the passive one when the aperture\nsize is small, but the performance gap decreases with the increase in aperture\nsize; and 2) given identical power budgets, the passive STAR-RIS is generally\npreferred, whereas the active STAR-RIS typically suffers performance loss for\nbalancing between the hardware power and the amplification power.",

Chiral BICs are photonic resonances with a high degree of circular\npolarisation, which hold great promise for spin-selective applications in\nquantum optics and nanophotonics. Here, we demonstrate a novel application of a\nchiral BIC for inducing strong coupling between the circularly polarised\nphotons and spin-polarised (valley) excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) in\natomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs). By placing\nmonolayer WS$_2$ onto the BIC-hosting metasurface, we observe the formation of\nintrinsically chiral, valley-selective exciton polaritons, evidenced by\ncircularly polarised photoluminescence (PL) at two distinct energy levels. The\nPL intensity and degree of circular polarisation of polaritons exceed those of\nuncoupled excitons in our structure by an order of magnitude. Our microscopic\nmodel shows that this enhancement is due to folding of the Brillouin zone\ncreating a direct emission path for high-momenta polaritonic states far outside\nthe light cone, thereby providing a shortcut to thermalisation (energy\nrelaxation) and suppressing depolarisation. Moreover, while the polarisation of\nthe upper polariton is determined by the valley excitons, the lower polariton\nbehaves like an intrinsic chiral emitter with its polarisation fixed by the\nBIC. Therefore, the spin alignment of the upper and lower polaritons\n($\\uparrow\\downarrow$ and $\\uparrow \\uparrow$) can be controlled by $\\sigma^+$\nand $\\sigma^-$ polarised optical excitation, respectively.

However, while these models can generate functionally correct code, they\noften produce code that is inefficient in terms of runtime. This inefficiency\nis particularly problematic in resource-constrained environments, impacting\nsoftware performance and sustainability.\n  Existing approaches for optimizing code efficiency for CodeLLMs like SOAP and\nPIE exhibit certain limitations. SOAP requires a compatible execution\nenvironment and predefined test cases for iterative code modification, while\nPIE focuses on instruction tuning, improving efficiency but compromising\ncorrectness. These shortcomings highlight the need for a fine-tuning framework\nthat optimizes both efficiency and correctness without relying on predefined\ntest cases or specific execution environments.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce ACECode, a reinforcement learning-based\nfine-tuning framework that aligns CodeLLMs with dual objectives of efficiency\nand correctness. ACECode combines three key steps: (1) generating code with an\nactor CodeLLM, (2) calculating a training-free reward signal derived from code\nexecution feedback for each generated code, and (3) optimizing the CodeLLM via\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. This reward signal enables joint\nassessment of efficiency and correctness without manual labeling.\n  We evaluate ACECode by fine-tuning four SOTA (state-of-the-art) CodeLLMs and\ncomparing their code with three baselines: original, instruction-tuned, and\nPIE-tuned CodeLLMs. Extensive experiment results suggest that \\tool{}\nsignificantly improves the efficiency and correctness of generated code against\nall baselines for all CodeLLMs. Specifically, CodeLLMs fine-tuned with ACECode\nimprove pass@1 by 1.84% to 14.51% and reduce runtime in 65% to 72% of cases\ncompared to original CodeLLMs.",

Finally, the discrepancies between predicted tokens and original\ntokens are utilized to score anomalies.

In high-stakes scenarios like opportunistic medical\ndiagnosis, model interpretability is a key factor for the adoption of AI\nrecommendations. Rule-based methods are inherently explainable and closely\nalign with clinical guidelines, but they are not immediately applicable to\nhigh-dimensional data such as CT scans. To address this gap, we introduce a\nneurosymbolic approach for VCF detection in CT volumes. The proposed model\ncombines deep learning (DL) for vertebral segmentation with a shape-based\nalgorithm (SBA) that analyzes vertebral height distributions in salient\nanatomical regions. This allows for the definition of a rule set over the\nheight distributions to detect VCFs.

This decentralization aligns with prevalent\norganizational practices, in which the operations team uses the information\ncommunicated from the forecasting team as input to make decisions. We formalize\nthis decentralized procedure as a bilevel problem to design a communicated\ndistribution that can yield asymptotic optimal solutions to original two-stage\nrisk-averse DRO problems.

Consequently, the operations team can solve a highly\ntractable and scalable optimization problem to identify asymptotic optimal\nsolutions. Specifically, as the magnitude of the problem parameters (including\nthe uncertain parameters and the first-stage capacity) increases to infinity at\nan appropriate rate, the cost ratio between our induced solution and the\noriginal optimal solution converges to one, indicating that our decentralized\napproach yields high-quality solutions.

    "abstract": "Emojis have become ubiquitous in online communication, serving as a universal\nmedium to convey emotions and decorative elements. Their widespread use\ntranscends language and cultural barriers, enhancing understanding and\nfostering more inclusive interactions. While existing work gained valuable\ninsight into emojis understanding, exploring emojis' capability to serve as a\nuniversal sentiment indicator leveraging large language models (LLMs) has not\nbeen thoroughly examined. Our study aims to investigate the capacity of emojis\nto serve as reliable sentiment markers through LLMs across languages and\ncultures. We leveraged the multimodal capabilities of ChatGPT to explore the\nsentiments of various representations of emojis and evaluated how well\nemoji-conveyed sentiment aligned with text sentiment on a multi-lingual dataset\ncollected from 32 countries. Our analysis reveals that the accuracy of\nLLM-based emoji-conveyed sentiment is 81.43%, underscoring emojis' significant\npotential to serve as a universal sentiment marker. We also found a consistent\ntrend that the accuracy of sentiment conveyed by emojis increased as the number\nof emojis grew in text. The results reinforce the potential of emojis to serve\nas global sentiment indicators, offering insight into fields such as\ncross-lingual and cross-cultural sentiment analysis on social media platforms.\nCode: https://github.com/ResponsibleAILab/emoji-universal-sentiment.",

The problem is defined as\nmultiple depot pickup and delivery with time windows constrained over\noperational restrictions, such as vehicle battery limitation, precedence time\nwindow, and building obstruction. Utilizing the coalition game theory, we\ninvestigate cooperation structures among the modes to capture how strategic\ncollaboration can improve overall routing efficiency. To do so, a generalized\nreinforcement learning model is designed to evaluate the cost-sharing and\nallocation to different modes to learn the cooperative behaviour with respect\nto various realistic scenarios. Our methodology leverages an end-to-end deep\nmulti-agent policy gradient method augmented by a novel spatio-temporal\nadjacency neighbourhood graph attention network using a heterogeneous\nedge-enhanced attention model and transformer architecture. Several numerical\nexperiments on last-mile delivery applications have been conducted, showing the\nresults from the case study in the city of Mississauga, which shows that\ndespite the incorporation of an extensive network in the graph for two modes\nand a complex training structure, the model addresses realistic operational\nconstraints and achieves high-quality solutions compared with the existing\ntransformer-based and classical methods.

Experimental results demonstrate that the\nensemble model significantly improves both AUC-ROC and accuracy compared to\nindividual attack methods across various large language models and datasets.\nThis indicates that by combining the strengths of different methods, we can\nmore effectively identify members of the model's training data, thereby\nproviding a more robust tool for evaluating the privacy risks of LLM.

While quantizing model\nweights to sub-byte precision has emerged as a promising solution to ease\nmemory pressure, the group quantization formats commonly used for LLM\nquantization have significant compute overheads and a resource-intensive\ndequantization process. As a result, a higher proportion of compute\ninstructions do not perform multiplies, i.e., real work, rendering them\nunsuitable for meeting the required latency requirements for LLMs deployed on\ncommodity CPUs.

These kernels amortize the cost of loading the operands and the cost\nof weight unpacking across multiple output rows. This, along with the\nintroduction of an optimized interleaved group data layout for weights and\ndecompression path optimizations to reduce unnecessary operations and\ndequantization overhead while maximizing the use of vector and matrix multiply\noperations, significantly improves the efficiency of MAC operations.\nFurthermore, we present a groupwise non-uniform codebook-based quantization\nmethod for ultra-low-precision quantization of LLMs to better match non-uniform\npatterns in their weight distributions, demonstrating better throughput during\ntoken generation while ensuring better quality than the state-of-the-art.\nApplying these improvements to 4-bit LLMs results in a 3-3.2x improvement in\nprompt processing and a 2x improvement in autoregressive decoding on Arm CPUs,\ncompared to LLaMA.cpp-based solution.

The key problem is that data plane\nperformance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are\nloading. In this paper, we first show that the data plane can be made fast with\nno or O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between\nGPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable to host cache and is underutilized,\nand (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with\nnetwork-optimized multicast.

This allows us to offload the layer computation from\nthe overloaded serving instances to the scaled ones without waiting for the\nparameters to be fully loaded.

Given that LLMs are most commonly misused in academic\nwriting, this work investigates the generalization and adaptation capabilities\nof MGT detectors in three key aspects specific to academic writing: First, we\nconstruct MGT-Acedemic, a large-scale dataset comprising over 336M tokens and\n749K samples. MGT-Acedemic focuses on academic writing, featuring human-written\ntexts (HWTs) and MGTs across STEM, Humanities, and Social Sciences, paired with\nan extensible code framework for efficient benchmarking. Second, we benchmark\nthe performance of various detectors for binary classification and attribution\ntasks in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. This benchmark reveals the\noften-overlooked challenges of attribution tasks. Third, we introduce a novel\nattribution task where models have to adapt to new classes over time without\n(or with very limited) access to prior training data in both few-shot and\nmany-shot scenarios. We implement eight different adapting techniques to\nimprove the performance and highlight the inherent complexity of the task. Our\nfindings provide insights into the generalization and adaptation ability of MGT\ndetectors across diverse scenarios and lay the foundation for building robust,\nadaptive detection systems.

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in assisting healthcare\nprofessionals with accurate diagnoses and enabling automated diagnostic\nprocesses. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often struggle with\ncapturing long-range dependencies, while transformer-based architectures,\ndespite their effectiveness, come with increased computational complexity.\nRecent efforts have focused on combining CNNs and transformers to balance\nperformance and efficiency, but existing approaches still face challenges in\nachieving high segmentation accuracy while maintaining low computational costs.\nFurthermore, many methods underutilize the CNN encoder's capability to capture\nlocal spatial information, concentrating primarily on mitigating long-range\ndependency issues. To address these limitations, we propose QTSeg, a novel\narchitecture for medical image segmentation that effectively integrates local\nand global information. QTSeg features a dual-mix attention decoder designed to\nenhance segmentation performance through: (1) a cross-attention mechanism for\nimproved feature alignment, (2) a spatial attention module to capture\nlong-range dependencies, and (3) a channel attention block to learn\ninter-channel relationships. Additionally, we introduce a multi-level feature\ndistribution module, which adaptively balances feature propagation between the\nencoder and decoder, further boosting performance. Extensive experiments on\nfive publicly available datasets covering diverse segmentation tasks, including\nlesion, polyp, breast cancer, cell, and retinal vessel segmentation,\ndemonstrate that QTSeg outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple\nevaluation metrics while maintaining lower computational costs.

Specifically, to fully harness the potential of visual\nentity and place modalities in modeling shot relations, we mine long-term shot\ncorrelations from entity semantics while simultaneously revealing short-term\nshot correlations from place semantics. In this way, we can learn distinctive\nshot features that consolidate coherence within scenes and amplify\ndistinguishability across scenes. Once equipped with distinctive shot features,\nwe further encode the relations between preceding and succeeding shots of each\ntarget shot by similarity convolution, aiding in the identification of scene\nending shots.

However, most existing\nmulti-sensor fusion SLAM methods mainly use all of the data from a range of\nsensors, a strategy we refer to as the all-in method. This method, while\nmerging the benefits of different sensors, also brings in their weaknesses,\nlowering the robustness and accuracy and leading to high computational demands.\nTo address this, we propose a new fusion approach -- Selective Kalman Filter --\nto carefully choose and fuse information from multiple sensors (using LiDAR and\nvisual observations as examples in this paper). For deciding when to fuse data,\nwe implement degeneracy detection in LiDAR SLAM, incorporating visual\nmeasurements only when LiDAR SLAM exhibits degeneracy. Regarding degeneracy\ndetection, we propose an elegant yet straightforward approach to determine the\ndegeneracy of LiDAR SLAM and to identify the specific degenerative direction.\nThis method fully considers the coupled relationship between rotational and\ntranslational constraints. In terms of how to fuse data, we use visual\nmeasurements only to update the specific degenerative states. As a result, our\nproposed method improves upon the all-in method by greatly enhancing real-time\nperformance due to less processing visual data, and it introduces fewer errors\nfrom visual measurements. Experiments demonstrate that our method for\ndegeneracy detection and fusion, in addressing degeneracy issues, exhibits\nhigher precision and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and\noffers enhanced real-time performance relative to the all-in method.

The largest\nimprovements in accuracy were achieved using an ensembling approach, where the\noutput of multiple independent decoders was merged using a fine-tuned large\nlanguage model (an approach used by all 3 top entrants). Performance gains were\nalso found by improving how the baseline recurrent neural network (RNN) model\nwas trained, including by optimizing learning rate scheduling and by using a\ndiphone training objective. Improving upon the model architecture itself proved\nmore difficult, however, with attempts to use deep state space models or\ntransformers not yet appearing to offer a benefit over the RNN baseline.

    "abstract": "To enhance autonomous driving safety in complex scenarios, various methods\nhave been proposed to simulate LiDAR point cloud data. Nevertheless, these\nmethods often face challenges in producing high-quality, diverse, and\ncontrollable foreground objects. To address the needs of object-aware tasks in\n3D perception, we introduce OLiDM, a novel framework capable of generating\nhigh-fidelity LiDAR data at both the object and the scene levels. OLiDM\nconsists of two pivotal components: the Object-Scene Progressive Generation\n(OPG) module and the Object Semantic Alignment (OSA) module. OPG adapts to\nuser-specific prompts to generate desired foreground objects, which are\nsubsequently employed as conditions in scene generation, ensuring controllable\noutputs at both the object and scene levels. This also facilitates the\nassociation of user-defined object-level annotations with the generated LiDAR\nscenes. Moreover, OSA aims to rectify the misalignment between foreground\nobjects and background scenes, enhancing the overall quality of the generated\nobjects. The broad effectiveness of OLiDM is demonstrated across various LiDAR\ngeneration tasks, as well as in 3D perception tasks. Specifically, on the\nKITTI-360 dataset, OLiDM surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods such as\nUltraLiDAR by 17.5 in FPD. Additionally, in sparse-to-dense LiDAR completion,\nOLiDM achieves a significant improvement over LiDARGen, with a 57.47\\% increase\nin semantic IoU. Moreover, OLiDM enhances the performance of mainstream 3D\ndetectors by 2.4\\% in mAP and 1.9\\% in NDS, underscoring its potential in\nadvancing object-aware 3D tasks.

Although the effectiveness of these methods in visual\ntext rendering is rapidly improving, they still encounter challenges such as\ninaccurate characters and strokes when rendering complex visual text. In this\npaper, we propose CharGen, a highly accurate character-level visual text\ngeneration and editing model. Specifically, CharGen employs a character-level\nmultimodal encoder that not only extracts character-level text embeddings but\nalso encodes glyph images character by character. This enables it to capture\nfine-grained cross-modality features more effectively. Additionally, we\nintroduce a new perceptual loss in CharGen to enhance character shape\nsupervision and address the issue of inaccurate strokes in generated text. It\nis worth mentioning that CharGen can be integrated into existing diffusion\nmodels to generate visual text with high accuracy. CharGen significantly\nimproves text rendering accuracy, outperforming recent methods in public\nbenchmarks such as AnyText-benchmark and MARIO-Eval, with improvements of more\nthan 8% and 6%, respectively. Notably, CharGen achieved a 5.5% increase in\naccuracy on Chinese test sets.",

    "abstract": "\\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{N}etworks~(GNNs) have achieved\nsignificant success in various real-world applications, including social\nnetworks, finance systems, and traffic management. Recent researches highlight\ntheir vulnerability to backdoor attacks in node classification, where GNNs\ntrained on a poisoned graph misclassify a test node only when specific triggers\nare attached. These studies typically focus on single attack categories and use\nadaptive trigger generators to create node-specific triggers. However, adaptive\ntrigger generators typically have a simple structure, limited parameters, and\nlack category-aware graph knowledge, which makes them struggle to handle\nbackdoor attacks across multiple categories as the number of target categories\nincreases. We address this gap by proposing a novel approach for\n\\textbf{E}ffective and \\textbf{U}nnoticeable\n\\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{C}ategory~(EUMC) graph backdoor attacks, leveraging\nsubgraph from the attacked graph as category-aware triggers to precisely\ncontrol the target category. To ensure the effectiveness of our method, we\nconstruct a \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{C}ategory \\textbf{S}ubgraph\n\\textbf{T}riggers \\textbf{P}ool~(MC-STP) using the subgraphs of the attacked\ngraph as triggers. We then exploit the attachment probability shifts of each\nsubgraph trigger as category-aware priors for target category determination.\nMoreover, we develop a ``select then attach'' strategy that connects suitable\ncategory-aware trigger to attacked nodes for unnoticeability. Extensive\nexperiments across different real-world datasets confirm the efficacy of our\nmethod in conducting multi-category graph backdoor attacks on various GNN\nmodels and defense strategies.",

    "abstract": "Determining the quantum-classical boundary between quantum circuits which can\nbe efficiently simulated classically and those which cannot remains a\nfundamental question. One approach to classical simulation is to represent the\noutput of a quantum circuit as a Clifford-augmented Matrix Product State\n(CAMPS) which, via a disentangling algorithm, decomposes the wave function into\nClifford and MPS components and from which Pauli expectation values can be\ncomputed in time polynomial in the MPS bond-dimension. In this work, we develop\nan optimization-free disentangling (OFD) algorithm for Clifford circuits either\ndoped with multi-qubit gates of the form $\\alpha I+\\beta P$. We give a simple\nalgebraic criterion which characterizes the individual quantum circuits for\nwhich OFD generates an efficient CAMPS - the bond-dimension is exponential in\nthe null space of a GF(2) matrix induced by a tableau of the twisted Pauli\nstrings $P$. This significantly increases the number of circuits with rigorous\npolynomial time classical simulations. We also give evidence that the typical\n$N$ qubit random Clifford circuit doped with $N$ uniformly distributed $T$\ngates of poly-logarithmic depth or greater has a CAMPS with polynomial\nbond-dimension. In addition, we compare OFD against disentangling by\noptimization. We further explore the representability of CAMPS for random\nClifford circuits doped with more than $N$ $T$-gates. We also propose\nalgorithms for sampling, probability and amplitude estimation of bitstrings,\nand evaluation of entanglement R\\'enyi entropy from CAMPS, which, though still\nhaving exponential complexity, are more efficient than standard MPS\nsimulations.

    "abstract": "Let $\\lambda$ be the Liouville function. Assuming the Generalised Riemann\nHypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions (GRH), we show that for every\nsufficiently large even integer $N$ there are $a,b \\geq 1$ such that $$ a+b = N\n\\text{ and } \\lambda(a) = \\lambda(b) = -1. $$ This conditionally answers an\nanalogue of the binary Goldbach problem for the Liouville function, posed by\nShusterman.\n  The latter is a consequence of a quantitative lower bound on the frequency of\nsign patterns attained by $(\\lambda(n),\\lambda(N-n))$, for sufficiently large\nprimes $N$. We show, assuming GRH, that there is a constant $C > 0$ such that\nfor each pattern $(\\eta_1,\\eta_2) \\in \\{-1,+1\\}^2$ and each prime $N \\geq N_0$,\n$$ |\\{n < N : (\\lambda(n),\\lambda(N-n)) = (\\eta_1,\\eta_2)\\}| \\gg N e^{-C(\\log\n\\log N)^{6}}. $$ The proof makes essential use of the Pierce expansion of\nrational numbers $n/N$, which may be of interest in other binary problems.",

    "abstract": "An exponential space elevator is a space elevator with a tether cross-section\nthat varies exponentially with altitude. With such an elevator it is possible\nto reel in tether material at one end of the elevator while reeling out at the\nother end, without changing the overall taper profile. I show how to use this\nproperty to build up or clone a space elevator much more efficiently than with\nstandard climber-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models offer powerful predictive capabilities but often lack\ntransparency. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) addresses\nthis by perturbing features and measuring their impact on a model's output. In\ntext-based tasks, LIME typically removes present words (bits set to 1) to\nidentify high-impact tokens. We propose \\textbf{Q-LIME $\\pi$} (Quantum LIME\n$\\pi$), a quantum-inspired extension of LIME that encodes a binary feature\nvector in a quantum state, leveraging superposition and interference to explore\nlocal neighborhoods more efficiently. Our method focuses on flipping bits from\n$1 \\rightarrow 0$ to emulate LIME's ``removal'' strategy, and can be extended\nto $0 \\rightarrow 1$ where adding features is relevant. Experiments on subsets\nof the IMDb dataset demonstrate that Q-LIME $\\pi$ often achieves near-identical\ntop-feature rankings compared to classical LIME while exhibiting lower runtime\nin small- to moderate-dimensional feature spaces. This quantum-classical hybrid\napproach thus provides a new pathway for interpretable AI, suggesting that,\nwith further improvements in quantum hardware and methods, quantum parallelism\nmay facilitate more efficient local explanations for high-dimensional data.",

    "abstract": "Large, high-purity single-crystals of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are essential for\nexploiting its many desirable and interesting properties. Here, we demonstrate\nvia X-ray tomography, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy that\nh-BN crystals can be grown by traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ). The\ndiameters of grown boules range from 3 - 5 mm with lengths from 2 - 10 mm.\nTomography indicates variable grain sizes within the boules, with the largest\nhaving areas of $\\approx$ 1 mm $\\times$ 2 mm and thickness $\\approx$ 0.5 mm.\nAlthough the boules contain macroscale flux inclusions, the h-BN lattice itself\nis of high quality for samples grown under optimized conditions. The currently\noptimized growth procedure employs an Fe flux, moderate N$_2$ pressure ($P_{N2}\n\\approx$ 6 bar), and a growth rate of 0.1 mm/h. Raman spectroscopy for an\noptimized sample gives an average linewidth of 7.7(2) cm$^{-1}$ for the\nE$_{\\mathrm{2g}}$ intralayer mode at 1365.46(4) cm$^{-1}$ and 1.0(1) cm$^{-1}$\nfor the E$_{\\mathrm{2g}}$ interlayer shear mode at 51.78(9) cm$^{-1}$. The\ncorresponding photoluminescence spectrum shows sharp phonon-assisted free\nexciton peaks and minimal signal in the energy range corresponding to\ncarbon-related defects ($E$ = 3.9 4.1 eV). Our work demonstrates the viability\nof growing h-BN by the TSFZ technique, thereby opening a new route towards\nlarger, high-quality crystals and advancing the state of h-BN related research.",
