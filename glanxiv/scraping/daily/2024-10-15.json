    "abstract": "We show that spin-orbit splitting (SOS) in monolayers of semiconducting\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is substantially enhanced by\nelectron-electron interaction. This effect, similar to the exchange-enhancement\nof the electron g-factor, is most pronounced for conduction band electrons (in\nparticular, in MoS$_2$), and it has a non-monotonic dependence on the carrier\nsheet density, $n$. That is, the SOS enhancement is peaked at the onset of\nfilling of the higher-energy spin-split band by electrons, $n_*$, which also\nseparates the regimes of slow (at $n<n_*$) and fast (for $n>n_*$) spin and\nvalley relaxation of charge carriers. Moreover, this density itself is\ndetermined by the enhanced SOS value, making the account of exchange\nrenormalisation important for the analysis of spintronic performance of\nfield-effect transistors based on two-dimensional TMDs.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning has unlocked the potential for robots to exhibit highly\ndexterous behaviours. However, it still struggles with long-horizon,\nmulti-object tasks due to poor sample efficiency and limited generalisation.\nExisting methods require a substantial number of demonstrations to cover\npossible task variations, making them costly and often impractical for\nreal-world deployment. We address this challenge by introducing oriented\naffordance frames, a structured representation for state and action spaces that\nimproves spatial and intra-category generalisation and enables policies to be\nlearned efficiently from only 10 demonstrations. More importantly, we show how\nthis abstraction allows for compositional generalisation of independently\ntrained sub-policies to solve long-horizon, multi-object tasks. To seamlessly\ntransition between sub-policies, we introduce the notion of self-progress\nprediction, which we directly derive from the duration of the training\ndemonstrations. We validate our method across three real-world tasks, each\nrequiring multi-step, multi-object interactions. Despite the small dataset, our\npolicies generalise robustly to unseen object appearances, geometries, and\nspatial arrangements, achieving high success rates without reliance on\nexhaustive training data.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across applications.\nHowever, ensuring their reliability remains a challenge, and in many\nsituations, alternative models with similar functionality and accuracy are\navailable. Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture\nbehavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets,\nmaking it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential\ntesting addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in\nDNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations:\nmany rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To\naddress these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation\napproach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to\ngenerate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral\ndiscrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions,\nfocusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input\nspace and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically\nsearching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that\ntrigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it\napplicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs\ntrained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly\noutperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with\ngreater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the\ngenerated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model\nselection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input\ncharacteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using\nalternative models.",

Alas, the overwhelming majority of protocols in the\nliterature have the caveat that their security crucially hinges on the security\nof the cryptography and setup, to the point where if the cryptography is\nbroken, even a single corrupted party can violate the security of the protocol.\nThus these protocols provide higher corruption resilience ($n/2$ instead of\n$n/3$) for the price of increased assumptions. Is this trade-off necessary?\n  We further the study of crypto-agnostic Byzantine agreement among $n$ parties\nthat answers this question in the negative. Specifically, let $t_s$ and $t_i$\ndenote two parameters such that (1) $2t_i + t_s < n$, and (2) $t_i \\leq t_s <\nn/2$. Crypto-agnostic Byzantine agreement ensures agreement among honest\nparties if (1) the adversary is computationally bounded and corrupts up to\n$t_s$ parties, or (2) the adversary is computationally unbounded and corrupts\nup to $t_i$ parties, and is moreover given all secrets of all parties\nestablished during the setup. We propose a compiler that transforms any pair of\nresilience-optimal Byzantine agreement protocols in the authenticated and\ninformation-theoretic setting into one that is crypto-agnostic. Our compiler\nhas several attractive qualities, including using only $O(\\lambda n^2)$ bits\nover the two underlying Byzantine agreement protocols, and preserving round and\ncommunication complexity in the authenticated setting. In particular, our\nresults improve the state-of-the-art in bit complexity by at least two factors\nof $n$ and provide either early stopping (deterministic) or expected constant\nround complexity (randomized). We therefore provide fallback security for\nauthenticated Byzantine agreement for free for $t_i \\leq n/4$.",

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong\npotential in solving planning problems, there is a trade-off between\nflexibility and complexity. LLMs, as zero-shot planners themselves, are still\nnot capable of directly generating valid plans for complex planning problems\nsuch as multi-constraint or long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, many\nframeworks aiming to solve complex planning problems often rely on\ntask-specific preparatory efforts, such as task-specific in-context examples\nand pre-defined critics/verifiers, which limits their cross-task generalization\ncapability. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by observing that the\ncore of many planning problems lies in optimization problems: searching for the\noptimal solution (best plan) with goals subject to constraints (preconditions\nand effects of decisions). With LLMs' commonsense, reasoning, and programming\ncapabilities, this opens up the possibilities of a universal LLM-based approach\nto planning problems. Inspired by this observation, we propose LLMFP, a\ngeneral-purpose framework that leverages LLMs to capture key information from\nplanning problems and formally formulate and solve them as optimization\nproblems from scratch, with no task-specific examples needed. We apply LLMFP to\n9 planning problems, ranging from multi-constraint decision making to\nmulti-step planning problems, and demonstrate that LLMFP achieves on average\n83.7% and 86.8% optimal rate across 9 tasks for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,\nsignificantly outperforming the best baseline (direct planning with OpenAI\no1-preview) with 37.6% and 40.7% improvements. We also validate components of\nLLMFP with ablation experiments and analyzed the underlying success and failure\nreasons. Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/llmfp.",

    "abstract": "The Thirty Meter Telescope will use a sophisticated adaptive optics system\ncalled NFIRAOS. This system utilizes two deformable mirrors conjugate to 0 km\nand 11.2 km to apply a Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) correction over a\n2 arcminute field of view. DM0 and DM11 have 63 and 75 actuators across their\nrespective diameters. To study the behavior of these mirrors, we have developed\na low-cost, very high-order Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Sensor (WFS). We will use\nour WFS to calibrate the flatness of the DMs and measure the influence\nfunctions of the actuators. NFIRAOS is cooled to reduce the thermal emissivity\nof optical surfaces visible to the science detectors, so we will also measure\nthe behaviour of the DMs in both warm and cold environments. As the cold\nchamber is prone to vibrations, a WFS is preferred to a phase-shifting\ninterferometer. Our design was driven by the need to be able to evaluate the DM\nsurface between the actuators, which led to the requirement of at least 248 sub\napertures across the diameter. The largest commercially available\nShack-Hartmann WFS has only 128 sub-apertures across the diameter, which is not\nenough to properly sample these DMs. Furthermore, the designed sensor is able\nto record the wavefront at 50 FPS (50 times per second) at full resolution. To\nfabricate this WFS, we used a commercial off-the-shelf CMOS detector, camera\nlens, and lens let array, which kept the total cost less than 20K USD. Here we\npresent the design and performance characteristics of this device.",

    "abstract": "For predicting software defects at an early stage, researchers have proposed\njust-in-time defect prediction (JIT-DP) to identify potential defects in code\ncommits. The prevailing approaches train models to represent code changes in\nhistory commits and utilize the learned representations to predict the presence\nof defects in the latest commit. However, existing models merely learn editions\nin source code, without considering the natural language intentions behind the\nchanges. This limitation hinders their ability to capture deeper semantics. To\naddress this, we introduce a novel bi-modal change pre-training model called\nBiCC-BERT. BiCC-BERT is pre-trained on a code change corpus to learn bi-modal\nsemantic representations. To incorporate commit messages from the corpus, we\ndesign a novel pre-training objective called Replaced Message Identification\n(RMI), which learns the semantic association between commit messages and code\nchanges. Subsequently, we integrate BiCC-BERT into JIT-DP and propose a new\ndefect prediction approach -- JIT-BiCC. By leveraging the bi-modal\nrepresentations from BiCC-BERT, JIT-BiCC captures more profound change\nsemantics. We train JIT-BiCC using 27,391 code changes and compare its\nperformance with 8 state-of-the-art JIT-DP approaches.

Our integrated\nTSA-winch system overcomes these constraints by providing variable transmission\nratios through dynamic adjustment. It increases actuator stroke by winching\ninstead of overtwisting, and it improves force output by twisting. The design\nfeatures a rotating turret that houses a winch, which is mounted on a bevel\ngear assembly driven by a through-hole drive shaft. Mathematical models are\ndeveloped for the combined displacement and velocity control of this system.\nExperimental validation demonstrates the actuator's ability to achieve a wide\nrange of transmission ratios and precise movement control. We present\nperformance data on movement precision and generated forces, discussing the\nresults in the context of existing literature.

    "abstract": "Graph representation learning, involving both node features and graph\nstructures, is crucial for real-world applications but often encounters\npervasive noise. State-of-the-art methods typically address noise by focusing\nseparately on node features with large language models (LLMs) and on graph\nstructures with graph structure learning models (GSLMs). In this paper, we\nintroduce LangGSL, a robust framework that integrates the complementary\nstrengths of pre-trained language models and GSLMs to jointly enhance both node\nfeature and graph structure learning. In LangGSL, we first leverage LLMs to\nfilter noise in the raw data and extract valuable cleaned information as\nfeatures, enhancing the synergy of downstream models. During the mutual\nlearning phase in LangGSL, the core idea is to leverage the relatively small\nlanguage model (LM) to process local attributes and generate reliable\npseudo-labels and informative node embeddings, which are then integrated into\nthe GSLM's prediction phase. This approach enriches the global context and\nenhances overall performance. Meanwhile, GSLM refines the evolving graph\nstructure constructed from the LM's output, offering updated labels back to the\nLM as additional guidance, thus facilitating a more effective mutual learning\nprocess. The LM and GSLM work synergistically, complementing each other's\nstrengths and offsetting weaknesses within a variational information-maximizing\nframework, resulting in enhanced node features and a more robust graph\nstructure. Extensive experiments on diverse graph datasets of varying scales\nand across different task scenarios demonstrate the scalability and\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the causal effect of a treatment or health policy with\nobservational data can be challenging due to an imbalance of and a lack of\noverlap between treated and control covariate distributions. In the presence of\nlimited overlap, researchers choose between 1) methods (e.g., inverse\nprobability weighting) that imply traditional estimands but whose estimators\nare at risk of considerable bias and variance; and 2) methods (e.g., overlap\nweighting) which imply a different estimand, thereby modifying the target\npopulation to reduce variance. We propose a framework for navigating the\ntradeoffs between variance and bias due to imbalance and lack of overlap and\nthe targeting of the estimand of scientific interest. We introduce a bias\ndecomposition that encapsulates bias due to 1) the statistical bias of the\nestimator; and 2) estimand mismatch, i.e., deviation from the population of\ninterest. We propose two design-based metrics and an estimand selection\nprocedure that help illustrate the tradeoffs between these sources of bias and\nvariance of the resulting estimators. Our procedure allows analysts to\nincorporate their domain-specific preference for preservation of the original\nresearch population versus reduction of statistical bias. We demonstrate how to\nselect an estimand based on these preferences with an application to right\nheart catheterization data.",

The outflow is revealed in the\nsoft X-ray spectra as an absorption feature, which is enhanced periodically\nevery $\\sim 8.3$ days. The repetitive nature of the ultrafast outflow is\ntentatively explained by an orbiting massive perturber, possibly an\nintermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), trajectory of which is inclined with\nrespect to the accretion flow around the primary supermassive black hole\n(SMBH). In this scenario, the orbiting body pushes the disc gas into the\noutflow funnel, where it is accelerated by the ordered magnetic field (Sukov\\'a\net al. 2021). Quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows (a.k.a. QPOuts) are thus a novel\nphenomenon that can help reveal new extreme-/intermediate-mass ratio inspiral\n(EMRI/IMRI) candidates.

We\nestablish that the BICEP3 2-year dataset (2017--2018) has an on-sky sensitivity\nto the cosmic birefringence angle of $\\sigma = 0.078\\deg$, which could be\nimproved to $\\sigma = 0.055\\deg$ by adding all of the existing BICEP3 data\n(through 2023). Furthermore, we emphasize the possibility of using the BICEP3\nsky patch as a polarization calibration source for CMB experiments, which with\nthe present data could reach a precision of $0.035\\deg$. Finally, in the\ncontext of inflation searches, we investigate the impact of\ndetector-to-detector variations in polarization angles as they may bias the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio r. We show that while the effect is expected to remain\nsubdominant to other sources of systematic uncertainty, it can be reliably\ncalibrated using polarization angle measurements such as the ones we present in\nthis paper.",

Here, we report\nexperimental observations of even and odd optical harmonics generated from a\nsuspended subwavelength silicon film, a dielectric membrane, up to the 7th\nharmonic tuned deep in the UV range at 210nm, which is the current limit of our\ndetection system, using peak power densities of order 3TW/cm^2. We explain the\nexperimental data with a time domain, hydrodynamic-Maxwell approach broadly\napplicable to most materials. Our approach accounts simultaneously for surface\nand magnetic nonlinearities that generate even optical harmonics, as well as\nlinear and nonlinear material dispersions beyond the third order to account for\nodd optical harmonics, plasma formation, and a phase locking mechanism that\nmakes the generation of high harmonics possible deep into the UV range, where\nsemiconductors like silicon start operating in a metallic regime.",

    "abstract": "This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of collaborative bandit algorithms\nand provides a thorough comparison of their performance. Collaborative bandits\naim to improve the performance of contextual bandits by introducing\nrelationships between arms (or items), allowing effective propagation of\ninformation. Collaboration among arms allows the feedback obtained through a\nsingle user (item) to be shared across related users (items). Introducing\ncollaboration also alleviates the cold user (item) problem, i.e., lack of\nhistorical information when a new user (item) arriving to the platform with no\nprior record of interactions. In the context of modeling the relationships\nbetween arms (items), there are two main approaches: Hard and soft clustering.\nWe call approaches that model the relationship between arms in an\n\\textit{absolute} manner as hard clustering, i.e., the relationship is binary.\nSoft clustering relaxes membership constraints, allowing \\textit{fuzzy}\nassignment. Focusing on the latter, we provide extensive experiments on the\nstate-of-the-art collaborative contextual bandit algorithms and investigate the\neffect of sparsity and how the exploration intensity acts as a correction\nmechanism. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that controlling for sparsity\nin collaboration improves data efficiency and performance as it better informs\nlearning. Meanwhile, increasing the exploration intensity acts as a correction\nbecause it effectively reduces variance due to potentially misspecified\nrelationships among users. We observe that this misspecification is further\nremedied by introducing latent factors, and thus, increasing the dimensionality\nof the bandit parameters.",

A key\ninnovation in AdaDPSyn is the Precision-Focused Iterative Radius Reduction\ntechnique, which dynamically refines the aggregation radius - the scope of data\ngrouping for noise addition - based on patterns observed in data clustering,\nthereby minimizing the amount of additive noise. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on standard benchmarks and compare AdaDPSyn with DP few-shot\ngeneration algorithm (Tang et al., 2023).

This approach is largely unexplored in the field of AAD but\nleads to a single-word auditory attention decoding problem in which an epoch of\nan EEG signal timed to a specific word is labeled as attended or unattended.\nThis paper presents a deep learning approach, based on EEGNet, to address this\nchallenge.

Such automatic call characterisation can\nassist conservation efforts and inform environmental management strategies. In\ncontrast to previous work in which call detection was performed at a segment\nlevel, we perform call detection at a frame level which implicitly also allows\ncall endpointing, the isolation of a call in a longer recording. For\nexperimentation, we employ two annotated datasets, one containing Asian and the\nother African elephant vocalisations. We evaluate several shallow and deep\nclassifier models, and show that the current best performance can be improved\nby using an audio spectrogram transformer (AST), a neural architecture which\nhas not been used for this purpose before, and which we have configured in a\nnovel sequence-to-sequence manner. We also show that using transfer learning by\npre-training leads to further improvements both in terms of computational\ncomplexity and performance. Finally, we consider sub-call classification using\nan accepted taxonomy of call types, a task which has not previously been\nconsidered. We show that also in this case the transformer architectures\nprovide the best performance. Our best classifiers achieve an average precision\n(AP) of 0.962 for framewise binary call classification, and an area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.957 and 0.979 for call\nclassification with 5 classes and sub-call classification with 7 classes\nrespectively. All of these represent either new benchmarks (sub-call\nclassifications) or improvements on previously best systems. We conclude that a\nfully-automated elephant call detection and subcall classification system is\nwithin reach.

These tables scale linearly with the\nnumber of users and items, and are trained to ensure high similarity between\nembeddings of interacted user-item pairs, while maintaining low similarity for\nnon-interacted pairs. Despite their high performance, encouraging dispersion\nfor non-interacted pairs necessitates expensive regularization (e.g., negative\nsampling), hurting runtime and scalability. Existing research tends to address\nthese challenges by simplifying the learning process, either by reducing model\ncomplexity or sampling data, trading performance for runtime. In this work, we\nmove beyond model-level modifications and study the properties of the embedding\ntables under different learning strategies. Through theoretical analysis, we\nfind that the singular values of the embedding tables are intrinsically linked\nto different CF loss functions. These findings are empirically validated on\nreal-world datasets, demonstrating the practical benefits of higher stable\nrank, a continuous version of matrix rank which encodes the distribution of\nsingular values. Based on these insights, we propose an efficient warm-start\nstrategy that regularizes the stable rank of the user and item embeddings. We\nshow that stable rank regularization during early training phases can promote\nhigher-quality embeddings, resulting in training speed improvements of up to\n66%. Additionally, stable rank regularization can act as a proxy for negative\nsampling, allowing for performance gains of up to 21% over loss functions with\nsmall negative sampling ratios. Overall, our analysis unifies current CF\nmethods under a new perspective, their optimization of stable rank, motivating\na flexible regularization method.",

    "abstract": "Overlaps between words are crucial in many areas of computer science, such as\ncode design, stringology, and bioinformatics. A self overlapping word is\ncharacterized by its periods and borders. A period of a word $u$ is the\nstarting position of a suffix of $u$ that is also a prefix $u$, and such a\nsuffix is called a border. Each word of length, say $n>0$, has a set of\nperiods, but not all combinations of integers are sets of periods. Computing\nthe period set of a word $u$ takes linear time in the length of $u$. We address\nthe question of computing, the set, denoted $\\Gamma_n$, of all period sets of\nwords of length $n$. Although period sets have been characterized, there is no\nformula to compute the cardinality of $\\Gamma_n$ (which is exponential in $n$),\nand the known dynamic programming algorithm to enumerate $\\Gamma_n$ suffers\nfrom its space complexity. We present an incremental approach to compute\n$\\Gamma_n$ from $\\Gamma_{n-1}$, which reduces the space complexity, and then a\nconstructive certification algorithm useful for verification purposes. The\nincremental approach defines a parental relation between sets in $\\Gamma_{n-1}$\nand $\\Gamma_n$, enabling one to investigate the dynamics of period sets, and\ntheir intriguing statistical properties. Moreover, the period set of a word $u$\nis the key for computing the absence probability of $u$ in random texts. Thus,\nknowing $\\Gamma_n$ is useful to assess the significance of word statistics,\nsuch as the number of missing words in a random text.",

    "abstract": "The vulnerability of machine learning models in adversarial scenarios has\ngarnered significant interest in the academic community over the past decade,\nresulting in a myriad of attacks and defenses. However, while the community\nappears to be overtly successful in devising new attacks across new contexts,\nthe development of defenses has stalled. After a decade of research, we appear\nno closer to securing AI applications beyond additional training. Despite a\nlack of effective mitigations, AI development and its incorporation into\nexisting systems charge full speed ahead with the rise of generative AI and\nlarge language models. Will our ineffectiveness in developing solutions to\nadversarial threats further extend to these new technologies?\n  In this paper, we argue that overly permissive attack and overly restrictive\ndefensive threat models have hampered defense development in the ML domain.\nThrough the lens of adversarial evasion attacks against neural networks, we\ncritically examine common attack assumptions, such as the ability to bypass any\ndefense not explicitly built into the model. We argue that these flawed\nassumptions, seen as reasonable by the community based on paper acceptance,\nhave encouraged the development of adversarial attacks that map poorly to\nreal-world scenarios. In turn, new defenses evaluated against these very\nattacks are inadvertently required to be almost perfect and incorporated as\npart of the model. But do they need to? In practice, machine learning models\nare deployed as a small component of a larger system. We analyze adversarial\nmachine learning from a system security perspective rather than an AI\nperspective and its implications for emerging AI paradigms.",

Specifically, we first fine-tune the SD with source data,\naligning the content and layout of generated samples with real-world driving\nscenarios. Then, we propose a procedural prompt generation method based on LLM,\nwhich can enrich scenario descriptions and help SD automatically generate more\ndiverse, detailed images. In addition, we introduce a balanced generation\nstrategy, which encourages the SD to generate high-quality objects of tailed\nclasses under various weather conditions, such as riders and motorcycles. This\nsegmentation-model-agnostic method can improve the generalization ability of\nexisting models by additionally adapting them with the generated synthetic\ndata. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method can\nsignificantly improve the segmentation performance of different\nstate-of-the-art models on target domains.

    "abstract": "We study a decentralized version of Moving Agents in Formation (MAiF), a\nvariant of Multi-Agent Path Finding aiming to plan collision-free paths for\nmultiple agents with the dual objectives of reaching their goals quickly while\nmaintaining a desired formation. The agents must balance these objectives under\nconditions of partial observation and limited communication. The formation\nmaintenance depends on the joint state of all agents, whose dimensionality\nincreases exponentially with the number of agents, rendering the learning\nprocess intractable. Additionally, learning a single policy that can\naccommodate different linear preferences for these two objectives presents a\nsignificant challenge. In this paper, we propose Mean-Field Control with\nEnvelop $Q$-learning (MFC-EQ), a scalable and adaptable learning framework for\nthis bi-objective multi-agent problem. We approximate the dynamics of all\nagents using mean-field theory while learning a universal preference-agnostic\npolicy through envelop $Q$-learning. Our empirical evaluation of MFC-EQ across\nnumerous instances shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art centralized MAiF\nbaselines. Furthermore, MFC-EQ effectively handles more complex scenarios where\nthe desired formation changes dynamically -- a challenge that existing MAiF\nplanners cannot address.",

First, AiGem formulates the\nhistorical traffic interaction with the autonomous agent as a graph in two\nsteps: (1) at each time step of the history frames, agent-interactions are\ncaptured using spatial edges between the agents (nodes of the graph), and then,\n(2) connects the spatial graphs in chronological order using temporal edges.\nThen, AiGem applies a depthwise graph encoder network on the spatial-temporal\ngraph to generate graph embedding, i.e., embedding of all the nodes in the\ngraph. Next, a sequential Gated Recurrent Unit decoder network uses the\nembedding of the current timestamp to get the decoded states. Finally, an\noutput network comprising a Multilayer Perceptron is used to predict the\ntrajectories utilizing the decoded states as its inputs.

    "abstract": "Representation learning has become increasingly important, especially as\npowerful models have shifted towards learning latent representations before\nfine-tuning for downstream tasks. This approach is particularly valuable in\nleveraging the structural information within brain anatomy. However, a common\nlimitation of recent models developed for MRIs is their tendency to ignore or\nremove geometric information, such as translation and rotation, thereby\ncreating invariance with respect to geometric operations. We contend that\nincorporating knowledge about these geometric transformations into the model\ncan significantly enhance its ability to learn more detailed anatomical\ninformation within brain structures. As a result, we propose a novel method for\nencoding 3D MRIs that enforces equivariance with respect to all rotations in 3D\nspace, in other words, SO(3)-equivariance (SOE). By explicitly modeling this\ngeometric equivariance in the representation space, we ensure that any\nrotational operation applied to the input image space is also reflected in the\nembedding representation space. This approach requires moving beyond\ntraditional representation learning methods, as we need a representation vector\nspace that allows for the application of the same SO(3) operation in that\nspace. To facilitate this, we leverage the concept of vector neurons. The\nrepresentation space formed by our method captures the brain's structural and\nanatomical information more effectively. We evaluate SOE pretrained on the\nstructural MRIs of two public data sets with respect to the downstream task of\npredicting age and diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease from T1-weighted brain scans\nof the ADNI data set. We demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms\nother methods but is also robust against various degrees of rotation along\ndifferent axes.

    "abstract": "Logical fallacy uses invalid or faulty reasoning in the construction of a\nstatement. Despite the prevalence and harmfulness of logical fallacies,\ndetecting and classifying logical fallacies still remains a challenging task.\nWe observe that logical fallacies often use connective words to indicate an\nintended logical relation between two arguments, while the argument semantics\ndoes not actually support the logical relation. Inspired by this observation,\nwe propose to build a logical structure tree to explicitly represent and track\nthe hierarchical logic flow among relation connectives and their arguments in a\nstatement. Specifically, this logical structure tree is constructed in an\nunsupervised manner guided by the constituency tree and a taxonomy of\nconnectives for ten common logical relations, with relation connectives as\nnon-terminal nodes and textual arguments as terminal nodes, and the latter are\nmostly elementary discourse units. We further develop two strategies to\nincorporate the logical structure tree into LLMs for fallacy reasoning.\nFirstly, we transform the tree into natural language descriptions and feed the\ntextualized tree into LLMs as a part of the hard text prompt. Secondly, we\nderive a relation-aware tree embedding and insert the tree embedding into LLMs\nas a soft prompt. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\napproach based on logical structure tree significantly improves precision and\nrecall for both fallacy detection and fallacy classification.",

This combined method was applied to a chronic kidney disease\n(CKD) cohort of more than two million individuals and used to understand the\nassociational and causal relationships of CKD variables with respect to a\nsurrogate outcome of >=40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate\n(eGFR). The associational and causal analyses depicted similar findings across\nDBNs from two independent healthcare systems. The associational analysis showed\nthat the most influential variables were eGFR, urine albumin-to-creatinine\nratio, and pulse pressure, whereas the causal analysis showed eGFR as the most\ninfluential variable, followed by modifiable factors such as medications that\nmay impact kidney function over time.

However, performing online experiments\nwith every change to a CMG system is troublesome, as each iteration affects\nusers and requires time to collect enough statistics. On the other hand,\noffline evaluation, a prevalent approach in the research literature,\nfacilitates fast experiments but employs automatic metrics that are not\nguaranteed to represent the preferences of real users. In this work, we\ndescribe a novel way we employed to deal with this problem at JetBrains, by\nleveraging an online metric - the number of edits users introduce before\ncommitting the generated messages to the VCS - to select metrics for offline\nexperiments.\n  To support this new type of evaluation, we develop a novel markup collection\ntool mimicking the real workflow with a CMG system, collect a dataset with 57\npairs consisting of commit messages generated by GPT-4 and their counterparts\nedited by human experts, and design and verify a way to synthetically extend\nsuch a dataset. Then, we use the final dataset of 656 pairs to study how the\nwidely used similarity metrics correlate with the online metric reflecting the\nreal users' experience.\n  Our results indicate that edit distance exhibits the highest correlation with\nthe online metric, whereas commonly used similarity metrics such as BLEU and\nMETEOR demonstrate low correlation. This contradicts the previous studies on\nsimilarity metrics for CMG, suggesting that user interactions with a CMG system\nin real-world settings differ significantly from the responses by human\nlabelers within controlled environments.

A primary challenge in studying\nmultilingual scaling is the difficulty of analyzing individual language\nperformance due to cross-lingual transfer. To address this, we shift the focus\nfrom individual languages to language families. We introduce and validate a\nhypothesis that the test cross-entropy loss for each language family is\ndetermined solely by its own sampling ratio, independent of other languages in\nthe mixture. This insight simplifies the complexity of multilingual scaling and\nmake the analysis scalable to an arbitrary number of languages. Building on\nthis hypothesis, we derive a power-law relationship that links performance with\ndataset size, model size and sampling ratios. This relationship enables us to\npredict performance across various combinations of the above three quantities,\nand derive the optimal sampling ratios at different model scales. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed scaling law, we\nperform a large-scale empirical study, training more than 100 models on 23\nlanguages spanning 5 language families. Our experiments show that the optimal\nsampling ratios derived from small models (85M parameters) generalize\neffectively to models that are several orders of magnitude larger (1.2B\nparameters), offering a resource-efficient approach for multilingual LM\ntraining at scale.",

In contrast, the direct problem aims to\ndetermine the heat transfer rate for a given geometry. The solution obtained\nhere is analytic, and the resulting function describing the relation between\nheight ans radius of the glass, is in closed form, providing a family of\noptimal glass shapes that can be manufactured by conventional methods.

To characterize\nquantitatively the condition for and outcome of fragmentation under realistic\nthermodynamics, we perform global 3D simulations of gravitationally unstable\ndisks at various cooling rates and cooling types, including the first global\nsimulations of gravitational instability that employ full radiation transport.\nWe find that fragmentation is a stochastic process, with the fragment\ngeneration rate per disk area $p_{\\rm frag}$ showing an exponential dependence\non the parameter $\\beta\\equiv\\Omega_K t_{cool}$, where $\\Omega_K$ is the\nKeplerian rotation frequency and $t_{cool}$ is the average cooling timescale.\nCompared to a prescribed constant $\\beta$, radiative cooling in the optically\nthin/thick regime makes $p_{\\rm frag}$ decrease slower/faster in $\\beta$; the\ncritical $\\beta$ corresponding to $\\sim 1$ fragment per orbit is $\\approx$3, 5,\n2 for constant $\\beta$, optically thin, and optically thick cooling,\nrespectively. The distribution function of the initial fragment mass is\nremarkably insensitive to disk thermodynamics. Regardless of cooling rate and\noptical depth, the typical initial fragment mass is $m_{frag} \\approx 40\nM_{tot}h^3$, with $M_{tot}$ being the total (star+disk) mass and $h=H/R$ being\nthe disk aspect ratio. Applying this result to typical Class 0/I protostellar\ndisks, we find $m_{frag}\\sim 20 M_J$, suggesting that fragmentation more likely\nforms brown dwarfs.

However, the origin of the induced electric\npolarization in CMO remains highly controversial and continues to be a subject\nof ongoing debate. In this paper, through room temperature X-ray powder\ndiffraction (XRPD), temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, and\nthermally stimulated depolarizing current (TSDC) measurements, we provide\nexperimental evidence for a route to tune the magnetically induced polarization\nby modifying the exchange-striction in CMO via Sr-doping.

We suggest that this reduction in induced electric polarization in CMO\noriginates from the increase in the Mn$^{3+}$ -- O -- Mn$^{4+}$ bond angle due\nto Sr$^{2+}$ doping, weakening the exchange-striction interaction.

    "abstract": "Early turbulence in periodic cylinder arrays is of particular interest in\nmany practical applications to enhance mixing and material/heat exchange. In\nthis study, we reveal a new early transition pathway to a chaotic wavy state\nand drag enhancement with the addition of polymers. Using 2D direct numerical\nsimulations with sufficiently small polymer diffusion ($\\epsilon=10^{-5}$), we\nshow that viscoelastic flow past periodic cylinder arrays become unstable at a\nReynolds number $Re\\approx 10$, significantly lower than the Newtonian\ncounterpart of $Re\\approx 150-200$. The chaotic wavy state which ensues\nexhibits sheets and `arrowhead' polymer conformation structures, consistent\nwith the saturated centre-mode instability observed in wall-bounded parallel\nflows (Page et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 125, 154501, 2020). Analysis of the\nkinetic energy budget reveals the purely elastic origin of the chaos. However,\ninertial forces, in conjunction with elastic forces, can reshape the base\nstate, affecting the formation of an invariant polymer sheet. This sheet\nfacilitates the stretching and recoiling of polymers, which in turn induces\nflow fluctuations and maintains the chaos. Exploring various maximum polymer\nextensions $b$, and polymer concentrations $\\beta$ highlights the role of\nelastic forces in stretching the upstream separation zone while suppressing the\ndownstream separation zone, resulting in drag enhancement at finite $Re$.\nSurprisingly, these modifications to the base state can suppress the invariant\npolymer sheet under large elastic forces (large $b$ or small $\\beta$), thereby\nachieving a stable polymer-modified laminar state.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the Restricted Longest Common Subsequence (RLCS)\nproblem, an extension of the well-known Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)\nproblem. This problem has significant applications in bioinformatics,\nparticularly for identifying similarities and discovering mutual patterns and\nimportant motifs among DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. Building on recent\nadvancements in solving this problem through a general search framework, this\npaper introduces two novel heuristic approaches designed to enhance the search\nprocess by steering it towards promising regions in the search space. The first\nheuristic employs a probabilistic model to evaluate partial solutions during\nthe search process. The second heuristic is based on a neural network model\ntrained offline using a genetic algorithm. A key aspect of this approach is\nextracting problem-specific features of partial solutions and the complete\nproblem instance. An effective hybrid method, referred to as the learning beam\nsearch, is developed by combining the trained neural network model with a beam\nsearch framework. An important contribution of this paper is found in the\ngeneration of real-world instances where scientific abstracts serve as input\nstrings, and a set of frequently occurring academic words from the literature\nare used as restricted patterns. Comprehensive experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in solving the RLCS\nproblem. Finally, an empirical explainability analysis is applied to the\nobtained results. In this way, key feature combinations and their respective\ncontributions to the success or failure of the algorithms across different\nproblem types are identified.",

Third, an examination of DMD analyses using a range of\nspatial and temporal resolutions of hemodynamic data to validate the\napplicability of DMD for low-resolution data, similar to ones in clinical\npractices. Our results show that DMD is able to characterize the inflow jet\ndynamics by separating large-scale structures and flow instabilities even at\nlow spatial and temporal resolutions.

However, informative 3D imaging techniques are time-consuming, costly and\nrarely available, such that analyses often have to rely on 2D image data. This\npaper presents a novel stereological approach for generating virtual 3D cathode\nparticles that exhibit crack networks that are statistically equivalent to\nthose observed in 2D sections of experimentally measured particles.\nConsequently, more easily available 2D image data suffices for deriving a full\n3D characterization of cracked cathodes particles. In future research, the\nvirtually generated 3D particles will be used as geometry input for spatially\nresolved electro-chemo-mechanical simulations, to enhance our understanding of\nstructure-property relationships of cathodes in Li-ion batteries.",

While in the current\nliterature uncertainty measures are produced for standalone modules without\nconsidering the broader system context, in our work we explicitly consider the\nrole of decision-making under uncertainty in illuminating how \"good'\" an\nuncertainty measure is. Our insights are centered around quantifying the ways\nin which being uncertainty-aware makes a system more robust. Firstly, we use\nlevel set generation tools to produce a measure for system robustness and use\nthis measure to compare system designs, thus placing uncertainty quantification\nin the context of system performance and evaluation metrics. Secondly, we use\nthe concept of specification generation from systems theory to produce a\nformulation under which a designer can simultaneously constrain the properties\nof an uncertainty measure and analyze the efficacy of the\ndecision-making-under-uncertainty algorithm used by the system. We apply our\nanalyses to two real-world and complex autonomous systems, one for autonomous\ndriving and another for aircraft runway incursion detection, helping to form a\ntoolbox for an uncertainty-aware system designer to produce more effective and\nrobust systems.",

These highly\nluminous variables are observable beyond 100 Mpc, so if they were confirmed to\nbehave as standard candles, they would allow us a direct measurement of\ncosmological distances without any secondary distance indicator, thus reducing\npotential systematic errors in the calibration of the cosmic distance scale.\nThis paper presents an analysis of the largest known sample of 73 ULPs,\nincluding 15 objects in nearby galaxies, with new accurate and homogeneous\nphotometry obtained by Gaia DR3, and a new object, in our Galaxy, identified as\nLong Period Variable in Gaia DR3, but recently reclassified as ULP. The\nobtained results suggest that, by improving photometric accuracy, the ULP\nPeriod-Wesenheit relation shows a smaller dispersion than that obtained in\nliterature and is in better agreement with the Classical Cepheid (CC) one,\nsupporting the hypothesis that ULPs are the extension of the CCs at higher\nperiod, mass and luminosity. However, to reach this aim, it is necessary to\nenrich the sample with high-quality data. The Rubin-LSST survey offers the\npossibility to achieve this thanks to its photometric characteristics and time\nextension. In particular, we will explore the capabilities of the Rubin-LSST\nsurvey to recover ULP theoretical light-curves by using a new tool called\nPulsationStarRecovery, built by our group for this type of analysis.",

Results are obtained within the tight-binding model with\ninterlayer hopping parameters defined by the Slater-Koster form for different\ninterlayer twist angles $\\theta$. Our findings show that, for $\\theta$ around\n0$^\\circ$ or $60^\\circ$, the energy spectra exhibit features resulting from the\ninterplay between characteristics of the AA and AB/BA stacking orders that\ncompose the moir\\'e pattern of such tBLG, while the low-energy levels are shown\nto be nearly independent on the rotation angle for $10^\\circ\\lesssim\n\\theta\\lesssim 50^\\circ$.

PIXEL, a canonical example of such a model, is a vision\ntransformer that has been pre-trained on rendered text. While PIXEL has shown\npromising cross-script transfer abilities and robustness to orthographic\nperturbations, it falls short of outperforming monolingual subword counterparts\nlike BERT in most other contexts. This discrepancy raises questions about the\namount of linguistic knowledge learnt by these models and whether their\nperformance in language tasks stems more from their visual capabilities than\ntheir linguistic ones. To explore this, we probe PIXEL using a variety of\nlinguistic and visual tasks to assess its position on the vision-to-language\nspectrum. Our findings reveal a substantial gap between the model's visual and\nlinguistic understanding. The lower layers of PIXEL predominantly capture\nsuperficial visual features, whereas the higher layers gradually learn more\nsyntactic and semantic abstractions. Additionally, we examine variants of PIXEL\ntrained with different text rendering strategies, discovering that introducing\ncertain orthographic constraints at the input level can facilitate earlier\nlearning of surface-level features.

We compared three models:\nMistral 7B, SaulLM-7B-Base (Mistral 7B with continued pre-training on legal\ncorpora), and SaulLM-7B-Instruct (with further IFT). This preliminary\nassessment examined 7 distinct text sequences from recent AI & Law literature,\neach containing a human-defined legal concept.

This inquiry\nrevealed that (1) the impact of legal training was unevenly distributed across\nthe various human-defined legal concepts, and (2) the contextual\nrepresentations of legal knowledge learned during legal training did not\ncoincide with structures of human-defined legal concepts.

Building on the Benamou-Brenier formula from optimal transport and\naction matching, we use a variational problem to infer parameter- and\ntime-dependent gradient fields that represent approximations of the population\ndynamics. The inferred gradient fields can then be used to rapidly generate\nsample trajectories that mimic the dynamics of the physical system on a\npopulation level over varying physics parameters.

While\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models excel in accessing information from\nlarge document collections, they struggle with complex tasks that require\naggregation and reasoning over information spanning across multiple\ndocuments--what we call holistic reasoning. Long-context language models\n(LCLMs) have great potential for managing large-scale documents, but their\nholistic reasoning capabilities remain unclear. In this work, we introduce\nHoloBench, a novel framework that brings database reasoning operations into\ntext-based contexts, making it easier to systematically evaluate how LCLMs\nhandle holistic reasoning across large documents. Our approach adjusts key\nfactors such as context length, information density, distribution of\ninformation, and query complexity to evaluate LCLMs comprehensively. Our\nexperiments show that the amount of information in the context has a bigger\ninfluence on LCLM performance than the actual context length. Furthermore, the\ncomplexity of queries affects performance more than the amount of information,\nparticularly for different types of queries. Interestingly, queries that\ninvolve finding maximum or minimum values are easier for LCLMs and are less\naffected by context length, even though they pose challenges for RAG systems.\nHowever, tasks requiring the aggregation of multiple pieces of information show\na noticeable drop in accuracy as context length increases. Additionally, we\nfind that while grouping relevant information generally improves performance,\nthe optimal positioning varies across models. Our findings surface both the\nadvancements and the ongoing challenges in achieving a holistic understanding\nof long contexts.",

However, the increased memory and computational costs\nassociated with these models pose significant challenges for deployment on\nresource-limited devices. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising\nsolution to reduce the costs of LLMs without requiring post-processing steps.\nPrior structural pruning methods either follow the dependence of structures at\nthe cost of limiting flexibility, or introduce non-trivial additional\nparameters by incorporating different projection matrices. In this work, we\npropose a novel approach that relaxes the constraint imposed by regular\nstructural pruning methods and eliminates the structural dependence along the\nembedding dimension. Our dimension-independent structural pruning method offers\nseveral benefits. Firstly, our method enables different blocks to utilize\ndifferent subsets of the feature maps. Secondly, by removing structural\ndependence, we facilitate each block to possess varying widths along its input\nand output dimensions, thereby significantly enhancing the flexibility of\nstructural pruning. We evaluate our method on various LLMs, including OPT,\nLLaMA, LLaMA-2, Phi-1.5, and Phi-2.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of federated training of a deep neural network\n(DNN) over a random access channel (RACH) such as in computer networks,\nwireless networks, and cellular systems. More precisely, a set of remote users\nparticipate in training a centralized DNN model using SGD under the\ncoordination of a parameter server (PS). The local model updates are\ntransmitted from the remote users to the PS over a RACH using a slotted ALOHA\nprotocol. The PS collects the updates from the remote users, accumulates them,\nand sends central model updates to the users at regular time intervals. We\nrefer to this setting as the RACH-FL setting. The RACH-FL setting crucially\naddresses the problem of jointly designing a (i) client selection and (ii)\ngradient compression strategy which addresses the communication constraints\nbetween the remote users and the PS when transmission occurs over a RACH. For\nthe RACH-FL setting, we propose a policy, which we term the ''age-of-gradient''\n(AoG) policy in which (i) gradient sparsification is performed using top-K\nsparsification, (ii) the error correction is performed using memory\naccumulation, and (iii) the slot transmission probability is obtained by\ncomparing the current local memory magnitude minus the magnitude of the\ngradient update to a threshold. Intuitively, the AoG measure of ''freshness''\nof the memory state is reminiscent of the concept of age-of-information (AoI)\nin the context of communication theory and provides a rather natural\ninterpretation of this policy. Numerical simulations show the superior\nperformance of the AoG policy as compared to other RACH-FL policies.",

The best known algorithm for the trace reconstruction from the\ndeletion channel is due to Chase, and recovers the input string whp given\n$\\exp(\\tilde{O}(n^{1/5}))$ traces [Cha21b].\n  The main component in Chase's algorithm is a procedure for k-mer estimation,\nwhich, for any marker $w$ in $\\{0, 1\\}^k$ of length $k$, computes a \"smoothed\"\ndistribution of its appearances in the input string $x$ [CGL+23, MS24]. Current\nk-mer estimation algorithms fail when the deletion probability is above $1/2$,\nrequiring a more complex analysis for Chase's algorithm. Moreover, the only\nknown extension of these approaches beyond the deletion channels is based on\nnumerically estimating high-order differentials of a multivariate polynomial,\nmaking it highly impractical [Rub23].\n  In this paper, we construct a simple Monte Carlo method for k-mer estimation\nwhich can be easily applied to a much wider variety of channels. In particular,\nwe solve k-mer estimation for any combination of insertion, deletion, and\nbit-flip channels, even in the high deletion probability regime, allowing us to\ndirectly apply Chase's algorithm for this wider class of channels.\n  To accomplish this, we utilize an approach from the field of quantum error\nmitigation (the process of using many measurements from noisy quantum computers\nto simulate a clean quantum computer), called the quasi-probability method\n(also known as probabilistic error cancellation) [TBG17, PSW22]. We derive a\ncompletely classical version of this technique, and use it to construct a k-mer\nestimation algorithm.\n  No background in quantum computing is needed to understand this paper.",

Generally, a tuned controller is\nnot sufficient to perform in all environments. Thus, a controller that can\nadapt to changing conditions is necessary for autonomous driving. Furthermore,\nthese controllers often depend on vehicle models that also need to adapt over\ntime due to varying environments. This paper uses graphs to present novel\ntechniques to learn the vehicle model and the lateral controller online. First,\na heterogeneous graph is presented depicting the current states of and inputs\nto the vehicle. The vehicle model is then learned online using known physical\nconstraints in conjunction with the processing of the graph through a Graph\nNeural Network structure. Next, another heterogeneous graph - depicting the\ntransition from current to desired states - is processed through another Graph\nNeural Network structure to generate the steering command on the fly. Finally,\nthe performance of this self-learning model-based lateral controller is\nevaluated and shown to be satisfactory on an open-source autonomous driving\nplatform called CARLA.",

This is a well-known property of the\nclassical evolution equations, but demonstrating that it is robust to quantum\ncorrection involves a number of technical arguments. In this paper, we will use\neffective field theory (EFT) techniques to demonstrate the all orders\nconservation of the super-horizon scalar and tensor fluctuations of the metric\nduring inflation. We show how to construct an EFT for these soft modes, in\nanalogy with Soft de Sitter Effective Theory. We pay particular attention to\nhow the breaking of time-diffeomorphisms by the inflationary background\nintroduces new time scales that alter the structure of the EFT. In this\ndescription, the all orders conservation of the metric fluctuations is a direct\nconsequence of symmetries and power counting that cannot be altered by loop\ncorrections. We further show that this holds when the inflaton (or metric\nfluctuations) is coupled to additional heavy fields, as in quasi-single field\ninflation. We match this behavior to several calculations in the ultraviolet\n(UV) theory and show how the Mellin representation enables a more transparent\nconnection between the UV and the EFT descriptions.",

To address co-variate shift, we formulate diffusion\ndistillation within imitation learning (DDIL) framework and enhance training\ndistribution for distilling diffusion models on both data distribution (forward\ndiffusion) and student induced distributions (backward diffusion). Training on\ndata distribution helps to diversify the generations by preserving marginal\ndata distribution and training on student distribution addresses compounding\nerror by correcting covariate shift. In addition, we adopt reflected diffusion\nformulation for distillation and demonstrate improved performance, stable\ntraining across different distillation methods.

However, making the collected imagery data useful for automated defect\ndetection requires significant manual labeling effort. We propose a novel\nsolution that combines synthetic asset defect images with manually labeled\ndrone images. This solution has several benefits: improves performance of\ndefect detection, reduces the number of hours spent on manual labeling, and\nenables the capability to generate realistic images of rare defects where not\nenough real-world data is available.

This perspective\nallows us to define a complete decomposition of the KL error. This then\nmotivates the formulation of a sparse selection problem over the set of\npossible mode interactions. In the same way as sparse graph selection allows\nfor better generalization, we find that our learned distributions are able to\nmore efficiently use the finite amount of data which is available in practice.\nOn both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate our algorithm's\neffectiveness in maximizing the log-likelihood for the generative task and also\nthe ease of adaptability to the discriminative task of classification.",

    "abstract": "Pretraining robust vision or multimodal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) relies\non large-scale datasets that may be noisy, potentially misaligned, and have\nlong-tail distributions. Previous works have shown promising results in\naugmenting datasets by generating synthetic samples. However, they only support\ndomain-specific ad hoc use cases (e.g., either image or text only, but not\nboth), and are limited in data diversity due to a lack of fine-grained control\nover the synthesis process. In this paper, we design a \\emph{controllable}\nimage-text synthesis pipeline, CtrlSynth, for data-efficient and robust\nmultimodal learning. The key idea is to decompose the visual semantics of an\nimage into basic elements, apply user-specified control policies (e.g., remove,\nadd, or replace operations), and recompose them to synthesize images or texts.\nThe decompose and recompose feature in CtrlSynth allows users to control data\nsynthesis in a fine-grained manner by defining customized control policies to\nmanipulate the basic elements. CtrlSynth leverages the capabilities of\npretrained foundation models such as large language models or diffusion models\nto reason and recompose basic elements such that synthetic samples are natural\nand composed in diverse ways. CtrlSynth is a closed-loop, training-free, and\nmodular framework, making it easy to support different pretrained models. With\nextensive experiments on 31 datasets spanning different vision and\nvision-language tasks, we show that CtrlSynth substantially improves zero-shot\nclassification, image-text retrieval, and compositional reasoning performance\nof CLIP models.",

We analyze 28 AGN sightlines passing\nwithin 35 kpc of the LMC with archival HST/COS spectra to characterize the cool\n(T\\approx10^4$ K) gas in the LMC CGM, via new measurements of UV absorption in\nsix low ions (OI, FeII, SiII, AlII, SII, and NiII) and one intermediate ion\n(SiIII). We show that a declining column-density profile is present in all\nseven ions, with the low-ion profiles having a steeper slope than the high-ion\nprofiles in CIV and SiIV reported by Krishnarao et al. 2022. Crucially,\nabsorption at the LMC systemic velocity is only detected (in all ions) out to\n17 kpc. Beyond this distance, the gas has a lower velocity and is associated\nwith the Magellanic Stream. These results demonstrate that the LMC's CGM is\ncomposed of two distinct components: a compact inner halo extending to 17 kpc,\nand a more extended stripped region associated with the Stream.

    "abstract": "Characterizing a quantum system by learning its state or evolution is a\nfundamental problem in quantum physics and learning theory with a myriad of\napplications. Recently, as a new approach to this problem, the task of agnostic\nstate tomography was defined, in which one aims to approximate an arbitrary\nquantum state by a simpler one in a given class. Generalizing this notion to\nquantum processes, we initiate the study of agnostic process tomography: given\nquery access to an unknown quantum channel $\\Phi$ and a known concept class\n$\\mathcal{C}$ of channels, output a quantum channel that approximates $\\Phi$ as\nwell as any channel in the concept class $\\mathcal{C}$, up to some error. In\nthis work, we propose several natural applications for this new task in quantum\nmachine learning, quantum metrology, classical simulation, and error\nmitigation. In addition, we give efficient agnostic process tomography\nalgorithms for a wide variety of concept classes, including Pauli strings,\nPauli channels, quantum junta channels, low-degree channels, and a class of\nchannels produced by $\\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits. The main technical tool we use\nis Pauli spectrum analysis of operators and superoperators. We also prove that,\nusing ancilla qubits, any agnostic state tomography algorithm can be extended\nto one solving agnostic process tomography for a compatible concept class of\nunitaries, immediately giving us efficient agnostic learning algorithms for\nClifford circuits, Clifford circuits with few T gates, and circuits consisting\nof a tensor product of single-qubit gates. Together, our results provide\ninsight into the conditions and new algorithms necessary to extend the\nlearnability of a concept class from the standard tomographic setting to the\nagnostic one.",

The management and organization of datasets is also\nmade easier; DAXA archives can be version controlled and updated if new data\nbecome available. Once relevant observations are identified, the raw data can\nbe downloaded (and optionally processed) through DAXA, or pre-processed event\nlists, images, and exposure maps can be downloaded if they are available. X-ray\nobservations are perfectly suited to serendipitous discoveries and archival\nanalyses, and with a decade-long `X-ray desert' potentially on the horizon\narchival data will take on even greater importance; enhanced access to those\narchives will be vital to the continuation of X-ray astronomy.",

Either the theory is incomplete or these objects are not single\nentities.

Including\nenvironmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a\nrather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena.\nHere, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of\nsuperradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar\nwaves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged\nblack hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively\ngeneric, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of\nmassless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged\nblack holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black\nholes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar\nwave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of\nmass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant\namplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction' that the\nmass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently\nlarge scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly\naffected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational\ninteraction between the dense halo and the wave's mass grows, thus further\nsuppressing the superradiant amplification.",

    "abstract": "We characterise the entropy profiles of 32 very high mass\n($M_{500}>7.75\\times10^{14}~M_{\\odot}$) galaxy clusters (HIGHMz), selected from\nthe CHEX-MATE sample, to study the intracluster medium (ICM) entropy\ndistribution in a regime where non-gravitational effects are minimised. Using\nXMM-Newton measurements, we measure the entropy profiles up to ~$R_{500}$ for\nall objects. The scaled profiles exhibit large dispersion in the central\nregions, but converge rapidly to the expectation from pure gravitational\ncollapse beyond the core. We quantify the correlation between the ICM\nmorphological parameters and scaled entropy as a function of radius, showing\nthat morphologically relaxed (disturbed) objects have low (high) central\nentropy. We compare our data to other observational samples, finding\ndifferences in normalisation which are linked to the average mass of the\nsamples in question. We find that a weaker mass dependence than self-similar in\nthe scaling (Am ~ -0.25) allows us to minimise the dispersion in the radial\nrange [0.3-0.8]$R_{500}$ for clusters spanning over a decade in mass. The\ndeviation from self-similarity is radially dependent and is more pronounced at\nsmall and intermediate radii than at $R_{500}$. We also investigate the\ndistribution of central entropy $K_0$, finding no evidence for bimodality, and\nouter slopes $\\alpha$, which peaks at ~1.1. Using weak lensing masses, we find\nindication for a small suppression of the scatter (~30%) beyond the core when\nusing masses derived from Yx in the rescaling. Finally, we compare to recent\ncosmological numerical simulations from THE THREE HUNDRED and MACSIS, finding\ngood agreement with our observational data. These results provide a robust\nobservational benchmark in the gravity-dominated regime and will serve as a\nfuture reference for samples at lower mass, higher redshifts, and for ongoing\nwork using cosmological numerical simulations.",

Whilst we identify some prospects for observation with future GW\ndetectors, our results highlight the need to develop new experiments for\nhigh-frequency GW detection in the ~kHz to ~MHz range.

    "abstract": "Galactic globular clusters contain two main groups of stars, the pristine or\n1P stars, and the polluted or 2P stars. The pristine-star fraction in clusters,\n$F_{1P}$, is a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass, $m_{prst}$.\nPaper~I has introduced a model mapping the region of the $(m_{prst},F_{1P})$\nspace occupied by clusters, with the cluster mass threshold for 2P-star\nformation a key building-block. We now expand this model to the pristine-star\nfraction in dependence of the pristine- and polluted-population masses. Milone\net al.(2020) found that $F_{1P}$ anticorrelates more tightly with the\npolluted-population present-day mass, $m_{2P,prst}$, than with the cluster\ntotal mass, $m_{prst}$. In contrast, $F_{1P}$ anticorrelates poorly with the\npristine-population current mass, $m_{1P,prst}$. We show the loose\nanticorrelation between $F_{1P}$ and $m_{1P,prst}$ to result from a roughly\nconstant pristine-population mass among clusters as they start their long-term\nevolution in the Galactic tidal field. As for the tight anticorrelation between\n$m_{2P,prst}$ and $F_{1P}$, it stems from the initially shallow relation\nbetween $m_{2P}$ and $F_{1P}$ (Fig.4). Clusters of the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) appear to behave unexpectedly\nwith respect to each other. For a given $F_{1P}$, LMC clusters are more massive\nthan SMC clusters despite their enduring a stronger tidal field (Fig.6). This\nis opposite to how the Galactic outer- and inner-halo clusters behave (bottom\npanels of Figs 1-3). The explanation may lie in cluster formation conditions.\nFinally, we wonder whether the single-population clusters NGC~419 and Rup~106\nformed as multiple-populations clusters.",

    "abstract": "Accreting massive black holes (MBHs, with M$_\\bullet > 10^3$ M$_{\\odot}$) are\nknown for their panchromatic emission, spanning from radio to gamma rays. While\nMBHs accreting at significant fractions of their Eddington rate are readily\ndetectable, those accreting at much lower rates in radiatively inefficient\nmodes often go unnoticed, blending in with other astrophysical sources. This\nchallenge is particularly relevant for gas-starved MBHs in external galaxies\nand those possibly wandering in the Milky Way. We present HOLESOM, a machine\nlearning-powered tool based on the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) algorithm,\nspecifically designed to identify slowly-accreting MBHs using sparse\nphotometric data. Trained on a comprehensive set of $\\sim$ 20, 000 spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs), HOLESOM can (i) determine if the photometry of a\nsource is consistent with slowly-accreting MBHs and (ii) estimate its black\nhole mass and Eddington ratio, including uncertainties. We validate HOLESOM\nthrough extensive tests on synthetic data and real-world cases, including\nSagittarius A* (Sgr A*), demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying\nslowly-accreting MBHs. Additionally, we derive analytical relations between\nradio and X-ray luminosities to further constrain physical parameters. The\nprimary strength of HOLESOM lies in its ability to accurately identify MBH\ncandidates, which can then be targeted for follow-up photometric and\nspectroscopic observations. Fast and scalable, HOLESOM offers a robust\nframework for automatically scanning large multi-wavelength datasets, making it\na valuable tool for unveiling hidden MBH populations in the local Universe.",

As a result,\nnumerous scientific works have been published analyzing and further developing\nvarious aspects of the experiment, from performing tests of gravity to\nimproving the efficiency of the current data analysis techniques. In this\nregard, we contribute to the recent advancements in the field of PTAs by\npresenting the most general, agnostic, per-frequency Bayesian search for a\nlow-frequency (red) noise process in these data. Our new method involves the\nuse of a conjugate Jeffrey's-like multivariate prior which allows one to model\nall unique parameters of the global PTA-level red noise covariance matrix as a\nseparate model parameter for which a marginalized posterior-probability\ndistribution can be found using Gibbs sampling. Even though perfecting the\nimplementation of the Gibbs sampling and mitigating the numerical stability\nchallenges require further development, we show the power of this new method by\nanalyzing realistic and theoretical PTA simulated data sets. We show how our\ntechnique is consistent with the more restricted standard techniques in\nrecovering both the auto and the cross-spectrum of pulsars' low-frequency (red)\nnoise. Furthermore, we highlight ways to approximately characterize a GWB (both\nits auto- and cross-spectrum) using Fourier coefficient estimates from\nsingle-pulsar and so-called CURN (common uncorrelated red noise) analyses via\nanalytic draws from a specific Inverse-Wishart distribution.",

At the core of 3D PTV is the dual-frame fluid motion estimation\nalgorithm, which tracks particles across two consecutive frames. Recently, deep\nlearning-based methods have achieved impressive accuracy in dual-frame fluid\nmotion estimation; however, they heavily depend on large volumes of labeled\ndata. In this paper, we introduce a new method that is completely\nself-supervised and notably outperforms its fully-supervised counterparts while\nrequiring only 1% of the training samples (without labels) used by previous\nmethods.

While AB Aur b is detectable in complementary\ntotal intensity data, it is a non-detection in polarized light at $\\lambda$ $>$\n1.3 $\\mu $m. While the observed disk color is extremely red across $JHK$, the\ndisk has a blue intrinsic scattering color consistent with small dust grains.\nThe disk's polarization spectrum is redder than AB Aur b's total intensity\nspectrum. The polarization fraction peaks at $\\sim$ 0.6 along the major disk\naxis. Radiative transfer modeling of the CHARIS data shows that small, porous\ndust grains with a porosity of $p$ = 0.6--0.8 better reproduce the\nscattered-light appearance of the disk than more compact spheres ($p$ = 0.3),\nespecially the polarization fraction. This work demonstrates the utility of\nintegral field spectropolarimetry to characterize structures in protoplanetary\ndisks and elucidate the properties of the disks' dust.",

Using the operator algebra formalism,\nwe establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data, such as\nanyon fusion rules and topological spins, of two-dimensional bulk stabilizer\ncodes and one-dimensional boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the\noperator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and\nconvert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for\nobtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion\nrules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible\ngapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through\nboundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines\nthe analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for\nfault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $\\mathbb{Z}_d$\nqudits for both prime and nonprime $d$, enabling exploration of topological\nphases beyond the Kitaev toric code.

We show that multi-head attention can be expressed in\nthe summation form. Drawing on the insight that not all attention heads hold\nequal significance, we propose Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH), a new\narchitecture that treats attention heads as experts in the Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) mechanism. MoH has two significant advantages: First, MoH enables each\ntoken to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency\nwithout compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. Second,\nMoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted\nsummation, introducing flexibility to the attention mechanism and unlocking\nextra performance potential. Extensive experiments on ViT, DiT, and LLMs\ndemonstrate that MoH outperforms multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of\nthe attention heads. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained multi-head\nattention models, such as LLaMA3-8B, can be further continue-tuned into our MoH\nmodels. Notably, MoH-LLaMA3-8B achieves an average accuracy of 64.0% across 14\nbenchmarks, outperforming LLaMA3-8B by 2.4% by utilizing only 75% of the\nattention heads.

Each cluster corresponds to a gate in\nthe multi-gating mechanism, routing user-item pairs to appropriate expert\nmodels. This architecture enables GaVaMoE to generate tailored explanations for\nspecific user types and preferences, mitigating data sparsity by leveraging\nuser similarities.

A good detector should focus on\nthe generative models fingerprints while ignoring image properties such as\nsemantic content, resolution, file format, etc. Fake image detectors are\nusually built in a data driven way, where a model is trained to separate real\nfrom fake images. Existing works primarily investigate network architecture\nchoices and training recipes. In this work, we argue that in addition to these\nalgorithmic choices, we also require a well aligned dataset of real/fake images\nto train a robust detector. For the family of LDMs, we propose a very simple\nway to achieve this: we reconstruct all the real images using the LDMs\nautoencoder, without any denoising operation. We then train a model to separate\nthese real images from their reconstructions. The fakes created this way are\nextremely similar to the real ones in almost every aspect (e.g., size, aspect\nratio, semantic content), which forces the model to look for the LDM decoders\nartifacts. We empirically show that this way of creating aligned real/fake\ndatasets, which also sidesteps the computationally expensive denoising process,\nhelps in building a detector that focuses less on spurious correlations,\nsomething that a very popular existing method is susceptible to. Finally, to\ndemonstrate just how effective the alignment in a dataset can be, we build a\ndetector using images that are not natural objects, and present promising\nresults. Overall, our work identifies the subtle but significant issues that\narise when training a fake image detector and proposes a simple and inexpensive\nsolution to address these problems.",

Herein, the Q-function is\ntrained from off-policy environment data and the actor (policy) is trained to\nmaximize the Q-function via gradient ascent. We observe that in complex tasks\nlike dexterous manipulation and restricted locomotion, the Q-value is a complex\nfunction of action, having several local optima or discontinuities. This poses\na challenge for gradient ascent to traverse and makes the actor prone to get\nstuck at local optima. To address this, we introduce a new actor architecture\nthat combines two simple insights: (i) use multiple actors and evaluate the\nQ-value maximizing action, and (ii) learn surrogates to the Q-function that are\nsimpler to optimize with gradient-based methods. We evaluate tasks such as\nrestricted locomotion, dexterous manipulation, and large discrete-action space\nrecommender systems and show that our actor finds optimal actions more\nfrequently and outperforms alternate actor architectures.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the\nMarkovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining\nscale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation.\nBy explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no\nrelations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual\ndissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a\nsingle dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation\ncascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we\nshow that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law\nscaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles\nbecome hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation\nestimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal\noperation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient\nconditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These\nhigher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper\nlower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden\ndissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may\nerroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore\nthe still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in\nanalyzing coarse observations.",

However, as text\ninputs become longer, existing encoding methods like CLIP face limitations, and\naligning the generated images with long texts becomes challenging. To tackle\nthese issues, we propose LongAlign, which includes a segment-level encoding\nmethod for processing long texts and a decomposed preference optimization\nmethod for effective alignment training. For segment-level encoding, long texts\nare divided into multiple segments and processed separately. This method\novercomes the maximum input length limits of pretrained encoding models. For\npreference optimization, we provide decomposed CLIP-based preference models to\nfine-tune diffusion models. Specifically, to utilize CLIP-based preference\nmodels for T2I alignment, we delve into their scoring mechanisms and find that\nthe preference scores can be decomposed into two components: a text-relevant\npart that measures T2I alignment and a text-irrelevant part that assesses other\nvisual aspects of human preference. Additionally, we find that the\ntext-irrelevant part contributes to a common overfitting problem during\nfine-tuning. To address this, we propose a reweighting strategy that assigns\ndifferent weights to these two components, thereby reducing overfitting and\nenhancing alignment. After fine-tuning $512 \\times 512$ Stable Diffusion (SD)\nv1.5 for about 20 hours using our method, the fine-tuned SD outperforms\nstronger foundation models in T2I alignment, such as PixArt-$\\alpha$ and\nKandinsky v2.2.

This integration enables precise\nmodifications at the object level and creative recomposition of scenes without\ncompromising overall image integrity.

These\nannotations facilitate concept learning with a fine-tuned diffusion model,\nrepresenting each object with an optimized token and detailed description\nprompt. 2) During the image editing phase, a LLM editing controller guides the\nedits towards specific areas.

The FDA focused its\nassessment on males of ages 18-64 years because the agency's risk analysis was\nlimited to vaccine-attributable myocarditis/pericarditis (VAM/P) given the\nexcess risk among males. The FDA analysis concluded that vaccine benefits\nclearly outweighed risks, even for 18-25-year-old males (those at highest VAM/P\nrisk). We reanalyze the FDA benefit-risk assessment using information available\nthrough the third week of January 2022 and focusing on 18-25-year-old males. We\nuse the FDA's framework but extend its model by accounting for protection\nderived from prior COVID infection, finer age-stratification in\nCOVID-hospitalization rates, and incidental hospitalizations (those of patients\nwho test positive for COVID but are being treated for something else). We also\nuse more realistic projections of Omicron-infection rates and more accurate\nrates of VAM/P. With hospitalizations as the principal endpoint of the analysis\n(those prevented by vaccination vs. those caused by VAM/P), our model finds\nvaccine risks outweighed benefits for 18-25-year-old males, except in scenarios\nprojecting implausibly high Omicron-infection prevalence. Our assessment\nsuggests that mRNA-1273 vaccination of 18-25-year-old males generated between\n16% and 63% more hospitalizations from vaccine-attributable\nmyocarditis/pericarditis alone compared to COVID hospitalizations prevented\n(over a 5-month period of vaccine protection assumed by the FDA). The preceding\nassessment is based on assumptions drawn from data available before 1/22/22.\nMoreover, these assumptions are validated by subsequently available data. Thus,\nwe show that the outcome of a benefit-risk assessment for vaccination may be\ndramatically impacted by accounting for the benefits derived from prior\ninfection",

These theories, treated here\nas new Lorentz-breaking theories, extend the Chern-Simons one by including\nparity-violating operators containing first and second derivatives of the\nnon-minimally coupled scalar (inflaton) field. This model is capable of\nimprinting parity-violating signatures in late-time observables, such as the\ngalaxy four-point correlation function.

A famous example in quantum optics is the Hong Ou Mandel\ninterference effect,a major ingredient in current quantum information\nprocessing using photonics. Traditionally the HOM features interference between\namplitudes for two one-photon number states. Surprisingly, interference can be\nmanifested when one amplitude represents that most classical of light field\nstates, the coherent state, provided the partner state is non-classical (eg a\nsingle photon state or an odd photon number state). Imposing such nonclassical\nfeatures on an otherwise classical state is the focus of this article.\nRecently, the HOM effect has been generalized to the multi-photon case, termed\nthe extended HOM effect by the authors.The implication of the extended HOM\neffect is that if an odd parity state, comprising only odd numbers of photons,\nenters one input port of a 50:50 beam splitter, then regardless of the state\nentering the other input port, be it pure or mixed, there will no output\ncoincident counts. In this work, we explain the extended HOM as arising from a\nsequence of pairwise HOM-like complete destructive interferences occurring\nsimultaneously in the multicomponent amplitude for the output coincidence\ncounts. We first demonstrate this diagrammatically in order to build physical\nintuition, before developing a general analytical proof. We then examine the\ncase of a single photon interacting with a coherent state (and idealized\nlaser), and consider prospects for experimental detection by including the\neffect of imperfect detection efficiency. This work highlights the importance\nof the non-classicality of light, and in particular the interference effects\nstemming from the discreteness of photon quanta.",

OKAMI uses\nopen-world vision models to identify task-relevant objects and retarget the\nbody motions and hand poses separately. Our experiments show that OKAMI\nachieves strong generalizations across varying visual and spatial conditions,\noutperforming the state-of-the-art baseline on open-world imitation from\nobservation. Furthermore, OKAMI rollout trajectories are leveraged to train\nclosed-loop visuomotor policies, which achieve an average success rate of 79.2%\nwithout the need for labor-intensive teleoperation.

Two key methodologies are explored:\nProportional-Derivative (PD) approximation and Sparse Identification of\nNonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). The UAV dynamics are first modeled using the\nEuler-Lagrange formulation, providing a set of generalized coordinates.\nHowever, platform constraints limit the control inputs to attitude angles, and\nlinear and angular velocities along the z-axis. To accommodate these\nlimitations, thrust and torque inputs are approximated using a PD controller,\nserving as the foundation for nonlinear system identification. In parallel,\nSINDy, a data-driven method, is employed to derive a compact and interpretable\nmodel of the UAV dynamics from experimental data. Both identified models are\nthen integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for accurate\ntrajectory tracking, where model accuracy, informed by data-driven insights,\nplays a critical role in optimizing control performance. This fusion of\ndata-driven approaches and theoretical modeling enhances the system's\nrobustness and adaptability in real-world conditions, offering a detailed\nanalysis of the UAV's dynamic behavior.",

    "abstract": "The well-known 1089 trick reflects an amazing trait of digital reversal\nprocess and reminisces of a limiting attractor in dynamical systems even though\nit takes only two steps. It is natural to consider the situations when the\nnumber of digits is beyond three as in the original 1089 trick, as well as\nsituations when the number of steps is beyond two. The first part has been\nmostly done by Webster which we will reproduce. After two steps, the resulting\nintegers are called Papadakis-Webster integers (PWI), which is always divisible\nby 99, and the resulting quotients consist of only 0's and 1's, which we name\nPapadakis-Webster binary strings (PWBS). Not all binary strings could be PWBS,\nand we define the hairpin pairing rule to determine if a binary string is a\nPWBS. For the second part, we propose a two-option iteration system named\niterative digital reversal (IDR) suitably interweaving additions and\nsubtractions. The simplest limiting behavior of IDR is 2-cycles. The elements\nin an IDR 2-cycle are all composed of repetitions of the 10(9)$_L$89 (L>=0)\nmotif, and are all PWIs. The lower 2-cycle elements after division of 99 belong\nto the subset of PWBS that are palindromic and consist of 0- and 1-blocks with\na minimal length of two. IDR also has higher p-cycles (p=10,12,71) whose\nelements seem to contain at least one PWI. Another interesting finding about\nIDR is that it contains non-periodic and diverging trajectories, as the integer\nvalues grow to infinity. In these diverging trajectories, while the number of\nflanking digits around the middle point increases by the iteration, the middle\npart has an 8-cycle rhythm or signature which has been found in all diverging\ntrajectories. Overall, the generalization of the original 1089 trick in both\nspace and time leads to new patterns in integers and new phenomenology in\ndynamics.",

In this paper,\nwe present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly\ngenerate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize\nvisual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to\nthe strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual\ninformation, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel\ndynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs DeCo, which adaptively selects the\nappropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the\nfinal layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and\ncan be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and\napplied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks,\ndemonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared\nto baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations.

    "abstract": "Classifying nodes in a graph is a common problem. The ideal classifier must\nadapt to any imbalances in the class distribution. It must also use information\nin the clustering structure of real-world graphs. Existing Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) have not addressed both problems together. We propose the\nEnhanced Cluster-aware Graph Network (ECGN), a novel method that addresses\nthese issues by integrating cluster-specific training with synthetic node\ngeneration. Unlike traditional GNNs that apply the same node update process for\nall nodes, ECGN learns different aggregations for different clusters. We also\nuse the clusters to generate new minority-class nodes in a way that helps\nclarify the inter-class decision boundary. By combining cluster-aware\nembeddings with a global integration step, ECGN enhances the quality of the\nresulting node embeddings. Our method works with any underlying GNN and any\ncluster generation technique. Experimental results show that ECGN consistently\noutperforms its closest competitors by up to 11% on some widely studied\nbenchmark datasets.",

The results show that DHR, a retriever model utilising hierarchical\npassage selection through fine-tuning at both the document and passage levels,\noutperforms traditional methods in retrieving relevant technical information,\nachieving a Top-10 accuracy of 86.2%. Additionally, the Retriever-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) technique, used in the proposed QA system, is evaluated to\ndemonstrate the benefits of using the hybrid dataset and the DHR.

    "abstract": "Underwater vehicles have seen significant development over the past seventy\nyears. However, bio-inspired propulsion robots are still in their early stages\nand require greater interdisciplinary collaboration between biologists and\nroboticists. The octopus, one of the most intelligent marine animals, exhibits\nremarkable abilities such as camouflaging, exploring, and hunting while\nswimming with its arms. Although bio-inspired robotics researchers have aimed\nto replicate these abilities, the complexity of designing an eight-arm bionic\nswimming platform has posed challenges from the beginning. In this work, we\npropose a novel bionic robot swimming platform that combines asymmetric passive\nmorphing arms with an umbrella-like quick-return mechanism. Using only two\nsimple constant-speed motors, this design achieves efficient swimming by\nreplicating octopus-like arm movements and stroke time ratios. The robot\nreached a peak speed of 314 mm/s during its second power stroke. This design\nreduces the complexity of traditional octopus-like swimming robot actuation\nsystems while maintaining good swimming performance. It offers a more\nachievable and efficient platform for biologists and roboticists conducting\nmore profound octopus-inspired robotic and biological studies.",

The detailed analysis of the spectrum of\nGRB 131014A observed by the $Fermi$ gamma ray burst monitor and Large Area\nTelescope has revealed an unconventional spectral shape that significantly\ndeviates from the typical Band function. The spectrum exhibits three\ndistinctive breaks and an extended power law at higher energies. Furthermore,\nthe lower end of the spectrum aligns with power-law indices greater than -0.5,\nand in the brightest region of the burst, these values approach +1. The lowest\nspectral break is thereby found to be consistent with a blackbody. These\nobserved spectral characteristics strongly suggest the radiation process to be\ninverse Compton scattering in an optically thin region. Applying the empirical\nfit parameters for physical modeling, we find that the kinetic energy of the\nGRB jet of bulk Lorentz factor, $\\Gamma \\sim 400$, gets dissipated just above\nthe photosphere, approximately at a radius of $\\sim 10^{14}$ cm.

    "abstract": "Novel optical imaging techniques, such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI)\ncombined with machine learning-based (ML) analysis, have the potential to\nrevolutionize clinical surgical imaging. However, these novel modalities face a\nshortage of large-scale, representative clinical data for training ML\nalgorithms, while preclinical animal data is abundantly available through\nstandardized experiments and allows for controlled induction of pathological\ntissue states, which is not ethically possible in patients. To leverage this\nsituation, we propose a novel concept called \"xeno-learning\", a cross-species\nknowledge transfer paradigm inspired by xeno-transplantation, where organs from\na donor species are transplanted into a recipient species. Using a total of\n13,874 HSI images from humans as well as porcine and rat models, we show that\nalthough spectral signatures of organs differ substantially across species,\nrelative changes resulting from pathologies or surgical manipulation (e.g.,\nmalperfusion; injection of contrast agent) are comparable. Such changes learnt\nin one species can thus be transferred to a new species via a novel\n\"physiology-based data augmentation\" method, enabling the large-scale secondary\nuse of preclinical animal data for humans. The resulting ethical, monetary, and\nperformance benefits promise a high impact of the proposed knowledge transfer\nparadigm on future developments in the field.",

In this paper,\nwe propose DySpec, a faster speculative decoding algorithm with a novel dynamic\ntoken tree structure. We begin by bridging the draft distribution and\nacceptance rate from intuitive and empirical clues, and successfully show that\nthe two variables are strongly correlated. Based on this, we employ a greedy\nstrategy to dynamically expand the token tree at run time. Theoretically, we\nshow that our method can achieve optimal results under mild assumptions.\nEmpirically, DySpec yields a higher acceptance rate and speedup than fixed\ntrees. DySpec can drastically improve the throughput and reduce the latency of\ntoken generation across various data distribution and model sizes, which\nsignificantly outperforms strong competitors, including Specinfer and Sequoia.\nUnder low temperature setting, DySpec can improve the throughput up to\n9.1$\\times$ and reduce the latency up to 9.4$\\times$ on Llama2-70B.

Different from regular MIMO, the XL-MIMO shifts part of the\ncommunication region from the far field to the near field, where the\nspherical-wave channel model cannot be accurately approximated by the\ncommonly-adopted planar-wave channel model. As a result, the well-explored\nfar-field beamspace is unsuitable for near-field communications, thereby\nrequiring the exploration of specialized near-field beamspace. In this article,\nwe investigate the near-field communications for XL-MIMO from the perspective\nof beamspace. Given the spherical wavefront characteristics of the near-field\nchannels, we first map the antenna space to the near-field beamspace with the\nfractional Fourier transform. Then, we divide the near-field beamspace into\nthree parts, including high mainlobe, low mainlobe, and sidelobe, and provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of these components. Based on the analysis, we\ndemonstrate the advantages of the near-field beamspace over the existing\nmethods. Finally, we point out several applications of the near-field beamspace\nand highlight some potential directions for future study in the near-field\nbeamspace.",

    "abstract": "This thesis focuses on three fundamental aspects of biological systems;\nnamely, entropy production, Bayesian mechanics, and the free-energy principle.\nThe contributions are threefold: 1) We compute the entropy production for a\ngreater class of systems than before, including almost any stationary diffusion\nprocess, such as degenerate diffusions where the driving noise does not act on\nall coordinates of the system. Importantly, this class of systems encompasses\nMarkovian approximations of stochastic differential equations driven by colored\nnoise, which is significant since biological systems at the macro- and\nmeso-scale are generally subject to colored fluctuations. 2) We develop a\nBayesian mechanics for biological and physical entities that interact with\ntheir environment in which we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the\ninternal states of something to infer its external states, consistently with\nvariational Bayesian inference in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. 3)\nWe refine the constraints on Bayesian mechanics to obtain a description that is\nmore specific to biological systems, called the free-energy principle. This\nsays that active and internal states of biological systems unfold as minimising\na quantity known as free energy. The mathematical foundation to the free-energy\nprinciple, presented here, unlocks a first principles approach to modeling and\nsimulating behavior in neurobiology and artificial intelligence, by minimising\nfree energy given a generative model of external and sensory states.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) are gas giant planets orbiting close to their host\nstar, with equilibrium temperatures exceeding 2000 K, and among the most\nstudied planets in terms of their atmospheric composition. Thanks to a new\ngeneration of ultra-stable high-resolution spectrographs, it is possible to\ndetect the signal from the individual lines of the species in the exoplanetary\natmospheres. We employed two techniques in this study. First, we used\ntransmission spectroscopy, which involved examining the spectra around single\nlines of FeII. Then we carried out a set of cross-correlation studies for two\nUHJs: KELT-9b and KELT-20b. Both planets orbit fast-rotating stars, which\nresulted in the detection of the strong Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and\ncenter-to-limb variations in the transmission spectrum. These effects had to be\ncorrected to ensure a precise analysis. Using the transmission spectroscopy\nmethod, we detected 21 single lines of FeII in the atmosphere of KELT-9b. All\nof the detected lines are blue-shifted, suggesting strong day-to-night side\natmospheric winds. The cross-correlation method leads to the detection of the\nblue-shifted signal with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 13.46. Our results\nare in agreement with models based on non-local thermodynamical equilibrium\n(NLTE) effects, with a mean micro-turbulence of nu_mic = 2.73 +/- 1.5 km/s and\nmacro-turbulence of nu_mac = 8.22 +/- 3.85 km/s. In the atmosphere of KELT-20b,\nwe detected 17 single lines of FeII. Considering different measurements of the\nsystemic velocity of the system, we conclude that the existence of winds in the\natmosphere of KELT-20b cannot be determined conclusively. The detected signal\nwith the cross-correlation method presents a S/N of 11.51. The results are\nconsistent with NLTE effects, including means of nu_mic = 3.04 +/- 0.35 km/s\nand nu_mac = 6.76 +/- 1.17 km/s.",

When the training and test distributions are\nmismatched, artifacts and hallucinations can occur in reconstructed images due\nto the incorrect priors. In this work, we systematically study out of\ndistribution (OOD) problems where a known training distribution is first\nprovided. We first study the setting where only a single measurement obtained\nfrom the unknown test distribution is available. Next we study the setting\nwhere a very small sample of data belonging to the test distribution is\navailable, and our goal is still to reconstruct an image from a measurement\nthat came from the test distribution. In both settings, we use a patch-based\ndiffusion prior that learns the image distribution solely from patches.\nFurthermore, in the first setting, we include a self-supervised loss that helps\nthe network output maintain consistency with the measurement. Extensive\nexperiments show that in both settings, the patch-based method can obtain high\nquality image reconstructions that can outperform whole-image models and can\ncompete with methods that have access to large in-distribution training\ndatasets. Furthermore, we show how whole-image models are prone to memorization\nand overfitting, leading to artifacts in the reconstructions, while a\npatch-based model can resolve these issues.",

Among other approaches, learning-based warm-starting represents an\nappealing paradigm for solving the trajectory generation problem, effectively\ncombining the benefits of optimization- and data-driven methods. Current\napproaches for learning-based trajectory generation often focus on fixed,\nsingle-scenario environments, where key scene characteristics, such as obstacle\npositions or final-time requirements, remain constant across problem instances.\nHowever, practical trajectory generation requires the scenario to be frequently\nreconfigured, making the single-scenario approach a potentially impractical\nsolution. To address this challenge, we present a novel trajectory generation\nframework that generalizes across diverse problem configurations, by leveraging\nhigh-capacity transformer neural networks capable of learning from multimodal\ndata sources. Specifically, our approach integrates transformer-based neural\nnetwork models into the trajectory optimization process, encoding both\nscene-level information (e.g., obstacle locations, initial and goal states) and\ntrajectory-level constraints (e.g., time bounds, fuel consumption targets) via\nmultimodal representations. The transformer network then generates near-optimal\ninitial guesses for non-convex optimization problems, significantly enhancing\nconvergence speed and performance. The framework is validated through extensive\nsimulations and real-world experiments on a free-flyer platform, achieving up\nto 30% cost improvement and 80% reduction in infeasible cases with respect to\ntraditional approaches, and demonstrating robust generalization across diverse\nscenario variations.",

To accurately simulate real-user clicks, we conducted\na large crowdsourcing study of click patterns in an interactive segmentation\nscenario and collected 475K real-user clicks. Drawing on ideas from saliency\ntasks, we develop a clickability model that enables sampling clicks, which\nclosely resemble actual user inputs. Using our model and dataset, we propose\nRClicks benchmark for a comprehensive comparison of existing interactive\nsegmentation methods on realistic clicks. Specifically, we evaluate not only\nthe average quality of methods, but also the robustness w.r.t. click patterns.\nAccording to our benchmark, in real-world usage interactive segmentation models\nmay perform worse than it has been reported in the baseline benchmark, and most\nof the methods are not robust. We believe that RClicks is a significant step\ntowards creating interactive segmentation methods that provide the best user\nexperience in real-world cases.",

We first analyze 24 industry reports to\nextract trends and (in)consistencies across observations by commercial\nstakeholders in 2022. We then analyze ten data sets spanning industry and\nacademic sources, across four years (2019-2023), to find and explain\ndiscrepancies based on data sources, vantage points, methods, and parameters.\nOur method includes a new approach: we share an aggregated list of DDoS targets\nwith industry players who return the results of joining this list with their\nproprietary data sources to reveal gaps in visibility of the academic data\nsources. We use academic data sources to explore an industry-reported relative\ndrop in spoofed reflection-amplification attacks in 2021-2022. Our study\nillustrates the value, but also the challenge, in independent validation of\nsecurity-related properties of Internet infrastructure. Finally, we reflect on\nopportunities to facilitate greater common understanding of the DDoS landscape.\nWe hope our results inform not only future academic and industry pursuits but\nalso emerging policy efforts to reduce systemic Internet security\nvulnerabilities.",

Each BS is equipped with a set of cameras, such that it\ncan collect a small number of labeled CSI, a large number of unlabeled CSI, and\nthe images taken by cameras. To exploit the unlabeled CSI data and position\nlabels obtained from images, we design an meta-learning based hard\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Specifically, since we do not know the\ncorresponding relationship between unlabeled CSI and the multiple vehicle\nlocations in images, we formulate the calculation of the training objective as\na minimum matching problem. To reduce the impact of label noises caused by\nincorrect matching between unlabeled CSI and vehicle locations obtained from\nimages and achieve better convergence, we introduce a weighted loss function on\nthe unlabeled datasets, and study the use of a meta-learning algorithm for\ncomputing the weighted loss. Subsequently, the model parameters are updated\naccording to the weighted loss function of unlabeled CSI samples and their\nmatched position labels obtained from images. Simulation results show that the\nproposed method can reduce the positioning error by up to 61% compared to a\nbaseline that does not use images and uses only CSI fingerprint for vehicle\npositioning.",

The nature of the spherical\nBessel functions includes a long asymptotic oscillatory tail at large radii,\nnot conducive to applications where a tight concentration of wave amplitude\naround a ring is desired, for example in toroidal configurations. However, we\nhave found that certain practical bandpass spectral shapes, centered around a\npeak frequency, can create a superposition of spherical Bessel functions that\neffectively concentrate the wave amplitude around a defined ring at the time\ninstant of coherent addition, avoiding the long tail asymptotic oscillations of\nthe single frequency solution. Theoretical solutions are shown for different\nbandpass spectra applied to the spherical Bessel functions, along with\nnumerical solutions of transient wave propagation using practical hemispherical\nsource shapes.

We derive the macroscale response of the\ncomposite using systematic multiple scales homomgenisation by exploiting the\ndisparity in lengthscales associated with the size of an electrode particle and\nthe electrode as a whole. The resulting effective model accurately replicates\nthe behaviour of the original model (as is demonstrated by a series of relevant\ncase studies) but, crucially, is markedly {simpler and hence} cheaper to solve.\nThis is significant practical value because it facilitates low-cost, realistic\ncomputations of the mechanical states of battery electrodes, thereby allowing\nmodel-assisted development of battery designs that are better able to withstand\nthe mechanical abuse encountered in practice and ultimately paving the way for\nlonger-lasting batteries.",

As a pure-parallel\ncomplement to the Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential\nStandards (ULLYSES) survey, Scylla obtained 342 orbits of ultraviolet (UV)\nthrough near-infrared (IR) imaging of the LMC and SMC with Wide Field Camera 3.\nIn this paper, we describe the science objectives, observing strategy, data\nreduction procedure, and initial results from our photometric analysis of 96\nobserved fields. Although our observations were constrained by ULYSSES primary\nexposures, we imaged all fields in at least two filters (F475W and F814W), and\n64% of fields in at least three and as many as seven WFC3 filters spanning the\nUV to IR. Overall, we reach average 50% completeness of $m_{\\rm F225W}=26.0$,\n$m_{\\rm F275W}=26.2$, $m_{\\rm F336W}=26.9$, $m_{\\rm F475W}=27.8$, $m_{\\rm\nF814W}=25.5$, $m_{\\rm F110W}=24.7$, and $m_{\\rm F160W}=24.0$ Vega magnitudes in\nour photometric catalogs, which is faintward of the ancient main sequence\nturnoff in all filters. The primary science goals of Scylla include\ncharacterizing the structure and properties of dust in the MCs, as well as\ntheir spatially-resolved star formation and chemical enrichment histories.

To reduce LLMs' reliance on external sources, we\npropose BridG MT, a method that combines Sentence Bridging, which generates a\nsequence of sentences as a bridge that gradually transition from\neasy-to-translate to more difficult, and Gradual MT, which sequentially\ntranslates these sentences using earlier translations as few-shot examples for\nsubsequent ones.

The item's quality is the seller's private\ninformation, and the buyer's valuation of the item depends on both the quality\nand the buyer's type. The mediator, who is uninformed about the private\ninformation of both the seller and buyer, aims to design a mechanism that\nelicits and reveals information to facilitate communication between two agents.\nThe mediator can also charge a fee for providing such services.\n  In this work, we study the problem of designing mechanisms that maximize\nrevenue for the mediator. We formulate this mechanism design problem as an\noptimization problem that involves non-linear constraints. Interestingly, under\nthe monotone hazard rate assumption, we can bypass this issue by considering a\nrelaxed problem and showing that the solution to the relaxed problem remains\noptimal to the original one. In optimal mechanisms, the mediator directly\nrecommends whether to trade after eliciting the agents' types. The mediator\nprivately offers a price to each agent if a trade is recommended. The optimal\nmechanism adopts a threshold information structure, i.e., it only reveals to\nthe agent whether the other agent's type exceeds a certain threshold. The\noptimal payment function of buyer is monotone decreasing to their type, which\ndiffers from most existing works.

Our\nkey contribution lies in bridging classical graphics techniques, such as\nmesh-based deformation, with modern Gaussian primitives, achieving\nstate-of-the-art geometry reconstruction and rendering quality. Unlike previous\navatar rendering approaches, SurFhead enables efficient reconstruction driven\nby Gaussian primitives while preserving high-fidelity geometry.",

    "abstract": "The distributed nature of cellular networks is one of the main enablers for\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC). For target positioning and\ntracking, making use of bistatic measurements is non-trivial due to their\nnon-linear relationship with Cartesian coordinates. Most of the literature\nproposes geometric-based methods to determine the target's location by solving\na well-defined set of equations stemming from the available measurements. The\nerror covariance to be used for Bayesian tracking is then derived from local\nTaylor expansions. In our work we adaptively fuse any subset of bistatic\nmeasurements using a maximum likelihood (ML) framework, allowing to incorporate\nevery possible combination of available measurements, i.e., transmitter angle,\nreceiver angle and bistatic range. Moreover, our ML approach is intrinsically\nflexible, as it can be extended to fuse an arbitrary number of measurements by\nmultistatic setups. Finally, we propose both a fixed and dynamic way to compute\nthe covariance matrix for the position error to be fed to Bayesian tracking\ntechniques, like a Kalman filter. Numerical evaluations with realistic cellular\ncommunications parameters at mmWave frequencies show that our proposal\noutperforms the considered baselines, achieving a location and velocity root\nmean square error of 0.25 m and 0.83 m/s, respectively.",

However, the generators and extractors of existing GS methods can\nonly target specific formats and types of data and lack of universality.\nBesides, the model size is usually related to the underlying grid resolution,\nand the transmission behavior of the extractor is susceptible to suspicion of\nsteganalysis. Implicit neural representation(INR) is a technique for\nrepresenting data in a continuous manner. Inspired by this, we propose an\nINR-based generative steganography by point cloud representation (INR-GSPC). By\nusing the function generator, the problem of the generator model size growing\nexponentially with the increase of gridded data has been solved. That is able\nto generate a wide range of data types and break through the limitation of\nresolution. In order to unify the data formats of the generator and message\nextractor, the data is converted to point cloud representation. We designed and\nfixed a point cloud message extractor.

    "abstract": "Convection-diffusion-reaction equations are a class of second-order partial\ndifferential equations widely used to model phenomena involving the change of\nconcentration/population of one or more substances/species distributed in\nspace. Understanding and preserving their stability properties in numerical\nsimulation is crucial for accurate predictions, system analysis, and\ndecision-making. This work presents a comprehensive framework for constructing\nfully discrete Lyapunov-consistent discretizations of any order for\nconvection-diffusion-reaction models. We introduce a systematic methodology for\nconstructing discretizations that mimic the stability analysis of the\ncontinuous model using Lyapunov's direct method. The spatial algorithms are\nbased on collocated discontinuous Galerkin methods with the summation-by-parts\nproperty and the simultaneous approximation terms approach for imposing\ninterface coupling and boundary conditions. Relaxation Runge-Kutta schemes are\nused to integrate in time and achieve fully discrete Lyapunov consistency. To\nverify the properties of the new schemes, we numerically solve a system of\nconvection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equations governing the\ndynamic evolution of monomer and dimer concentrations during the dimerization\nprocess. Numerical results demonstrated the accuracy and consistency of the\nproposed discretizations. The new framework can enable further advancements in\nthe analysis, control, and understanding of general\nconvection-diffusion-reaction systems.",

This knowledge limits the accuracy and\nprecision of mass estimation, a key parameter for such studies. In this paper,\nwe conduct an in-depth analysis of cluster ACT-CL J0240.0+0116 using a\nmulti-wavelength approach, with a primary focus on high angular resolution\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) thermal component observations obtained under the NIKA2\nSunyaev-Zeldovich Large Programme (LPSZ). We create composite images using\nNIKA2, X-ray, and optical galaxy number density maps. The results reveal\ndistinct signs of disturbance within the cluster with the distributions of gas\nand member galaxies that do not overlap. We also find suggestions of an inflow\nof matter onto the cluster from the southwestern direction. Ultimately, we\nclassify the cluster as disturbed, using morphological indicators derived from\nits SZ, X-ray, and optical image. The cluster SZ signal is also contaminated by\na strong central point source. We adopt different approaches to handling this\ncontaminant and find the estimates of our pressure and hydrostatic mass\nprofiles robust to the point source mitigation model. The cluster hydrostatic\nmass is estimated at $4.25^{+0.50}_{-0.45\\, } \\times 10^{14}\n\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ for the case where the point source was masked. These\nvalues are consistent with the mass estimated using only X-ray data and with\nthose from previous SZ studies of the Atacama cosmology telescope (ACT) survey,\nwith improved precision on the mass estimate. Our findings strongly suggest\nthat ACT-CL J0240.0+0116 is a disturbed cluster system, and the detailed\nobservations and derived values serve as a compelling case study for the\ncapabilities of the LPSZ in mapping the cluster ICM with high precision.",

    "abstract": "Recent RGB-guided depth super-resolution methods have achieved impressive\nperformance under the assumption of fixed and known degradation (e.g., bicubic\ndownsampling). However, in real-world scenarios, captured depth data often\nsuffer from unconventional and unknown degradation due to sensor limitations\nand complex imaging environments (e.g., low reflective surfaces, varying\nillumination). Consequently, the performance of these methods significantly\ndeclines when real-world degradation deviate from their assumptions. In this\npaper, we propose the Degradation Oriented and Regularized Network (DORNet), a\nnovel framework designed to adaptively address unknown degradation in\nreal-world scenes through implicit degradation representations. Our approach\nbegins with the development of a self-supervised degradation learning strategy,\nwhich models the degradation representations of low-resolution depth data using\nrouting selection-based degradation regularization. To facilitate effective\nRGB-D fusion, we further introduce a degradation-oriented feature\ntransformation module that selectively propagates RGB content into the depth\ndata based on the learned degradation priors. Extensive experimental results on\nboth real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DORNet in\nhandling unknown degradation, outperforming existing methods.

To address these issues, we propose Rule-guided\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation with LMs, which explicitly introduces rules for\nin-context learning (RuleRAG-ICL) to guide retrievers to recall related\ndocuments in the directions of rules and uniformly guide generators to reason\nattributed by the same rules. Moreover, most existing RAG datasets were\nconstructed without considering rules and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are recognized\nas providing high-quality rules. Therefore, we construct five rule-aware RAG\nbenchmarks for QA, RuleQA, based on KGs to stress the significance of retrieval\nand reasoning with rules. Experiments on RuleQA demonstrate RuleRAG-ICL\nimproves the retrieval quality of +89.2% in Recall@10 and answer accuracy of\n+103.1% in Exact Match, and RuleRAG-FT yields more enhancement.

For VisualRWKV-HD, we developed a lossless\ndownsampling method to effectively integrate a high-resolution vision encoder\nwith low-resolution encoders, without extending the input sequence length. For\nthe VisualRWKV-UHD model, we enhanced image representation by dividing the\nimage into four segments, which are then recombined with the original image.\nThis technique allows the model to incorporate both high-resolution and\nlow-resolution features, effectively balancing coarse and fine-grained\ninformation. As a result, the model supports resolutions up to 4096 x 4096\npixels, offering a more detailed and comprehensive visual processing\ncapability.

    "abstract": "Hot subdwarf (SD) stars are the stripped cores of red giant stars in\ntransition to the white dwarf sequence. The B-type subdwarfs (sdB) are powered\nby helium fusion in the core, more evolved ones (sdO) by shell burning. Low\nmass SDs may evolve through this stage without any support by nuclear fusion.\nBecause the loss of the giants' envelopes is likely caused by mass transfer in\nbinaries, hot SDs are test beds for close-binary evolution through stable and\nunstable Roche lobe overflow, common envelope formation and ejection as well as\nmergers. Many classes of hot SDs can be identified according to surface\ncomposition, binarity, magnetism, pulsation characteristics and population\nmembership, including members of globular clusters. Observed binaries show a\nwide spread of orbital periods from 20 minutes to more than 1,000 days with\nwhite dwarf or main sequence companions. The closest systems qualify as type Ia\nsupernova progenitors and LISA detectable gravitational wave sources.\nHigh-precision light curves from Kepler and TESS combined with radial velocity\ncurves are used to derive masses, while asteroseismology adds information on\nthe internal structure, slow rotation, and synchronization. Gaia's parallax\nmeasurements now allow us to place the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\nand derive stellar parameters by combining them with multi-band photometry. The\nstellar radius can be determined to high precision this way. Newton's law can\nthen be used to derive masses if accurate surface gravities are available.\nLarge-scale spectroscopic surveys will provide atmospheric parameters for large\nsamples of stars, allowing the mass distributions for the diverse subtypes to\nbe established. These are crucial for testing binary synthesis models and\nconstraining poorly known parameters such as the common envelope efficiency as\nwell as the critical threshold mass-ratio for mass transfer stability.",

The proposed HexOpt method takes\nas input a surface triangular mesh and a volumetric all-hex mesh. A constrained\noptimization problem is formulated to improve mesh quality using a novel\nfunction that combines Jacobian and scaled Jacobian metrics which are rectified\nand scaled to quadratic measures, while preserving the surface geometry. This\noptimization problem is solved using the augmented Lagrangian (AL) method,\nwhere the Lagrangian terms enforce the constraint that surface points must\nremain on the triangular mesh. Specifically, corner points stay exactly at the\ncorner, edge points are confined to the edges, and face points are free to move\nacross the surface. To take the advantage of the Quasi-Newton method while\ntackling the high-dimensional variable problem, the\nLimited-Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm is employed. The\nstep size for each iteration is determined by the Armijo line search. Coupled\nwith smart Laplacian smoothing, HexOpt has demonstrated robustness and\nefficiency, successfully applying to 3D models and hex meshes generated by\ndifferent methods without requiring any manual intervention or parameter\nadjustment.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Transformer Layer Injection (TLI), a novel method\nfor efficiently upscaling large language models (LLMs) while minimizing\ncomputational costs and maintaining model performance. Model scale is a key\nfactor in enhancing the quality of machine learning models, and TLI addresses\nthe challenge of scaling by reducing initial loss, minimizing fine-tuning\nrequirements, and preserving model complexity. Our approach improves upon the\nconventional Depth Up-Scaling (DUS) technique by injecting new layers into\nevery set of K layers, enabling hidden representations to pass through\ntransformer blocks with minimal disruption. We compare TLI with existing\napproaches, including Mixture of Experts (MoE) and DUS, and validate its\nefficiency through experiments on small LLMs (LLama3 1B, 3B, and 8B). Results\nshow that TLI achieves better initialization, requires fewer training steps,\nand delivers superior accuracy on tasks such as KoBEST and KMCQA, with models\nperforming effectively even without additional training. TLI is demonstrated to\nbe both data-efficient and cost-effective, significantly outperforming existing\nmethods. Its scalability and simplicity make it a promising solution for\nupscaling transformer-based models, with potential applications in scaling\nmodels from 10B to 405B parameters.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success in perfect information\ngames such as Go and Atari, enabling agents to compete at the highest levels\nagainst human players. However, research in reinforcement learning for\nimperfect information games has been relatively limited due to the more complex\ngame structures and randomness. Traditional methods face challenges in training\nand improving performance in imperfect information games due to issues like\ninaccurate Q value estimation and reward sparsity. In this paper, we focus on\nUno, an imperfect information game, and aim to address these problems by\nreducing Q value overestimation and reshaping reward function. We propose a\nnovel algorithm that utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search to average the value\nestimations in Q function. Even though we choose Double Deep Q Learning as the\nfoundational framework in this paper, our method can be generalized and used in\nany algorithm which needs Q value estimation, such as the Actor-Critic.\nAdditionally, we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to reshape the reward structure\nin the game environment. We compare our algorithm with several traditional\nmethods applied to games such as Double Deep Q Learning, Deep Monte Carlo and\nNeural Fictitious Self Play, and the experiments demonstrate that our algorithm\nconsistently outperforms these approaches, especially as the number of players\nin Uno increases, indicating a higher level of difficulty.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, $b$-symplectic manifolds have become important structures in\nthe study of symplectic geometry, serving as Poisson manifolds that retain\nsymplectic properties away from a hypersurface. Inspired by this rich\nlandscape, $E$-structures were introduced by Nest and Tsygan in \\cite{NT2} as a\ncomprehensive framework for exploring generalizations of $b$-structures. This\npaper initiates a deeper investigation into their Poisson facets, building on\nfoundational work by \\cite{MS21}. We also examine the closely related concept\nof almost regular Poisson manifolds, as studied in \\cite{AZ17}, which reveals a\nnatural Poisson groupoid associated with these structures.\n  In this article, we investigate the intricate relationship between\n$E$-structures and almost regular Poisson structures. Our comparative analysis\nnot only scrutinizes their Poisson properties but also offers explicit formulae\nfor the Poisson structure on the Poisson groupoid associated to the\n$E$-structures as both Poisson manifolds and singular foliations. In doing so,\nwe reveal an interesting link between the existence of commutative frames and\nDarboux-Carath\\'eodory-type expressions for the relevant structures.",

Non-universal adversarial attacks,\nwhile effective, are often impractical for real-time online applications due to\ntheir high computational demands per data instance. Recently, universal\nadversarial perturbations (UAPs) have been introduced as a solution, but\nexisting generator-based UAP methods are significantly time-consuming.

    "abstract": "By enabling capturing of 3D point clouds that reflect the geometry of the\nimmediate environment, LiDAR has emerged as a primary sensor for autonomous\nsystems. If a LiDAR scan is too sparse, occluded by obstacles, or too small in\nrange, enhancing the point cloud scan by while respecting the geometry of the\nscene is useful for downstream tasks. Motivated by the explosive growth of\ninterest in generative methods in vision, conditional LiDAR generation is\nstarting to take off. This paper proposes a novel simultaneous diffusion\nsampling methodology to generate point clouds conditioned on the 3D structure\nof the scene as seen from multiple views. The key idea is to impose multi-view\ngeometric constraints on the generation process, exploiting mutual information\nfor enhanced results. Our method begins by recasting the input scan to multiple\nnew viewpoints around the scan, thus creating multiple synthetic LiDAR scans.\nThen, the synthetic and input LiDAR scans simultaneously undergo conditional\ngeneration according to our methodology. Results show that our method can\nproduce accurate and geometrically consistent enhancements to point cloud\nscans, allowing it to outperform existing methods by a large margin in a\nvariety of benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Band structures of electrons in a periodic potential are well-known to host\ntopologies that impact their behaviors at edges and interfaces. The concept\nhowever is more general than the single-electron setting. In this work, we\nconsider topology of plasmons in a two-dimensional metal, subject to a\nunidirectional periodicity. We show how the plasmon modes and wavefunctions may\nbe computed for such a periodic system, by focusing on the confined, quantized\nphoton degrees of freedom associated with the plasmon modes. At low frequencies\nthe plasmons disperse with wavevector as $\\sqrt{q}$; however at higher\nfrequencies one finds a series of bands and gaps in the spectrum. For a\nunidirectional periodic electron density with inversion symmetry, we show that\neach band hosts a Zak phase $\\gamma_n$ which may only take the values $0$ or\n$\\pi$. Each gap has a topological index $\\nu$ that is determined by the sum of\nthe Zak phases below it. When the system has an interface with the vacuum, one\nfinds in-gap modes for gaps with non-trivial topologies, which are confined to\nthe interface. In addition, interfaces between systems that are the same except\nfor their topologies -- which can be created by a defect in the lattice in\nwhich half a unit cell has been removed -- host in-gap, confined states when\nthe topological indices of the relevant gaps are different. We demonstrate\nthese properties numerically by analyzing a Kronig-Penney-type model in\ngraphene, in which the electron density is piecewise constant, modulating\nbetween two different densities. In addition, we consider a related plasmon\nsystem modeled after the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. We show that the\ntopological phase diagram of the lowest energy bands is highly analogous to\nthat of the SSH tight-binding system.",

To bridge the gap between MLLMs\nand low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks:\nvideo question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward\nmodeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data\ngeneration pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge\nand multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the\ngenerated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink\nbenchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models:\nAPI-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based\nMLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform\npoorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These\nfindings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements\nto be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI.

An\nultra-relativistic positron beam is directed diagonally into the crystal and\npropagates along the (110) planes.

In light of this progress, it\nis crucial to expand the parameter space of simulations used to infer\nastrophysical properties from this signal. In this work, we explore the role of\ncosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the matter\nclustering amplitude $\\sigma_8$, whose values as provided by measurements at\ndifferent redshifts are in tension. We run $N$-body simulations using GADGET-4,\nand post-process them with the reionization simulation code POLAR, that uses\nL-GALAXIES to include galaxy formation and evolution properties and GRIZZLY to\nexecute 1-D radiative transfer of ionizing photons in the intergalactic medium\n(IGM). We compare our results with the latest JWST observations and explore\nwhich astrophysical properties for different cosmologies are necessary to match\nthe observed UV luminosity functions at redshifts $z = 10$ and $9$.\nAdditionally, we explore the impact of these parameters on the observed 21-cm\nsignal power spectrum, focusing on the redshifts within the range of LOFAR\n21-cm signal observations ($z \\approx 8.5-10$). Despite differences in\ncosmological and astrophysical parameters, our models cannot be ruled out by\nthe current upper limits.

On the other hand, Federated Learning (FL) solves this problem by\nenabling distributed model training, addressing privacy concerns, and\nminimizing data transmission. This study explores using FL for anomaly\ndetection in industrial and civil construction machinery architectures that use\nIIoT prototypes with LoRaWAN communication. The process leverages an optimized\nautoencoder neural network structure and compares federated models with\ncentralized ones. Despite uneven data distribution among machine clients, FL\ndemonstrates effectiveness, with a mean F1 score (of 94.77), accuracy (of\n92.30), TNR (of 90.65), and TPR (92.93), comparable to centralized models,\nconsidering airtime of trainning messages of 52.8 min. Local model evaluations\non each machine highlight adaptability. At the same time, the performed\nanalysis identifies message requirements, minimum training hours, and optimal\nround/epoch configurations for FL in LoRaWAN, guiding future implementations in\nconstrained industrial environments.",

    "abstract": "Stellar ultraviolet (UV) emission serves as a crucial indicator for\nestimating magnetic activity and evaluating the habitability of exoplanets\norbiting stars. In this paper, we present a straightforward method to derive\nstellar photospheric UV emission for F to M main-sequence stars. By using\nPARSEC models, we establish relations between near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV)\nmagnitudes from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), NUV magnitudes from the\nChina Space Station Telescope, and stellar effective temperatures and Gaia\nBP$-$RP color for different metallicities. Together with the observed sample,\nwe find that for NUV emission, the photospheric contribution to the observed\nflux is less than 20% for M stars, around 10% to 70% for G stars, and ranges\nfrom 30% to 85% for G and F stars. For FUV emission, the photospheric\ncontribution is less than $10^{-6}$ for M stars, below $10^{-4}$ for K stars,\naround $10^{-4}$ to 10% for G stars, and between 6% and 50% for F stars. Our\nwork enables the simple and effective determination of stellar excess UV\nemission and the exploration of magnetic activity.",

    "abstract": "Estimating depth from a single 2D image is a challenging task due to the lack\nof stereo or multi-view data, which are typically required for depth\nperception. In state-of-the-art architectures, the main challenge is to\nefficiently capture complex objects and fine-grained details, which are often\ndifficult to predict. This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based\napproach using an enhanced encoder-decoder architecture, where the\nInception-ResNet-v2 model serves as the encoder. This is the first instance of\nutilizing Inception-ResNet-v2 as an encoder for monocular depth estimation,\ndemonstrating improved performance over previous models. It incorporates\nmulti-scale feature extraction to enhance depth prediction accuracy across\nvarious object sizes and distances. We propose a composite loss function\ncomprising depth loss, gradient edge loss, and Structural Similarity Index\nMeasure (SSIM) loss, with fine-tuned weights to optimize the weighted sum,\nensuring a balance across different aspects of depth estimation. Experimental\nresults on the KITTI dataset show that our model achieves a significantly\nfaster inference time of 0.019 seconds, outperforming vision transformers in\nefficiency while maintaining good accuracy. On the NYU Depth V2 dataset, the\nmodel establishes state-of-the-art performance, with an Absolute Relative Error\n(ARE) of 0.064, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.228, and an accuracy of\n89.3% for $\\delta$ < 1.25. These metrics demonstrate that our model can\naccurately and efficiently predict depth even in challenging scenarios,\nproviding a practical solution for real-time applications.",

Systematic\ndiscussions of distinctive singular behaviors are made to classify various\ntypes of QPT from one SN state to the other SN state in using the Wigner-Yanase\nskew information (WYSI), the bipartite entanglement entropy (BEE), and the\nquadrupole moments (QMs). For the spin-1 system with the three uniaxial SN\nphases, we find that a discontinuous QPT, signaled by discontinuous behaviors\nof all the considered WYSI, BEE, and QMs, occurs from the z-ferroquadrupole\nphase (FQP) to the x- or y-FQPs, while a continuous QPT occurs between the x-\nand y-FQPs. The central charge in the continuous QPT line is estimated as $c\n\\simeq 1$ from the BEE. Compared to the spin-1 system, depending on a given\nstrength of the uniaxial-type single-ion anisotropy, the spin-2 system\nundergoes four different types of QPTs between the two biaxial SN phases as the\nrhombic-type anisotropy varies: the quantum crossovers, connecting the two\northogonal biaxial SN states adiabatically without an explicit phase\ntransition, the continuous and the discontinuous QPTs, and the SN to magnetic\ntransitions via the antiferromagnetic phase (AFP). In a sharp contrast to the\nspin-1 system, for the transitions between the two biaxial SN phases, the\ndiscontinuous transition line is classified as a topological phase\ncharacterized by a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum and a string order\nparameter defined by the Cartan generator of the $\\mathrm{SO}(5)$ symmetry\ngroup in spin-2 systems, while the continuous QPT is advocated by the central\ncharge $c \\simeq 1$. Whereas the QPT lines with $c \\simeq 1/2$ indicate that\nthe transition between the biaxial SN phase and the AFP belongs to the Ising\nuniversality class.",

However, the established\nentropy-based bounds tend to be loose, making it difficult to accurately\nestimate the minimum time for evolution. In this research, we have combined the\nknowledge of the entropy-based speed limits with that of the resource theory of\nasymmetry (RTA) and provided much stricter inequalities. Our results show that\nthe limitation on the change rate of states and expectation values can be\ndivided into two parts: quantum coherence for energy (i.e., asymmetry)\ncontributed by the system and the heat bath and the classical\nentropy-increasing effect from the bath. As a result, our inequalities\ndemonstrate that the difference in the speed of evolution between classical and\nquantum open systems, i.e., the quantum enhancement in speed, is determined by\nthe quantum Fisher information, which measures quantum fluctuations of energy\nand serves as a standard resource measure in the resource theory of asymmetry.\nWe further show that a similar relation holds for the rate of change of\nexpectation values of physical quantities.",

    "abstract": "A key component in developing atrial digital twins (ADT) - virtual\nrepresentations of patients' atria - is the accurate prescription of myocardial\nfibers which are essential for the tissue characterization. Due to the\ndifficulty of reconstructing atrial fibers from medical imaging, a widely used\nstrategy for fiber generation in ADT relies on mathematical models. Existing\nmethodologies utilze semi-automatic approaches, are tailored to specific\nmorphologies, and lack rigorous validation against imaging fiber data. In this\nstudy, we introduce a novel atrial Laplace-Dirichlet-Rule-Based Method (LDRBM)\nfor prescribing highly detailed myofiber orientations and providing robust\nregional annotation in bi-atrial morphologies of any complexity. The robustness\nof our approach is verified in eight extremely detailed bi-atrial geometries,\nderived from a sub-millimiter Diffusion-Tensor-Magnetic-Resonance Imaging\n(DTMRI) human atrial fiber dataset. We validate the LDRBM by quantitatively\nrecreating each of the DTMRI fiber architectures: a comprehensive comparison\nwith DTMRI ground truth data is conducted, investigating differences between\nelectrophysiology (EP) simulations provided by either LDRBM and DTMRI fibers.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the novel LDRBM outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art fiber models, confirming the exceptional accuracy of our\nmethodology and the critical importance of incorporating detailed fiber\norientations in EP simulations. Ultimately, this work represents a fundamental\nstep toward the development of physics-based digital twins of the human atria,\nestablishing a new standard for prescribing fibers in ADT.",

    "abstract": "Contact-rich manipulation plays an important role in human daily activities,\nbut uncertain parameters pose significant challenges for robots to achieve\ncomparable performance through planning and control. To address this issue,\ndomain adaptation and domain randomization have been proposed for robust policy\nlearning. However, they either lose the generalization ability across diverse\ninstances or perform conservatively due to neglecting instance-specific\ninformation. In this paper, we propose a bi-level approach to learn robust\nmanipulation primitives, including parameter-augmented policy learning using\nmultiple models, and parameter-conditioned policy retrieval through domain\ncontraction.

We apply this model to analyze the Roberge-Weiss\ntransition.

When the temperature T is lower than the Roberge-Weiss\ntransition temperature TRW, the torus shrinks smoothly to the one-dimensional\nobject at the Roberge-Weiss transition point, but the discontinuity does not\nappear. On the other hand, the discontinuity of the geometrical object appears\nwhen T>TRW. We also calculate the modulus of the torus and transform it into\nthe fundamental region.

By capturing hidden patterns and underlying structures within data,\ndeep learning has improved performance across various NLP tasks, overcoming the\nlimitations of rule-based systems. However, most research and development in\nNLP has been concentrated on a select few languages, primarily those with large\nnumbers of speakers or financial significance, leaving many others\nunderexplored. This lack of research is often attributed to the scarcity of\nadequately annotated datasets essential for training deep learning models.\nDespite this challenge, there is potential in leveraging the linguistic\nsimilarities between unexplored and well-studied languages, particularly those\nin close geographic and linguistic proximity. This thesis investigates the\napplication of transfer learning for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging between Hindi\nand Nepali, two highly similar languages belonging to the Indo-Aryan language\nfamily. Specifically, the work explores whether joint training of a POS tagging\nmodel for both languages enhances performance. Additionally, we assess whether\nmultitask learning in Hindi, with auxiliary tasks such as gender and\nsingular/plural tagging, can contribute to improved POS tagging accuracy. The\ndeep learning architecture employed is the BLSTM-CNN-CRF model, trained under\ndifferent conditions: monolingual word embeddings, vector-mapped embeddings,\nand jointly trained Hindi-Nepali word embeddings. Varying dropout rates (0.25\nto 0.5) and optimizers (ADAM and AdaDelta) are also evaluated.

The ozone scheme uses simplified\nphotochemical modules to represent the impact of both gas-phase and\nheterogeneous reactions throughout polar ozone depletion events. The study\nshows that during the Boreal and Austral spring seasons, the predictability of\nthe total ozone column exceeds 10 days and is comparable to the predictability\nof large-scale weather variables. It also demonstrates that over both polar\nregions, the inclusion of ozone radiative coupling has a significant impact on\nthe temperature and wind distributions throughout the stratosphere. Over\nAntarctica, the ozone coupled forecasts are systematically colder at all lead\ntimes, which helps eliminate a temperature bias present in the model using\nclimatological ozone. The strength of the polar vortex also increases\nsignificantly throughout the lower stratosphere, in better agreement with zonal\nwind analyses.

It can be observed that\nmodality gap mainly lies in the image style difference. In this work, we\npropose a novel Coupled Knowledge Distillation framework called CKD, which\npursues common styles of different modalities to break modality gap, for high\nperformance RGBT tracking. In particular, we introduce two student networks and\nemploy the style distillation loss to make their style features consistent as\nmuch as possible. Through alleviating the style difference of two student\nnetworks, we can break modality gap of different modalities well. However, the\ndistillation of style features might harm to the content representations of two\nmodalities in student networks. To handle this issue, we take original RGB and\nTIR networks as the teachers, and distill their content knowledge into two\nstudent networks respectively by the style-content orthogonal feature\ndecoupling scheme. We couple the above two distillation processes in an online\noptimization framework to form new feature representations of RGB and thermal\nmodalities without modality gap. In addition, we design a masked modeling\nstrategy and a multi-modal candidate token elimination strategy into CKD to\nimprove tracking robustness and efficiency respectively.

    "abstract": "The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a critical parameter to understand ecosystem\nhealth and vegetation dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel method for\npixel-wise LAI prediction by leveraging the complementary information from\nSentinel 1 radar data and Sentinel 2 multi-spectral data at multiple\ntimestamps. Our approach uses a deep neural network based on multiple U-nets\ntailored specifically to this task. To handle the complexity of the different\ninput modalities, it is comprised of several modules that are pre-trained\nseparately to represent all input data in a common latent space. Then, we\nfine-tune them end-to-end with a common decoder that also takes into account\nseasonality, which we find to play an important role. Our method achieved 0.06\nRMSE and 0.93 R2 score on publicly available data. We make our contributions\navailable at https://github.com/valentingol/LeafNothingBehind for future works\nto further improve on our current progress.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, imitation learning has made progress in the field of robotic\nmanipulation. However, it still faces challenges when addressing complex\nlong-horizon tasks with deformable objects, such as high-dimensional state\nspaces, complex dynamics, and multimodal action distributions. Traditional\nimitation learning methods often require a large amount of data and encounter\ndistributional shifts and accumulative errors in these tasks. To address these\nissues, we propose a data-efficient general learning framework (DeformPAM)\nbased on preference learning and reward-guided action selection. DeformPAM\ndecomposes long-horizon tasks into multiple action primitives, utilizes 3D\npoint cloud inputs and diffusion models to model action distributions, and\ntrains an implicit reward model using human preference data. During the\ninference phase, the reward model scores multiple candidate actions, selecting\nthe optimal action for execution, thereby reducing the occurrence of anomalous\nactions and improving task completion quality. Experiments conducted on three\nchallenging real-world long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Results show that DeformPAM\nimproves both task completion quality and efficiency compared to baseline\nmethods even with limited data.

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning is expected to boost model performance by integrating\ninformation from different modalities. However, its potential is not fully\nexploited because the widely-used joint training strategy, which has a uniform\nobjective for all modalities, leads to imbalanced and under-optimized uni-modal\nrepresentations. Specifically, we point out that there often exists modality\nwith more discriminative information, e.g., vision of playing football and\nsound of blowing wind. They could dominate the joint training process,\nresulting in other modalities being significantly under-optimized. To alleviate\nthis problem, we first analyze the under-optimized phenomenon from both the\nfeed-forward and the back-propagation stages during optimization. Then,\nOn-the-fly Prediction Modulation (OPM) and On-the-fly Gradient Modulation (OGM)\nstrategies are proposed to modulate the optimization of each modality, by\nmonitoring the discriminative discrepancy between modalities during training.\nConcretely, OPM weakens the influence of the dominant modality by dropping its\nfeature with dynamical probability in the feed-forward stage, while OGM\nmitigates its gradient in the back-propagation stage. In experiments, our\nmethods demonstrate considerable improvement across a variety of multimodal\ntasks. These simple yet effective strategies not only enhance performance in\nvanilla and task-oriented multimodal models, but also in more complex\nmultimodal tasks, showcasing their effectiveness and flexibility.

Although\nthere are many defense methods to achieve backdoor detection for DNN inputs and\nbackdoor elimination for DNN models, they still have not presented a clear\nexplanation of the relationship between these two missions. In this paper, we\nuse the features from the middle layer of the DNN model to analyze the\ndifference between backdoor and benign samples and propose Backdoor\nConsistency, which indicates that at least one backdoor exists in the DNN model\nif the backdoor trigger is detected exactly on input. By analyzing the middle\nfeatures, we design an effective and comprehensive backdoor defense method\nnamed BeniFul, which consists of two parts: a gray-box backdoor input detection\nand a white-box backdoor elimination. Specifically, we use the reconstruction\ndistance from the Variational Auto-Encoder and model inference results to\nimplement backdoor input detection and a feature distance loss to achieve\nbackdoor elimination.

However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty\nplanning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp\ncorners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this\nproblem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity\nPrediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal\nparameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a\nproposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC\nachieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity\nprofile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method\noptimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners\nwith significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with\nvehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the\nnumber of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to\nthe state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then\napplied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged\nracing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the\nmean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling\nlimits.

The visible\nand mid-infrared photometry are consistent with a white dwarf of\n$T_\\text{eff}\\approx10000$ K, $M\\approx0.8 M_\\odot$, though observation of its\noptical spectrum is required to precisely constrain its physical parameters.\nThese results demonstrate that precise mid-infrared photometry of white dwarf\ncompanions to bright stars can be obtained with MIRI, opening up new\npossibilities for studying white dwarfs in close binaries.",

Attribute diversity refers to\nvarying semantic granularity in attribute descriptions, ranging from low-level\n(specific, directly observable) to high-level (abstract, highly generic)\ncharacteristics. This diversity challenges the collection of adequate visual\ncues for attributes under a uni-granularity.

This is fundamentally challenging since electrical and\nthermal conduction are usually coupled. Here, we discover that quasi-2D\nconjugated coordination polymer films exhibit this ideal mix of antithetical\nproperties due to coexistence of defect-tolerant charge transport and\ndefect-sensitive heat propagation. The former is highlighted by the highest\nconductivities > 2000 S cm-1 with metallic temperature dependence observed in\ndisordered films with paracrystallinity > 10%, while the latter manifests in\nlow, temperature-activated lattice thermal conductivities (< 0.38 W m-1 K-1)\noriginating from small-amplitude, quasi-harmonic lattice dynamics with\ndisorder-limited lifetimes and vibrational scattering length on the order of\ninteratomic spacing. Based on temperature-dependent thermoelectric and\nmagnetotransport experiments we identify a two-carrier (hole-electron),\nambipolar metallic transport regime as the origin of relatively small Seebeck\ncoefficients in these materials.

Consequently, this popular software paradigm is increasingly used\nfor the performance evaluation of server systems. Due to the scale and\ncomplexity of datacenters, the evaluation of server optimization techniques is\nusually done on a smaller scale using a client-server model. Although the\nexperimental details of the server side are excessively described in most\npublications, the client side is often ignored. This paper identifies the\nhardware configuration of the client side as an important source of performance\nvariation that can affect the accuracy and the correctness of the conclusions\nof a study that analyzes the performance of microservices. This is partially\nattributed to the strict latency requirements of microservices and the small\nscale of the experimental environment. In this work we present, using a widely\nused online-service, several examples where the accuracy and the trends of the\nconclusions differ based on the configuration of the client-side. At the same\ntime we show that the experimental evaluation time can be significantly\naffected by the hardware configuration of the client.

Often times, a heterogeneous Gaussian process that\nconsists of multiple parametric sub-processes is often used when the observed\ndata come from a very diverse set of taxa. In the maximum likelihood setting,\nchallenges can be found when exploring the involved likelihood surface and when\ninterpreting the uncertainty around the parameters.\n  Results: We extend the methods to tackle inference problems for mixed\nGaussian phylogenetic models (MGPMs) by implementing a Bayesian scheme that can\ntake into account biologically relevant priors. The posterior inference method\nis based on the Population Monte Carlo (PMC) algorithm that are easily\nparallelized, and using an efficient algorithm to calculate the likelihood of\nphylogenetically correlated observations. A model evaluation method that is\nbased on the proximity of the posterior predictive distribution to the observed\ndata is also implemented. Simulation study is done to test the inference and\nevaluation capability of the method.

A key result of our study is that, in order to maximally\nenhance the probability of cat state generation, the initial state needs to be\nnon-classical. This can be achieved e.g. with one-axis twisting in a cavity-QED\nsystem.",

The Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach is a\npowerful analytical tool to study the dynamics of open quantum systems.\nNumerical treatments of the influence functional including the quasi-adiabatic\npropagator technique and the tensor-network-based time-evolving matrix product\noperator method, have proven to be efficient in studying open quantum systems\nwith bosonic environments. However, the numerical implementation of the\nfermionic path integral suffers from the Grassmann algebra involved. In this\nwork, we present a detailed introduction of the Grassmann time-evolving matrix\nproduct operator method for fermionic open quantum systems. In particular, we\nintroduce the concepts of Grassmann tensor, signed matrix product operator, and\nGrassmann matrix product state to handle the Grassmann path integral. Using the\nsingle-orbital Anderson impurity model as an example, we review the numerical\nbenchmarks for structured fermionic environments for real-time nonequilibrium\ndynamics, real-time and imaginary-time equilibration dynamics, and its\napplication as an impurity solver. These benchmarks show that our method is a\nrobust and promising numerical approach to study strong coupling physics and\nnon-Markovian dynamics.

Tuning the strengths of the\nelectron-phonon coupling and the Hubbard interaction allows us to examine the\nevolution of the spectral properties of the system as it crosses over from a\nbound bipolaron to separate polarons. With increasing Hubbard repulsion, the\ndecrease of the bipolaron binding energy results in the gradual downward shift\nof the polaron band - a low-frequency feature in the spectral function.\nSimultaneously, the intensity of the polaron band away from the center of the\nBrillouin zone diminishes until it remains non-zero only in its center as the\nbipolaron unbinds into two separate polarons.

Traditional single-round jailbreak\nattacks, such as GCG and AutoDAN, do not alter the sensitive words in the\ndangerous prompts. Although they can temporarily bypass the model's safeguards\nthrough prompt engineering, their success rate drops significantly as the LLM\nis further fine-tuned, and they cannot effectively circumvent static rule-based\nfilters that remove the hazardous vocabulary.\n  In this study, to better understand jailbreak attacks, we introduce a\nmulti-round jailbreak approach. This method can rewrite the dangerous prompts,\ndecomposing them into a series of less harmful sub-questions to bypass the\nLLM's safety checks. We first use the LLM to perform a decomposition task,\nbreaking down a set of natural language questions into a sequence of\nprogressive sub-questions, which are then used to fine-tune the Llama3-8B\nmodel, enabling it to decompose hazardous prompts. The fine-tuned model is then\nused to break down the problematic prompt, and the resulting sub-questions are\nsequentially asked to the victim model. If the victim model rejects a\nsub-question, a new decomposition is generated, and the process is repeated\nuntil the final objective is achieved.

    "abstract": "Constrained synthesizability is an unaddressed challenge in generative\nmolecular design. In particular, designing molecules satisfying multi-parameter\noptimization objectives, while simultaneously being synthesizable and enforcing\nthe presence of specific commercial building blocks in the synthesis. This is\npractically important for molecule re-purposing, sustainability, and\nefficiency. In this work, we propose a novel reward function called TANimoto\nGroup Overlap (TANGO), which uses chemistry principles to transform a sparse\nreward function into a dense and learnable reward function -- crucial for\nreinforcement learning. TANGO can augment general-purpose molecular generative\nmodels to directly optimize for constrained synthesizability while\nsimultaneously optimizing for other properties relevant to drug discovery using\nreinforcement learning. Our framework is general and addresses\nstarting-material, intermediate, and divergent synthesis constraints. Contrary\nto most existing works in the field, we show that incentivizing a\ngeneral-purpose (without any inductive biases) model is a productive approach\nto navigating challenging optimization scenarios. We demonstrate this by\nshowing that the trained models explicitly learn a desirable distribution. Our\nframework is the first generative approach to tackle constrained\nsynthesizability.",

Previously\nsuggested CRNs for feed-forward networks often utilized the rectified linear\nunit (ReLU) or discrete activation functions. However, one concern in this case\nis the discontinuities of the derivatives of those non-smooth functions, which\ncan cause significant noise disruption during backpropagation. In this study,\nwe propose a CRN that performs both feed-forward and training processes using\nsmooth activation functions to avoid discontinuities in the backpropagation.\nAll reactions occur in a single pot, and the reactions for training are\nbimolecular. Our case studies on XOR, Iris, MNIST datasets, and a non-linear\nregression model demonstrate that computation via the CRN (i) maintains\naccuracy despite noise in the reaction rates and the concentration of species\nand (ii) is insensitive to the choice of the running time and the magnitude of\nthe noise in comparison to NNs with a non-smooth activation function.

These mechanisms are\ndiffusion, advection and dispersion, all of which depend on the microstructure\nof the porous medium; however, this dependence remains poorly understood. For\nidealised microstructures, one can use the mathematical framework of\nhomogenisation to examine this dependence, but strongly heterogeneous materials\nare more challenging. Here, we consider a two-dimensional microstructure\ncomprising an array of obstacles of smooth but arbitrary shape, the size and\nspacing of which can vary along the length of the porous medium. We use\nhomogenisation via the method of multiple scales to systematically upscale a\nmicroscale problem involving non-periodic cells of varying area to obtain\neffective continuum equations for macroscale transport and sorption. The\nequations are characterised by the local porosity, an effective local\nadsorption rate and an effective local anisotropic solute diffusivity. All of\nthese macroscale properties depend nontrivially on the two degrees of\nmicrostructural geometric freedom in our problem; obstacle size and obstacle\nspacing. Further, the coefficient of effective diffusivity comprises the\nmolecular diffusivity, the suppressive effect of the presence of obstacles and\nthe enhancing effect of dispersion. To illustrate the mathematical model, we\nfocus on a simple example geometry comprising circular obstacles on a hexagonal\nlattice, for which we numerically determine the macroscale permeability and\neffective diffusivity.

This optimal size emerges from a\ntradeoff between the highest stability in small networks and the greatest\ninstability with diffusion in large networks.

    "abstract": "Defying the median voter theorem, party polarization has spread globally,\nespecially in the United States. As concerns grow over its risks to democracy,\npolitical science has probed its causes, revealing two paradoxes: while\npolarization between U.S. political parties has undeniably increased since the\n1970s, the corresponding rise in issue polarization among voters remains\ncontested; moreover, the growing number of politically relevant issues would be\nexpected to counteract party polarization rather than reinforce it. To examine\nthese findings theoretically, we analyze a mathematical model of bipartisan\nelections where voters and parties interact in a multidimensional ideological\nspace. We derive equations that determine the critical threshold of expected\nvoter support needed for a party to find it strategically advantageous to\nposition itself at the center or outside of it. This threshold fundamentally\nincreases with the decrease of the effective dimension of the ideological\nspace, while issue polarization among voters plays a secondary role. Thus, the\nmodel points to both paradoxes being explainable if ideological dimensionality\nis causally linked to polarization. The model reveals a Curie point: below this\nthreshold, parties polarize as in a ferromagnetic phase, with voters acting\nlike aligned spins; above it, they shift toward the center, akin to a\nparamagnetic phase.",

    "abstract": "Sodium MRI is an imaging technique used to visualize and quantify sodium\nconcentrations in vivo, playing a role in many biological processes and\npotentially aiding in breast cancer characterization. Sodium MRI, however,\nsuffers from inherently low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and spatial\nresolution, compared with conventional proton MRI. A deep-learning method, the\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), has demonstrated success\nacross a wide range of denoising tasks, yet struggles with sodium MRI's unique\nnoise profile, as DDPM primarily targets Gaussian noise. DDPM can distort\nfeatures when applied to sodium MRI. This paper advances the DDPM by\nintroducing the Rician Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (RDDPM) for\nsodium MRI denoising. RDDPM converts Rician noise to Gaussian noise at each\ntimestep during the denoising process. The model's performance is evaluated\nusing three non-reference image quality assessment metrics, where RDDPM\nconsistently outperforms DDPM and other CNN-based denoising methods.",

    "abstract": "Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to identify a design that\nmaximizes a black-box function using only a fixed, pre-collected dataset of\ndesigns and their corresponding scores. A common approach in offline MBO is to\ntrain a regression-based surrogate model by minimizing mean squared error (MSE)\nand then find the best design within this surrogate model by different\noptimizers (e.g., gradient ascent). However, a critical challenge is the risk\nof out-of-distribution errors, i.e., the surrogate model may typically\noverestimate the scores and mislead the optimizers into suboptimal regions.\nPrior works have attempted to address this issue in various ways, such as using\nregularization techniques and ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of\nthe model, but it still remains. In this paper, we argue that regression models\ntrained with MSE are not well-aligned with the primary goal of offline MBO,\nwhich is to select promising designs rather than to predict their scores\nprecisely. Notably, if a surrogate model can maintain the order of candidate\ndesigns based on their relative score relationships, it can produce the best\ndesigns even without precise predictions. To validate it, we conduct\nexperiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final\ndesigns and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak. In contrast,\na metric that measures order-maintaining quality shows a significantly stronger\ncorrelation. Based on this observation, we propose learning a ranking-based\nmodel that leverages learning to rank techniques to prioritize promising\ndesigns based on their relative scores. We show that the generalization error\non ranking loss can be well bounded. Empirical results across diverse tasks\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ranking-based models than\ntwenty existing methods.",

We elucidate the TM width by simulations for flat\nprofiles, as the absence of background diamagnetic flows implies a small\nrotation-speed, while finite-gradients are included to investigate the TM\nrotation. For flat profiles, the initial saturation width of nonlinearly driven\nmagnetic islands is related to the TM linear growth rate; however, large\nislands in the initial saturation phase are prone to current density\nredistribution that reduces the island width in the following evolution.\nIsland-induced $\\boldsymbol{E}\\times\\boldsymbol{B}$ and diamagnetic sheared\nflows develop at the separatrix, able to destabilize the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI). The KHI turbulence enhances a strong quadrupole vortex flow\nthat reinforces the island decay, resulting in a strong reduction of the island\nwidth in an eventual steady state. This process is enhanced by trapped\nelectrons. For finite gradients profile, the TM usually rotates in the electron\ndiamagnetic direction, but can change direction when the ion temperature\ngradient dominates the other gradients. The reduced growth of the TM by\ndiamagnetic effects results in a moderate island size, which remains almost\nunchanged after the initial saturation. At steady state, strong zonal flows are\nnonlinearly excited and dominate the island rotation, as expected from previous\ntheoretical and numerical studies.

Resetting is a critical technological feature in\nthese systems allowing for mid-circuit measurement and complete or partial\nqubit reset. The possibility of realizing discrete-time reset dynamics on\nquantum computers makes it important to investigate the steady-state properties\nof such dynamics. Here, we explore the behavior of generic discrete-time\nunitary dynamics interspersed by random reset events. For Poissonian resets, we\ncompute the stationary state of the process and demonstrate, by taking a\nweak-reset limit, the existence of \"resonances\" in the quantum gates, allowing\nfor the emergence of steady state density matrices which are not diagonal in\nthe eigenbasis of the generator of the unitary gate. Such resonances are a\ngenuine discrete-time feature and impact on quantum and classical correlations\neven beyond the weak-reset limit. Furthermore, we consider non-Poissonian reset\nprocesses and explore conditions for the existence of a steady state. We show\nthat, when the reset probability vanishes sufficiently rapidly with time, the\nsystem does not approach a steady state. Our results highlight key differences\nbetween continuous-time and discrete-time stochastic resetting and may be\nuseful to engineer states with controllable correlations on existing devices.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for representation\nlearning from network data, the fairness of GNN models has raised great\nattention lately. Fair GNNs aim to ensure that node representations can be\naccurately classified, but not easily associated with a specific group.\nExisting advanced approaches essentially enhance the generalisation of node\nrepresentation in combination with data augmentation strategy, and do not\ndirectly impose constraints on the fairness of GNNs. In this work, we identify\nthat a fundamental reason for the unfairness of GNNs in social network learning\nis the phenomenon of social homophily, i.e., users in the same group are more\ninclined to congregate. The message-passing mechanism of GNNs can cause users\nin the same group to have similar representations due to social homophily,\nleading model predictions to establish spurious correlations with sensitive\nattributes. Inspired by this reason, we propose a method called Equity-Aware\nGNN (EAGNN) towards fair graph representation learning. Specifically, to ensure\nthat model predictions are independent of sensitive attributes while\nmaintaining prediction performance, we introduce constraints for fair\nrepresentation learning based on three principles: sufficiency, independence,\nand separation. We theoretically demonstrate that our EAGNN method can\neffectively achieve group fairness. Extensive experiments on three datasets\nwith varying levels of social homophily illustrate that our EAGNN method\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance across two fairness metrics and\noffers competitive effectiveness.",

Another approach to mapping is the\nusage of topological properties, e.g. adjacency of locations in the\nenvironment. Topological maps are less prone to odometry error accumulation and\nhigh resources consumption, and also enable fast path planning because of the\ngraph sparsity.

Statistical multimodel postprocessing helps to\ncombine various sources to achieve these seamless forecasts. However, when one\nof the combined sources of the forecast is not available due to reaching the\nend of its forecasting horizon, forecasts can be temporally inconsistent and\nsudden drops in skill can be observed. To obtain a seamless forecast, the\noutput of multimodel postprocessing is often blended across these transitions,\nalthough this unnecessarily worsens the forecasts immediately before the\ntransition. Additionally, large differences between the latest observation and\nthe first forecasts can be present. This paper presents an idea to preserve a\nsmooth temporal prediction until the end of the forecast range and increase its\npredictability. This optimal seamless forecast is simply accomplished by not\nexcluding any model from the multimodel by using the latest possible lead time\nas model persistence into the future. Furthermore, the gap between the latest\navailable observation and the first model step is seamlessly closed with the\npersistence of the observation by using the latest observation as additional\npredictor. With this idea, no visible jump in forecasts is observed and the\nverification presents a seamless quality in terms of scores.

    "abstract": "Regression analysis with missing data is a long-standing and challenging\nproblem, particularly when there are many missing variables with arbitrary\nmissing patterns. Likelihood-based methods, although theoretically appealing,\nare often computationally inefficient or even infeasible when dealing with a\nlarge number of missing variables. In this paper, we consider the Cox\nregression model with incomplete covariates that are missing at random. We\ndevelop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for nonparametric maximum\nlikelihood estimation, employing a transformation technique in the E-step so\nthat it involves only a one-dimensional integration. This innovation makes our\nmethods scalable with respect to the dimension of the missing variables. In\naddition, for variable selection, we extend the proposed EM algorithm to\naccommodate a LASSO penalty in the likelihood. We demonstrate the feasibility\nand advantages of the proposed methods over existing methods by large-scale\nsimulation studies and apply the proposed methods to a cancer genomic study.",

The analysis shows that this behavior is linked to the joint\neffect of variations of the effective Lewis number and Zeldovich number. IFIs\nin ammonia/hydrogen blends further show a non-monotonic trend with respect to\npressure, which is found to be linked to the chemistry of the hydroperoxyl\nradical $\\rm HO_2$. The addition of $\\rm NH_3$ opens new reaction pathways for\nthe consumption of $\\rm HO_2$ resulting in a chain carrying behavior in\ncontrast to its chain terminating nature in pure $\\rm H_2$/air flames.\nTheoretically derived dispersion relations can predict the non-monotonic\nbehavior for lean conditions. However, these are found to be sensitive to the\ndifferent methods for evaluating the Zeldovich number available in the\nliterature.",

    "abstract": "Conditional density estimation (CDE) goes beyond regression by modeling the\nfull conditional distribution, providing a richer understanding of the data\nthan just the conditional mean in regression. This makes CDE particularly\nuseful in critical application domains. However, interpretable CDE methods are\nunderstudied. Current methods typically employ kernel-based approaches, using\nkernel functions directly for kernel density estimation or as basis functions\nin linear models. In contrast, despite their conceptual simplicity and\nvisualization suitability, tree-based methods -- which are arguably more\ncomprehensible -- have been largely overlooked for CDE tasks. Thus, we propose\nthe Conditional Density Tree (CDTree), a fully non-parametric model consisting\nof a decision tree in which each leaf is formed by a histogram model.\nSpecifically, we formalize the problem of learning a CDTree using the minimum\ndescription length (MDL) principle, which eliminates the need for tuning the\nhyperparameter for regularization. Next, we propose an iterative algorithm\nthat, although greedily, searches the optimal histogram for every possible node\nsplit. Our experiments demonstrate that, in comparison to existing\ninterpretable CDE methods, CDTrees are both more accurate (as measured by the\nlog-loss) and more robust against irrelevant features. Further, our approach\nleads to smaller tree sizes than existing tree-based models, which benefits\ninterpretability.",

The language and vision communities have seen remarkable progress toward\nthis trend by scaling up transformer-based models trained on massive datasets,\nwhile reinforcement learning (RL) agents still suffer from poor generalization\ncapacity under such paradigms. To tackle this challenge, we propose Meta\nDecision Transformer (Meta-DT), which leverages the sequential modeling ability\nof the transformer architecture and robust task representation learning via\nworld model disentanglement to achieve efficient generalization in offline\nmeta-RL. We pretrain a context-aware world model to learn a compact task\nrepresentation, and inject it as a contextual condition to the causal\ntransformer to guide task-oriented sequence generation. Then, we subtly utilize\nhistory trajectories generated by the meta-policy as a self-guided prompt to\nexploit the architectural inductive bias. We select the trajectory segment that\nyields the largest prediction error on the pretrained world model to construct\nthe prompt, aiming to encode task-specific information complementary to the\nworld model maximally. Notably, the proposed framework eliminates the\nrequirement of any expert demonstration or domain knowledge at test time.\nExperimental results on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks across various dataset\ntypes show that Meta-DT exhibits superior few and zero-shot generalization\ncapacity compared to strong baselines while being more practical with fewer\nprerequisites.

As one of the\nmost successful models, EGNN leverages a simple scalarization technique to\nperform equivariant message passing over only Cartesian vectors (i.e.,\n1st-degree steerable vectors), enjoying greater efficiency and efficacy\ncompared to equivariant GNNs using higher-degree steerable vectors. This\nsuccess suggests that higher-degree representations might be unnecessary. In\nthis paper, we disprove this hypothesis by exploring the expressivity of\nequivariant GNNs on symmetric structures, including $k$-fold rotations and\nregular polyhedra. We theoretically demonstrate that equivariant GNNs will\nalways degenerate to a zero function if the degree of the output\nrepresentations is fixed to 1 or other specific values. Based on this\ntheoretical insight, we propose HEGNN, a high-degree version of EGNN to\nincrease the expressivity by incorporating high-degree steerable vectors while\nmaintaining EGNN's efficiency through the scalarization trick. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that HEGNN not only aligns with our theoretical\nanalyses on toy datasets consisting of symmetric structures, but also shows\nsubstantial improvements on more complicated datasets such as $N$-body and\nMD17.

By learning a joint distribution over a correlated image pair\n(e.g. image and depth) with a diffusion model, our approach enables versatile\ncapabilities via different inference-time sampling schemes, including\ncontrollable image generation (e.g. depth to image), estimation (e.g. image to\ndepth), signal guidance, joint generation (image & depth), and coarse control.\nPrevious attempts at unification often introduce significant complexity through\nmulti-stage training, architectural modification, or increased parameter\ncounts. In contrast, our simple formulation requires a single, computationally\nefficient training stage, maintains the standard model input, and adds minimal\nlearned parameters (15% of the base model). Moreover, our model supports\nadditional capabilities like non-spatially aligned and coarse conditioning.\nExtensive results show that our single model can produce comparable results\nwith specialized methods and better results than prior unified methods.

It is widely understood that, when effect\nmodification is present, treatment recommendations may vary by population and\nby subgroups within the population. Population-adjustment methods are\nincreasingly used to adjust for differences in effect modifiers between study\npopulations and to produce population-adjusted estimates in a relevant target\npopulation for decision-making. It is also widely understood that marginal and\nconditional estimands for non-collapsible effect measures, such as odds ratios\nor hazard ratios, do not in general coincide even without effect modification.\nHowever, the consequences of both non-collapsibility and effect modification\ntogether are little-discussed in the literature.\n  In this paper, we set out the definitions of conditional and marginal\nestimands, illustrate their properties when effect modification is present, and\ndiscuss the implications for decision-making. In particular, we show that\neffect modification can result in conflicting treatment rankings between\nconditional and marginal estimates. This is because conditional and marginal\nestimands correspond to different decision questions that are no longer aligned\nwhen effect modification is present. For time-to-event outcomes, the presence\nof covariates implies that marginal hazard ratios are time-varying, and effect\nmodification can cause marginal hazard curves to cross. We conclude with\npractical recommendations for decision-making in the presence of effect\nmodification, based on pragmatic comparisons of both conditional and marginal\nestimates in the decision target population. Currently, multilevel network\nmeta-regression is the only population-adjustment method capable of producing\nboth conditional and marginal estimates, in any decision target population.",

These systems often follow the stochastic gradient descent of\nan underlying energy function, converging to stationary distributions around\nenergy minima. The local covariance of these distributions is shaped by the\nenergy landscape's curvature, often resulting in anisotropic characteristics.\nWhile flow-based generative models have gained traction in generating samples\nfrom equilibrium distributions in such applications, they predominately employ\nisotropic conditional probability paths, limiting their ability to capture such\ncovariance structures.\n  In this paper, we introduce Hessian-Informed Flow Matching (HI-FM), a novel\napproach that integrates the Hessian of an energy function into conditional\nflows within the flow matching framework. This integration allows HI-FM to\naccount for local curvature and anisotropic covariance structures. Our approach\nleverages the linearization theorem from dynamical systems and incorporates\nadditional considerations such as time transformations and equivariance.\nEmpirical evaluations on the MNIST and Lennard-Jones particles datasets\ndemonstrate that HI-FM improves the likelihood of test samples.",

This Colloquium considers quantum effects associated with\nskyrmion textures: their theoretical origins, the experimental and material\nchallenges associated with their detection, and the promise of exploiting them\nfor quantum operations. Starting with classical skyrmions, we discuss their\nmagnon and electron excitations and show how hybrid architectures offer new\nplatforms for engineering quantum orders, including topological\nsuperconductivity.

Looking ahead, we propose\nmaterial classes suitable for the realization of skyrmions in quantum spin\nsystems and identify device architectures with the promise of achieving quantum\noperations.

While considerable\nbiological research is needed to understand the FLASH effect and determine the\nFLASH modifying factors (FMF) for individual OARs, exploratory treatment\nplanning studies have also emerged. This study aims to show that spinal\nmetastases are candidate treatment sites likely to benefit from this phenomenon\nand establish the requisite FMFs to achieve the protective FLASH effect. A\nconformal FLASH Proton SBRT plan was generated for a patient with spine\nmetastasis in a research version of RayStation11B (RaySearch laboratories AB,\nStockhom) on an IBA Proteus Plus system. Two oblique posterior beams were used\nin the plan. The prescribed dose to the CTV was set according to 3 different\nfractionation regimens: 5 fractions (fx) of 7 Gy, 8 fx of 5 Gy, and 10 fx of\n4.2 Gy. Spot filtering and sorting techniques were applied to maximize the 5%\npencil beam scanning DR in the spinal cord (SC). The FLASH effect was assumed\nto be observed within irradiated regions above 40 Gy/s and 4 Gy per fraction.\nThe generated plans successfully ensure robust target coverage in each\nfraction. The volume of SC that does not comply with the clinical goal adheres\nto the FLASH effect conditions in each fraction. Depending on the\naforementioned fractionation schemes used, a FMF of approximately 0.6 to 0.8 is\nnecessary to enable such treatment in FLASH conditions. Our study demonstrates\nthe potential of hypofractionated FLASH PT in treating spine metastasis while\npreserving SC integrity. This approach could enable more effective treatment of\nspinal metastases, potentially preventing SC compression and paralysis in these\npatients.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal variational autoencoders (VAEs) aim to capture shared latent\nrepresentations by integrating information from different data modalities. A\nsignificant challenge is accurately inferring representations from any subset\nof modalities without training an impractical number (2^M) of inference\nnetworks for all possible modality combinations. Mixture-based models simplify\nthis by requiring only as many inference models as there are modalities,\naggregating unimodal inferences. However, they suffer from information loss\nwhen modalities are missing. Alignment-based VAEs address this by aligning\nunimodal inference models with a multimodal model through minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence but face issues due to amortization gaps,\nwhich compromise inference accuracy. To tackle these problems, we introduce\nmultimodal iterative amortized inference, an iterative refinement mechanism\nwithin the multimodal VAE framework. This method overcomes information loss\nfrom missing modalities and minimizes the amortization gap by iteratively\nrefining the multimodal inference using all available modalities. By aligning\nunimodal inference to this refined multimodal posterior, we achieve unimodal\ninferences that effectively incorporate multimodal information while requiring\nonly unimodal inputs during inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show\nthat our approach improves inference performance, evidenced by higher linear\nclassification accuracy and competitive cosine similarity, and enhances\ncross-modal generation, indicated by lower FID scores. This demonstrates that\nour method enhances inferred representations from unimodal inputs.",

Despite significant achievements in complex\nrobotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires\nthe coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for\ngenerative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action\nspace, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding\nenvironment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based,\nscene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and\nefficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on\nrobot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions\nfrom mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner.

This enables the reduction of physical violations and\nexecution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner.\nThrough benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20\nscenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural\nplanners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world\nrobot.

On the other hand, recent\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated reasoning and planning\ncapabilities, introduced new ways to interact with and program machines, and\nincorporate both domain-specific and commonsense knowledge. Hence, we propose\nto address the aforementioned challenges by integrating LLMs with robot swarms\nand show the potential in proofs of concept (showcases). For this integration,\nwe explore two approaches. The first approach is 'indirect integration,' where\nLLMs are used to synthesize and validate the robot controllers. This approach\nmay reduce development time and human error before deployment. Moreover, during\ndeployment, it could be used for on-the-fly creation of new robot behaviors.\nThe second approach is 'direct integration,' where each robot locally executes\na separate LLM instance during deployment for robot-robot collaboration and\nhuman-swarm interaction. These local LLM instances enable each robot to reason,\nplan, and collaborate using natural language, as demonstrated in our showcases\nwhere the robots are able to detect a variety of anomalies, without prior\ninformation about the nature of these anomalies.

This is particularly severe for the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA), which has a periodic pattern of missing\nchannels that introduce spikes along $k_\\parallel$. The Tracking Tapered\nGridded Estimator (TTGE) overcomes this by first correlating the visibilities\nin the frequency domain to estimate the multi-frequency angular power spectrum\n(MAPS) $C_\\ell(\\Delta\\nu)$ that has no missing frequency separation\n$\\Delta\\nu$. We perform a Fourier transform along $\\Delta\\nu$ to estimate\n$P(k_\\perp,k_\\parallel)$. Considering our earlier work, simulations demonstrate\nthat the TTGE can estimate $P(k_\\perp,k_\\parallel)$ without any artifacts due\nto the missing channels. However, the spikes were still found to persist for\nthe actual data, which is foreground-dominated. The current work presents a\ndetailed investigation considering both simulations and actual data. We find\nthat the spikes arise due to a combination of the missing channels and the\nstrong spectral dependence of the foregrounds. Based on this, we propose and\ndemonstrate a technique to mitigate the spikes. Applying this, we find the\nvalues of $P(k_\\perp,k_\\parallel)$ in the region $0.004 \\leq k_\\perp \\leq\n0.048\\,{\\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ and $k_\\parallel > 0.35 \\,{\\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ to be\nconsistent with zero within the expected statistical fluctuations.

    "abstract": "The development of vision-language and generative models has significantly\nadvanced text-guided image editing, which seeks the preservation of core\nelements in the source image while implementing modifications based on the\ntarget text. However, existing metrics have a context-blindness problem,\nindiscriminately applying the same evaluation criteria on completely different\npairs of source image and target text, biasing towards either modification or\npreservation. Directional CLIP similarity, the only metric that considers both\nsource image and target text, is also biased towards modification aspects and\nattends to irrelevant editing regions of the image. We propose AugCLIP, a\ncontext-aware metric that adaptively coordinates preservation and modification\naspects, depending on the specific context of a given source image and target\ntext. This is done by deriving the CLIP representation of an ideally edited\nimage, that preserves the source image with necessary modifications to align\nwith target text. More specifically, using a multi-modal large language model,\nAugCLIP augments the textual descriptions of the source and target, then\ncalculates a modification vector through a hyperplane that separates source and\ntarget attributes in CLIP space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets, encompassing a diverse range of editing scenarios, show that AugCLIP\naligns remarkably well with human evaluation standards, outperforming existing\nmetrics.

For DRACO's pre-training, the quality of\nthe dataset is essential, we hence build a high-quality, diverse dataset from\nan uncurated public database, including over 270,000 movies or micrographs.\nAfter pre-training, DRACO naturally serves as a generalizable cryo-EM image\ndenoiser and a foundation model for various cryo-EM downstream tasks.

The first study explores covert target detection using optical or\nmicrowave probes, establishing quantum-mechanical limits on the error\nprobabilities of entanglement-assisted detection methods while maintaining the\nsender's covertness. It identifies the minimal energy required to preserve\ncovertness and reduce error probabilities, compares two-mode squeezed vacuum\nprobes and coherent states against these limits, and extends the analysis to\ndiscriminating thermal loss channels and non-adversarial quantum illumination.\nThe second study focuses on phase-insensitive optical amplifiers, determining\nthe quantum limit on the precision of gain estimation using multimode probes\npossibly entangled with ancillary systems. It finds that the average photon\nnumber and the number of input modes are interchangeable resources for\nachieving optimal gain sensing precision, contrasting classical probes with\nquantum probes and highlighting the advantages of the latter, even with\nsingle-photon inputs and inefficient photodetection. It also provides a\nclosed-form expression for the energy-constrained Bures distance between two\namplifier channels. The third study compares three probe states -- coherent\nstate, two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV), and single-photon entangled state\n(SPES) -- in quantum-enhanced target detection, assessing their performance\nunder signal energy constraints relevant to covert radar sensing. SPES is\nuniquely positioned as a practical probe due to its non-classical properties\nafter thermal loss and ease of generation. Numerical analysis shows that at low\nsignal energies, the error exponent of TMSV aligns with SPES, indicating\ncomparable detection capabilities and that SPES surpasses the best classical\nstate-the coherent state-in accuracy for certain signal strengths.",

While DP-SGD is well-suited to federated\nlearning with a single untrusted central server using lightweight secure\naggregation protocols, secure aggregation is not conducive to implementing\nmodern DP-FTRL techniques without assuming a trusted central server. DP-FTRL\nbased approaches have already seen widespread deployment in industry, albeit\nwith a trusted central curator who provides and applies the correlated noise.\nTo realize a fully private, single untrusted server DP-FTRL federated learning\nprotocol, we introduce secure stateful aggregation: a simple append-only data\nstructure that allows for the private storage of aggregate values and reading\nlinear functions of the aggregates. Assuming Ring Learning with Errors, we\nprovide a lightweight and scalable realization of this protocol for\nhigh-dimensional data in a new security/resource model, Federated MPC : where a\npowerful persistent server interacts with weak, ephemeral clients. We observe\nthat secure stateful aggregation suffices for realizing DP-FTRL-based private\nfederated learning: improving DPFL utility guarantees over the state of the art\nwhile maintaining privacy with an untrusted central party.

Prevailing affordance learning algorithms often adopt the label\nassignment paradigm and presume that there is a unique relationship between\nfunctional region and affordance label, yielding poor performance when adapting\nto unseen environments with large appearance variations. In this paper, we\npropose to leverage interactive affinity for affordance learning, \\ie\nextracting interactive affinity from human-object interaction and transferring\nit to non-interactive objects. Interactive affinity, which represents the\ncontacts between different parts of the human body and local regions of the\ntarget object, can provide inherent cues of interconnectivity between humans\nand objects, thereby reducing the ambiguity of the perceived action\npossibilities.

    "abstract": "The origin of large and small particle axial bands in long rotating tumblers\nis a long-standing question. Using DEM simulations, we show that this axial\nsegregation is due to a Rayleigh-Taylor instability which is characterized by\nthe fact that the density of a granular medium increases with mixing and\ndecreases with segregation. For initially mixed particles, segregation and\ncollisional diffusion in the flowing layer balance and lead to a three-layer\nsystem, with a layer of large particles over a layer of small particles, and,\ninterposed between these layers, a layer of more densely packed mixed\nparticles. The higher density mixed particle layer over the lower density small\nparticle layer induces a Rayleigh-Taylor instability, evident as waviness in\nthe interface between the layers. The waviness destabilizes into ascending\nplumes of small particles and descending plumes of mixed particles with large\nparticles enriched near the surface, which become evident as small and large\nparticle bands visible at the free surface. Rolls driven by segregation at the\ntilted interface between plumes maintain the pattern of frozen plumes.\nPublished by the American Physical Society 2024",

This happens\ndue to the significant electromagnetic-scale anomaly contribution in the\nthermomagnetic medium.

We observe that at $(m_{0c},\nm_{sc}) \\simeq (2, 20) \\mathrm{MeV}$ for the isospin symmetric mass for up and\ndown quarks, $m_0$, and the strange quark mass, $m_s$, $T_{\\mathrm{pc}}$\ndecreases with the magnetic field if the quark masses exceed the critical\nvalues, and increases as the quark masses become smaller.

By learning long-term dependencies,\nTransformer can effectively integrate multimodal features in the feature\nextraction stage, which greatly improves the performance of multimodal object\ndetection. However, current methods merely stack Transformer-guided fusion\ntechniques without exploring their capability to extract features at various\ndepth layers of network, thus limiting the improvements in detection\nperformance. In this paper, we introduce an accurate and efficient object\ndetection method named SeaDATE. Initially, we propose a novel dual attention\nFeature Fusion (DTF) module that, under Transformer's guidance, integrates\nlocal and global information through a dual attention mechanism, strengthening\nthe fusion of modal features from orthogonal perspectives using spatial and\nchannel tokens. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis and empirical validation\ndemonstrate that the Transformer-guided fusion method, treating images as\nsequences of pixels for fusion, performs better on shallow features' detail\ninformation compared to deep semantic information. To address this, we designed\na contrastive learning (CL) module aimed at learning features of multimodal\nsamples, remedying the shortcomings of Transformer-guided fusion in extracting\ndeep semantic features, and effectively utilizing cross-modal information.\nExtensive experiments and ablation studies on the FLIR, LLVIP, and M3FD\ndatasets have proven our method to be effective, achieving state-of-the-art\ndetection performance.",

However, existing approaches encounter\nchallenges, including sensitivity to artifacts and noise, suboptimal selection\nof training viewpoints, and the absence of global optimization. In this paper,\nwe propose GSORB-SLAM, a dense SLAM framework that integrates 3DGS with ORB\nfeatures through a tightly coupled optimization pipeline. To mitigate the\neffects of noise and artifacts, we propose a novel geometric representation and\noptimization method for tracking, which significantly enhances localization\naccuracy and robustness. For high-fidelity mapping, we develop an adaptive\nGaussian expansion and regularization method that facilitates compact yet\nexpressive scene modeling while suppressing redundant primitives. Furthermore,\nwe design a hybrid graph-based viewpoint selection mechanism that effectively\nreduces overfitting and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across\nvarious datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both tracking precision-improving RMSE by 16.2% compared to\nORB-SLAM2 baselines-and reconstruction quality-improving PSNR by 3.93 dB\ncompared to 3DGS-SLAM baselines.

The coherence time of light sources used to make\nholograms is one of the key parameters for the success of such experiments; it\nmust be large enough so that an optical wave train divided in two parts\n(reference/objects beams) interferes with itself to record the 3D shape of the\nobject on the photosensitive medium.

    "abstract": "Animals use limbs for both locomotion and manipulation. We aim to equip\nquadruped robots with similar versatility. This work introduces a system that\nenables quadruped robots to interact with objects using their legs, inspired by\nnon-prehensile manipulation. The system has two main components: a visual\nmanipulation policy module and a loco-manipulator module. The visual\nmanipulation policy, trained with reinforcement learning (RL) using point cloud\nobservations and object-centric actions, decides how the leg should interact\nwith the object. The loco-manipulator controller manages leg movements and body\npose adjustments, based on impedance control and Model Predictive Control\n(MPC). Besides manipulating objects with a single leg, the system can select\nfrom the left or right leg based on critic maps and move objects to distant\ngoals through base adjustment. Experiments evaluate the system on object pose\nalignment tasks in both simulation and the real world, demonstrating more\nversatile object manipulation skills with legs than previous work.

    "abstract": "In molecular dynamics (MD), systems are molecules made up of atoms, and the\naim is to determine their evolution over time. MD is based on a numerical\nresolution algorithm, whose role is to apply the forces generated by the\nvarious components, according to the equations of Newtonian physics. Molecular\nDynamics is currently mainly used in materials science and molecular biology.\nIn this document, we limit ourselves to {\\it alkanes} which are non-cyclic\ncarbon-hydrogenated chains. In the basic ``All-atom'' (AA) scale, all the atoms\nare directly simulated. In the ``United-atom'' (UA) scale, one considers grains\nthat are composed of a carbon atom with the hydrogen atoms attached to it.\nGrains in the ``Coarse-grained'' (CG) scale are composed of two consecutive UA\ngrains. In the multi-scale approach, one tries to use as much as possible the\nUA and CG scales which can be more efficiently simulated than the AA scale. In\nthis document, we mainly put the focus on three topics. First, we describe an\nMD system, implemented in the Java programming language, according to the\nSynchronous Reactive Programming approach in which there exists a notion of a\nglobal logical time. This system is used to simulate molecules and also to\nbuild the potentials functions at the UA and CG scales. Second, two methods to\nderive UA and CG potentials from AA potentials are proposed and analysed.\nBasically, both methods rely on strong geometrical links with the AA scale. We\nuse these links with AA to determine the forms and values of the UA and CG\npotentials. In the first method (called ``inverse-Boltzmann''), one considers\ndata produced during several AA scale molecule simulations, and one processes\nthese data using a statistical approach. In the second method (``minimisation\nmethod''), one applies a constrained-minimisation technique to AA molecules.\nThe most satisfactory method clearly appears to be the minimisation-based one.\nThe UA potentials we have determined have standard forms: they only differ from\nAA potentials by parameter values. On the opposite, CG potentials are\nnon-standard functions. We show how to implement them with functions defined\n``by cases''. Finally, we consider ``reconstructions'' which are means to\ndynamically change molecule scales during simulations. In particular, we\nconsider automatic reconstructions based on the proximity of molecules.",

This paper\nproposes the concepts of zone inflation and volume transfer for the design of a\nfabric-based pneumatic exosuit with both efficiency and wearability. The\nmeaning of zone inflation is to divide the inflation area of pneumatic exosuit\ninto inflation-deflation zone and inflation-holding zone which can reduce the\nconsumption of compressed air and improve efficiency. Volume transfer, a\nstrategic distribution method of inflatable regions inside the garment, can\neffectively enhance the wearability of the exosuit. Using inexpensive\nthermoplastic polyurethane film and clothing fabric, the exosuit is made by\nheat pressing and sewing. The exosuit has a response time of 0.5s, a stress\narea of 1500mm2, and a profile of only 32mm, which can be hidden inside common\nclothing. A mathematical model is developed to predict the output torque of the\nexosuit with an error of 3.6%. Mechanical experiments show that the exosuit\noutputs a torque of 9.1Nm at a pressure of 100kPa. Surface electromyography\nexperiments show that the exosuit can provide users with a boost from sitting\nto standing, with an average reduction in electromyography signals of 14.95%.\nThe exosuit designed using these methods synthesizes efficiency and wearability\nand is expected to be an ideal paradigm for fabric-based pneumatic exosuits.",

More than 2700 days of observations since the\nbeginning of the Ca II K observations with USET, in July 2012, were used in our\nanalysis. For each observation day, we produce synoptic maps to map the entire\nsolar surface during a full solar rotation.

The area fraction are extracted from the masks for each\ninclination and we compare the evolution of those time series to quantify the\nimpact of the inclination angle. We find a variation of the area fraction\nbetween an Equator-on view and a Pole-on view. Our results show an important\nimpact of the viewing angle on the detection of modulation due to the solar\nrotation. With the dense temporal sampling of USET data, the solar rotation is\ndetectable up to an inclination of about $|i| = 70^{\\circ}$ and the solar-cycle\nmodulation is clearly detected for all inclinations, though with a reduced\namplitude in polar views. When applying a sparse temporal sampling typical for\ntime series of solar-like stars, the rotational modulation is no longer\ndetected, whatever the inclination.

Recognizing this need,\nReCoded has enhanced the skill set of their tech Bootcamp graduates by\nintroducing the community platform -- \"ReCoded's Mentorship Platform\". To\nimprove the user experience of the volunteer mentors at ReCoded, this thesis\ninvestigates optimizing mentors' interactions with digital mentorship platforms\nand provides suggestions for enhancing these interactions. Multiple third-party\ncollaborators have powered the mentorship platform at ReCoded. This thesis\nexamines the platform powered by StellarUp as a case study. The insights\nobtained may inform the UX design of any subsequent mentorship platforms\nconsidered by ReCoded. This thesis adopted a user-centric approach to solving a\nUX question. The study identified challenges in the mentors' user journey and\ntheir needs by engaging with users via interviews, usability tests, and\neye-tracking methods. Three principal issues emerged: platform navigation, the\nonboarding process, and the seamless integration of external tools. Solutions\nwere derived from desk research for onboarding, card sorting techniques for\nnavigation, and competitive analyses for tool integration.

The efficiency of AfterLearnER is demonstrated by\ntackling non-differentiable signals such as threshold-based criteria in depth\nsensing, the word error rate in speech re-synthesis, image quality in 3D\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), image generation via Latent Diffusion\nModels (LDM), the number of kills per life at Doom, computational accuracy or\nBLEU in code translation, and human appreciations in image synthesis.

The advantages of AfterLearnER are its versatility\n(no gradient is needed), the possibility to use non-differentiable feedback\nincluding human evaluations, the limited overfitting, supported by a\ntheoretical study and its anytime behavior.

A hyperchaotic dynamical system is therefore even more unpredictable\nthan a chaotic one, and has a higher fractal dimension. While hyperchaos has\nbeen studied extensively over the last decades, only a few experimental systems\nare known to exhibit hyperchaotic dynamics. Here we introduce hyperchaos in the\ncontext of cavity optomechanics, in which light inside an optical resonator\ninteracts with a suspended oscillating mass. We show that hyperchaos can arise\nin optomechanical systems with quadratic coupling and is well within reach of\ncurrent experiments. We compute the two positive Lyapunov exponents,\ncharacteristic of hyperchaos, and independently verify the correlation\ndimension. We also identify a possible mechanism for the emergence of\nhyperchaos. As systems designed for high-precision measurements, optomechanical\nsystems enable direct measurement of all four dynamical variables and therefore\nthe full reconstruction of the hyperchaotic attractor.

    "abstract": "The advent of massive ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (mURLLC)\nhas introduced a critical class of time- and reliability-sensitive services\nwithin next-generation wireless networks. This shift has attracted significant\nresearch attention, driven by the need to meet stringent quality-of-service\n(QoS) requirements. In this context, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)\nsystems have emerged as a promising solution to enhance mURLLC performance by\nproviding substantial enhancements in both spectral efficiency and massive\nconnectivity, particularly through the development of finite blocklength coding\n(FBC) techniques. Nevertheless, owing to the dynamic nature of wireless network\nenvironments and the complex architecture of FBC-enhanced NOMA systems, the\nresearch on the efficient design of optimizing the system performance for\nmaximizing system capacity while guaranteeing the tail distributions in terms\nof new statistical QoS constraints for delay and error-rate is still in its\ninfancy. In an effort to address these challenges, we put forth the formulation\nand solution of {\\epsilon}-effective capacity problems tailored for uplink\nFBC-enhanced NOMA systems, specifically catering to ensure statistical delay\nand error-rate bounded QoS requirements. In particular, we establish uplink\ntwo-user FBC-enhanced NOMA system models by applying the hybrid successive\ninterference cancellation (SIC). We also develop the concept of the\n{\\epsilon}-effective capacity and propose the optimal power allocation policies\nto maximize the {\\epsilon}-effective capacity and {\\epsilon}-effective energy\nefficiency while upper-bounding both delay and error-rate. We conduct a set of\nsimulations to validate and evaluate our developed optimization schemes over\nFBC-enhanced NOMA systems.",

Our work introduces a novel two-stage anomaly detection\nalgorithm called CONSULT (CONtrastive Self-sUpervised Learning for few-shot\nTumor detection). The first stage of CONSULT fine-tunes a pre-trained feature\nextractor specifically for MRI brain images, using a synthetic data generation\npipeline to create tumor-like data.

We propose\na novel quantization paradigm called QSPEC, which seamlessly integrates two\ncomplementary quantization schemes for speculative decoding. Leveraging nearly\ncost-free execution switching, QSPEC drafts tokens with low-precision, fast\nactivation-weight quantization, and verifies them with high-precision\nweight-only quantization, effectively combining the strengths of both\nquantization schemes. Compared to high-precision quantization methods, QSPEC\nempirically boosts token generation throughput by up to 1.64x without any\nquality compromise, distinguishing it from other low-precision quantization\napproaches. This enhancement is also consistent across various serving tasks,\nmodel sizes, quantization methods, and batch sizes.

However, open-boundary computational methods\nare scarce and typically do not satisfy all the equilibrium conditions imposed\nby reality. Namely, in the absence of external gradients, 1) the system of\ninterest (SoI) must be at thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium with an\ninfinite reservoir of particles, 2) the fluctuations of the SoI in equilibrium\nshould sample the grand canonical ensemble, 3) the local solvation\nthermodynamics, which is extremely sensitive to finite-size effects due to\nsolvent depletion, should be correctly described. This point is particularly\nrelevant for out-of-equilibrium systems. Finally, 4) the method should be\nrobust enough to deal with phase transitions and coexistence conditions in the\nSoI. In this study, we demonstrate with prototypical liquid systems embedded\ninto a reservoir of ideal gas particles that the adaptive resolution simulation\n(AdResS) method, coupled with particle insertion/deletion steps, satisfies all\nthese requirements. Therefore, this AdResS setup is suitable for performing\nequilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations of open systems.",

The efficacy of task-specific finetuning largely\ndepends on the selection of appropriate training data. We present TSDS\n(Task-Specific Data Selection), a framework to select data for task-specific\nmodel finetuning, guided by a small but representative set of examples from the\ntarget task. To do so, we formulate data selection for task-specific finetuning\nas an optimization problem with a distribution alignment loss based on optimal\ntransport to capture the discrepancy between the selected data and the target\ndistribution. In addition, we add a regularizer to encourage the diversity of\nthe selected data and incorporate kernel density estimation into the\nregularizer to reduce the negative effects of near-duplicates among the\ncandidate data. We connect our optimization problem to nearest neighbor search\nand design efficient algorithms to compute the optimal solution based on\napproximate nearest neighbor search techniques. We evaluate our method on data\nselection for both continued pretraining and instruction tuning of language\nmodels. We show that instruction tuning using data selected by our method with\na 1% selection ratio often outperforms using the full dataset and beats the\nbaseline selection methods by 1.5 points in F1 score on average.",

In\nthis work, we extend the exploration of sycophancy from LLMs to VLMs,\nintroducing the MM-SY benchmark to evaluate this phenomenon. We present\nevaluation results from multiple representative models, addressing the gap in\nsycophancy research for VLMs. To mitigate sycophancy, we propose a synthetic\ndataset for training and employ methods based on prompts, supervised\nfine-tuning, and DPO. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods\neffectively alleviate sycophancy in VLMs. Additionally, we probe VLMs to assess\nthe semantic impact of sycophancy and analyze the attention distribution of\nvisual tokens. Our findings indicate that the ability to prevent sycophancy is\npredominantly observed in higher layers of the model.

    "abstract": "Recent studies proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) with\nIn-Context Learning (ICL) to handle code intelligence tasks without\nfine-tuning. ICL employs task instructions and a set of examples as\ndemonstrations to guide the model in generating accurate answers without\nupdating its parameters. While ICL has proven effective for code intelligence\ntasks, its performance heavily relies on the selected examples. Previous work\nhas achieved some success in using BM25 to retrieve examples for code\nintelligence tasks. However, existing approaches lack the ability to understand\nthe semantic and structural information of queries, resulting in less helpful\ndemonstrations. Moreover, they do not adapt well to the complex and dynamic\nnature of user queries in diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel\napproach named Instructive Code Retriever (ICR), which is designed to retrieve\nexamples that enhance model inference across various code intelligence tasks\nand datasets. We enable ICR to learn the semantic and structural information of\nthe corpus by a tree-based loss function. To better understand the correlation\nbetween queries and examples, we incorporate the feedback from LLMs to guide\nthe training of the retriever. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nretriever significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We evaluate\nour model's effectiveness on various tasks, i.e., code summarization, program\nsynthesis, and bug fixing.

    "abstract": "We introduce $\\textit{sorted weight sectioning}$ (SWS): a weight allocation\nalgorithm that places sorted deep neural network (DNN) weight sections on\nbit-sliced compute-in-memory (CIM) crossbars to reduce analog-to-digital\nconverter (ADC) energy consumption. Data conversions are the most\nenergy-intensive process in crossbar operation. SWS effectively reduces this\ncost leveraging (1) small weights and (2) zero weights (weight sparsity).\n  DNN weights follow bell-shaped distributions, with most weights near zero.\nUsing SWS, we only need low-order crossbar columns for sections with\nlow-magnitude weights. This reduces the quantity and resolution of ADCs used,\nexponentially decreasing ADC energy costs without significantly degrading DNN\naccuracy.\n  Unstructured sparsification further sharpens the weight distribution with\nsmall accuracy loss. However, it presents challenges in hardware tracking of\nzeros: we cannot switch zero rows to other layer weights in unsorted crossbars\nwithout index matching. SWS efficiently addresses unstructured sparse models\nusing offline remapping of zeros into earlier sections, which reveals full\nsparsity potential and maximizes energy efficiency.\n  Our method reduces ADC energy use by 89.5% on unstructured sparse BERT\nmodels. Overall, this paper introduces a novel algorithm to promote\nenergy-efficient CIM crossbars for unstructured sparse DNN workloads.",

    "abstract": "The detection of gravitational waves has opened unparalleled opportunities\nfor observing the universe, particularly through the study of black hole\ninspirals. These events serve as unique laboratories to explore the laws of\nphysics under conditions of extreme energies. However, significant noise in\ngravitational wave (GW) data from observatories such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo\nposes major challenges in signal identification. Traditional noise suppression\nmethods often fall short in fully addressing the non-Gaussian effects in the\ndata, including the fluctuations in noise power spectral density (PSD) over\nshort time intervals. These challenges have led to the exploration of an AI\napproach that, while overcoming previous obstacles, introduced its own\nchallenges, such as scalability, reliability issues, and the vanishing gradient\nproblem. Our approach addresses these issues through a simplified architecture.\nTo compensate for the potential limitations of a simpler model, we have\ndeveloped a novel training methodology that enables it to accurately detect\ngravitational waves amidst highly complex noise. Employing this strategy, our\nmodel achieves over 99% accuracy in non-white noise scenarios and shows\nremarkable adaptability to changing noise PSD conditions. By leveraging the\nprinciples of transfer learning, our model quickly adapts to new noise profiles\nwith just a few epochs of fine-tuning, facilitating real-time applications in\ndynamically changing noise environments.",

Prior\nmethods have utilized drones for data capture and radiance fields for scene\nreconstruction, both of which present certain challenges. First, in order to\ncapture diverse viewpoints with the drone's front-facing camera, some\napproaches fly the drone in an unstable zig-zag fashion, which hinders\ndrone-piloting and generates motion blur in the captured data. Secondly, most\nradiance field methods do not easily scale to arbitrarily large number of\nimages. This paper proposes an efficient and scalable pipeline for indoor\nnovel-view synthesis from drone-captured 360 videos using 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. 360 cameras capture a wide set of viewpoints, allowing for\ncomprehensive scene capture under a simple straightforward drone trajectory. To\nscale our method to large scenes, we devise a divide-and-conquer strategy to\nautomatically split the scene into smaller blocks that can be reconstructed\nindividually and in parallel. We also propose a coarse-to-fine alignment\nstrategy to seamlessly match these blocks together to compose the entire scene.\nOur experiments demonstrate marked improvement in both reconstruction quality,\ni.e. PSNR and SSIM, and computation time compared to prior approaches.",

Existing GCL-based methods on the community detection usually\nfocused on learning attribute representations of individual nodes, which,\nhowever, ignores structural semantics of communities (e.g., nodes in the same\ncommunity should be structurally cohesive). Therefore, in this paper, we will\nconsider the community detection under the community structure semantics and\npropose an effective framework for graph contrastive learning under structure\nsemantics (GCLS$^2$) to detect communities. To seamlessly integrate interior\ndense and exterior sparse characteristics of communities with our contrastive\nlearning strategy, we employ classic community structures to extract high-level\nstructural views and design a structure semantic expression module to augment\nthe original structural feature representation. Moreover, we formulate the\nstructure contrastive loss to optimize the feature representation of nodes,\nwhich can better capture the topology of communities. To adapt to large-scale\nnetworks, we design a high-level graph partitioning (HGP) algorithm that\nminimizes the community detection loss for GCLS$^2$ online training. It is\nworth noting that we prove a lower bound on the training of GCLS$^2$ from the\nperspective of the information theory, explaining why GCLS$^2$ can learn a more\naccurate representation of the structure. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted on various real-world graph datasets and confirmed that GCLS$^2$\noutperforms nine state-of-the-art methods, in terms of the accuracy,\nmodularity, and efficiency of detecting communities.",

    "abstract": "Intercalation is a robust method for tuning the physical properties of a vast\nnumber of van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, the prospects of using\nintercalation to modify magnetism in vdWs systems and the associated mechanisms\nhave not been investigated adequately. In this work, we modulate magnetic order\nin an XY antiferromagnet NiPS3 single crystals by introducing pyridine\nmolecules into the vdWs gap under different thermal conditions. X-ray\ndiffraction measurements indicated pronounced changes in the lattice parameter\nbeta, while magnetization measurements at in-plane and out-of-plane\nconfigurations exposed reversal trends in the crystals Neel temperatures\nthrough intercalation-de-intercalation processes. The changes in magnetic\nordering were also supported by three-dimensional thermal diffusivity\nexperiments. The preferred orientation of the pyridine dipoles within vdW gaps\nwas deciphered via polarized Raman spectroscopy. The results highlight the\nrelation between the preferential alignment of the intercalants, thermal\ntransport, and crystallographic disorder along with the modulation of\nanisotropy in the magnetic order. The theoretical concept of double-exchange\ninteraction in NiPS3 was employed to explain the intercalation-induced magnetic\nordering. The study uncovers the merit of intercalation as a foundation for\nspin switches and spin transistors in advanced quantum devices.",

We propose an alternative identifying assumption that, despite its\nnonparametric nature, suggests a simple estimation algorithm based on a\ntransformation of the empirical cumulative distribution function of the data.\nThis estimation procedure requires neither tuning parameters nor optimization\nin the first step, i.e., has a closed form.

We consider neural networks with piecewise linear activation\nfunctions, so that they can be mapped to an equivalent tree that is similar to\noblique decision trees. Since each node in such a tree serves as a function of\nthe input of the tree, each sub-tree is a sub-policy of the main policy.

This implies that the hump and dip energies extracted\nfrom the spectra depend on the sample fabrication conditions. When the samples\nwere fabricated at 4.2 K and/or under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), the hump energy\nexhibited a step-like doping dependence and the dip energy followed the upper\npseudo-gap line. As the fabrication conditions deteriorated, the hump and dip\nenergies reproduced the previous results, in that the dip energy was\nsignificantly dependent on the sample, whereas the hump energy exhibited a\nsmooth hump doping dependence.

    "abstract": "Understanding molecular adsorption on surfaces underpins many problems in\nchemistry and materials science. Accurately and efficiently describing the\nadsorption has been a challenging task for first-principles methods as the\nprocess can involve both short-range chemical bond formations and long-range\nphysical interactions, e.g., the van der Waals (vdW) interaction. Density\nfunctional theory presents an appealing choice for modeling adsorption\nreactions, though calculations with many exchange correlation density\nfunctional approximations struggle to accurately describe both chemical and\nphysical molecular adsorptions. Here, we propose an efficient density\nfunctional approximation that is accurate for both chemical and physical\nadsorption by concurrently optimizing its semilocal component and the\nlong-range vdW correction against the prototypical adsorption CO/Pt(111) and\nAr$_2$ binding energy curve. The resulting functional opens the door to\naccurate and efficient modeling of general molecular adsorption.",

    "abstract": "In subsurface imaging, learning the mapping from velocity maps to seismic\nwaveforms (forward problem) and waveforms to velocity (inverse problem) is\nimportant for several applications. While traditional techniques for solving\nforward and inverse problems are computationally prohibitive, there is a\ngrowing interest in leveraging recent advances in deep learning to learn the\nmapping between velocity maps and seismic waveform images directly from data.\nDespite the variety of architectures explored in previous works, several open\nquestions still remain unanswered such as the effect of latent space sizes, the\nimportance of manifold learning, the complexity of translation models, and the\nvalue of jointly solving forward and inverse problems. We propose a unified\nframework to systematically characterize prior research in this area termed the\nGeneralized Forward-Inverse (GFI) framework, building on the assumption of\nmanifolds and latent space translations. We show that GFI encompasses previous\nworks in deep learning for subsurface imaging, which can be viewed as specific\ninstantiations of GFI. We also propose two new model architectures within the\nframework of GFI: Latent U-Net and Invertible X-Net, leveraging the power of\nU-Nets for domain translation and the ability of IU-Nets to simultaneously\nlearn forward and inverse translations, respectively. We show that our proposed\nmodels achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for forward and inverse\nproblems on a wide range of synthetic datasets, and also investigate their\nzero-shot effectiveness on two real-world-like datasets.

Existing\nmethods for generating VH test cases primarily rely on human annotations,\ntypically in the form of triples: (image, question, answer). In this paper, we\nintroduce VHExpansion, the first automated method for expanding VH test cases\nfor MLLMs. Given an initial VH test case, VHExpansion automatically expands it\nby perturbing the question and answer through negation as well as modifying the\nimage using both common and adversarial perturbations. Additionally, we propose\na new evaluation metric, symmetric accuracy, which measures the proportion of\ncorrectly answered VH test-case pairs. Each pair consists of a test case and\nits negated counterpart. Our theoretical analysis shows that symmetric accuracy\nis an unbiased evaluation metric that remains unaffected by the imbalance of VH\ntesting cases with varying answers when an MLLM is randomly guessing the\nanswers, whereas traditional accuracy is prone to such imbalance. We apply\nVHExpansion to expand three VH datasets annotated manually and use these\nexpanded datasets to benchmark seven MLLMs. Our evaluation shows that\nVHExpansion effectively identifies more VH test cases. Moreover, symmetric\naccuracy, being unbiased, leads to different conclusions about the\nvulnerability of MLLMs to VH compared to traditional accuracy metric.

The critical challenge\nunderpinning this task is ensuring both the fidelity of the generated images\nand their semantic alignment with the provided conditions. To tackle this\nissue, previous studies have employed supervised perceptual losses derived from\npre-trained models, i.e., reward models, to enforce alignment between the\ncondition and the generated result. However, we observe one inherent\nshortcoming: considering the diversity of synthesized images, the reward model\nusually provides inaccurate feedback when encountering newly generated data,\nwhich can undermine the training process. To address this limitation, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware reward modeling, called Ctrl-U, including\nuncertainty estimation and uncertainty-aware regularization, designed to reduce\nthe adverse effects of imprecise feedback from the reward model. Given the\ninherent cognitive uncertainty within reward models, even images generated\nunder identical conditions often result in a relatively large discrepancy in\nreward loss. Inspired by the observation, we explicitly leverage such\nprediction variance as an uncertainty indicator. Based on the uncertainty\nestimation, we regularize the model training by adaptively rectifying the\nreward. In particular, rewards with lower uncertainty receive higher loss\nweights, while those with higher uncertainty are given reduced weights to allow\nfor larger variability. The proposed uncertainty regularization facilitates\nreward fine-tuning through consistency construction.

    "abstract": "Edge computing has emerged as an alternative to reduce transmission and\nprocessing delay and preserve privacy of the video streams. However, the\never-increasing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used in video-based\napplications (e.g. object detection) exerts pressure on memory-constrained edge\ndevices. Model merging is proposed to reduce the DNNs' memory footprint by\nkeeping only one copy of merged layers' weights in memory. In existing model\nmerging techniques, (i) only architecturally identical layers can be shared;\n(ii) requires computationally expensive retraining in the cloud; (iii) assumes\nthe availability of ground truth for retraining. The re-evaluation of a merged\nmodel's performance, however, requires a validation dataset with ground truth,\ntypically runs at the cloud. Common metrics to guide the selection of shared\nlayers include the size or computational cost of shared layers or\nrepresentation size. We propose a new model merging scheme by sharing\nrepresentations (i.e., outputs of layers) at the edge, guided by representation\nsimilarity S. We show that S is extremely highly correlated with merged model's\naccuracy with Pearson Correlation Coefficient |r| > 0.94 than other metrics,\ndemonstrating that representation similarity can serve as a strong validation\naccuracy indicator without ground truth. We present our preliminary results of\nthe newly proposed model merging scheme with identified challenges,\ndemonstrating a promising research future direction.",

The invariant SSL framework overcomes the deficiencies of the fixed\nlabelling by adapting the SSL system to changes in the objects behavior and\nimproving performance in dynamic situations. The above proposed method was\ntested through various simulations and real world trials, with the series\nobtaining enhanced grasp success rates of 15% over other existing methods,\nespecially under dynamic scenarios. Also, having tested for adaptation times,\nit was confirmed that the system could adapt faster, thus applicable for use in\nthe real world, such as in industrial automation and service robotics.

However, existing occupancy prediction methods\nmainly focus on designing better occupancy representations, such as\ntri-perspective view or neural radiance fields, while ignoring the advantages\nof using long-temporal information. In this paper, we propose a radar-camera\nmulti-modal temporal enhanced occupancy prediction network, dubbed TEOcc. Our\nmethod is inspired by the success of utilizing temporal information in 3D\nobject detection. Specifically, we introduce a temporal enhancement branch to\nlearn temporal occupancy prediction. In this branch, we randomly discard the\nt-k input frame of the multi-view camera and predict its 3D occupancy by\nlong-term and short-term temporal decoders separately with the information from\nother adjacent frames and multi-modal inputs. Besides, to reduce computational\ncosts and incorporate multi-modal inputs, we specially designed 3D\nconvolutional layers for long-term and short-term temporal decoders.\nFurthermore, since the lightweight occupancy prediction head is a dense\nclassification head, we propose to use a shared occupancy prediction head for\nthe temporal enhancement and main branches. It is worth noting that the\ntemporal enhancement branch is only performed during training and is discarded\nduring inference. Experiment results demonstrate that TEOcc achieves\nstate-of-the-art occupancy prediction on nuScenes benchmarks.

However,\nmany practical domains involve data that are non-identically distributed across\nsources, and statistically dependent within its source, violating vital\nassumptions in existing theoretical studies. Toward addressing these issues, we\nestablish statistical guarantees for learning general $\\textit{nonlinear}$\nrepresentations from multiple data sources that admit different input\ndistributions and possibly dependent data. Specifically, we study the\nsample-complexity of learning $T+1$ functions $f_\\star^{(t)} \\circ g_\\star$\nfrom a function class $\\mathcal F \\times \\mathcal G$, where $f_\\star^{(t)}$ are\ntask specific linear functions and $g_\\star$ is a shared nonlinear\nrepresentation. A representation $\\hat g$ is estimated using $N$ samples from\neach of $T$ source tasks, and a fine-tuning function $\\hat f^{(0)}$ is fit\nusing $N'$ samples from a target task passed through $\\hat g$. We show that\nwhen $N \\gtrsim C_{\\mathrm{dep}} (\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal F) +\n\\mathrm{C}(\\mathcal G)/T)$, the excess risk of $\\hat f^{(0)} \\circ \\hat g$ on\nthe target task decays as $\\nu_{\\mathrm{div}} \\big(\\frac{\\mathrm{dim}(\\mathcal\nF)}{N'} + \\frac{\\mathrm{C}(\\mathcal G)}{N T} \\big)$, where $C_{\\mathrm{dep}}$\ndenotes the effect of data dependency, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{div}}$ denotes an\n(estimatable) measure of $\\textit{task-diversity}$ between the source and\ntarget tasks, and $\\mathrm C(\\mathcal G)$ denotes the complexity of the\nrepresentation class $\\mathcal G$. In particular, our analysis reveals: as the\nnumber of tasks $T$ increases, both the sample requirement and risk bound\nconverge to that of $r$-dimensional regression as if $g_\\star$ had been given,\nand the effect of dependency only enters the sample requirement, leaving the\nrisk bound matching the iid setting.",

To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Fidelity Latent\nspace Active Learning (MF-LAL), a generative modeling framework that integrates\na set of oracles with varying cost-accuracy tradeoffs. Using active learning,\nwe train a surrogate model for each oracle and use these surrogates to guide\ngeneration of compounds with high predicted activity.

Our experiments on two disease-relevant proteins show that\nMF-LAL produces compounds with significantly better binding free energy scores\nthan other single and multi-fidelity approaches (~50% improvement in mean\nbinding free energy score).

For\nclarity of our presentation, we illustrate these results with examples from\nwell-known classes of two-qubit states. Moreover, the dynamical behavior of\nthese two quantifiers is carefully analyzed under the influence of local unital\nand nonunital noisy channels. The results suggest that average correlation is\nclosely related to the violation of three-setting linear steering, like its\nrelationship with Bell violation. Particularly, for a given class of states,\nthe hierarchy of nonclassicality-steering-Bell nonlocality is demonstrated.",

Let $\\mathcal{V}$ denote an $(h+k)$-dimensional vector space\nover $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Let the set $P$ consist of the subspaces of\n$\\mathcal{V}$. The set $P$, together with the inclusion partial order, is a\nposet called a projective geometry. We define a matrix $A\\in\n\\text{Mat}_{P}(\\mathbb{C})$ as follows. For $u,v\\in P$, the $(u,v)$-entry of\n$A$ is $1$ if each of $u,v$ covers $u\\cap v$, and $0$ otherwise. Fix $y\\in P$\nwith $\\dim y=k$.

Meanwhile, real-world datasets\noften contain redundant and noisy data, imposing a negative impact on training\nefficiency and model performance. Data selection has shown promise in\nidentifying the most representative samples from the entire dataset, which aims\nto minimize the performance gap with reduced training costs. Existing works\ntypically rely on single-modality information to assign importance scores for\nindividual samples, which may lead to inaccurate assessments, especially when\ndealing with noisy or corrupted samples. To address this limitation, we propose\na novel CLIP-powered data selection framework that leverages multimodal\ninformation for more robust and generalizable sample selection. Specifically,\nour framework consists of three key modules-dataset adaptation, sample scoring,\nand selection optimization-that together harness extensive pre-trained\nmultimodal knowledge to comprehensively assess sample influence and optimize\nthe selection results through multi-objective optimization. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art baselines on various benchmark datasets.

Our theoretical analysis reveals\nthat the semantic feature learning processes in FixMatch and SL are rather\ndifferent. In particular, FixMatch learns all the discriminative features of\neach semantic class, while SL only randomly captures a subset of features due\nto the well-known lottery ticket hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that our\nanalysis framework can be applied to other FixMatch-like SSL methods, e.g.,\nFlexMatch, FreeMatch, Dash, and SoftMatch.

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that Federated Learning (FL) is vulnerable to\nbackdoor attacks. Existing defenses cluster submitted updates from clients and\nselect the best cluster for aggregation. However, they often rely on\nunrealistic assumptions regarding client submissions and sampled clients\npopulation while choosing the best cluster. We show that in realistic FL\nsettings, state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses struggle to perform well against\nbackdoor attacks in FL. To address this, we highlight that backdoored\nsubmissions are adversarially biased and overconfident compared to clean\nsubmissions. We, therefore, propose an Adversarially Guided Stateful Defense\n(AGSD) against backdoor attacks on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in FL scenarios.\nAGSD employs adversarial perturbations to a small held-out dataset to compute a\nnovel metric, called the trust index, that guides the cluster selection without\nrelying on any unrealistic assumptions regarding client submissions. Moreover,\nAGSD maintains a trust state history of each client that adaptively penalizes\nbackdoored clients and rewards clean clients. In realistic FL settings, where\nSOTA defenses mostly fail to resist attacks, AGSD mostly outperforms all SOTA\ndefenses with minimal drop in clean accuracy (5% in the worst-case compared to\nbest accuracy) even when (a) given a very small held-out dataset -- typically\nAGSD assumes 50 samples (<= 0.1% of the training data) and (b) no heldout\ndataset is available, and out-of-distribution data is used instead.

Our aim was to determine the distance and stellar parameters of 521,424\nsolar-like stars from LAMOST DR9; these stars lacked precise distance\nmeasurements (uncertainties higher than 20\\% or even without any distance\nestimations) when checked with Gaia.\n  Methods. We proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict\nthe absolute magnitudes, colors, and stellar parameters (T_eff, logg, and\n[FeH]) directly from low-resolution spectra. For spectra with signal-to-noise\nratios at g band (S/N_g) greater than 10, the model achieves a precision of 85\nK for T_eff, 0.07 dex for logg, 0.06 dex for [Fe/H], 0.25 mag for M_g, and 0.03\nmag for bp-rp. The estimated distances have a median fractional error of 4%\nwith a standard deviation of 8%.\n  Results: We applied the trained CNN model to 521,424 solar-like stars to\nderive the distance and stellar parameters.

Additionally, we investigated the metallicity gradients of the\nMilky Way from a subsample, and find a radial gradient ranging from -0.05 <\nDelta{[Fe/H]}/Delta{R} < 0.0 dex/kpc and a vertical gradient ranging from -0.26\n< Delta{[Fe/H]}/Delta{Z} < -0.07dex/kpc\n  Conclusions. We conclude that our method is effective in estimating distances\nand stellar parameters for solar-like stars with limited astrometric data.

In this paper, we present SplitSEE, a structurally splittable\nframework designed for effective temporal-frequency representation learning in\nsingle-channel EEG. The key concept of SplitSEE is a self-supervised framework\nincorporating a deep clustering task. Given an EEG, we argue that the time and\nfrequency domains are two distinct perspectives, and hence, learned\nrepresentations should share the same cluster assignment. To this end, we first\npropose two domain-specific modules that independently learn domain-specific\nrepresentation and address the temporal-frequency tradeoff issue in\nconventional spectrogram-based methods. Then, we introduce a novel clustering\nloss to measure the information similarity. This encourages representations\nfrom both domains to coherently describe the same input by assigning them a\nconsistent cluster. SplitSEE leverages a pre-training-to-fine-tuning framework\nwithin a splittable architecture and has following properties: (a)\nEffectiveness: it learns representations solely from single-channel EEG but has\neven outperformed multi-channel baselines.

While QUBO involves binary\nvariables, combinatorial optimization problems frequently include integer\nvariables, which require encoding by binary variables. This process, known as\nbinary-integer encoding, includes various methods, one of which is domain-wall\nencoding - a recently proposed approach. Experiments on a quantum annealing\nmachine have demonstrated that domain-wall encoding outperforms the commonly\nused one-hot encoding in terms of objective function value and the probability\nof obtaining the optimal solution. In a digital Ising machine, domain-wall\nencoding required less computation time to reach optimal solutions compared to\none-hot encoding. However, its practical effectiveness in digital Ising\nmachines remains unclear. To address this uncertainty, the performance of\none-hot and domain-wall encoding methods was evaluated on a digital Ising\nmachine using the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). The comparison focused on\nthe dependency of penalty coefficient and sensitivity to computation time.\nDomain-wall encoding demonstrated a higher feasible solution rate when relative\npenalty coefficients for the two constraint terms were adjusted, a strategy not\ncommonly used in previous studies. Additionally, domain-wall encoding obtained\nhigher performance practical evaluation metrics for QKPs with large knapsack\ncapacities compared to one-hot encoding.

    "abstract": "The masses of fifteen baryon sets and twenty-four meson sets of three or more\nequal-quantum excited states, using Breit-Wigner PDG masses and their\nuncertainties at fixed $J^P$ for baryons and $J^{PC}$ for mesons, are fitted by\na simple two-parameter logarithmic function, $M_n = \\alpha Ln(n) + \\beta$,\nwhere $n$ is the level of radial excitation. The conjecture is made that\naccurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryons (including LHCb exotic\n$P_{c\\bar{c}}^+$s) and meson excited states (including $s\\bar{s}$, $s\\bar{c}$,\n$c\\bar{c}$, $c\\bar{b}$, and $b\\bar{b}$ states) are related by the logarithmic\nfunction used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited\nstates. The baryon ``star'' rating case is evaluated. The Cornell potential is\nan example of how a logarithmic behavior can be explained by an appropriate\npotential. Thus, a ``universal mass equation'' (UME) for equal-quantum\nexcited-state sets is presented.",

    "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, LLaMA, and Claude have\nprevailed in countless domains, including legal scenarios. With LLMs' rapid\ntechnological progress, the development of prompt engineering (PE) as an\ninterface between the LLMs and real-world applications has drawn the attention\nof all developers. Various PE methods have been proposed to overcome real-world\nchallenges, such as few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, RAG for legal judgment\nprediction (LJP) is still underexplored. To address this, we propose \"Athena\",\na novel framework cultivating RAG as a core preprocess component to enhance\nLLMs' performance on specialized tasks. Athena constructs a knowledge base for\naccusations, attached with a semantic retrieval mechanism through\nvectorization. Our experiments show that Athena's overall performance has\nimproved significantly, achieving state-of-the-art results on the CAIL2018\ndataset. Our ablation study on the in-context window size parameter further\nreproduces LLMs' \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon with a relative positional\nvariation. And with moderate hyper-parameter-tuning, we can achieve at most 95%\nof accuracy accordingly. We also study the impact of query rewriting and data\ndistribution, providing possible directions for future research based on former\nanalyses.",

Second-order\napproaches are particularly appealing for OKL as they often offer substantial\nimprovements in regret guarantees. However, existing second-order OKL\napproaches suffer from at least quadratic time complexity with respect to the\npre-set budget, rendering them unsuitable for meeting the real-time demands of\nlarge-scale streaming recommender systems. The singular value decomposition\nrequired to obtain explicit feature mapping is also computationally expensive\ndue to the complete decomposition process.

Theoretical analysis demonstrates that FORKS achieves a\nlogarithmic regret guarantee on par with other second-order approaches while\nmaintaining a linear time complexity w.r.t. the budget, significantly enhancing\nefficiency over existing approaches.

The available homomorphic algorithms\nremain restricted, especially in large dimensions, while important applications\nsuch as Large Language Models (LLM) require computing Softmax over large\ndimensional vectors. In terms of multiplicative depth of the computation (a\nsuitable measure of cost for homomorphic algorithms), our algorithm achieves\n$O(\\log n)$ complexity for a fixed range of inputs, where $n$ is the Softmax\ndimension. Our algorithm is especially adapted to the situation where we must\ncompute many Softmax at the same time, for instance, in the LLM situation.

    "abstract": "At a cocktail party, humans exhibit an impressive ability to direct their\nattention. The auditory attention detection (AAD) approach seeks to identify\nthe attended speaker by analyzing brain signals, such as EEG signals. However,\ncurrent AAD algorithms overlook the spatial distribution information within EEG\nsignals and lack the ability to capture long-range latent dependencies,\nlimiting the model's ability to decode brain activity. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes a dual attention refinement network with spatiotemporal\nconstruction for AAD, named DARNet, which consists of the spatiotemporal\nconstruction module, dual attention refinement module, and feature fusion \\&\nclassifier module. Specifically, the spatiotemporal construction module aims to\nconstruct more expressive spatiotemporal feature representations, by capturing\nthe spatial distribution characteristics of EEG signals. The dual attention\nrefinement module aims to extract different levels of temporal patterns in EEG\nsignals and enhance the model's ability to capture long-range latent\ndependencies. The feature fusion \\& classifier module aims to aggregate\ntemporal patterns and dependencies from different levels and obtain the final\nclassification results. The experimental results indicate that compared to the\nstate-of-the-art models, DARNet achieves an average classification accuracy\nimprovement of 5.9\\% for 0.1s, 4.6\\% for 1s, and 3.9\\% for 2s on the DTU\ndataset. While maintaining excellent classification performance, DARNet\nsignificantly reduces the number of required parameters.

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, bidding in power markets has attracted widespread\nattention. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used for power market\nbidding as a powerful AI tool to make decisions under real-world uncertainties.\nHowever, current RL methods mostly employ low dimensional bids, which\nsignificantly diverge from the N price-power pairs commonly used in the current\npower markets. The N-pair bidding format is denoted as High Dimensional Bids\n(HDBs), which has not been fully integrated into the existing RL-based bidding\nmethods. The loss of flexibility in current RL bidding methods could greatly\nlimit the bidding profits and make it difficult to tackle the rising\nuncertainties brought by renewable energy generations. In this paper, we intend\nto propose a framework to fully utilize HDBs for RL-based bidding methods.\nFirst, we employ a special type of neural network called Neural Network Supply\nFunctions (NNSFs) to generate HDBs in the form of N price-power pairs. Second,\nwe embed the NNSF into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to make it compatible\nwith most existing RL methods. Finally, experiments on Energy Storage Systems\n(ESSs) in the PJM Real-Time (RT) power market show that the proposed bidding\nmethod with HDBs can significantly improve bidding flexibility, thereby\nimproving the profit of the state-of-the-art RL bidding methods.",

Detections of nuclear accretion signatures in dwarf\ngalaxies provides strong evidence for the presence of these IMBHs. We develop a\nBayesian model to infer the black hole occupation fraction assuming a broken\npower law Eddington ratio distribution function. Our approach accounts for\nnon-detections, incompleteness, and contamination from star-forming-related\nemission. We apply this model to galaxies with X-ray data from the Chandra\nSource Catalog at distances $<50$ Mpc, radio data from the VLA Sky Survey at $<\n50$ Mpc, and optical variability data from the Palomar Transient Factory at\n$z<0.055$.

    "abstract": "We study the generation of high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) through\ngraviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of inflaton in the post-inflationary\nuniverse, focusing on scenarios with a polynomial inflaton potential. Two main\nreheating channels are considered: decays into bosons (spin 0) and fermions\n(spin $\\frac{1}{2}$). We compute the resulting GW spectra from three-body\ndecays, where the inflaton decays into a pair of daughter particles and a\ngraviton. We numerically compute the GW spectra for various polynomial\nexponents by employing two distinct approaches: one treating the inflaton as a\ncollection of rest particles and the other treating it as a coherently\noscillating classical field. In the former approach, only gravitons with\nenergies below half the inflaton mass are produced, while the latter allows for\nthe production of gravitons with arbitrarily high energies when the potential\nexponent is 4 or greater. This difference arises because the inflaton's\noscillations are no longer described by a single harmonic mode but instead\nconsist of infinitely many harmonic modes with different frequencies. As a\nresult, the GW spectrum exhibits multiple peaks, with these peaks being less\npronounced for higher powers of the potential. We also examine the dependence\nof the GW spectrum on the coupling constant between the inflaton and daughter\nparticles. Our findings suggest that future GW detectors targeting GWs in the\nGHz band, such as resonant cavities, may have the capability to detect these\nsignals, offering potential insights into the reheating phase of the early\nuniverse.",

In contrast to the\nstate-of-the-art kernel solver that embeds differential operators within\nkernels, posing challenges with a large number of collocation points, our\napproach eliminates these operators from the kernel. We model the solution\nusing a standard kernel interpolation form and differentiate the interpolant to\ncompute the derivatives. Our framework obviates the need for complex Gram\nmatrix construction between solutions and their derivatives, allowing for a\nstraightforward implementation and scalable computation. As an instance, we\nallocate the collocation points on a grid and adopt a product kernel, which\nyields a Kronecker product structure in the interpolation. This structure\nenables us to avoid computing the full Gram matrix, reducing costs and scaling\nefficiently to a large number of collocation points.

Yet,\nmany studies overlook the role of architecture and initial synaptic\nconnectivity in such models. Building on insights from deep learning, where\ninitialization profoundly affects learning dynamics, we ask a key but\nunderexplored neuroscience question: how does initial synaptic connectivity\nshape learning in neural circuits? To investigate this, we train recurrent\nneural networks (RNNs), which are widely used for brain modeling, with\nbiologically plausible learning rules. Our findings reveal that initial weight\nmagnitude significantly influences the learning performance of such rules,\nmirroring effects previously observed in training with backpropagation through\ntime (BPTT). By examining the maximum Lyapunov exponent before and after\ntraining, we uncovered the greater demands that certain initialization schemes\nplace on training to achieve desired information propagation properties.\nConsequently, we extended the recently proposed gradient flossing method, which\nregularizes the Lyapunov exponents, to biologically plausible learning and\nobserved an improvement in learning performance. To our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to examine the impact of initialization on biologically plausible\nlearning rules for RNNs and to subsequently propose a biologically plausible\nremedy.

In this work, we propose to introduce the sample hardness into the\ntraining of deepfake detectors via the curriculum learning paradigm.\nSpecifically, we present a novel simple yet effective strategy, named Dynamic\nFacial Forensic Curriculum (DFFC), which makes the model gradually focus on\nhard samples during the training. Firstly, we propose Dynamic Forensic Hardness\n(DFH) which integrates the facial quality score and instantaneous instance loss\nto dynamically measure sample hardness during the training. Furthermore, we\npresent a pacing function to control the data subsets from easy to hard\nthroughout the training process based on DFH. Comprehensive experiments show\nthat DFFC can improve both within- and cross-dataset performance of various\nkinds of end-to-end deepfake detectors through a plug-and-play approach.

    "abstract": "Differentiable programming allows for derivatives of functions implemented\nvia computer code to be calculated automatically. These derivatives are\ncalculated using automatic differentiation (AD). This thesis explores two\napplications of differentiable programming to computational plasma physics.\nFirst, we consider how differentiable programming can be used to simplify and\nimprove stellarator optimization. We introduce a stellarator coil design code\n(FOCUSADD) that uses gradient-based optimization to produce stellarator coils\nwith finite build. Because we use reverse mode AD, which can compute gradients\nof scalar functions with the same computational complexity as the function,\nFOCUSADD is simple, flexible, and efficient. We then discuss two additional\napplications of AD in stellarator optimization. Second, we explore how machine\nlearning (ML) can be used to improve or replace the numerical methods used to\nsolve partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on time-dependent PDEs in\nfluid mechanics relevant to plasma physics. Differentiable programming allows\nneural networks and other techniques from ML to be embedded within numerical\nmethods. This is a promising, but relatively new, research area. We focus on\ntwo basic questions. First, can we design ML-based PDE solvers that have the\nsame guarantees of conservation, stability, and positivity that standard\nnumerical methods do? The answer is yes; we introduce error-correcting\nalgorithms that preserve invariants of time-dependent PDEs. Second, which types\nof ML-based solvers work best at solving PDEs? We perform a systematic review\nof the scientific literature on solving PDEs with ML. Unfortunately we discover\ntwo issues, weak baselines and reporting biases, that affect the interpretation\nreproducibility of a significant majority of published research.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using formal\nmethods-based techniques to safely achieve temporal tasks, such as timed\nsequence of goals, or patrolling objectives. Such tasks are often expressed in\nreal-time logics such as Signal Temporal Logic (STL), whereby, the logical\nspecification is encoded into an optimization problem. Such approaches usually\ninvolve optimizing over the quantitative semantics, or robustness degree, of\nthe logic over bounded horizons: the semantics can be encoded as mixed-integer\nlinear constraints or into smooth approximations of the robustness degree. A\nmajor limitation of this approach is that it faces scalability challenges with\nrespect to temporal complexity: for example, encoding long-term tasks requires\nstoring the entire history of the system. In this paper, we present a\nquantitative generalization of such tasks in the form of symbolic automata\nobjectives. Specifically, we show that symbolic automata can be expressed as\nmatrix operators that lend themselves to automatic differentiation, allowing\nfor the use of off-the-shelf gradient-based optimizers. We show how this helps\nsolve the need to store arbitrarily long system trajectories, while efficiently\nleveraging the task structure encoded in the automaton.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic-Resolution Photoacoustic Microscopy (AR-PAM) is promising for\nsubcutaneous vascular imaging, but its spatial resolution is constrained by the\nPoint Spread Function (PSF). Traditional deconvolution methods like\nRichardson-Lucy and model-based deconvolution use the PSF to improve\nresolution. However, accurately measuring the PSF is difficult, leading to\nreliance on less accurate blind deconvolution techniques. Additionally, AR-PAM\nsuffers from long scanning times, which can be reduced via down-sampling, but\nthis necessitates effective image recovery from under-sampled data, a task\nwhere traditional interpolation methods fall short, particularly at high\nunder-sampling rates. To address these challenges, we propose an approach based\non Implicit Neural Representations (INR). This method learns a continuous\nmapping from spatial coordinates to initial acoustic pressure, overcoming the\nlimitations of discrete imaging and enhancing AR-PAM's resolution. By treating\nthe PSF as a learnable parameter within the INR framework, our technique\nmitigates inaccuracies associated with PSF estimation. We evaluated our method\non simulated vascular data, showing significant improvements in Peak\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) over\nconventional methods. Qualitative enhancements were also observed in leaf vein\nand in vivo mouse brain microvasculature images.

Our RT models successfully reproduced the Mg II line\nprofiles for all 33 galaxies, revealing a necessary condition for strong LyC\nleakage: high maximum clump outflow velocity ($v_{\\rm MgII,\\,max} \\gtrsim\n390\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$) and low total Mg II column density ($N_{\\rm MgII,\\,tot}\n\\lesssim 10^{14.3}\\,\\rm cm^{-2}$).

In addition, using archival HST COS/G160M data, we modeled\nLy$\\alpha$ profiles for six objects and found that their spectral properties do\nnot fully align with the conventional LyC leakage criteria, yet no clear\ncorrelation was identified between the modeled parameters and observed LyC\nescape fractions. We inferred LyC escape fractions based on HI properties from\nLy$\\alpha$ RT modeling and found that LyC leakage is primarily governed by the\nnumber of optically thick HI clumps per sightline ($f_{\\rm cl}$).

Future\nhigh-resolution, spatially resolved observations are crucial for resolving this\npuzzle. Overall, our results support a \"picket fence\" geometry over a\n\"density-bounded\" scenario for the CGM, where a combination of high Mg II\noutflow velocities and low Mg II column densities may be correlated with the\npresence of more low-density HI channels that facilitate LyC escape.",
