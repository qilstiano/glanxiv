    "abstract": "Context:Halo formation time, which quantifies the mass assembly history of\ndark-matter halos, directly impacts galaxy properties and evolution. Although\nnot directly observable, it can be inferred through proxies like star formation\nhistory or galaxy spatial distributions. Recent advances in machine learning\nenable more accurate predictions of halo formation time using galaxy and halo\nproperties.\n  Aims:This study aims to investigate a machine learning-based approach to\npredict halo formation time-defined as the epoch when a halo accretes half of\nits current mass-using both halo and baryonic properties derived from\ncosmological simulations. By incorporating properties associated with the\nbrightest cluster galaxy located at the cluster center, its associated\nintracluster light component and satellite galaxies, we aim to surpass these\nanalytical predictions, improve prediction accuracy and identify key properties\nthat can provide the best proxy for the halo assembly history.\n  Methods:Using The Three Hundred cosmological simulations, we train Random\nForest (RF) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models on halo and baryonic\nproperties, such as mass, concentration, stellar and gas masses, and features\nof the brightest cluster galaxy and intracluster light. CNN models are trained\non two-dimensional radial property maps. We also construct simple linear models\nusing only observationally accessible features. Results:RF models show median\nbiases of 4%-9% with standard deviations of 20%. CNN models reduce median bias\nto <4%, although they have higher scatter. Simple linear models using a limited\nnumber of observables achieve prediction accuracy comparable to RF models.\nTraditional relations between halo formation time and mass/concentration are\npreserved.",

The introduction of a time axis provides\nconsiderable design freedom, and a central question is how to exploit this\nfreedom. Though many popular methods seek straight line (i.e., zero\nacceleration) trajectories, we show here that a specific class of ``curved''\ntrajectories can significantly improve approximation and learning. In\nparticular, we consider the unit-time interpolation of any given transport map\n$T$ and seek the schedule $\\tau: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$ that minimizes the spatial\nLipschitz constant of the corresponding velocity field over all times $t \\in\n[0,1]$. This quantity is crucial as it allows for control of the approximation\nerror when the velocity field is learned from data. We show that, for a broad\nclass of source/target measures and transport maps $T$, the \\emph{optimal\nschedule} can be computed in closed form, and that the resulting optimal\nLipschitz constant is \\emph{exponentially smaller} than that induced by an\nidentity schedule (corresponding to, for instance, the Wasserstein geodesic).\nOur proof technique relies on the calculus of variations and\n$\\Gamma$-convergence, allowing us to approximate the aforementioned degenerate\nobjective by a family of smooth, tractable problems.",

    "abstract": "Visual object tracking is a crucial research topic in the fields of computer\nvision and multi-modal fusion. Among various approaches, robust visual tracking\nthat combines RGB frames with Event streams has attracted increasing attention\nfrom researchers. While striving for high accuracy and efficiency in tracking,\nit is also important to explore how to effectively conduct adversarial attacks\nand defenses on RGB-Event stream tracking algorithms, yet research in this area\nremains relatively scarce. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a\ncross-modal adversarial attack algorithm for RGB-Event visual tracking. Because\nof the diverse representations of Event streams, and given that Event voxels\nand frames are more commonly used, this paper will focus on these two\nrepresentations for an in-depth study. Specifically, for the RGB-Event voxel,\nwe first optimize the perturbation by adversarial loss to generate RGB frame\nadversarial examples. For discrete Event voxel representations, we propose a\ntwo-step attack strategy, more in detail, we first inject Event voxels into the\ntarget region as initialized adversarial examples, then, conduct a\ngradient-guided optimization by perturbing the spatial location of the Event\nvoxels. For the RGB-Event frame based tracking, we optimize the cross-modal\nuniversal perturbation by integrating the gradient information from multimodal\ndata. We evaluate the proposed approach against attacks on three widely used\nRGB-Event Tracking datasets, i.e., COESOT, FE108, and VisEvent. Extensive\nexperiments show that our method significantly reduces the performance of the\ntracker across numerous datasets in both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

Under-resolved LBMs\nare unstable, and while there is a number of important efforts to stabilize\nthem, they often face limitations in generalizing across scales and physical\nsystems. We present a novel, data-driven, multiagent reinforcement learning\n(MARL) approach that drastically improves stability and accuracy of\ncoarse-grained LBM simulations.

We find that the MARL closures stabilize the simulations and recover the\nenergy spectra of significantly more expensive fully resolved simulations while\nmaintaining computational efficiency.

Each AIOS node\noperates as a server to host and execute agents, while supporting peer-to-peer\ncoordination without reliance on centralized orchestration. Based on AIOS\nServer, we further present the world's first practically deployed Internet of\nAgentsites (AIOS-IoA), including AgentHub for agent registration and discovery\nand AgentChat for interactive communication, at https://planet.aios.foundation.\nThe agent discovery mechanism based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) and a\nGossip protocol serves as the search engine for the internet of agentsites.\nThis work provides a practical foundation for building the Internet of\nAgentsites-a new paradigm where autonomous agents become first-class citizens\nof the web. The implementation is available at\nhttps://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.Server and is integrated into the AIOS main\nbranch at https://github.com/agiresearch/AIOS.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for AR/VR applications has highlighted the need for\nhigh-quality 360-degree panoramic content. However, generating high-quality\n360-degree panoramic images and videos remains a challenging task due to the\nsevere distortions introduced by equirectangular projection (ERP). Existing\napproaches either fine-tune pretrained diffusion models on limited ERP datasets\nor attempt tuning-free methods that still rely on ERP latent representations,\nleading to discontinuities near the poles. In this paper, we introduce\nSphereDiff, a novel approach for seamless 360-degree panoramic image and video\ngeneration using state-of-the-art diffusion models without additional tuning.\nWe define a spherical latent representation that ensures uniform distribution\nacross all perspectives, mitigating the distortions inherent in ERP. We extend\nMultiDiffusion to spherical latent space and propose a spherical latent\nsampling method to enable direct use of pretrained diffusion models. Moreover,\nwe introduce distortion-aware weighted averaging to further improve the\ngeneration quality in the projection process. Our method outperforms existing\napproaches in generating 360-degree panoramic content while maintaining high\nfidelity, making it a robust solution for immersive AR/VR applications.

Existing methods primarily focus on either adversarial defense or\nhallucination post-hoc correction, leaving a gap in unified robustness\nstrategies. We introduce \\textbf{Hydra}, an adaptive agentic framework that\nenhances plug-in VLMs through iterative reasoning, structured critiques, and\ncross-model verification, improving both resilience to adversarial\nperturbations and intrinsic model errors. Hydra employs an Action-Critique\nLoop, where it retrieves and critiques visual information, leveraging\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) techniques to refine\noutputs dynamically. Unlike static post-hoc correction methods, Hydra adapts to\nboth adversarial manipulations and intrinsic model errors, making it robust to\nmalicious perturbations and hallucination-related inaccuracies. We evaluate\nHydra on four VLMs, three hallucination benchmarks, two adversarial attack\nstrategies, and two adversarial defense methods, assessing performance on both\nclean and adversarial inputs. Results show that Hydra surpasses plug-in VLMs\nand state-of-the-art (SOTA) dehallucination methods, even without explicit\nadversarial defenses, demonstrating enhanced robustness and factual\nconsistency. By bridging adversarial resistance and hallucination mitigation,\nHydra provides a scalable, training-free solution for improving the reliability\nof VLMs in real-world applications.",

Unlike standard machine\nlearning datasets, these videos are designed for human learners, often mixing\nmedical imagery with narration, explanatory diagrams, and contextual framing.\nIn this work, we investigate whether such pedagogically rich, yet\nnon-standardized and heterogeneous videos can effectively teach general-domain\nvision-language models biomedical knowledge. To this end, we introduce\nOpenBiomedVi, a biomedical video instruction tuning dataset comprising 1031\nhours of video-caption and Q/A pairs, curated through a multi-step\nhuman-in-the-loop pipeline. Diverse biomedical video datasets are rare, and\nOpenBiomedVid fills an important gap by providing instruction-style supervision\ngrounded in real-world educational content. Surprisingly, despite the informal\nand heterogeneous nature of these videos, the fine-tuned Qwen-2-VL models\nexhibit substantial performance improvements across most benchmarks. The 2B\nmodel achieves gains of 98.7% on video tasks, 71.2% on image tasks, and 0.2% on\ntext tasks. The 7B model shows improvements of 37.09% on video and 11.2% on\nimage tasks, with a slight degradation of 2.7% on text tasks compared to their\nrespective base models. To address the lack of standardized biomedical video\nevaluation datasets, we also introduce two new expert curated benchmarks,\nMIMICEchoQA and SurgeryVideoQA. On these benchmarks, the 2B model achieves\ngains of 99.1% and 98.1%, while the 7B model shows gains of 22.5% and 52.1%,\nrespectively, demonstrating the models' ability to generalize and perform\nbiomedical video understanding on cleaner and more standardized datasets than\nthose seen during training.

While absolute positional embeddings (APE)\nhave shown theoretical advantages over relative positional embeddings (RPE),\nparticularly due to the ability of sinusoidal functions to preserve spatial\ninductive biases like monotonicity and shift invariance, a fundamental\nchallenge arises when mapping a 2D grid to a 1D sequence. Existing methods have\nmostly overlooked or never explored the impact of patch ordering in positional\nembeddings. To address this, we propose LOOPE, a learnable patch-ordering\nmethod that optimizes spatial representation for a given set of frequencies,\nproviding a principled approach to patch order optimization. Empirical results\nshow that our PE significantly improves classification accuracy across various\nViT architectures. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of positional\nembeddings, we introduce the \"Three Cell Experiment\", a novel benchmarking\nframework that assesses the ability of PEs to retain relative and absolute\npositional information across different ViT architectures. Unlike standard\nevaluations, which typically report a performance gap of 4 to 6% between models\nwith and without PE, our method reveals a striking 30 to 35% difference,\noffering a more sensitive diagnostic tool to measure the efficacy of PEs.

While recent advances like neural rendering and 3D\nGaussian splatting have enabled high-quality digital human avatar creation and\nanimation, most methods rely on multiple images or multi-view inputs, limiting\ntheir practicality for real-world use. In this paper, we propose SEGA, a novel\napproach for Single-imagE-based 3D drivable Gaussian head Avatar creation that\ncombines generalized prior models with a new hierarchical UV-space Gaussian\nSplatting framework. SEGA seamlessly combines priors derived from large-scale\n2D datasets with 3D priors learned from multi-view, multi-expression, and\nmulti-ID data, achieving robust generalization to unseen identities while\nensuring 3D consistency across novel viewpoints and expressions. We further\npresent a hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework that leverages\nFLAME-based structural priors and employs a dual-branch architecture to\ndisentangle dynamic and static facial components effectively. The dynamic\nbranch encodes expression-driven fine details, while the static branch focuses\non expression-invariant regions, enabling efficient parameter inference and\nprecomputation. This design maximizes the utility of limited 3D data and\nachieves real-time performance for animation and rendering. Additionally, SEGA\nperforms person-specific fine-tuning to further enhance the fidelity and\nrealism of the generated avatars.

In this work, we propose Spiking Point Mamba (SPM), the first\nMamba-based SNN in the 3D domain. Due to the poor performance of simply\ntransferring Mamba to 3D SNNs, SPM is designed to utilize both the sequence\nmodeling capabilities of Mamba and the temporal feature extraction of SNNs.\nSpecifically, we first introduce Hierarchical Dynamic Encoding (HDE), an\nimproved direct encoding method that effectively introduces dynamic temporal\nmechanism, thereby facilitating temporal interactions. Then, we propose a\nSpiking Mamba Block (SMB), which builds upon Mamba while learning\ninter-time-step features and minimizing information loss caused by spikes.\nFinally, to further enhance model performance, we adopt an asymmetric SNN-ANN\narchitecture for spike-based pre-training and finetune.

    "abstract": "The recent successes of large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of\ntheoretical research into language generation. A recent line of work proposes\nan abstract view, called language generation in the limit, where generation is\nseen as a game between an adversary and an algorithm: the adversary generates\nstrings from an unknown language $K$, chosen from a countable collection of\ncandidate languages, and after seeing a finite set of these strings, the\nalgorithm must generate new strings from $K$ that it has not seen before. This\nformalism highlights a key tension: the trade-off between validity (the\nalgorithm should only produce strings from the language) and breadth (it should\nbe able to produce many strings from the language). This trade-off is central\nin applied language generation as well, where it appears as a balance between\nhallucination (generating invalid utterances) and mode collapse (generating\nonly a restricted set of outputs). Despite its importance, this trade-off has\nbeen challenging to study quantitatively. We develop ways to quantify this\ntrade-off by formalizing breadth using measures of density. Existing algorithms\nfor language generation in the limit produce output sets that can have zero\ndensity in the true language, and this important failure of breadth might seem\nunavoidable. We show, however, that such a failure is not necessary: we provide\nan algorithm for language generation in the limit whose outputs have strictly\npositive density in $K$. We also study the internal representations built by\nthese algorithms, specifically the sequence of hypothesized candidate languages\nthey consider, and show that achieving the strongest form of breadth may\nrequire oscillating indefinitely between high- and low-density representations.\nOur analysis introduces a novel topology on language families, with notions of\nconvergence and limit points playing a key role.",

While public data assumptions may be\nreasonable in text and image domains, they are less likely to hold for tabular\ndata due to tabular data heterogeneity across domains. We propose leveraging\npowerful priors to address this limitation; specifically, we synthesize\nrealistic tabular data directly from schema-level specifications - such as\nvariable names, types, and permissible ranges - without ever accessing\nsensitive records. To that end, this work introduces the notion of \"surrogate\"\npublic data - datasets generated independently of sensitive data, which consume\nno privacy loss budget and are constructed solely from publicly available\nschema or metadata. Surrogate public data are intended to encode plausible\nstatistical assumptions (informed by publicly available information) into a\ndataset with many downstream uses in private mechanisms. We automate the\nprocess of generating surrogate public data with large language models (LLMs);\nin particular, we propose two methods: direct record generation as CSV files,\nand automated structural causal model (SCM) construction for sampling records.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that surrogate public tabular\ndata can effectively replace traditional public data when pretraining\ndifferentially private tabular classifiers. To a lesser extent, surrogate\npublic data are also useful for hyperparameter tuning of DP synthetic data\ngenerators, and for estimating the privacy-utility tradeoff.",

In contrast, supporting multiple N:M patterns to provide sparse\nrepresentational freedom introduces costly overhead in hardware. To address\nthese challenges for LLMs, we first present a flexible layer-wise\noutlier-density-aware N:M sparsity (FLOW) selection method. FLOW enables the\nidentification of optimal layer-wise N and M values (from a given range) by\nsimultaneously accounting for the presence and distribution of outliers,\nallowing a higher degree of representational freedom. To deploy sparse models\nwith such N:M flexibility, we then introduce a flexible, low-overhead digital\ncompute-in-memory architecture (FlexCiM). FlexCiM supports diverse sparsity\npatterns by partitioning a digital CiM (DCiM) macro into smaller sub-macros,\nwhich are adaptively aggregated and disaggregated through distribution and\nmerging mechanisms for different N and M values. Extensive experiments on both\ntransformer-based and recurrence-based state space foundation models (SSMs)\ndemonstrate that FLOW outperforms existing alternatives with an accuracy\nimprovement of up to 36%, while FlexCiM achieves up to 1.75x lower inference\nlatency and 1.5x lower energy consumption compared to existing sparse\naccelerators.

The early suppression of these potentially valuable\nsolution ideas by the policy gradient hinders the model's ability to revisit\nand re-explore these ideas later.

    "abstract": "Large-scale adoption of commercial and personal Electric Vehicles (EVs) is\nexpected to significantly affect traffic flow dynamics, emissions, and energy\nconsumption in the transportation sector. Range anxiety and challenges\nassociated with charging EVs are among the key issues that reduce the adoption\nrate of EVs and, in turn, limit their system-level impacts. A promising\nsolution to address these challenges is the introduction of charging while\ndriving (CWD) lanes. Although technological advancements have made it possible\nto charge vehicles wirelessly while driving, introducing such lanes to the\ntraffic stream can potentially disturb traffic flow and result in new\ncongestion patterns. This study puts forward a framework to investigate the\neffects of CWD lanes on traffic flow, considering %autonomy, speed\nharmonization, and environmental factors for different market penetration rates\n(MPRs) of personal and commercial EVs. Different policies have been\ninvestigated to suggest the best design for CWD lanes. Results indicate that\nintroducing CWD lanes can decrease overall traffic throughput and increase\ncongestion due to additional lane-changing maneuvers by electric vehicles\naiming to utilize the CWD lane. Although higher MPRs of EVs help stabilize\ntraffic flow and reduce the number of shockwaves, speed disruption tends to\nincrease in the CWD lane and propagate to adjacent lanes. Emission analyses\nshow significant reductions (up to 63\\%) in pollution levels with increasing\nMPRs of personal and commercial EVs. Our analysis shows that while CWD lanes\ncan facilitate the adoption of EVs, they can deteriorate traffic efficiency,\nemphasizing the importance of careful design and policy considerations.",

We develop exact\nformulations for both fully connected and convolutional architectures by\nmodeling nonlinearities such as ReLU activations through binary variables and\nencoding structural sparsity via filter- and layer-level pruning constraints.\nThe resulting models integrate parameter learning, architecture selection, and\nstructural regularization within a single optimization problem, yielding\nglobally optimal solutions with respect to a composite objective that balances\nprediction accuracy, weight sparsity, and architectural compactness. The\nmixed-integer programming formulation accommodates piecewise-linear operations,\nincluding max pooling and activation gating, and permits precise enforcement of\nlogic-based or domain-specific constraints. By incorporating considerations of\ninterpretability, sparsity, and verifiability directly into the training\nprocess, the proposed framework bridges a range of research areas including\nexplainable artificial intelligence, symbolic reasoning, and formal\nverification.",

To achieve this,\nprior methods employ DDIM inversion to transform source frames into latent\nnoise, which is then fed into a pre-trained diffusion model, conditioned on the\nuser-edited first frame, to generate the edited video.

Our approach enhances\nmulti-drone collaboration in AISs by combining infotaxis (a cognitive search\nstrategy) with optimized source term estimation and an innovative cooperative\nmechanism. Specifically, we introduce a novel source term estimation method\nthat utilizes multiple parallel particle filters, with each filter dedicated to\nestimating the parameters of a potentially unknown source within the search\nscene. Furthermore, we develop a cooperative mechanism based on dynamic\nlikelihood weights to prevent multiple drones from simultaneously estimating\nand searching for the same source, thus optimizing the energy efficiency and\nsearch coverage of the consumer AIS. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nDLW-CI approach significantly outperforms baseline methods regarding success\nrate, accuracy, and root mean square error, particularly in scenarios with\nrelatively few sources, regardless of the presence of obstacles. Also, the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is verified in a diffusion scenario\ngenerated by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model.

Our framework also eliminates the problem of\nfree-riders, ensuring fairness in the distribution of block rewards. We perform\na detailed security analysis of our framework and prove our scheme as secure as\nhash-based PoW.

The Ni\n$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals display bonding-antibonding, or\nbonding-antibonding-nonbonding, characteristic splittings, depending on the\neven or odd number of stacking layers $m$. In addition, the ratio of the\nin-plane interorbital hopping between $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals\nand in-plane intraorbital hopping between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals was found to\nbe large in La$_{m+1}$Ni$_m$O$_{3m+1}$ ($m = 1$ to 6), and this ratio increases\nfrom $m = 1$ to $m = 6$, suggesting that the in-plane hybridization will\nincrease as the layer number $m$ increases. In contrast to the dominant\n$s^\\pm$--wave state driven by spin fluctuations in the bilayer\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, two nearly degenerate\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and $s^\\pm$-wave leading states were obtained in the\nfour-layer stacking La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and five-layer stacking\nLa$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$. The leading $s^\\pm$-wave state was recovered in the\nsix-layer material La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$. In general, at the level of the random\nphase approximation treatment, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$\ndecreases in stoichiometric bulk systems from the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to\nthe six-layer La$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, despite the $m$ dependent dominant pairing.\nBoth in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic correlations are found to be quite\ncomplex. Within the in-plane direction, we obtained the peak of the magnetic\nsusceptibility at ${\\bf q} = (0.6 \\pi, 0.6 \\pi)$ for La$_5$Ni$_4$O$_{13}$ and\nLa$_7$Ni$_6$O$_{19}$, and at ${\\bf q} = (0.7 \\pi, 0.7 \\pi)$ for\nLa$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{16}$.",

Driven\nby Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) agents hold the potential to empower the creation,\nmaintenance, and evolution of mobile metaverses. Currently, AI agents are\nprimarily constructed using cloud-based LLMs and VLMs. However, several\nchallenges hinder their effective implementation, including high service\nlatency and potential sensitive data leakage during perception and processing.\nIn this paper, we develop an edge-cloud collaboration-based federated AI agent\nconstruction framework in mobile metaverses. Specifically, Edge Servers (ESs),\nacting as agent infrastructures, collaboratively create agent modules in a\ndistributed manner. The cloud server then integrates these modules into AI\nagents and deploys them at the edge, thereby enabling low-latency AI agent\nservices for users. Considering that ESs may exhibit dynamic levels of\nwillingness to participate in federated AI agent construction, we design a\ntwo-period dynamic contract model to continuously motivate ESs to participate\nin agent module creation, effectively addressing the dynamic information\nasymmetry between the cloud server and the ESs. Furthermore, we propose an\nEnhanced Diffusion Model-based Soft Actor-Critic (EDMSAC) algorithm to\nefficiently generate optimal dynamic contracts, in which dynamic structured\npruning is applied to DM-based actor networks to enhance denoising efficiency\nand policy learning performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of the EDMSAC algorithm and the proposed contract\nmodel.",

Special attention is given to the role of the\nanisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization\nstates with distinct chiral properties, referred to as \"flexons\". In the first\npart of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the\npolarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures\nin uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the\ntransition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs\ngradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings\nindicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains,\ntermed as \"flexo-chemical\" coupling, can significantly influence the effective\nCurie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality\nin multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening\neffects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization\nmorphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of\nthe review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral\npolar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics\nelements and cryptography.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose LDAO (Local Distribution-based Adaptive Oversampling),\na novel data-level approach that avoids categorizing individual samples as rare\nor frequent. Instead, LDAO learns the global distribution structure by\ndecomposing the dataset into a mixture of local distributions, each preserving\nits statistical characteristics. LDAO then models and samples from each local\ndistribution independently before merging them into a balanced training set.\nLDAO achieves a balanced representation across the entire target range while\npreserving the inherent statistical structure within each local distribution.\nIn extensive evaluations on 45 imbalanced datasets, LDAO outperforms\nstate-of-the-art oversampling methods on both frequent and rare target values,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness for addressing the challenge of imbalanced\nregression.",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel saliency-guided\nSiamese network tracker based on key fine-grained feature infor-mation. First,\nwe introduce a fine-grained feature parallel learning convolu-tional block with\na dual-stream architecture and convolutional kernels of varying sizes. This\ndesign captures essential global features from shallow layers, enhances feature\ndiversity, and minimizes the loss of fine-grained in-formation typically\nencountered in residual connections. In addition, we propose a multi-layer\nfine-grained feature fusion module that uses bilinear matrix multiplication to\neffectively integrate features across both deep and shallow layers. Next, we\nintroduce a Siamese residual refinement block that corrects saliency map\nprediction errors using residual learning. Combined with deep supervision, this\nmechanism progressively refines predictions, ap-plying supervision at each\nrecursive step to ensure consistent improvements in accuracy. Finally, we\npresent a saliency loss function to constrain the sali-ency predictions,\ndirecting the network to focus on highly discriminative fi-ne-grained features.\nExtensive experiment results demonstrate that the pro-posed tracker achieves\nthe highest precision and success rates on the PTB-TIR and LSOTB-TIR\nbenchmarks.

    "abstract": "Advances in self-distillation have shown that when knowledge is distilled\nfrom a teacher to a student using the same deep learning (DL) architecture, the\nstudent performance can surpass the teacher particularly when the network is\noverparameterized and the teacher is trained with early stopping.\nAlternatively, ensemble learning also improves performance, although training,\nstoring, and deploying multiple models becomes impractical as the number of\nmodels grows. Even distilling an ensemble to a single student model or weight\naveraging methods first requires training of multiple teacher models and does\nnot fully leverage the inherent stochasticity for generating and distilling\ndiversity in DL models. These constraints are particularly prohibitive in\nresource-constrained or latency-sensitive applications such as wearable\ndevices. This paper proposes to train only one model and generate multiple\ndiverse teacher representations using distillation-time dropout. However,\ngenerating these representations stochastically leads to noisy representations\nthat are misaligned with the learned task. To overcome this problem, a novel\nstochastic self-distillation (SSD) training strategy is introduced for\nfiltering and weighting teacher representation to distill from task-relevant\nrepresentations only, using student-guided knowledge distillation (SGKD). The\nstudent representation at each distillation step is used as authority to guide\nthe distillation process. Experimental results on real-world affective\ncomputing, wearable/biosignal datasets from the UCR Archive, the HAR dataset,\nand image classification datasets show that the proposed SSD method can\noutperform state-of-the-art methods without increasing the model size at both\ntraining and testing time, and incurs negligible computational complexity\ncompared to state-of-the-art ensemble learning and weight averaging methods.",

    "abstract": "Radio maps (RMs) are essential for environment-aware communication and\nsensing, providing location-specific wireless channel information. Existing RM\nconstruction methods often rely on precise environmental data and base station\n(BS) locations, which are not always available in dynamic or privacy-sensitive\nenvironments. While sparse measurement techniques reduce data collection, the\nimpact of noise in sparse data on RM accuracy is not well understood. This\npaper addresses these challenges by formulating RM construction as a Bayesian\ninverse problem under coarse environmental knowledge and noisy sparse\nmeasurements. Although maximum a posteriori (MAP) filtering offers an optimal\nsolution, it requires a precise prior distribution of the RM, which is\ntypically unavailable. To solve this, we propose RadioDiff-Inverse, a\ndiffusion-enhanced Bayesian inverse estimation framework that uses an\nunconditional generative diffusion model to learn the RM prior. This approach\nnot only reconstructs the spatial distribution of wireless channel features but\nalso enables environmental structure perception, such as building outlines, and\nlocation of BS just relay on pathloss, through integrated sensing and\ncommunication (ISAC). Remarkably, RadioDiff-Inverse is training-free,\nleveraging a pre-trained model from Imagenet without task-specific fine-tuning,\nwhich significantly reduces the training cost of using generative large model\nin wireless networks. Experimental results demonstrate that RadioDiff-Inverse\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy of RM construction and\nenvironmental reconstruction, and robustness against noisy sparse sampling.",

We derive explicit relationships linking the uniform structural\ngrowth rate to the parameters of the normal distribution and the variance of a\nsmall stochastic perturbation.

While\nrecent diffusion models have shown promise, they often struggle with\nmaintaining coherence between known and unknown (missing) regions. This issue\narises from the lack of explicit spatial and semantic alignment during the\ndiffusion process, resulting in content that does not smoothly integrate with\nthe original image. Additionally, diffusion models typically rely on global\nlearned distributions rather than localized features, leading to\ninconsistencies between the generated and existing image parts. In this work,\nwe propose ConFill, a novel framework that introduces a Context-Adaptive\nDiscrepancy (CAD) model to ensure that intermediate distributions of known and\nunknown regions are closely aligned throughout the diffusion process. By\nincorporating CAD, our model progressively reduces discrepancies between\ngenerated and original images at each diffusion step, leading to contextually\naligned completion. Moreover, ConFill uses a new Dynamic Sampling mechanism\nthat adaptively increases the sampling rate in regions with high reconstruction\ncomplexity. This approach enables precise adjustments, enhancing detail and\nintegration in restored areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConFill\noutperforms current methods, setting a new benchmark in image completion.",

This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks\nthat bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more\ncomprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these\ntasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded\nsystem programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench\nconsists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware\nplatforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover\nseveral key findings.

In\nthe cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance\nwith MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8%\npass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4%\npass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like\nDeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this\ndomain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge\nduring pretraining.

These strategies result in significant improvements, with\nDeepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.\nAdditionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from\n21.4% to 27.8%.",

As numerical attributes become increasingly essential\nin characterizing entities and relations in KGs, the ability to reason over\nthese attributes has gained significant importance. Existing graph-based\nmethods such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Knowledge Graph Embeddings\n(KGEs), primarily focus on aggregating homogeneous local neighbors and\nimplicitly embedding diverse triples.

This paper proposes a framework for low-cost and real-time\nimplementation of deep spike detection, which consists of two one-dimensional\n(1-D) convolutional neural network (CNN) model for channel selection and\nartefact removal. The framework utilizes simulation and hardware layers, and it\napplies several low-power techniques to optimise the implementation cost of a\n1-D CNN model. A compact CNN model with 210 bytes memory size is achieved using\nstructured pruning, network projection and quantization in the simulation\nlayer. The hardware layer also accommodates various techniques including a\ncustomized multiply-accumulate (MAC) engine, novel fused layers in the\nconvolution pipeline and proposing flexible resource allocation for a\npower-efficient and low-delay design. The optimized 1-D CNN significantly\ndecreases both computational complexity and model size, with only a minimal\nreduction in accuracy. Classification of 1-D CNN on the Cyclone V 5CSEMA5F31C6\nFPGA evaluation platform is accomplished in just 16.8 microseconds at a\nfrequency of 2.5 MHz.

Despite the considerable interest that style\ntransfer has garnered among researchers, most efforts have focused on enhancing\nthe quality of output images through advanced AI algorithms. In this paper, we\napproach style transfer from an aesthetic perspective, thereby bridging AI\ntechniques and aesthetics. We analyze two style transfer algorithms: one based\non convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the other utilizing recent\nTransformer models. By comparing the images produced by each, we explore the\nelements that constitute the style of artworks through an aesthetic analysis of\nthe style transfer results.

With the flourishing of\nmultimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency\nprediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues\nguide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic\nguidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues\ncan improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to\nsimultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper,\nand propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video\nsaliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image\ngeneration task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts\nsaliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large\nmultimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and\nintroduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate\nimage-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the\nmodel to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the\ntextual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another\nconditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions\nindicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT)\ndirectly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may\naffect the estimation of the noise level.

Different regimes of light-matter\ncoupling have been studied using different approximations, one of which is\nrotating wave approximation(RWA), which is said to be valid for weak coupling\nand near resonant regimes. In this study, we have categorized the light-matter\ncoupling into four regimes depending on the validity of the RWA as moderate,\n$\\lambda/\\omega_c\\leq 0.1$, strong, $0.1 \\leq \\lambda/\\omega_c\\leq 0.5$,\nultra-strong, $0.5 \\leq\\lambda/\\omega_c\\leq 1.0$ and deep-strong,\n$\\lambda/\\omega_c\\geq 1.0$ coupling, where $\\lambda$ is the coupling strength\nand $\\omega_c$ is the cavity frequency. In experiments, vacuum Rabi-splitting\nhas been observed which is a clear indication of formation of polaritonic\nstates. It is a common misunderstanding that the cavity remains in vacuum state\nwhen the coupled system is in the ground state. Here we show that upon\ncoupling, the cavity has non-zero excitation even in the ground state, which is\nnot captured by RWA.

Recent advances\nin generative modeling aim to address these issues by providing uncertainty\nquantification and correction. However, the quality of generated simulation\nremains heavily dependent on the choice of conditioning priors. In this work,\nwe present an efficient generative framework for dynamics emulation, unifying\nprinciples of turbulence with diffusion-based modeling: Cohesion. Specifically,\nour method estimates large-scale coherent structure of the underlying dynamics\nas guidance during the denoising process, where small-scale fluctuation in the\nflow is then resolved. These coherent priors are efficiently approximated using\nreduced-order models, such as deep Koopman operators, that allow for rapid\ngeneration of long prior sequences while maintaining stability over extended\nforecasting horizon.

This model offers a natural abstraction of transportation\nnetworks where each transportation link connects two destinations periodically.\nFrom a network design perspective, a crucial task is to assign the time-labels\non the edges in a way that optimizes some criterion. In this paper we introduce\na very natural optimality criterion that captures how the temporal distances of\nall vertex pairs are `stretched', compared to their physical distances, i.e.\ntheir distances in the underlying static (non-temporal) graph. Given a static\ngraph $G$, the task is to assign to each edge one time-label between 1 and\n$\\Delta$ such that, in the resulting periodic temporal graph with\nperiod~$\\Delta$, the duration of the fastest temporal path from any vertex $u$\nto any other vertex $v$ is at most $\\alpha$ times the distance between $u$ and\n$v$ in $G$. Here, the value of $\\alpha$ measures how much the shortest paths\nare allowed to be \\emph{stretched} once we assign the periodic time-labels.\n  Our results span three different directions: First, we provide a series of\napproximation and NP-hardness results. Second, we provide approximation and\nfixed-parameter algorithms. Among them, we provide a simple polynomial-time\nalgorithm (the \\textit{radius-algorithm}) which always guarantees an\napproximation strictly smaller than $\\Delta$, and which also computes the\noptimum stretch in some cases. Third, we consider a parameterized local search\nextension of the problem where we are given the temporal labeling of the graph,\nbut we are allowed to change the time-labels of at most $k$ edges; for this\nproblem we prove that it is W[2]-hard but admits an XP algorithm with respect\nto $k$.",

Our representation unifies the continuous geometric\nproperties of B-Rep primitives in different orders (e.g., surfaces and curves)\nand their discrete topological relations in a $\\textit{holistic latent}$ (HoLa)\nspace. This is based on the simple observation that the topological connection\nbetween two surfaces is intrinsically tied to the geometry of their\nintersecting curve. Such a prior allows us to reformulate topology learning in\nB-Reps as a geometric reconstruction problem in Euclidean space.

    "abstract": "Existing co-salient object detection (CoSOD) methods generally employ a\nthree-stage architecture (i.e., encoding, consensus extraction & dispersion,\nand prediction) along with a typical full fine-tuning paradigm. Although they\nyield certain benefits, they exhibit two notable limitations: 1) This\narchitecture relies on encoded features to facilitate consensus extraction, but\nthe meticulously extracted consensus does not provide timely guidance to the\nencoding stage. 2) This paradigm involves globally updating all parameters of\nthe model, which is parameter-inefficient and hinders the effective\nrepresentation of knowledge within the foundation model for this task.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose an interaction-effective and\nparameter-efficient concise architecture for the CoSOD task, addressing two key\nlimitations. It introduces, for the first time, a parameter-efficient prompt\ntuning paradigm and seamlessly embeds consensus into the prompts to formulate\ntask-specific Visual Consensus Prompts (VCP). Our VCP aims to induce the frozen\nfoundation model to perform better on CoSOD tasks by formulating task-specific\nvisual consensus prompts with minimized tunable parameters. Concretely, the\nprimary insight of the purposeful Consensus Prompt Generator (CPG) is to\nenforce limited tunable parameters to focus on co-salient representations and\ngenerate consensus prompts. The formulated Consensus Prompt Disperser (CPD)\nleverages consensus prompts to form task-specific visual consensus prompts,\nthereby arousing the powerful potential of pre-trained models in addressing\nCoSOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our concise VCP outperforms\n13 cutting-edge full fine-tuning models, achieving the new state of the art\n(with 6.8% improvement in F_m metrics on the most challenging CoCA dataset).\nSource code has been available at https://github.com/WJ-CV/VCP.",

However, the issue of biometric\ninformation leakage can still pose a serious threat to user privacy and\nanonymity. Currently, there is no cancelable biometric template generation\nscheme specifically designed for vein biometrics. Therefore, this paper\nproposes an innovative cancelable vein biometric generation scheme: ColorVein.\nUnlike previous cancelable template generation schemes, ColorVein does not\ndestroy the original biometric features and introduces additional color\ninformation to grayscale vein images. This method significantly enhances the\ninformation density of vein images by transforming static grayscale information\ninto dynamically controllable color representations through interactive\ncolorization. ColorVein allows users/administrators to define a controllable\npseudo-random color space for grayscale vein images by editing the position,\nnumber, and color of hint points, thereby generating protected cancelable\ntemplates. Additionally, we propose a new secure center loss to optimize the\ntraining process of the protected feature extraction model, effectively\nincreasing the feature distance between enrolled users and any potential\nimpostors. Finally, we evaluate ColorVein's performance on all types of vein\nbiometrics, including recognition performance, unlinkability, irreversibility,\nand revocability, and conduct security and privacy analyses.

    "abstract": "Completion is a well-known transformation that captures the stable model\nsemantics of logic programs by turning a program into a set of first-order\ndefinitions. Stable models are models of the completion, but not all models of\nthe completion are stable models. For tight programs (programs without positive\nrecursion) the two semantics coincide. Recently this correspondence was\nextended to locally tight programs, which avoid non-terminating recursion.\nHowever, unlike tightness, local tightness cannot be checked with simple\nsyntactic methods. Completion is crucial for verifying answer set programs,\nespecially for external equivalence: a form of equivalence based on selected\noutput predicates under certain inputs. Standard equivalence and adherence to a\nfirst-order specification are special cases of external equivalence. The anthem\nverification tool has two limitations for checking external equivalence: (1)\nthere is no way to check local tightness automatically, and (2) it is not\npossible to verify programs that are not locally tight. Therefore, alternatives\nto completion are of interest. This thesis investigates ordered completion,\nintroduced in [Asuncion et al., 2012], which captures stable models of\narbitrary logic programs, but only for finite models. This work extends ordered\ncompletion to the mini-gringo language (a subset of the language used by the\nclingo solver). Additionally, it introduces a modification of ordered\ncompletion to handle infinite stable models.

During\nfine-tuning, a gated fusion mechanism adaptively integrates pre-trained\nrepresentations across nodes and dimensions, while an anomaly-aware\nregularization loss encourages abnormal nodes to preserve more anomaly-relevant\ninformation. Furthermore, we theoretically show that APF tends to achieve\nlinear separability under mild conditions.

We classified stars\ninto five categories: young stellar objects (YSOs), carbon-rich asymptotic\ngiant branch (CAGB) stars, oxygen-rich AGB (OAGB) stars, red supergiants (RSG),\nand post-AGB (PAGB) stars. Following this, we augmented the distribution of\nimbalanced classes using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).\nTherefore, the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) classifier achieved the\nhighest overall accuracy, reaching ${89\\%}$ based on the recall metric, in\ncategorizing dusty stellar sources before and after data augmentation. In this\nstudy, SMOTE did not impact the classification accuracy for the CAGB, PAGB, and\nRSG categories but led to changes in the performance of the OAGB and YSO\nclasses.",

    "abstract": "Car-following models (CFMs) are fundamental to traffic flow analysis and\nautonomous driving. Although calibrated physics-based and trained data-driven\nCFMs can replicate human driving behavior, their reliance on specific datasets\nlimits generalization across diverse scenarios and reduces reliability in\nreal-world deployment. Moreover, these models typically focus on behavioral\nfidelity and do not support the explicit optimization of local and string\nstability, which are increasingly important for the safe and efficient\noperation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To address these limitations, we\npropose a Knowledge-Informed Deep Learning (KIDL) paradigm that distills the\ngeneralization capabilities of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) into a\nlightweight and stability-aware neural architecture. LLMs are used to extract\nfundamental car-following knowledge beyond dataset-specific patterns, and this\nknowledge is transferred to a reliable, tractable, and computationally\nefficient model through knowledge distillation. KIDL also incorporates\nstability constraints directly into its training objective, ensuring that the\nresulting model not only emulates human-like behavior but also satisfies the\nlocal and string stability requirements essential for real-world AV deployment.\nWe evaluate KIDL on the real-world NGSIM and HighD datasets, comparing its\nperformance with representative physics-based, data-driven, and hybrid CFMs.\nBoth empirical and theoretical results consistently demonstrate KIDL's superior\nbehavioral generalization and traffic flow stability, offering a robust and\nscalable solution for next-generation traffic systems.",

Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with\nencouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed\nreasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently\nrobust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing\nagents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit\nreasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and\nerror recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from\nreactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate\nthis transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed\nthrough our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training\napproach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to\nDeliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on\nestablishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to\ntransfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to\nMLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to\nintegrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action\ngeneration. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic\nreasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage\nintroduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for\ngenerating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario\nConstruction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from\nidentified prone-to-error steps.

The\nscientific rating of each researcher is calculated as a weighted sum of the\ncomponents, allowing the model to reflect not only their current position but\nalso their career trajectory, including phase transitions, breakthroughs, and\nchanges in scientific style. Numerical simulations were conducted for both the\nindividual trajectories and population level distributions of the researchers.\nPhase diagrams were constructed, and a typology of scientific styles was\nformulated. The results demonstrate that RPR can serve as a universal tool for\nobjective assessment, strategic planning, and visualization of scientific\nreputation in both academic and applied environments.",

    "abstract": "Robust optimization is a commonly employed method to mitigate uncertainties\nin the planning of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). In certain\ncontexts, the large number of uncertainty scenarios makes the robust problem\nimpractically expensive to solve. Recent developments in research on IMPT\ntreatment planning indicate that the number of ideally considered error\nscenarios may continue to increase.\n  In this paper, we therefore investigate methods that reduce the size of the\nscenario set considered during the robust optimization. Six cases of patients\nwith non-small cell lung cancer are considered. First, we investigate the\nexistence of an optimal subset of scenarios that needs to be considered during\nrobust optimization, and perform experiments to see if the set can be found in\na reasonable time and substitute for the full set of scenarios during robust\nIMPT optimization. We then consider heuristic methods to estimate this subset\nor find subsets with similar properties. Specifically, we select a subset of\nmaximal diversity in terms of scenario-specific features such as the dose\ndistributions and function gradients at the initial point. Finally, we consider\nadversarial methods as an alternative to solving the full robust problem and\ninvestigate the impact on computation times.\n  The results indicate that the optimal subset can be well approximated by\nsolving the robust IMPT problem with conventional methods. Of the methods\ndesigned to approximate it within a practically useful time frame, the results\nof the diversity-maximization methods indicate that they may perform better\nthan a manual selection of scenarios based on the patient geometry. In\naddition, the adversarial approaches decreased the computation time by at least\nhalf compared to the conventional approach.",

Accurate estimation of a\nuser's channel signature -- specifically, the direction of arrival and time of\narrival -- is crucial for designing efficient beamforming transceivers,\nespecially under noisy observations. In this work, we propose an Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)-enabled framework for estimating the channel signature of a\nuser's location in mmWave massive MIMO systems. Our approach explicitly\naccounts for spatial wideband spreading, finite basis leakage effects, and\nsignificant unknown receiver noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a\ndenoising convolutional neural network with residual learning for recovering\nchannel responses, even when channel gains are of extremely low amplitude and\nembedded in ultra-high receiver noise environments. Notably, our method\nsuccessfully recovers spatio-temporal diversity branches at signal-to-noise\nratios as low as -20 dB.

To complement our approach, we design tailored metrics\nfor evaluating denoising and clustering performance within the context of\nwireless communications.

    "abstract": "The surge in multimedia content has led to the development of Multi-Modal\nRecommender Systems (MMRecs), which use diverse modalities such as text,\nimages, videos, and audio for more personalized recommendations. However,\nMMRecs struggle with noisy data caused by misalignment among modal content and\nthe gap between modal semantics and recommendation semantics. Traditional\ndenoising methods are inadequate due to the complexity of multi-modal data. To\naddress this, we propose a universal guided in-sync distillation denoising\nframework for multi-modal recommendation (GUIDER), designed to improve MMRecs\nby denoising user feedback. Specifically, GUIDER uses a re-calibration strategy\nto identify clean and noisy interactions from modal content. It incorporates a\nDenoising Bayesian Personalized Ranking (DBPR) loss function to handle implicit\nuser feedback. Finally, it applies a denoising knowledge distillation objective\nbased on Optimal Transport distance to guide the alignment from modality\nrepresentations to recommendation semantics. GUIDER can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing MMRecs methods as a plug-and-play solution.\nExperimental results on four public datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and\ngeneralizability.

HT systems go beyond the digital holographic microscopy (DHM)\nsystems that provide a two-dimensional (2D) representation of the total\naccumulated phase acquired by a plane beam on transmission through a 3D sample.\nWhile the early HT systems used a direct reconstruction methodology based on\nthe Fourier diffraction theorem, in recent years, there has been an increasing\nshift towards using iterative optimization frameworks for solving the 3D RI\nreconstruction problem. Despite this algorithmic framework shift, the HT system\nhardware still largely uses the multi-angle illumination geometries that were\nsuitable for reconstructions based on the Fourier diffraction theorem. The\npresent work examines the possibility of HT reconstruction through the use of\non-axis structured illumination(s) that nominally illuminates the 3D sample\nalong the axial direction. Through a simulation study, it is shown that a\ncross-talk free slice-by-slice 3D RI reconstruction of the sample is possible\nin this case via the use of sparsity penalties if the slice-to-slice distance\nobeys a design curve based on the notion of effective depth of focus. The\nsimulation results for two-, three- and four-slice 3D objects with laterally\noverlapping features clearly outline the separate roles played by the\nslice-to-slice de-correlation of the field propagating through the 3D sample\nand that of the sparsity penalty used to guide the iterative solution.

    "abstract": "Recommendation algorithms rely on user historical interactions to deliver\npersonalized suggestions, which raises significant privacy concerns. Federated\nrecommendation algorithms tackle this issue by combining local model training\nwith server-side model aggregation, where most existing algorithms use a\nuniform weighted summation to aggregate item embeddings from different client\nmodels. This approach has three major limitations: 1) information loss during\naggregation, 2) failure to retain personalized local features, and 3)\nincompatibility with parameter-free recommendation algorithms. To address these\nlimitations, we first review the development of recommendation algorithms and\nrecognize that their core function is to share collaborative information,\nspecifically the global relationship between users and items. With this\nunderstanding, we propose a novel aggregation paradigm named collaborative\ninformation aggregation, which focuses on sharing collaborative information\nrather than item parameters. Based on this new paradigm, we introduce the\nfederated collaborative information aggregation (FedCIA) method for\nprivacy-preserving recommendation. This method requires each client to upload\nitem similarity matrices for aggregation, which allows clients to align their\nlocal models without constraining embeddings to a unified vector space. As a\nresult, it mitigates information loss caused by direct summation, preserves the\npersonalized embedding distributions of individual clients, and supports the\naggregation of parameter-free models.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in microscopy techniques has uncovered unique aspects of\nflagella-driven motility in bacteria. A remarkable example is the discovery of\nflagellar wrapping, a phenomenon whereby a bacterium wraps its flagellum (or\nflagellar bundle) around its cell body and propels itself like a corkscrew,\nenabling locomotion in highly viscous or confined environments. For certain\nbacterial species, this flagellar-wrapping mode is crucial for establishing\nselective symbiotic relationships with their hosts. The transformation of a\nflagellum from an extended to a folded (wrapped) state is triggered by a\nbuckling instability driven by the motor-generated torque that unwinds the\nhelical filament. This study investigated this biologically inspired, novel\nbuckling mechanism through a combination of macroscale physical experiments,\nnumerical simulations, and scaling theory to reveal its underlying physical\nprinciples. Excellent quantitative agreement between experiments and numerical\nresults showed that long-range hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) are essential\nfor accurate quantitative descriptions of the geometrically nonlinear\ndeformation of the helical filament during wrapping. By systematically\nanalyzing extensive experimental and numerical data, we constructed a stability\ndiagram that rationalized the stability boundary through an elastohydrodynamic\nscaling analysis. Leveraging the scaling nature of this study, we compared our\nphysical results with available biological data and demonstrated that bacteria\nexploit motor-induced buckling instability to initiate their flagellar\nwrapping. Our findings indicate that this mechanically-driven process is\nessential to bacterial-wrapping motility and consequently, plays a critical\nrole in symbiosis and infection.",

Given these limitations,\nwe propose Key-based Coreset Optimization (KeCO), a novel framework that\nleverages untapped data to construct a compact and informative coreset. We\nintroduce visual features as keys within the coreset, which serve as the anchor\nfor identifying samples to be updated through different selection strategies.\nBy leveraging untapped samples from the support set, we update the keys of\nselected coreset samples, enabling the randomly initialized coreset to evolve\ninto a more informative coreset under low computational cost. Through extensive\nexperiments on coarse-grained and fine-grained image classification benchmarks,\nwe demonstrate that KeCO effectively enhances ICL performance for image\nclassification task, achieving an average improvement of more than 20\\%.\nNotably, we evaluate KeCO under a simulated online scenario, and the strong\nperformance in this scenario highlights the practical value of our framework\nfor resource-constrained real-world scenarios.",

We observe an evolution of time-lag from hard-lag (1.59$-$7.55 ms) in\nRXTE to a soft-lag (0.49$-$1.68 ms) in AstroSat observations. Wide-band\n(0.7$-$50 keV) spectral modelling suggests that HFQPOs are likely observed with\na higher covering fraction ($f_{cov} \\gtrsim 0.5$), i.e., the fraction of seed\nphotons being Comptonized in the corona, enhanced Comptonized flux ($\\sim$\n38%), and lower optical depth ($\\tau \\lesssim 8.5$ ) in contrast to\nobservations where HFQPOs are absent. We observed similar constraints for\nobserving HFQPOs during an inter-class ($\\phi \\rightarrow \\delta$) transition\nas well as in a few intra-class ($\\delta \\rightarrow \\delta$) variations. We\nalso find that the time-lag decreases as $\\tau$ increases, indicating that a\nhigher $\\tau$ reduces Compton up-scattering, thereby decreasing the hard-lag.\nInterestingly, in RXTE observations, the hard-lag ($\\sim$ 7 ms) gradually\ndecreases as optical depth and Comptonization ratio increases, eventually\nbecoming a soft-lag ($\\sim$1 ms) in AstroSat observations. These constraints on\nspectro-temporal parameters for the likelihood of observing HFQPOs support a\n'compact' coronal oscillation mechanism for generating HFQPOs, which we attempt\nto explain within the framework of a possible accretion scenario.",

It is an important\ntool for discovering a latent common cause or distinguishing between\nalternative linear causal structures.

In this paper, we propose a generalized tetrad\nconstraint, which establishes a testable implication for conditional\nindependence given a latent variable in nonlinear and nonparametric models. In\ncommonly-used linear models, this constraint implies the classical tetrad\nconstraint; in nonlinear models, it remains a necessary condition for\nconditional independence but the classical tetrad constraint no longer is.\nBased on this constraint, we further propose a formal test, which can control\ntype I error for significance level below 0.215 and has power approaching unity\nunder certain conditions.

    "abstract": "Multimodal fake news detection plays a crucial role in combating online\nmisinformation. Unfortunately, effective detection methods rely on annotated\nlabels and encounter significant performance degradation when domain shifts\nexist between training (source) and test (target) data. To address the\nproblems, we propose ADOSE, an Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) framework for\nmultimodal fake news detection which actively annotates a small subset of\ntarget samples to improve detection performance. To identify various deceptive\npatterns in cross-domain settings, we design multiple expert classifiers to\nlearn dependencies across different modalities. These classifiers specifically\ntarget the distinct deception patterns exhibited in fake news, where two\nunimodal classifiers capture knowledge errors within individual modalities\nwhile one cross-modal classifier identifies semantic inconsistencies between\ntext and images. To reduce annotation costs from the target domain, we propose\na least-disagree uncertainty selector with a diversity calculator for selecting\nthe most informative samples. The selector leverages prediction disagreement\nbefore and after perturbations by multiple classifiers as an indicator of\nuncertain samples, whose deceptive patterns deviate most from source domains.\nIt further incorporates diversity scores derived from multi-view features to\nensure the chosen samples achieve maximal coverage of target domain features.\nThe extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that ADOSE outperforms\nexisting ADA methods by 2.72\\% $\\sim$ 14.02\\%, indicating the superiority of\nour model.",

    "abstract": "Overestimation of turnout has long been an issue in election surveys, with\nnonresponse bias or voter overrepresentation regarded as one of the major\nsources of bias. However, the adjustment for nonignorable nonresponse bias is\nsubstantially challenging. Based on the ANES Non-Response Follow-Up Study\nconcerning the 2020 U.S. presidential election, we investigate the role of\ncallback data in adjusting for nonresponse bias in the estimation of turnout.\nCallback data are the records of contact attempts in the survey course,\navailable in many modern large-scale surveys. We propose a stableness of\nresistance assumption to account for the nonignorable missingness in the\noutcome, which states that the impact of the missing outcome on the response\npropensity is stable in the first two call attempts. Under this assumption and\nby leveraging covariates information from the census data, we establish the\nidentifiability and develop estimation methods for turnout, including a doubly\nrobust estimator. Our methods produce estimates very close to the official\nturnout and successfully capture the trend of declining willingness to vote as\nresponse reluctance increases. This work hints at the importance of adjusting\nfor nonignorable nonresponse bias and exhibits the promise of callback data for\npolitical surveys.",

However, rapid ion migration in LHPs not only undermines device\nstability but also hinders the development of multi-band composite structures,\nwhich are crucial to advancing perovskite bandgap engineering and unlocking\nnovel applications. Here, we introduce a novel and general strategy involving\nboth phase segregation and phase pinning by doping Er$^{3+}$ into\nCsPb(X$_x$Y$_{1-x}$)$_3$ (X, Y = Cl, Br, I) microplates via a simple one-step\nchemical vapor deposition method. The ion migration is effectively suppressed\nand a variety of stable multi-band composite structures are demonstrated, with\ndiverse dual-band photoluminescence emissions covering the red, green, and blue\nspectral bands. The corresponding high-performance dual-wavelength lasers have\nalso been fabricated, confirming the stability and high crystalline quality of\nthese multi-band composite structures. In addition, this strategy is extended\nto the doping of various lanthanide ion and the incorporation of different\nmixed halides into LHPs. As a result, a series of multi-band composite\nstructures based on LHPs and corresponding dual-wavelength lasers are\ndeveloped, thereby validating the generality of this strategy.

Although the vMF distribution is widely employed\nin a variety of probabilistic learning tasks involving spherical data,\nprincipled tools for comparing vMF distributions remain limited, primarily due\nto the intractability of normalization constants and the absence of suitable\ngeometric metrics. Motivated by the theory of optimal transport, we propose a\nWasserstein-like distance that decomposes the discrepancy between two vMF\ndistributions into two interpretable components: a geodesic term capturing the\nangular separation between mean directions, and a variance-like term\nquantifying differences in concentration parameters. The derivation leverages a\nGaussian approximation in the high-concentration regime to yield a tractable,\nclosed-form expression that respects the intrinsic spherical geometry.

As a primary application, we develop the efficient algorithms\nfor vMF mixture reduction, enabling structure-preserving compression of mixture\nmodels in high-dimensional settings.

At low pressure of\n10mTorr, the parabola feature of core plasma, stratification of whole discharge\narea into electronegative core and electropositive halo, anion potential\nbarrel, and the dipole and capacitor models of double layer characterize the\ndischarge structure of transport dominated regime. At increasing the pressure,\nthe recombination loss of ions becomes significant and the discharge structure\nis characterized by ellipse profile. Meanwhile, the regions of double layer and\nelectropositive halo are strikingly shrunk, which means that the plasma of\ntransport and chemistry self-balanced regime is a close system and probably do\nnot need the shield of chamber anymore. The dimensional analysis shows the\nrecombination can be transformed into drift flux, which balances the ambi-polar\ndiffusion of plasma species.

However, accurately quantizing LLM weights and\nactivations to low precision is challenging without degrading model accuracy.\nWe propose fine-grained mixed precision (FGMP) quantization, a post-training\nmixed-precision quantization hardware-software co-design methodology that\nmaintains accuracy while quantizing the majority of weights and activations to\nreduced precision. Our work makes the following contributions: 1) We develop a\npolicy that uses the perturbation in each value, weighted by the Fisher\ninformation, to select which weight and activation blocks to keep in higher\nprecision. This approach preserves accuracy by identifying which weight and\nactivation blocks need to be retained in higher precision to minimize the\nperturbation in the model loss. 2) We also propose a sensitivity-weighted\nclipping approach for fine-grained quantization which helps retain accuracy for\nblocks that are quantized to low precision. 3) We then propose hardware\naugmentations to leverage the efficiency benefits of FGMP quantization. Our\nhardware implementation encompasses i) datapath support for FGMP at block\ngranularity, and ii) a mixed-precision activation quantization unit to assign\nactivation blocks to high or low precision on the fly with minimal runtime and\nenergy overhead. Our design, prototyped using NVFP4 (an FP4 format with\nmicroscaling) as the low-precision datatype and FP8 as the high-precision\ndatatype, facilitates efficient FGMP quantization, attaining <1% perplexity\ndegradation on Wikitext-103 for the Llama-2-7B model relative to an all-FP8\nbaseline design while consuming 14% less energy during inference and requiring\n30% less weight memory.",

We introduce a new approach\nfor measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a\nrigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human\nexplanations, they often reference high-level concepts in the input question\nthat purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the\ndifference between the set of concepts that LLM explanations imply are\ninfluential and the set that truly are. Second, we present a novel method for\nestimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify\nthe values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals,\nand (2) using a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the causal effects of\nconcepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our\nmethod can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of\nunfaithfulness.

Grazing collisions have varied outcomes. In gentle\nencounters, multiple collisions typically form a single remnant with minimal\nmass loss ($\\lesssim 1 \\%$). For deep encounters, the result depends on the\nspecific collision parameters and stellar structure: $\\gamma=5/3$ polytropic\nstars in our simulation produced two disturbed remnants, while solar-type stars\n(modeled with MESA) in our deep-grazing run formed a single merger remnant in a\nlow-velocity collision. All merger remnants feature extended envelopes, making\nthem susceptible to partial tidal disruptions when they return to the SMBH. The\nmorphology and orbital energy distribution of collision-induced debris differ\nsignificantly from those of tidal disruption event (TDE) debris of single\nstars.

    "abstract": "Carbon fiber-reinforced composites (CFRC) are pivotal in advanced engineering\napplications due to their exceptional mechanical properties. A deep\nunderstanding of CFRC behavior under mechanical loading is essential for\noptimizing performance in demanding applications such as aerospace structures.\nWhile traditional Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, including advanced\ntechniques like Interface-enriched Generalized FEM (IGFEM), offer valuable\ninsights, they can struggle with computational efficiency. Existing data-driven\nsurrogate models partially address these challenges by predicting propagated\ndamage or stress-strain behavior but fail to comprehensively capture the\nevolution of stress and damage throughout the entire deformation history,\nincluding crack initiation and propagation. This study proposes a novel\nauto-regressive composite U-Net deep learning model to simultaneously predict\nstress and damage fields during CFRC deformation. By leveraging the U-Net\narchitecture's ability to capture spatial features and integrate macro- and\nmicro-scale phenomena, the proposed model overcomes key limitations of prior\napproaches. The model achieves high accuracy in predicting evolution of stress\nand damage distribution within the microstructure of a CFRC under\nunidirectional strain, offering a speed-up of over 60 times compared to IGFEM.",

Let's recall that, in deterministic systems, the\nHartman-Grobman theorem establishes the \"topological equivalence\" of the local\nphase portrait between a system and its linearization around hyperbolic fixed\npoints; hence, simplifying the study of the stability at those points.\n  However, it should be pointed out that, the conditions for a \"useful\" linear\napproximation of a non-linear system do not solely involved hyperbolic points;\nindeed, Nils Berglund and Barbara Gentz for example conspicuously used it in\ntheir book [3]; particularly during their study of white noise perturbed\nslow-fast dynamical systems. Yet, since our focus is on behavior of critical\npoints of a system, we need to make sure that the linear approximation of our\nperturbed system is equivalent in some sense to the perturbed system of the\nlinear approximation of the corresponding deterministic system.\n  The paper is organized as follow: we first establish the theorem when the\n\"diffusion\" matrix is invertible. We continue by examining the case of\nnon-invertible matrices, and non square matrices. We then apply the results to\nthe study of Multi-dimensional slow-fast systems done by Berglund and Gentz [3]\nby weakening regularity conditions.",

    "abstract": "Compared to single-target adversarial attacks, multi-target attacks have\ngarnered significant attention due to their ability to generate adversarial\nimages for multiple target classes simultaneously. Existing generative\napproaches for multi-target attacks mainly analyze the effect of the use of\ntarget labels on noise generation from a theoretical perspective, lacking\npractical validation and comprehensive summarization. To address this gap, we\nfirst identify and validate that the semantic feature quality and quantity are\ncritical factors affecting the transferability of targeted attacks: 1) Feature\nquality refers to the structural and detailed completeness of the implanted\ntarget features, as deficiencies may result in the loss of key discriminative\ninformation; 2) Feature quantity refers to the spatial sufficiency of the\nimplanted target features, as inadequacy limits the victim model's attention to\nthis feature. Based on these findings, we propose the 2D Tensor-Guided\nAdversarial Fusion (2D-TGAF) framework, which leverages the powerful generative\ncapabilities of diffusion models to encode target labels into two-dimensional\nsemantic tensors for guiding adversarial noise generation. Additionally, we\ndesign a novel masking strategy tailored for the training process, ensuring\nthat parts of the generated noise retain complete semantic information about\nthe target class. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset\ndemonstrate that 2D-TGAF consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in\nattack success rates, both on normally trained models and across various\ndefense mechanisms.",

To\naddress this, this study proposed a multi-granularity candidate-aware user\nmodeling framework that integrated user interest features across various levels\nof granularity. It consisted of two main components: candidate news encoding\nand user modeling. A news textual information extractor and a\nknowledge-enhanced entity information extractor can capture candidate news\nfeatures, and word-level, entity-level, and news-level candidate-aware\nmechanisms can provide a comprehensive representation of user interests.\nExtensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrated that the proposed\nmodel could significantly outperform baseline models.",

Besides, they tend to fail to\nassess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen\ngenerators in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-modal\nguided multi-perspective representation learning (BMRL) framework for zero-shot\ndeepfake attribution (ZS-DFA), which facilitates effective traceability to\nunseen generators. Specifically, we design a multi-perspective visual encoder\n(MPVE) to explore general deepfake attribution visual characteristics across\nthree views (i.e., image, noise, and edge). We devise a novel parsing encoder\nto focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA\nrepresentation learning via vision-parsing matching. A language encoder is\nproposed to capture fine-grained language embeddings, facilitating\nlanguage-guided general visual forgery representation learning through\nvision-language alignment. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake\nattribution contrastive center (DFACC) loss, to pull relevant generators closer\nand push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to\nenhance traceability.

This\nstudy examines the linguistic and semantic choices users make when crafting\nprompts and how these choices influence the diversity of generated outputs.\nAnalyzing over six million prompts from the Civiverse dataset on the CivitAI\nplatform across seven months, we categorize users into three groups based on\ntheir levels of linguistic experimentation: consistent repeaters, occasional\nrepeaters, and non-repeaters. Our findings reveal that as user participation\ngrows over time, prompt language becomes increasingly homogenized through the\nadoption of popular community tags and descriptors, with repeated prompts\ncomprising 40-50% of submissions. At the same time, semantic similarity and\ntopic preferences remain relatively stable, emphasizing common subjects and\nsurface aesthetics. Using Vendi scores to quantify visual diversity, we\ndemonstrate a clear correlation between lexical similarity in prompts and the\nvisual similarity of generated images, showing that linguistic repetition\nreinforces less diverse representations.

Numerical simulations can resolve the\nsmall temporal and spatial scales of the vapor bubbles in the flow boiling\nprocess, thus accessing many details of the flow which is unattainable\nexperimentally. Most of the previous studies of flow boiling heat transfer used\nstraight microchannels, even though curved microchannels have potential to\nfurther enhance the heat transfer performance. In this study, the flow boiling\nheat transfer in wavy microchannels is studied via numerical simulation by\nfocusing on the growth of the vapor bubbles. Straight and wavy microchannels\nare considered for comparison and analysis. The numerical simulations are\nconducted using the finite volume method to solve the flow and the heat\ntransfer, and the volume of fluid (VOF) method to capture the interface\ndynamics. The effects of key dimensionless numbers on bubble growth rate and\nwall heat transfer are quantified, including the Weber number, the Capillary\nnumber, and the Jakob number. The results indicate that the wavy structure of\nthe microchannel has a strong effect on the bubble growth and the wall heat\ntransfer in microchannels. As the waviness of the microchannel increases, the\nbubble grows faster because of the bubble deformation by the wavy channel, the\nbubble moves faster due to the bubble expansion, and the heat transfer is\nenhanced by the perturbation of the bubble to the flow. With the large velocity\nperpendicular to the channel flow direction induced by the waviness, the local\nNusselt number of the wavy channel could be high up to 2.6 times higher than\nthe straight channel.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical effects that span multiple physical scales -- such as the\ninfluence of vanishing molecular viscosity on large-scale flow structures under\nspecific conditions -- play a critical role in real fluid systems. The spin\nangular momentum-conserving Navier--Stokes equations offer a theoretical\nframework for describing such multiscale fluid dynamics by decomposing total\nangular momentum into bulk and intrinsic spin components. However, this\nframework still assumes locally non-solid rotational flows, a condition that\nremains empirically unverified. This study addresses such unvalidated\nassumptions intrinsic to the model and extends it within the framework of\nturbulence hierarchy theory. The theory suggests that under certain conditions,\nsmall-scale structures may transfer to larger scales through the rotational\nviscosity. To verify this, we conducted spectral analyses of freely decaying\ntwo-dimensional turbulence initialized with a vortex-concentrated distribution.\nThe results indicate that rotational viscosity exhibits interscale transfer\nbehavior, revealing a new mechanism by which order can propagate from small to\nlarge scales in Navier--Stokes turbulence.",

    "abstract": "Road environment segmentation plays a significant role in autonomous driving.\nNumerous works based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and Transformer\narchitectures have been proposed to leverage local and global contextual\nlearning for efficient and accurate semantic segmentation. In both\narchitectures, the encoder often relies heavily on extracting continuous\nrepresentations from the image, which limits the ability to represent\nmeaningful discrete information. To address this limitation, we propose\nsegmentation of the autonomous driving environment using vector quantization.\nVector quantization offers three primary advantages for road environment\nsegmentation. (1) Each continuous feature from the encoder is mapped to a\ndiscrete vector from the codebook, helping the model discover distinct features\nmore easily than with complex continuous features. (2) Since a discrete feature\nacts as compressed versions of the encoder's continuous features, they also\ncompress noise or outliers, enhancing the image segmentation task. (3) Vector\nquantization encourages the latent space to form coarse clusters of continuous\nfeatures, forcing the model to group similar features, making the learned\nrepresentations more structured for the decoding process. In this work, we\ncombined vector quantization with the lightweight image segmentation model\nMobileUNETR and used it as a baseline model for comparison to demonstrate its\nefficiency. Through experiments, we achieved 77.0 % mIoU on Cityscapes,\noutperforming the baseline by 2.9 % without increasing the model's initial size\nor complexity.",

    "abstract": "Development in digital technologies has continuously reshaped how individuals\nseek and receive social and emotional support. While online platforms and\ncommunities have long served this need, the increased integration of\ngeneral-purpose conversational AI into daily lives has introduced new dynamics\nin how support is provided and experienced. Existing research has highlighted\nboth benefits (e.g., wider access to well-being resources) and potential risks\n(e.g., over-reliance) of using AI for support seeking. In this five-week,\nexploratory study, we recruited 149 participants divided into two usage groups:\na baseline usage group (BU, n=60) that used the internet and AI as usual, and\nan active usage group (AU, n=89) encouraged to use one of four commercially\navailable AI tools (Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, PI AI, ChatGPT) for\nsocial and emotional interactions. Our analysis revealed significant increases\nin perceived attachment towards AI (32.99 percentage points), perceived AI\nempathy (25.8 p.p.), and motivation to use AI for entertainment (22.90 p.p.)\namong the AU group. We also observed that individual differences (e.g., gender\nidentity, prior AI usage) influenced perceptions of AI empathy and attachment.\nLastly, the AU group expressed higher comfort in seeking personal help,\nmanaging stress, obtaining social support, and talking about health with AI,\nindicating potential for broader emotional support while highlighting the need\nfor safeguards against problematic usage. Overall, our exploratory findings\nunderscore the importance of developing consumer-facing AI tools that support\nemotional well-being responsibly, while empowering users to understand the\nlimitations of these tools.",
