    "abstract": "Optical beam steering enables optical detection and imaging in macroscopic or\nmicroscopic scales and long-range communication over free space. It underpins\nnumerous optical applications, including LiDAR, biomedical imaging, and remote\nsensing. Despite the inherent speed of light, advanced applications\nincreasingly require the ability to steer multiple beams simultaneously to\nincrease imaging throughput, boost communication bandwidth, and control arrays\nqubits for scalable quantum computing. Therefore, there is a significant demand\nfor non-mechanical, integrated, and scalable multi-beam steering technology.\nHere, we report a scalable multi-beam steering system comprising an array of\nacousto-optic beam steering channels and photonic integrated circuits on a\nthin-film lithium niobate platform. Each channel generates tens of individually\ncontrollable beams of visible wavelength by exciting acoustic waves using\ndigitally synthesized multi-tone microwave signals. We demonstrate the system's\ncapabilities through multi-input, multi-output free-space communications,\nsimultaneously transmitting to multiple receivers at megabits/sec data rates.\nThis technology can be readily scaled up to steer hundreds of optical beams\nfrom a compact chip, potentially advancing many areas of optical technologies\nand enabling novel applications.",

    "abstract": "Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an innovative technology to improve\nwireless network capacity by adjusting 3D positions and 3D rotations of antenna\nsurfaces based on channel spatial distribution. However, the existing works on\n6DMA have assumed a central processing unit (CPU) to jointly process the\nsignals of all 6DMA surfaces to execute various tasks. This inevitably incurs\nprohibitively high processing cost for channel estimation. Therefore, we\npropose a distributed 6DMA processing architecture to reduce processing\ncomplexity of CPU by equipping each 6DMA surface with a local processing unit\n(LPU). In particular, we unveil for the first time a new\n\\textbf{\\textit{directional sparsity}} property of 6DMA channels, where each\nuser has significant channel gains only for a (small) subset of 6DMA\nposition-rotation pairs, which can receive direct/reflected signals from users.\nIn addition, we propose a practical three-stage protocol for the 6DMA-equipped\nbase station (BS) to conduct statistical CSI acquisition for all 6DMA candidate\npositions/rotations, 6DMA position/rotation optimization, and instantaneous\nchannel estimation for user data transmission with optimized 6DMA\npositions/rotations. Specifically, the directional sparsity is leveraged to\ndevelop distributed algorithms for joint sparsity detection and channel power\nestimation, as well as for directional sparsity-aided instantaneous channel\nestimation. Using the estimated channel power, we develop a channel power-based\noptimization algorithm to maximize the ergodic sum rate of the users by\noptimizing the antenna positions/rotations. Simulation results show that our\nchannel estimation algorithms are more accurate than benchmarks with lower\npilot overhead, and our optimization outperforms fluid/movable antennas\noptimized only in two dimensions (2D), even when the latter have perfect\ninstantaneous CSI.",

The introduction of the probability $p$ in the growth\nrule, which controls the expansion of square and triangle domains, enables us\nto obtain various square-triangle random tilings systematically. We analyze the\ndegree of the regularity of the point configurations, which are defined as the\nvertices on the square-triangle tilings, in terms of hyperuniformity. It is\nclarified that for $p<p_c \\; (p_c\\sim 0.5)$, the system can be regarded as a\nphase separation between square and triangular lattice domains and the variance\nof the point configurations obeys the scaling law $\\sigma^2\\sim\nO(R^{2-\\alpha})$ with $\\alpha<0$. The configurations are antihyperuniform. On\nthe other hand, for $p>p_c$, the squares and triangles are spatially well mixed\nand the point configurations belong to the hyperuniform class III with the\nexponent $0<\\alpha<1$. This means the existence of the\nhyperuniform-antihyperuniform transition at $p=p_c$. We also examine the\nstructure factor of the square-triangle tilings. It is clarified that the peak\nstructures in the large-wave-number regime are mostly common to all\nsquare-triangle tilings, while those in the small-wave-number regime strongly\ndepend on whether the point configurations are hyperuniform or\nantihyperuniform.",

We develop\na deep-learning algorithm called GeoCenter; besides a few scalars in the\noperational Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System, it relies only on\ngeostationary infrared (IR) satellite imagery, which is available for all TC\nbasins at high frequency (10 min) and low latency (< 10 min) during both day\nand night.

The animation is centered at a \"first\nguess\" location, offset from the true TC-center location by 48 km on average\nand sometimes > 100 km; GeoCenter is tasked with correcting this offset. On an\nindependent testing dataset, GeoCenter achieves a mean/median/RMS (root mean\nsquare) error of 26.6/22.2/32.4 km for all systems, 24.7/20.8/30.0 km for\ntropical systems, and 14.6/12.5/17.3 km for category-2--5 hurricanes.

The Clarke transform\nutilizes the generalized Clarke transformation and its inverse to reduce any\nnumber of joint values to a two-dimensional space without sacrificing any\nsignificant information. This space is the manifold of the joint space and is\ndescribed by two orthogonal Clarke coordinates. Application to kinematics,\nsampling, and control are presented. By deriving the solution to the previously\nunknown forward robot-dependent mapping for an arbitrary number of joints, the\nforward and inverse kinematics formulations are branchless, closed-form, and\nsingular-free. Sampling is used as a proxy for gauging the performance\nimplications for various methods and frameworks, leading to a branchless,\nclosed-form, and vectorizable sampling method with a 100 percent success rate\nand the possibility to shape desired distributions. Due to the utilization of\nthe manifold, the fairly simple constraint-informed, two-dimensional, and\nlinear controller always provides feasible control outputs. On top of that, the\nrelations to improved representations in continuum and soft robotics are\nestablished, where the Clarke coordinates are their generalizations.\n  The Clarke transform offers valuable geometric insights and paves the way for\ndeveloping approaches directly on the two-dimensional manifold within the\nhigh-dimensional joint space, ensuring compliance with the constraint. While\nbeing an easy-to-construct linear map, the proposed Clarke transform is\nmathematically consistent, physically meaningful, as well as interpretable and\ncontributes to the unification of frameworks across continuum and soft robots.",

    "abstract": "A unitary state $t$-design is an ensemble of pure quantum states whose\nmoments match up to the $t$-th order those of states uniformly sampled from a\n$d$-dimensional Hilbert space. Typically, unitary state $t$-designs are\nobtained by evolving some reference pure state with unitaries from an ensemble\nthat forms a design over the unitary group $\\mathbb{U}(d)$, as unitary designs\ninduce state designs. However, in this work we study whether Haar random\nsymplectic states -- i.e., states obtained by evolving some reference state\nwith unitaries sampled according to the Haar measure over $\\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$ --\nform unitary state $t$-designs. Importantly, we recall that random symplectic\nunitaries fail to be unitary designs for $t>1$, and that, while it is known\nthat symplectic unitaries are universal, this does not imply that their Haar\nmeasure leads to a state design. Notably, our main result states that Haar\nrandom symplectic states form unitary $t$-designs for all $t$, meaning that\ntheir distribution is unconditionally indistinguishable from that of unitary\nHaar random states, even with tests that use infinite copies of each state. As\nsuch, our work showcases the intriguing possibility of creating state\n$t$-designs using ensembles of unitaries which do not constitute designs over\n$\\mathbb{U}(d)$ themselves, such as ensembles that form $t$-designs over\n$\\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$.",

In this study, we introduce a novel unsupervised text\nrepresentation learning technique via instruction-tuning the pre-trained\nencoder-decoder large language models (LLM) under the dual-encoder retrieval\nframework. We demonstrate the corpus representation can be augmented by the\nrepresentations of relevant synthetic queries generated by the instruct-tuned\nLLM founded on the Rao-Blackwell theorem. Furthermore, we effectively align the\nquery and corpus text representation with self-instructed-tuning. Specifically,\nwe first prompt an open-box pre-trained LLM to follow defined instructions\n(i.e. question generation and keyword summarization) to generate synthetic\nqueries. Next, we fine-tune the pre-trained LLM with defined instructions and\nthe generated queries that passed quality check. Finally, we generate synthetic\nqueries with the instruction-tuned LLM for each corpora and represent each\ncorpora by weighted averaging the synthetic queries and original corpora\nembeddings. We evaluate our proposed method under low-resource settings on\nthree English and one German retrieval datasets measuring NDCG@10, MRR@100,\nRecall@100. We significantly improve the average zero-shot retrieval\nperformance on all metrics, increasing open-box FLAN-T5 model variations by\n[3.34%, 3.50%] in absolute and exceeding three competitive dense retrievers\n(i.e. mDPR, T-Systems, mBART-Large), with model of size at least 38% smaller,\nby 1.96%, 4.62%, 9.52% absolute on NDCG@10.",

Here, we examined the topographic and\nelectronic features of a recently developed chiral molecule, B,N-embedded\ndouble hetero[7]helicene, at the edge of Cu(100) supported NaCl thin film with\nscanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. An electron transport energy\ngap of 3.2 eV is measured, which is significantly larger than the energy\ndifference between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular\norbitals given by theoretical calculations or optical measurements. Through\nfirst principles calculations, we demonstrated that this energy discrepancy\nresults from the Coulomb interaction between the tunneling electron and the\nmolecule's electrons. This occurs in electron transport processes when the\nmolecule is well decoupled from the electrodes by the insulating decoupling\nlayers, leading to a temporary ionization of the molecule during electron\ntunneling. Beyond revealing properties concerning a specific molecule, our\nfindings underscore the key role of Coulomb interactions in modulating electron\ntransport in molecular junctions, providing insights into the interpretation of\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy features of molecules decoupled by insulating\nlayers.",

    "abstract": "We present BehAV, a novel approach for autonomous robot navigation in outdoor\nscenes guided by human instructions and leveraging Vision Language Models\n(VLMs). Our method interprets human commands using a Large Language Model (LLM)\nand categorizes the instructions into navigation and behavioral guidelines.\nNavigation guidelines consist of directional commands (e.g., \"move forward\nuntil\") and associated landmarks (e.g., \"the building with blue windows\"),\nwhile behavioral guidelines encompass regulatory actions (e.g., \"stay on\") and\ntheir corresponding objects (e.g., \"pavements\"). We use VLMs for their\nzero-shot scene understanding capabilities to estimate landmark locations from\nRGB images for robot navigation. Further, we introduce a novel scene\nrepresentation that utilizes VLMs to ground behavioral rules into a behavioral\ncost map. This cost map encodes the presence of behavioral objects within the\nscene and assigns costs based on their regulatory actions. The behavioral cost\nmap is integrated with a LiDAR-based occupancy map for navigation. To navigate\noutdoor scenes while adhering to the instructed behaviors, we present an\nunconstrained Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based planner that prioritizes\nboth reaching landmarks and following behavioral guidelines. We evaluate the\nperformance of BehAV on a quadruped robot across diverse real-world scenarios,\ndemonstrating a 22.49% improvement in alignment with human-teleoperated\nactions, as measured by Frechet distance, and achieving a 40% higher navigation\nsuccess rate compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Research in symbolic logical\nreasoning explored FOL generation using state-of-the-art LLMs (i.e., GPT-4) to\nproduce FOL translations of natural language (NL) statements, but errors in\ntranslation are usually not the focus. We address this by categorizing the\ntranslation errors in FOL statements generated by LLMs. To make progress\ntowards improving the quality of FOL translations for smaller language models\nsuch as LLaMA-2 13B and Mistral 7B, we create ProofFOL, a high-quality\nFOL-annotated subset of ProofWriter dataset using GPT-4o.

In addition to\nimproving the model using large data, we also tackle the issue of data scarcity\nand introduce an incremental framework encompassing of data augmentation and\nverification steps. In the augmentation process, a single pair of (premises,\nconclusion) is split into multiple new instances based on the predicates and\nFOLs. This data is used for fine-tuning, and the inference on this model\ngenerates FOLs with fewer errors over the model trained on the original data.\nOur investigation on the translation errors leads to generation of a\nperturbation dataset, which is used to train a verifier that corrects potential\nsyntactic and semantic FOL translation errors.

Our FL method and the\ncorresponding convergence analysis take into account the impact of quantization\nand packet dropping due to wireless errors. We show also the superiority of our\nmethod, in terms of communication overhead and energy consumption, as compared\nto standard gradient-based FL methods.",

    "abstract": "LLMs have shown promising results in task planning due to their strong\nnatural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, issues such\nas hallucinations, ambiguities in human instructions, environmental\nconstraints, and limitations in the executing agent's capabilities often lead\nto flawed or incomplete plans. This paper proposes MultiTalk, an LLM-based task\nplanning methodology that addresses these issues through a framework of\nintrospective and extrospective dialogue loops. This approach helps ground\ngenerated plans in the context of the environment and the agent's capabilities,\nwhile also resolving uncertainties and ambiguities in the given task. These\nloops are enabled by specialized systems designed to extract and predict\ntask-specific states, and flag mismatches or misalignments among the human\nuser, the LLM agent, and the environment. Effective feedback pathways between\nthese systems and the LLM planner foster meaningful dialogue. The efficacy of\nthis methodology is demonstrated through its application to robotic\nmanipulation tasks. Experiments and ablations highlight the robustness and\nreliability of our method, and comparisons with baselines further illustrate\nthe superiority of MultiTalk in task planning for embodied agents.",

To address these challenges,\nwe propose a hierarchical modular approach, named Adaptive Robotic\nCompositional Hierarchy (ARCH), which enables long-horizon, high-precision\nrobotic assembly in contact-rich settings.

The high-level policy, learned via IL from a\nhandful of demonstrations, without the need for teleoperation, selects the\nappropriate primitive skills and instantiates them with input parameters. We\nextensively evaluate our approach in simulation and on a real robotic\nmanipulation platform.

    "abstract": "Q-learning is a powerful tool for network control and policy optimization in\nwireless networks, but it struggles with large state spaces. Recent\nadvancements, like multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ), improves\nperformance and reduces complexity by integrating multiple Q-learning\nalgorithms across multiple related environments so-called digital cousins.\nHowever, MEMQ is designed for centralized single-agent networks and is not\nsuitable for decentralized or multi-agent networks. To address this challenge,\nwe propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ algorithm for partially decentralized\nwireless networks with multiple mobile transmitters (TXs) and base stations\n(BSs), where TXs do not have access to each other's states and actions. In\nuncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs.\nIn coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state\nbased on local observations and share limited information with leader TX to\nminimize joint cost. The cost of information sharing scales linearly with the\nnumber of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. The\nproposed scheme is 50% faster than centralized MEMQ with only a 20% increase in\naverage policy error (APE) and is 25% faster than several advanced\ndecentralized Q-learning algorithms with 40% less APE.

Additionally, we assessed smaller pixel\ndetectors like the Ximea xiJ and Andor Sona-6, which are better suited for\ndeep-sky imaging. Furthermore, high-sensitivity quantitative sCMOS detectors\nsuch as the Hamamatsu Orca-Quest C15550-20UP, capable of resolving individual\nphotoelectrons, were also tested. In-lab testing showed low levels of dark\ncurrent, read noise, faulty pixels, and fixed pattern noise, as well as\nlinearity levels above $98\\%$ across all detectors. The Orca-Quest had\nparticularly low noise levels with a dark current of $0.0067 \\pm 0.0003$\ne$^-$/s (at $-20^\\circ$C with air cooling) and a read noise of $0.37 \\pm 0.09$\ne$^-$ using its standard readout mode.

This approach is relevant not only in\nclinical settings, such as medical imaging, but also in public health, as\nhighlighted by the need for rapid, cost-effective testing methods during the\nSARS-CoV-2pandemic. Our model enables the development of testing protocols with\nan arbitrary number of tests, which can be customized to meet requirements for\ntype I and type II errors. This allows us to adjust sensitivity and specificity\naccording to application-specific needs. Additionally, we derive generalized\nRogan--Gladen estimates for estimating disease prevalence, accounting for an\narbitrary number of tests with potentially different type I and type II errors.\nWe also provide the corresponding uncertainty quantification.",

    "abstract": "While deep learning has catalyzed breakthroughs across numerous domains, its\nbroader adoption in clinical settings is inhibited by the costly and\ntime-intensive nature of data acquisition and annotation. To further facilitate\nmedical machine learning, we present an ultrasound dataset of 10,223\nBrightness-mode (B-mode) images consisting of sagittal slices of porcine spinal\ncords (N=25) before and after a contusion injury. We additionally benchmark the\nperformance metrics of several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms to\nlocalize the site of injury and semantic segmentation models to label the\nanatomy for comparison and creation of task-specific architectures. Finally, we\nevaluate the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segmentation models\non human ultrasound spinal cord images to determine whether training on our\nporcine dataset is sufficient for accurately interpreting human data. Our\nresults show that the YOLOv8 detection model outperforms all evaluated models\nfor injury localization, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50-95) score of\n0.606. Segmentation metrics indicate that the DeepLabv3 segmentation model\nachieves the highest accuracy on unseen porcine anatomy, with a Mean Dice score\nof 0.587, while SAMed achieves the highest Mean Dice score generalizing to\nhuman anatomy (0.445). To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest\nannotated dataset of spinal cord ultrasound images made publicly available to\nresearchers and medical professionals, as well as the first public report of\nobject detection and segmentation architectures to assess anatomical markers in\nthe spinal cord for methodology development and clinical applications.",

One consequence of this is that the antiproton (and, hence,\nthe antineutron) is dominantly composed of matter since some two-thirds of its\nmass is gluonic. Under this premise I found that the gravitational acceleration\nof antihydrogen would be $a_{\\bar{H}}=(0.33^{+0.23}_{-0.11})g$. This is to be\ncompared to the ALPHA-g result of $a_{\\bar{H}}=(0.75\\pm 0.13~({\\rm\nstat.+syst.})\\pm 0.16~({\\rm simulation}))g$. In this article I explore the\ncosmological implications of this definition of matter and antimatter. This\nleads to a quite different antigravity universe than previous analyses with,\nfor example, equal amounts of hydrogen and antihydrogen but far fewer antistars\nthan stars. I examine the observations used to extract various parameters of\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model of the universe and show that they are potentially\nconsistent with the characteristics of the antigravity universe. A precise\nversion of antigravity, one which must include General Relativity, is needed to\ngenerate a fully consistent, predictive model of the antigravity universe but\neven without it the antigravity scenario outlined here naturally leads to a\nrich phenomenology including different acceleration and expansion rates between\nthe early universe and the present, MOND-like galaxy rotation curves, cosmic\nvoids, and more.",

Despite a surge in new PEFT methods,\na systematic study to understand their performance and suitable application\nscenarios is lacking, leaving questions like \"when to apply PEFT\" and \"which\nmethod to use\" largely unanswered, especially in visual recognition. In this\npaper, we conduct a unifying empirical study of representative PEFT methods\nwith Vision Transformers. We systematically tune their hyperparameters to\nfairly compare their accuracy on downstream tasks. Our study offers a practical\nuser guide and unveils several new insights. First, if tuned carefully,\ndifferent PEFT methods achieve similar accuracy in the low-shot benchmark\nVTAB-1K. This includes simple approaches like FT the bias terms that were\nreported inferior. Second, despite similar accuracy, we find that PEFT methods\nmake different mistakes and high-confidence predictions, likely due to their\ndifferent inductive biases. Such an inconsistency (or complementarity) opens up\nthe opportunity for ensemble methods, and we make preliminary attempts at this.\nThird, going beyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PEFT is also\nuseful in many-shot regimes, achieving comparable or better accuracy than full\nFT while using significantly fewer parameters. Lastly, we investigate PEFT's\nability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to distribution shifts\n(e.g., CLIP). Perhaps not surprisingly, PEFT approaches outperform full FT\nalone. However, with weight-space ensembles, full FT can better balance target\ndistribution and distribution shift performance, suggesting a future research\ndirection for robust PEFT.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of agroecological practices will be crucial to address the\nchallenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. Such practices favor the\ncultivation of plants in complex mixtures with layouts differing from the\nmonoculture approach of conventional agriculture. Inspired by random sequential\nadsorption processes, we propose a one-dimensional model in which the plants\nare represented as line segments that start as points and grow at a constant\nrate until they reach length $\\sigma$ after a time interval $\\tau$. The\nplanting positions and times are randomly chosen with the constraint that plant\noverlap is forbidden. We apply an exact, event-driven simulation to investigate\nthe resulting spatiotemporal patterns and yields in both mono- and duocultures.\nAfter a transient period, with oscillations in the density and coverage, the\nfield reaches a steady state in which the mean age of plants is one half of the\ntime to maturity. The structure of the active plants is characterized by\ncorrelation functions between the fluctuation of the age of a plant and its\n$k$th neighbour. Nearest neighbours are negatively correlated, while next\nnearest neighbours tend to have similar ages. The steady state yield increases\nwith the planting rate and approaches a maximum value of 4/3 plants per unit\nlength per unit time. For two species with the same size at maturity but\ndifferent growth rates, the more slowly growing species is enriched in the\nharvest compared to the seed mix composition. If two species have the same time\nto maturity but different sizes, the smaller one is enriched in the harvest\nand, at a sufficiently high planting rate, the larger species may be completely\nabsent. For two species with the same ratio of $\\sigma/\\tau$ the selectivity is\ninsensitive to the planting rate. The model may be extended to higher\ndimensions, more species and other planting strategies.",

    "abstract": "Ground transportation infrastructure significantly impacts community\nconnectivity, economic growth, and access to essential services such as jobs,\neducation, and healthcare. However, in practice, these infrastructures do not\nprovide equitable services for all, and historical disparities have led to\ninequitable conditions for many individuals. This paper explores diverse\ndefinitions of equity relevant to ground infrastructures, examines the\nconsequences of inequitable transportation systems throughout the history of\nthe U.S. highway system, and explores various approaches for conducting equity\nanalysis. Based on the collected information, a generalized framework is\nintroduced to analyze the impact of these infrastructures on transportation\nequity. The study also provides a novel equity index that can be used to assess\nequity considering accessibility and affordability. Finally, the framework is\napplied to a case study in Baltimore City, Maryland, examining the equitable\ndistribution of electric vehicle (EV) chargers. By demonstrating its practical\napplication, the paper offers managers and policymakers a concise step-by-step\napproach to analyze transportation equity. This method assesses both the\nsocioeconomic features of affected populations and the distribution of\nservices, contributing to the development of a more sustainable ground\ntransport system.",

Forearm ultrasound offers detailed\ninformation about muscle morphology changes during hand movement which can be\nused to estimate hand gestures.

However, most of these\nexplanation methods appropriate attribution scores to pixels independently,\neven though both humans and DNNs make decisions by analyzing a set of closely\nrelated pixels simultaneously. Hence, the attribution score of a pixel should\nbe evaluated jointly by considering itself and its structurally-similar pixels.\nWe propose a method called IProp, which models each pixel's individual\nattribution score as a source of explanatory information and explains the image\nprediction through the dynamic propagation of information across all pixels. To\nformulate the information propagation, IProp adopts the Markov Reward Process,\nwhich guarantees convergence, and the final status indicates the desired\npixels' attribution scores. Furthermore, IProp is compatible with any existing\nattribution-based explanation method.

Moreover, at the THz transceiver, radio\nfrequency (RF) impairments such as phase noise (PN) of the analog devices also\nleads to degradation in channel estimation performance. Classical estimators as\nwell as traditional deep learning (DL) based algorithms struggle to maintain\ntheir robustness when performing for large scale antenna arrays i.e., M-MIMO,\nand when RF impairments are considered for practical usage. To effectively\naddress this issue, it is crucial to utilize a neural network (NN) that has the\nability to study the behaviors of the channel and RF impairment correlations,\nsuch as a recurrent neural network (RNN). The RF impairments act as sequential\nnoise data which is subsequently incorporated with the channel data, leading to\nchoose a specific type of RNN known as bidirectional long short-term memory\n(BiLSTM) which is followed by gated recurrent units (GRU) to process the\nsequential data.

The current state-of-the-art approach, PAL, utilizes code generation\nto address this issue. However, PAL depends on manually crafted prompt\ntemplates and examples while still producing inaccurate results. In this work,\nwe present TITAN-a novel strategy designed to enhance LLMs' performance on\ntask-oriented prompts. TITAN achieves this by generating scripts using a\nuniversal approach and zero-shot learning. Unlike existing methods, TITAN\neliminates the need for detailed task-specific instructions and extensive\nmanual efforts. TITAN enhances LLMs' performance on various tasks by utilizing\ntheir analytical and code-generation capabilities in a streamlined process.\nTITAN employs two key techniques: (1) step-back prompting to extract the task's\ninput specifications and (2) chain-of-thought prompting to identify required\nprocedural steps. This information is used to improve the LLMs' code-generation\nprocess. TITAN further refines the generated script through post-processing and\nthe script is executed to retrieve the final answer. Our comprehensive\nevaluation demonstrates TITAN's effectiveness in a diverse set of tasks. On\naverage, TITAN outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot approach by 7.6% and\n3.9% when paired with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Overall, without human annotation,\nTITAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in 8 out of 11 cases while only\nmarginally losing to few-shot approaches (which needed human intervention) on\nthree occasions by small margins.

However, improving their accuracy in generating\ncorrect and reliable code remains challenging. Numerous prompt engineering\ntechniques (PETs) have been developed to address this, but no single approach\nis universally optimal. Selecting the right PET for each query is difficult for\ntwo primary reasons: (1) interactive prompting techniques may not consistently\ndeliver the expected benefits, especially for simpler queries, and (2) current\nautomated prompt engineering methods lack adaptability and fail to fully\nutilize multi-stage responses. To overcome these challenges, we propose\nPET-Select, a PET-agnostic selection model that uses code complexity as a proxy\nto classify queries and select the most appropriate PET. By incorporating\ncontrastive learning, PET-Select effectively distinguishes between simple and\ncomplex problems, allowing it to choose PETs that are best suited for each\nquery's complexity level. Our evaluations on the MBPP and HumanEval benchmarks\nusing GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o show up to a 1.9% improvement in pass@1\naccuracy, along with a 74.8% reduction in token usage. Additionally, we provide\nboth quantitative and qualitative results to demonstrate how PET-Select\neffectively selects the most appropriate techniques for each code generation\nquery, further showcasing its efficiency in optimizing PET selection.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound images of the forearm can be used to classify hand gestures\ntowards developing human machine interfaces. In our previous work, we have\ndemonstrated gesture classification using ultrasound on a single subject\nwithout removing the probe before evaluation. This has limitations in usage as\nonce the probe is removed and replaced, the accuracy declines since the\nclassifier performance is sensitive to the probe location on the arm. In this\npaper, we propose training a model on multiple data collection sessions to\ncreate a generalized model, utilizing incremental learning through fine tuning.\nUltrasound data was acquired for 5 hand gestures within a session (without\nremoving and putting the probe back on) and across sessions. A convolutional\nneural network (CNN) with 5 cascaded convolution layers was used for this\nstudy. A pre-trained CNN was fine tuned with the convolution blocks acting as a\nfeature extractor, and the parameters of the remaining layers updated in an\nincremental fashion. Fine tuning was done using different session splits within\na session and between multiple sessions. We found that incremental fine tuning\ncan help enhance classification accuracy with more fine tuning sessions. After\n2 fine tuning sessions for each experiment, we found an approximate 10%\nincrease in classification accuracy. This work demonstrates that incremental\nlearning through fine tuning on ultrasound based hand gesture classification\ncan be used improves accuracy while saving storage, processing power, and time.\nIt can be expanded to generalize between multiple subjects and towards\ndeveloping personalized wearable devices.",

The primary objective of developing novel hardware is to\nimprove sensitivity and reliability (and possibly to reduce cost). Automation\nhas made NMR much more convenient, but it may lead to trusting the algorithms\nwithout regular checks. In this contribution, we analyzed the signal and\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a function of the receiver gain (RG) for 1H, 2H,\n13C, and 15N nuclei on five spectrometers. On a 1 T benchtop spectrometer\n(Spinsolve, Magritek), the SNR showed the expected increase as a function of\nRG. Still, the 1H and 13C signal amplitudes deviated by up to 50% from\nsupposedly RG-independent signal intensities. On 7, 9.4, 11.7, and 14.1 T\nspectrometers (Avance Neo, Bruker), the signal intensity increases linearly\nwith RG as expected, but surprisingly a drastic drop of SNR is observed for\nsome X-nuclei and fields. For example, while RG = 18 provided a 13C SNR similar\nto that at a maximum RG of 101 at 9.4 T, at RG = 20.2 the determined SNR was\n32% lower. The SNR figures are strongly system and resonance frequency\ndependent. Our findings suggest that NMR users should test the specific\nspectrometer behavior to obtain optimum SNR for their experiments, as automatic\nRG adjustment does not account for the observed characteristics.

In addition, we investigate the\npolymorphism of antigorite with periodicity $m$ = 13--24, which is believed to\nbe all the naturally existent antigorite species. We found that antigorite with\n$m$ larger than 21 appears more stable than lizardite at low temperatures. This\nmachine learning potential can be further applied to investigate more complex\nantigorite superstructures with multiple coexisting periodic waves.",

These include mapping incident\nartifacts onto threat attribution frameworks and employing expert reasoning to\nuncover the most likely responsible APT groups. This research aims to assist\nthe threat analyst in the attribution process by presenting an attribution\nmethod named CAPTAIN (Comprehensive Advanced Persistent Threat AttrIbutioN).\nThis novel APT attribution approach leverages the Tactics, Techniques, and\nProcedures (TTPs) employed by various APT groups in past attacks. CAPTAIN\nfollows two significant development steps: baseline establishment and\nsimilarity measure for attack pattern matching. This method starts by\nmaintaining a TTP database of APTs seen in past attacks as baseline behaviour\nof threat groups. The attribution process leverages the contextual information\nadded by TTP sequences, which reflects the sequence of behaviours threat actors\ndemonstrated during the attack on different kill-chain stages. Then, it\ncompares the provided TTPs with established baseline to identify the most\nclosely matching threat group. CAPTAIN introduces a novel similarity measure\nfor APT group attack-pattern matching that calculates the similarity between\nTTP sequences. The proposed approach outperforms traditional similarity\nmeasures like Cosine, Euclidean, and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) in\nperforming attribution. Overall, CAPTAIN performs attribution with the\nprecision of 61.36% (top-1) and 69.98% (top-2), surpassing the existing\nstate-of-the-art attribution methods.",

While this\napproach improves robustness to the types of noise present in the training\ndata, it confers limited robustness against unseen noises and negligible\nrobustness to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we revisit the approach of\nearlier works that developed acoustic features inspired by biological auditory\nperception that could be used to perform accurate and robust ASR. In contrast,\nSpecifically, we evaluate the ASR accuracy and robustness of several\nbiologically inspired acoustic features. In addition to several features from\nprior works, such as gammatone filterbank features (GammSpec), we also propose\ntwo new acoustic features called frequency masked spectrogram (FreqMask) and\ndifference of gammatones spectrogram (DoGSpec) to simulate the\nneuro-psychological phenomena of frequency masking and lateral suppression.\nExperiments on diverse models and datasets show that (1) DoGSpec achieves\nsignificantly better robustness than the highly popular log mel spectrogram\n(LogMelSpec) with minimal accuracy degradation, and (2) GammSpec achieves\nbetter accuracy and robustness to non-adversarial noises from the Speech Robust\nBench benchmark, but it is outperformed by DoGSpec against adversarial attacks.",

In addition, by intelligently\nanalyzing previous medication tolerance documented in clinical notes and\ndistinguishing between cases requiring different alert types, HELIOT can\npotentially reduce interruptive alerts by over 50% compared to traditional\nCDSSs.

First, we look at the value groups of the valued fields\nwe are interested in, the regular ordered Abelian groups. We establish for\nthese ordered groups a geometric description of forking, as well as a full\nclassification of the global extensions of a given type which are non-forking\nor invariant. Then, we prove an Ax-Kochen-Ershov principle for forking and\ndividing in expansions of pure short exact sequences of Abelian structures, as\nstudied by Aschenbrenner-Chernikov-Gehret-Ziegler in their article about\ndistality. This setting applies in particular to the leading-term structure of\n(expansions of) valued fields. Lastly, we give various sufficient conditions\nfor a parameter set in a Henselian valued field of residue characteristic zero\nto be an extension base. In particular, we show that forking equals dividing in\npseudo-local fields of residue characteristic zero. Additionally, we discuss\nresults by Ealy-Haskell-Simon on forking in separated extensions of Henselian\nvalued fields of residue characteristic zero. We contribute to the question in\nthe setting of Abhyankar extensions, where we show that, with some additional\nconditions, if a type in a pseudo-local field does not fork, then there exists\nsome global invariant Keisler measure whose support contains that type.

Yet the problem of interpreting deep learning findings is rarely more\nevident than in fMRI analyses, as the data is sensitive to scanning effects and\ninherently difficult to visualize. We propose a simple approach to mitigate\nthese challenges grounded on sparsification and self-supervision. Instead of\nextracting post-hoc feature attributions to uncover functional connections that\nare important to the target task, we identify a small subset of highly\ninformative connections during training and occlude the rest.

In this work,\nwe have performed the threshold resummation of the large logarithms that arise\nin the partonic threshold limit $z \\to 1$, up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading\nLogarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. The presence of the two-loop contributions in the\nprocess dependent resummation coefficient $g_0$ makes the numerical computation\na non-trivial task.

    "abstract": "It is no secret that statistical modelling often involves making simplifying\nassumptions when attempting to study complex stochastic phenomena. Spatial\nmodelling of extreme values is no exception, with one of the most common such\nassumptions being stationarity in the marginal and/or dependence features. If\nnon-stationarity has been detected in the marginal distributions, it is\ntempting to try to model this while assuming stationarity in the dependence,\nwithout necessarily putting this latter assumption through thorough testing.\nHowever, margins and dependence are often intricately connected and the\ndetection of non-stationarity in one feature might affect the detection of\nnon-stationarity in the other. This work is an in-depth case study of this\ninterrelationship, with a particular focus on a spatio-temporal environmental\napplication exhibiting well-documented marginal non-stationarity. Specifically,\nwe compare and contrast four different marginal detrending approaches in terms\nof our post-detrending ability to detect temporal non-stationarity in the\nspatial extremal dependence structure of a sea surface temperature dataset from\nthe Red Sea.",

We\nleverage on the approaching detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino\nbackground (DSNB) to explore whether, if the DSNB showed departures from\ntheoretical predictions, we could attribute such modifications to new physics\nunequivocally. In order to do so, we focus on visible neutrino decay. Many of\nthe signatures from neutrino decay are degenerate with astrophysical unknowns\nentering the DSNB modeling. Next generation neutrino observatories, such as\nHyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, as well as DUNE, will set stringent limits on a\nneutrino lifetime over mass ratio $\\tau/m \\sim 10^{9}$-$10^{10}$ s eV$^{-1}$ at\n$90\\%$ C.L., if astrophysical uncertainties and detector backgrounds were to be\nfully under control. However, if the lightest neutrino is almost massless and\nthe neutrino mass ordering is normal, constraining visible decay will not be\nrealistically possible in the coming few decades. We also assess the challenges\nof distinguishing among different new physics scenarios (such as visible decay,\ninvisible decay, and quasi-Dirac neutrinos), all leading up to similar\nsignatures in the DSNB.

Observations\ncan directly constrain the accretion channel but cannot effectively constrain\nmergers yet, while cosmological simulations provide galaxy merger information\nbut can hardly return accretion properties consistent with observations. In\nthis work, we combine the observed accretion channel and the simulated merger\nchannel, taking advantage of both observations and cosmological simulations, to\ndepict a realistic evolution pattern of the SMBH population. With this\nmethodology, we can derive the scaling relation between the black-hole mass\n($M_\\mathrm{BH}$) and host-galaxy stellar mass ($M_\\star$) and the local\nblack-hole mass function (BHMF). Our scaling relation is lower than those based\non dynamically measured $M_\\mathrm{BH}$, supporting the claim that dynamically\nmeasured SMBH samples may be biased. We show that the scaling relation has\nlittle redshift evolution. The BHMF steadily increases from $z=4$ to $z=1$ and\nremains largely unchanged from $z=1$ to $z=0$. The overall SMBH growth is\ngenerally dominated by the accretion channel, with possible exceptions at high\nmass ($M_\\mathrm{BH}\\gtrsim10^{8}~M_\\odot$ or $M_\\star\\gtrsim10^{11}~M_\\odot$)\nand low redshift ($z\\lesssim1$). We also predict that around 25% of the total\nSMBH mass budget in the local universe may be locked within long-lived,\nwandering SMBHs, and the wandering mass fraction and wandering SMBH counts\nincrease with $M_\\star$.",

In this scenario, various candidate polluter stars have been\nproposed to eject gas with altered chemical composition during the\nself-enrichment process. Most of the proposed polluters will also eject\nradioactive $^{26}$Al into the surroundings. Hence, any detection of $^{26}$Al\nin young massive star clusters (YMCs) would support the self-enrichment\nscenario if YMCs were indeed the progenitors of globular clusters. Observations\nof gamma-ray data from COMPTEL and INTEGRAL, as well as detections of\n$^{26}$AlF molecules by the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array\n(ALMA), indicate the maturing of $^{26}$Al detection methods. Detection\npossibilities will be enhanced in the short- to mid-term by the upcoming launch\nof the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). The Square Kilometer Array (SKA)\ncould in principle also detect radio recombination lines of the positronium\nformed from the decay products of $^{26}$Al. Here, we show for a sample of YMCs\nin the nearby Universe, where self-enrichment could plausibly take place. For\nsome nearby galaxies, this could enhance $^{26}$Al by an order of one\nmagnitude. Detecting $^{26}$AlF with ALMA appears feasible for many candidate\nself-enrichment clusters, although significant challenges remain with other\ndetection methods. The Large Magellanic Cloud, with its YMC R136, stands out as\nthe most promising candidate. Detecting a 1.8~MeV radioactive decay line of\n$^{26}$Al here would require at least 15 months of targeted observation with\nCOSI, assuming ongoing self-enrichment in R136.",

We focus on\n$S_4$, one of the most commonly used groups in lepton flavour mixing models.\nThe spontaneous breaking of $S_4$ leads to distinct vacua preserving a residual\n$Z_2$ or $Z_3$ symmetry. Five types of domain walls are found, labelled as SI,\nSII, TI, TII, and TIII, respectively, the former two separating $Z_2$ vacua and\nthe latter three separating $Z_3$ vacua. We highlight that SI, TI and TIII may\nbe unstable for some regions of the parameter space and decay to stable domain\nwalls. Stable domain walls can collapse and release gravitational radiation for\na suitable size of explicit symmetry breaking. A symmetry-breaking scale of\norder 100 TeV may explain the recent discovery of nanohertz gravitational waves\nby PTA experiments. For the first time, we investigate the properties of these\ndomain walls, which we obtain numerically with semi-analytical formulas applied\nto compute the tension and thickness across a wide range of parameter space.

The four-fold topological ground\nstate degeneracy on a torus admits a fermionic or semionic quasiparticle\nexchange statistics. The topological non-triviality of these states is visible\nin the existence of protected gapless edge modes. While the fermionic nematic\nand gapped Z$_2$ spin liquids have equivalent topological orders, they are\nstill thermodynamically distinct due to having different edge modes, in analogy\nto the topologically non-trivial and trivial states of quantum spin-Hall\nsystems. The analysis proceeds by recasting the Z$_2$ gauge theory of spin\nnematics as a continuum limit theory with a larger gauge structure. Nematic\nfractionalization parallels that of a quantum Hall liquid, but the large gauge\nsymmetry restores the time-reversal symmetry and restricts the quasiparticle\nfusion rules and statistics.

To check for spot\ncontamination, we obtain a simultaneous $g$-band transit with SOAR. The\nspectrum exhibits absorption features 30-50% deeper than the overall depth, far\nlarger than expected from an equivalent mature planet, and suggests that HIP\n67522 b's mass is $<$20 $M_{\\oplus}$ irrespective of cloud cover and stellar\ncontamination. A Bayesian retrieval analysis returns a mass constraint of\n$13.8\\pm1.0M_{\\oplus}$. This challenges the previous classification of HIP\n67522 b as a hot Jupiter and instead, positions it as a precursor to the more\ncommon sub-Neptunes. With a density of $<$0.10g/cm$^{3}$, HIP 67522 b is one of\nthe lowest density planets known. We find strong absorption from H$_{2}$O and\nCO$_{2}$ ($\\ge7\\sigma$), a modest detection of CO (3.5$\\sigma$), and weak\ndetections of H$_2$S and SO$_2$ ($\\simeq2\\sigma$). Comparisons with\nradiative-convective equilibrium models suggest supersolar atmospheric\nmetallicities and solar-to-subsolar C/O ratios, with photochemistry further\nconstraining the inferred atmospheric metallicity to 3$\\times$10 Solar due to\nthe amplitude of the SO$_2$ feature. These results point to the formation of\nHIP 67522 b beyond the water snowline, where its envelope was polluted by icy\npebbles and planetesimals. The planet is likely experiencing substantial mass\nloss (0.01-0.03 M$_{\\oplus}$ Myr$^{-1}$), sufficient for envelope destruction\nwithin a Gyr.

As an application, we\ndetermine the modular tensor category of the orbifold of a lattice vertex\noperator algebra under a lift of $-\\mathrm{id}$ for a lattice with odd-order\ndiscriminant form. In that case, the de-equivariantisation is of\nTambara-Yamagami type.\n  As the second tool, we describe how $G$-crossed extensions and condensations\nby commutative algebras commute in a suitable sense. This leads to an effective\napproach to compute new $G$-crossed extensions. As one application, we produce\nthe coherence data that are then used in arXiv:2411.12251 to define a\ngeneralisation of the Tambara-Yamagami categories with more than one simple\nobject in the twisted sector.

Sculptor C (D=2.04$^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$ Mpc;\n$M_V$=$-$9.1$\\pm$0.1 mag or $L_V$=(3.7$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$)$\\times$10$^5$\n$L_{\\odot}$) is consistent with being a satellite of NGC 300. Sculptor A\n(D=1.35$^{+0.22}_{-0.08}$ Mpc; $M_V$=$-$6.9$\\pm$0.3 mag or\n$L_V$=(5$^{+1}_{-1}$)$\\times$10$^4$ $L_{\\odot}$) is likely in the foreground of\nNGC 300 and at the extreme edge of the Local Group, analogous to the recently\ndiscovered ultra-faint Tucana B in terms of its physical properties and\nenvironment. Sculptor B (D=2.48$^{+0.21}_{-0.24}$ Mpc; $M_V$=$-$8.1$\\pm$0.3 mag\nor $L_V$=(1.5$^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$)$\\times$10$^5$ $L_{\\odot}$) is likely in the\nbackground, but future distance measurements are necessary to solidify this\nstatement. It is also of interest due to its quiescent state and low stellar\nmass. Both Sculptor A and B are $\\gtrsim$2-4 $r_{vir}$ from NGC 300 itself. The\ndiscovery of three dwarf galaxies in isolated or low-density environments\noffers an opportunity to study the varying effects of ram pressure stripping,\nreionization and internal feedback in influencing the star formation history of\nthe faintest stellar systems.",

Compared to\ndeterministic methods such as Trotterization, variational quantum compilation\n(VQC) methods employ variational optimization to reduce gate costs while\nmaintaining high accuracy. In this work, we explore the potential of a VQC\nscheme by making use of out-of-distribution generalization results in quantum\nmachine learning (QML): By learning the action of a given many-body dynamics on\na small data set of product states, we can obtain a unitary circuit that\ngeneralizes to highly entangled states such as the Haar random states. The\nefficiency in training allows us to use tensor network methods to compress such\ntime-evolved product states by exploiting their low entanglement features. Our\napproach exceeds state-of-the-art compilation results in both system size and\naccuracy in one dimension ($1$D). For the first time, we extend VQC to systems\non two-dimensional (2D) strips with a quasi-1D treatment, demonstrating a\nsignificant resource advantage over standard Trotterization methods,\nhighlighting the method's promise for advancing quantum simulation tasks on\nnear-term quantum processors.",

Any sample of the source constitutes a new version of\nthe information and the version age of the information is defined with respect\nto the most recent version of the information available for the whole network.\nWe derive a recursive expression for the average version AoI between different\nsubsets of the nodes which can be used to evaluate the average version AoI for\nany subset of the nodes including any single node. We derive asymptotic\nbehavior of the average AoI on any single node of the network for various\ntopologies including line, ring, and fully connected networks. The prior art\nresult on version age of a network by Yates [ISIT'21] can be interpreted as in\nour derivation as a network with a single view of the source, e.g., through a\nPoisson process with rate $\\lambda_{00}$. Our result indicates that there is no\nloss in the average version AoI performance by replacing a single view of the\nsource with distributed sensing across multiple nodes by splitting the same\nrate $\\lambda_{00}$. Particularly, we show that asymptotically, the average AoI\nscales with $O(\\log(n))$ and $O(\\sqrt{n})$ for fully connected and ring\nnetworks, respectively. More interestingly, we show that for the ring network\nthe same $O(\\sqrt{n})$ asymptotical performance on average AoI is still\nachieved with distributed sensing if the number of sensing nodes only scales\nwith $O(\\sqrt{n})$ instead of prior known result which requires $O(n)$. Our\nresults indicate that the sensing nodes can be arbitrarily chosen as long as\nthe maximum number of consecutive non-sensing nodes also scales as\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$.",

Our approach thus avoids the difficulty of\nestimating the original phase, which is highly unstructured and sensitive to\ntime shift.

Next, we show its\neffectiveness on an SE task, using both the VB-DMD and WSJ0-CHiME3 data sets.\nOn VB-DMD, our approach is competitive with conventional solutions.

The cops first choose their initial\nvertex positions, and later the robber chooses a vertex. The cops and robbers\nmake their moves in alternate turns: in the cops' turn, every cop can either\nchoose to move to an adjacent vertex or stay on the same vertex, and likewise\nthe robber in his turn. If the cops can capture the robber in a finite number\nof rounds, the cops win, otherwise the robber wins. The cop-number of a graph\nis the minimum number of cops required to catch a robber in the graph. It has\nlong been known that graphs embedded on surfaces (such as planar graphs and\ntoroidal graphs) have a small cop-number. Recently, Durocher et al. [Graph\nDrawing, 2023] investigated the problem of cop-number for the class of\n$1$-planar graphs, which are graphs that can be embedded in the plane such that\neach edge is crossed at most once. They showed that unlike planar graphs which\nrequire just three cops, 1-planar graphs have an unbounded cop-number. On the\npositive side, they showed that maximal 1-planar graphs require only three cops\nby crucially using the fact that the endpoints of every crossing in an embedded\nmaximal 1-planar graph induce a $K_4$. In this paper, we show that the\ncop-number remains bounded even under the relaxed condition that the endpoints\ninduce at least three edges. More precisely, let an $\\times$-crossing of an\nembedded 1-planar graph be a crossing whose endpoints induce a matching; i.e.,\nthere is no edge connecting the endpoints apart from the crossing edges\nthemselves. We show that any 1-planar graph that can be embedded without\n$\\times$-crossings has cop-number at most 21.

    "abstract": "Despite extensive research, open-vocabulary segmentation methods still\nstruggle to generalize across diverse domains. To reduce the computational cost\nof adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) while preserving their pre-trained\nknowledge, most methods freeze the VLMs for mask classification and train only\nthe mask generator. However, our comprehensive analysis reveals a surprising\ninsight: open-vocabulary segmentation is primarily bottlenecked by mask\nclassification, not mask generation. This discovery prompts us to rethink the\nexisting paradigm and explore an alternative approach. Instead of freezing the\nVLM, we propose to freeze the pre-trained mask generator and focus on\noptimizing the mask classifier. Building on the observation that VLMs\npre-trained on global-pooled image-text features often fail to capture\nfine-grained semantics necessary for effective mask classification, we propose\na novel Fine-grained Semantic Adaptation (FISA) method to address this\nlimitation. FISA enhances the extracted visual features with fine-grained\nsemantic awareness by explicitly integrating this crucial semantic information\nearly in the visual encoding process. As our method strategically optimizes\nonly a small portion of the VLM's parameters, it enjoys the efficiency of\nadapting to new data distributions while largely preserving the valuable VLM\npre-trained knowledge. Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of\nour approach. Notably, FISA achieves new state-of-the-art results across\nmultiple representative benchmarks, improving performance by up to +1.0 PQ and\n+3.0 mIoU and reduces training costs by nearly 5x compared to previous best\nmethods. Our code and data will be made public.",

Our approach provides a sparse\nestimation of the three distinct sparsity structures: the regression\ncoefficient matrix, the conditional dependency structure among responses, and\nbetween responses and covariates. This contrasts with existing methods, which\ntypically focus on any two of these structures but seldom achieve simultaneous\nsparse estimation for all three. A key aspect of our method is that it\nleverages the structural sparsity information gained from the presence of\nirrelevant covariates in the dataset to introduce covariate-level sparsity in\nthe precision and regression coefficient matrices. This is achieved through a\nBayesian conditional random field model using a hierarchical spike and slab\nprior setup. Despite the non-convex nature of the problem, we establish\nstatistical accuracy for points in the high posterior density region, including\nthe maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimator. We also present an efficient\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for computing the estimators.

For a DGFF $\\varphi$ defined in a box $B_N$ with side\nlength $N$, we show that with high probability, there exist low crossings in\nthe set of vertices $z$ with $|\\varphi(z)|\\le\\varepsilon\\sqrt{\\log N}$ for any\n$\\varepsilon>0$, while the average and the maximum of $\\varphi$ are of order\n$\\sqrt{\\log N}$ and $\\log N$, respectively. Our method also strongly suggests\nthe existence of such crossings below $C\\sqrt{\\log\\log N}$, for $C$ large\nenough. As a consequence, we also obtain connectivity properties of the set of\nthick points of a random walk.\n  We rely on an isomorphism between the DGFF and the random walk loop soup\n(RWLS) with critical intensity $\\alpha=1/2$, and further extend our study to\nthe occupation field of the RWLS for all subcritical intensities\n$\\alpha\\in(0,1/2)$.

We propose a magma\ntemperature-cloud feedback as a potential explanation that relies on the\nplanet's atmosphere and surface. In this feedback, under cloud-free conditions,\nstellar radiation heats surface magma, releasing silicate vapor that condenses\ninto clouds. Once formed, these clouds attenuate stellar insolation, thereby\ncooling the surface, reducing vapor supply, and decreasing cloudiness. A time\nlag between surface temperature increase and cloud formation, likely due to\nlagged atmospheric transport of cloud-forming vapor, enables self-sustained\noscillations in surface temperature and cloudiness. These oscillations manifest\nas variations in both the planet's thermal emission and reflected starlight,\ncausing variability in secondary eclipse depths across wavelengths without\nsignificantly affecting the transit depth. Using a simple model, we find that\ndiverse planetary parameters can reproduce the observed infrared brightness\nvariability. We also demonstrate that brightness at different wavelengths can\noscillate out of phase, consistent with recent observations by the James Webb\nSpace Telescope. Additionally, we propose that time-varying and spatially\nnon-uniform cloud cover can result in changing amplitude and phase offset of\nthe planet's phase curve, potentially explaining observations. Finally, we\ndiscuss observational strategies to test this proposed mechanism on 55 Cancri\ne. If confirmed, these observable ocean-atmosphere dynamics on exoplanets would\nprovide valuable insights into the composition, evolution, and long-term fate\nof rocky planet volatiles.",

    "abstract": "Physical solutions to the widely used Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) traffic model and\nthe adapted pressure (AP) ARZ model should satisfy the positivity of density,\nthe minimum and maximum principles with respect to the velocity $v$ and other\nRiemann invariants. Many numerical schemes suffer from instabilities caused by\nviolating these bounds, and the only existing bound-preserving (BP) numerical\nscheme (for ARZ model) is random, only first-order accurate, and not strictly\nconservative. This paper introduces arbitrarily high-order provably BP DG\nschemes for these two models, preserving all the aforementioned bounds except\nthe maximum principle of $v$, which has been rigorously proven to conflict with\nthe consistency and conservation of numerical schemes. Although the maximum\nprinciple of $v$ is not directly enforced, we find that the strictly preserved\nmaximum principle of another Riemann invariant $w$ actually enforces an\nalternative upper bound on $v$. At the core of this work, analyzing and\nrigorously proving the BP property is a particularly nontrivial task: the\nLax-Friedrichs (LF) splitting property, usually expected for hyperbolic\nconservation laws and employed to construct BP schemes, does not hold for these\ntwo models. To overcome this challenge, we formulate a generalized version of\nthe LF splitting property, and prove it via the geometric quasilinearization\n(GQL) approach [Kailiang Wu and Chi-Wang Shu, SIAM Review, 65: 1031-1073,\n2023]. To suppress spurious oscillations in the DG solutions, we employ the\noscillation-eliminating (OE) technique, recently proposed in [Manting Peng,\nZheng Sun, and Kailiang Wu, Mathematics of Computation, in press], which is\nbased on the solution operator of a novel damping equation. Several numerical\nexamples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, and BP\nproperties of our schemes, with applications to traffic simulations on road\nnetworks.",

The analysis of the occultations returns an eclipse depth of\n92+-21 ppm in the CHEOPS passband, 83+-27 ppm for TESS and >2000 ppm in the\nIRAC 1-2-4 Spitzer passbands. Using the eclipse depths in the Spitzer bands we\npropose a set of likely emission spectra which constrain the emission\ncontribution in the \\cheops and TESS passbands to approximately a few dozens of\nparts per million.

To explain\nthis inconsistency, we propose that other energy recirculation mechanisms may\nbe at play other than advection (for example, dissociation and recombination of\nH_2). Another possibility is that the observations in different bandpasses\nprobe different atmospheric layers, making the atmospheric analysis difficult\nwithout an appropriate modeling of the thermal emission spectrum of WASP-3 b,\nwhich is not feasible with the limited spectroscopic data available to date.",

In contrast,\nproxies have minimal impact on H3, which maintains consistent performance due\nto its internal mechanisms. H3 excels under high-loss and high-latency\nconditions, leveraging connection migration and multiplexing to deliver up to\n88.36% improvement in migration scenarios and 81.5% in extreme loss cases.\nWhile optimized H2 can match H3 in some settings, H3 is more robust overall,\nshowing less sensitivity to proxies, impairments, and congestion control\nvariations.",

    "abstract": "Multi-human multi-robot teams are increasingly recognized for their\nefficiency in executing large-scale, complex tasks by integrating heterogeneous\nyet potentially synergistic humans and robots. However, this inherent\nheterogeneity presents significant challenges in teaming, necessitating\nefficient initial task allocation (ITA) strategies that optimally form\ncomplementary human-robot pairs or collaborative chains and establish\nwell-matched task distributions. While current learning-based methods\ndemonstrate promising performance, they often incur high computational costs\nand lack the flexibility to incorporate user preferences in multi-objective\noptimization (MOO) or adapt to last-minute changes in dynamic real-world\nenvironments. To address these limitations, we propose REBEL, an LLM-based ITA\nframework that integrates rule-based and experience-enhanced learning to\nenhance LLM reasoning capabilities and improve in-context adaptability to MOO\nand situational changes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of\nREBEL in both single-objective and multi-objective scenarios, demonstrating\nsuperior alignment with user preferences and enhanced situational awareness to\nhandle unexpected team composition changes. Additionally, we show that REBEL\ncan complement pre-trained ITA policies, further boosting situational\nadaptability and overall team performance.

This\neffect disappears, however, upon time step refinement or the attainment of\nsteady state. The interpretation of the scheme as an Augmented Lagrangian\nmethod similar to Uzawa iteration for incompressible flow helps explain these\nresults. Moreover, due to the slowly evolving solution within undrained seal\nregions, we show that the explicit fixed-stress scheme requires very large time\nsteps to reveal its pressure stabilizing effect in examples of geologic CO$_2$\nsequestration. We note that large time steps can result in large errors in\ndrained regions, such as the aquifer or reservoir regions of these examples,\nand can prevent convergence of nonlinear solvers in the case of multiphase\nflows, which can make the explicit scheme an unreliable source of pressure\nstabilization.

We analyze 25\nhigh-quality spectra from the JDISC Survey reduced with asteroid calibrators as\npresented in Pontoppidan et al. (2024). First, we present a spectral atlas to\nillustrate the clustering of H$_2$O transitions from different upper level\nenergies ($E_u$) and identify single (un-blended) transitions that provide the\nmost reliable measurements. With that, we demonstrate two important excitation\neffects: the opacity saturation of ortho-para line pairs that overlap, and the\nnon-LTE excitation of $v=1-1$ lines scattered across the $v=0-0$ rotational\nband. Second, we define a shorter list of fundamental lines spanning $E_u=$\n1500-6000 K to develop simple line-ratio diagnostic diagrams for the radial\ntemperature distribution of water in inner disks, which can be interpreted\nusing discrete temperature components or a radial gradient. Third, we report\nthe detection of disk-rotation Doppler broadening of molecular lines, which\nconfirms the radial distribution of water emission including, for the first\ntime, the radially-extended $\\approx$ 170-220 K reservoir close to the\nsnowline. The combination of measured line ratios and broadening suggests that\ndrift-dominated disks have shallower temperature gradients with an extended\ncooler disk surface enriched by ice sublimation. We also report the first\ndetection of a H$_2$O-rich inner disk wind from narrow blue-shifted absorption\nin the ro-vibrational lines.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models implemented in hardware on physical devices may be\ndeployed for a long time. The computational abilities of the device may be\nlimited and become outdated with respect to newer improvements. Because of the\nsize of ML models, offloading some computation (e.g. to an edge cloud) can help\nsuch legacy devices. We cast this problem in the framework of learning with\nabstention (LWA) in which the expert (edge) must be trained to assist the\nclient (device). Prior work on LWA trains the client assuming the edge is\neither an oracle or a human expert. In this work, we formalize the reverse\nproblem of training the expert for a fixed (legacy) client. As in LWA, the\nclient uses a rejection rule to decide when to offload inference to the expert\n(at a cost). We find the Bayes-optimal rule, prove a generalization bound, and\nfind a consistent surrogate loss function. Empirical results show that our\nframework outperforms confidence-based rejection rules.",

Early works that embarked on this endeavor sought to estimate\nthe fluctuations due to the presence of a critical point assuming they stay in\nequilibrium. From these results came the proposal to focus efforts on higher,\nnon-Gaussian, moments of the event-by-event distributions, in particular of the\nnumber of protons. These non-Gaussian moments are especially sensitive to\ncritical fluctuations, as their magnitudes are proportional to high powers of\nthe critical correlation length. As the equation of state provides key input\nfor hydrodynamical simulations of heavy-ion collisions, we estimate equilibrium\nfluctuations from the BEST equation of state (EoS) that includes critical\nfeatures from the 3D Ising Model. In particular, the proton factorial cumulants\nand their dependence on non-universal mapping parameters is investigated within\nthe BEST EoS. Furthermore, the correlation length, as a central quantity for\nthe assessment of fluctuations in the vicinity of a critical point, is also\ncalculated in a consistent manner with the scaling equation of state. An\nunderstanding of the equilibrium estimates of proton factorial cumulants will\nbe useful for further comparison to estimates of out-of-equilibrium\nfluctuations in order to determine the magnitude of the observable fluctuations\nto be expected in heavy-ion collision experiments, in which the time spent near\na critical point is short.",

The linear scaling with Matsubara frequency, which is\na distinctive feature of the modes, together with the fact that their\nwavefunctions localize close to the horizon as we approach extremality,\nidentifies them as responsible for the aforementioned quantum effects.

Here, we\ninvestigate the impact of a massive embedded planet on this material transport\nthrough the gap region. We use 3D global hydrodynamic simulations run using\nFARGO3D with gas and dust species to investigate the dust filtration and the\norigin of material that can make it through the gap. We find small dust\nparticles can pass through the gap as expected from results in 2D, and that\nthis can be considered in two parts - filtering due to the planetary-induced\npressure maximum, and filtering due to accretion onto the planet. When gas\naccretion onto the planet is included, we find that the larger dust grains that\ncross the gap (i.e. those with $\\mathrm{St} \\sim 10^{-4}$) originate from\nregions near the mid-plane. We also find that dust and gas that enter the\nplanet-carved gap region pass through the Hill sphere of the planet, where the\ntemperature is likely to be strongly enhanced compared with the mid-plane\nregions from which this material originated. Considering the application of our\nsimulations to a Jupiter-mass planet at $\\sim 100\\ \\mathrm{AU}$, this suggests\nthat CO ice is very likely to desorb from grains in the close proximity of the\nplanet, without requiring any fine-tuning of the planet's location with respect\nto the CO snowline.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in\nautomating various medical imaging tasks, which could soon become routine in\nclinical practice for disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment planning, and\npost-treatment surveillance. However, the privacy concerns surrounding patient\ndata present a major barrier to the widespread adoption of AI in medical\nimaging, as large, diverse training datasets are essential for developing\naccurate, generalizable, and robust Artificial intelligence models. Federated\nLearning (FL) offers a solution that enables organizations to train AI models\ncollaboratively without sharing sensitive data. federated learning exchanges\nmodel training information, such as gradients, between the participating sites.\nDespite its promise, federated learning is still in its developmental stages\nand faces several challenges. Notably, sensitive information can still be\ninferred from the gradients shared during model training. Quantifying AI\nmodels' uncertainty is vital due to potential data distribution shifts\npost-deployment, which can affect model performance. Uncertainty quantification\n(UQ) in FL is particularly challenging due to data heterogeneity across\nparticipating sites. This review provides a comprehensive examination of FL,\nprivacy-preserving FL (PPFL), and UQ in FL. We identify key gaps in current FL\nmethodologies and propose future research directions to enhance data privacy\nand trustworthiness in medical imaging applications.",

    "abstract": "Traditional dataset distillation primarily focuses on image representation\nwhile often overlooking the important role of labels. In this study, we\nintroduce Label-Augmented Dataset Distillation (LADD), a new dataset\ndistillation framework enhancing dataset distillation with label augmentations.\nLADD sub-samples each synthetic image, generating additional dense labels to\ncapture rich semantics. These dense labels require only a 2.5% increase in\nstorage (ImageNet subsets) with significant performance benefits, providing\nstrong learning signals. Our label generation strategy can complement existing\ndataset distillation methods for significantly enhancing their training\nefficiency and performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LADD\noutperforms existing methods in terms of computational overhead and accuracy.\nWith three high-performance dataset distillation algorithms, LADD achieves\nremarkable gains by an average of 14.9% in accuracy. Furthermore, the\neffectiveness of our method is proven across various datasets, distillation\nhyperparameters, and algorithms. Finally, our method improves the\ncross-architecture robustness of the distilled dataset, which is important in\nthe application scenario.",

Here, we introduce precision and recall for logical rules and define\ntheir composition as rule utility -- a cost-effective measure of the predictive\npower of logical theories. We also introduce SPECTRUM, a scalable framework for\nlearning logical theories from relational data. Its scalability derives from a\nlinear-time algorithm that mines recurrent subgraphs in the data graph along\nwith a second algorithm that, using the cheap utility measure, efficiently\nranks rules derived from these subgraphs. Finally, we prove theoretical\nguarantees on the utility of the learnt logical theory.

    "abstract": "Infrared-faint white dwarfs are cool white dwarfs exhibiting significant\ninfrared flux deficits, most often attributed to collision-induced absorption\n(CIA) from H$_2$-He in mixed hydrogen-helium atmospheres. We present James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared spectra of three such objects\nusing NIRSpec (0.6-5.3 $\\mu$m) and MIRI (5-14 $\\mu$m): LHS 3250, WD J1922+0233,\nand LHS 1126. Surprisingly, for LHS 3250, we detect no H$_2$-He CIA absorption\nat 2.4 $\\mu$m, instead observing an unexpected small flux bump at this\nwavelength. WD J1922+0233 exhibits the anticipated strong absorption feature\ncentered at 2.4 $\\mu$m, but with an unexpected narrow emission-like feature\ninside this absorption band. LHS 1126 shows no CIA features and follows a\n$\\lambda^{-2}$ power law in the mid-infrared. LHS 1126's lack of CIA features\nsuggests a very low hydrogen abundance, with its infrared flux depletion likely\ncaused by He-He-He CIA. For LHS 3250 and WD J1922+0233, the absence of a 1.2\n$\\mu$m CIA feature in both stars argues against ultracool temperatures,\nsupporting recent suggestions that infrared-faint white dwarfs are warmer and\nmore massive than previously thought. This conclusion is further solidified by\nKeck near-infrared spectroscopy of seven additional objects. We explore\npossible explanations for the unexpected emission-like features in both stars,\nand temperature inversions above the photosphere emerge as a promising\nhypothesis. Such inversions may be common among the infrared-faint population,\nand since they significantly affect the infrared spectral energy distribution,\nthis would impact their photometric fits. Further JWST observations are needed\nto confirm the prevalence of this phenomenon and guide the development of\nimproved atmospheric models.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning is arguably the most straightforward way to tailor a pre-trained\nmodel (e.g., a foundation model) to downstream applications, but it also comes\nwith the risk of losing valuable knowledge the model had learned in\npre-training. For example, fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier capable of\nrecognizing a large number of classes to master a subset of classes at hand is\nshown to drastically degrade the model's accuracy in the other classes it had\npreviously learned. As such, it is hard to further use the fine-tuned model\nwhen it encounters classes beyond the fine-tuning data. In this paper, we\nsystematically dissect the issue, aiming to answer the fundamental question,\n\"What has been damaged in the fine-tuned model?\" To our surprise, we find that\nthe fine-tuned model neither forgets the relationship among the other classes\nnor degrades the features to recognize these classes. Instead, the fine-tuned\nmodel often produces more discriminative features for these other classes, even\nif they were missing during fine-tuning! {What really hurts the accuracy is the\ndiscrepant logit scales between the fine-tuning classes and the other classes},\nimplying that a simple post-processing calibration would bring back the\npre-trained model's capability and at the same time unveil the feature\nimprovement over all classes.

    "abstract": "Background: X-nuclei imaging (e.g. 31P MRI) suffers low SNR due to lower\ngyromagnetic ratios and tissue concentrations than 1H MRI. Enhancing SNR\nrequires high fields, advanced coils, optimized sequences, and sophisticated\nreconstruction methods. An optimized pipeline is essential for maximizing SNR\nin X-nuclei imaging. Purpose: To develop a toolbox of reconstruction and\nprocessing methods for fast 31P MR imaging, evaluating optimal pipelines for\ntwo data types: 31P-GRE and bSSFP-like MRF imaging. Methods: The toolbox\nincludes coil combination (adaptive and whitened-SVD), k-space filtering,\nreconstruction (Kaiser-Bessel regridding with FFT and NUFFT), and denoising\n(compressed sensing and MP-PCA). 31P MR datasets were acquired at 7T using\nspiral encoding with a double-tuned birdcage coil and a 32-channel phased\narray. GRE parameters: readout 18.62ms, flip angle 59deg, TR 5400ms, TE 0.3ms.\nMRF used a bSSFP-like scheme: readout 9.12ms, TR 19.8ms, TE 0.3ms. Results: For\nGRE data, adaptive coil combination with Kaiser-Bessel regridding (AC-KB)\nachieved highest mean SNRs: 38 (phantom) and 3.4 (in vivo), outperforming\nothers. For MRF data, whitened-SVD with Kaiser-Bessel regridding yielded an SNR\nof 18, surpassing AC-KB's 16. MP-PCA denoised GRE effectively; compressed\nsensing suited MRF data. Conclusion: We demonstrated a toolbox for optimizing\nfast 31P MR imaging pipelines. Optimal methods depend on acquisition and data.\nKaiser-Bessel regridding outperforms NUFFT. Adaptive coil combination and\nMP-PCA denoising are preferred for GRE data; whitened-SVD and compressed\nsensing are superior for MRF data. Careful selection of processing methods is\ncrucial, as conventional 1H MRI techniques may not suffice. The toolbox\nfacilitates future investigation for other X-nuclei datasets.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent broad adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across\nvarious domains, their potential for enriching information systems in\nextracting and exploring Linked Data (LD) and Resource Description Framework\n(RDF) triplestores has not been extensively explored. This paper examines the\nintegration of LLMs within existing systems, emphasising the enhancement of\nconversational user interfaces (UIs) and their capabilities for data extraction\nby producing more accurate SPARQL queries without the requirement for model\nretraining. Typically, conversational UI models necessitate retraining with the\nintroduction of new datasets or updates, limiting their functionality as\ngeneral-purpose extraction tools. Our approach addresses this limitation by\nincorporating LLMs into the conversational UI workflow, significantly enhancing\ntheir ability to comprehend and process user queries effectively. By leveraging\nthe advanced natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, our method\nimproves RDF entity extraction within web systems employing conventional\nchatbots. This integration facilitates a more nuanced and context-aware\ninteraction model, critical for handling the complex query patterns often\nencountered in RDF datasets and Linked Open Data (LOD) endpoints. The\nevaluation of this methodology shows a marked enhancement in system\nexpressivity and the accuracy of responses to user queries, indicating a\npromising direction for future research in this area.

First, because we only have a single\nhistoric sample path of Amazon's capacity limits, we propose a method that\nsamples from a distribution of possible constraint paths covering a space of\nreal-world scenarios.

It is therefore\nunknown whether extremely low-mass (possibly substellar) companions can form\nand survive in the direct UV-irradiated environment of massive stars. In this\npaper, we discuss VLT/SPHERE IFS (0\".15 - 0\".85) observations of six massive O-\nand early B-type stars in Sco OB1 and M17 that each have a low-mass candidate\ncompanion. Two targets have companions that are brown dwarf candidates. The\nother four have candidate companions in the low end of the stellar mass regime\n($\\leq$ 0.30 M$_\\odot$). For three of these, we have obtained a second epoch\nobservation. At least two sources exhibit similar proper motion to that of\ntheir central star. However, given the expected proper motion of background\nobjects, this does not imply certain companionship. We show how future\nfollow-up observations of the brown dwarf candidate companions in $J$, $H$ and\n$L$ bands should allow for an unambiguous confirmation of their nature.",

These parameters serve as promising\nimaging biomarkers in various anatomical targets such as the heart, liver, and\nskeletal muscles. However, measuring these parameters in the upper body poses\nchallenges due to physiological motion, particularly respiratory motion. In\nthis work, we propose a novel approach, motion-corrected (MoCo) MRF T1-FF,\nwhich estimates the motion field using an optimized preliminary motion scan and\nuses it to correct the MRF acquisition data before dictionary search for\nreconstructing motion-corrected FF and $T1_{H2O}$ parametric maps of the\nupper-body region. We validated this framework using an $\\textit{in vivo}$\ndataset comprising ten healthy volunteers and a 10-year-old boy with Duchenne\nmuscular dystrophy. At the ROI level, in regions minimally affected by motion,\nno significant bias was observed between the uncorrected and MoCo\nreconstructions for FF (mean difference of -0.7%) and $T1_{H2O}$ (-4.9 ms)\nvalues. Moreover, MoCo MRF T1-FF significantly reduced the standard deviations\nof distributions assessed in these regions, indicating improved precision.\nNotably, in regions heavily affected by motion, such as respiratory muscles,\nliver, and kidneys, the MRF parametric maps exhibited a marked reduction in\nmotion blurring and streaking artifacts after motion correction. Furthermore,\nthe diaphragm was consistently discernible on parametric maps after motion\ncorrection. This approach lays the groundwork for the joint 3D quantification\nof FF and $T1_{H2O}$ in regions that are rarely studied, such as the\nrespiratory muscles, particularly the intercostal muscles and diaphragm.",

    "abstract": "Text ranking has witnessed significant advancements, attributed to the\nutilization of dual-encoder enhanced by Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs).\nGiven the proliferation of available PLMs, selecting the most effective one for\na given dataset has become a non-trivial challenge. As a promising alternative\nto human intuition and brute-force fine-tuning, Transferability Estimation (TE)\nhas emerged as an effective approach to model selection. However, current TE\nmethods are primarily designed for classification tasks, and their estimated\ntransferability may not align well with the objectives of text ranking. To\naddress this challenge, we propose to compute the expected rank as\ntransferability, explicitly reflecting the model's ranking capability.\nFurthermore, to mitigate anisotropy and incorporate training dynamics, we\nadaptively scale isotropic sentence embeddings to yield an accurate expected\nrank score. Our resulting method, Adaptive Ranking Transferability (AiRTran),\ncan effectively capture subtle differences between models. On challenging model\nselection scenarios across various text ranking datasets, it demonstrates\nsignificant improvements over previous classification-oriented TE methods,\nhuman intuition, and ChatGPT with minor time consumption.",

    "abstract": "Many works have developed no-regret algorithms for contextual bandits with\nfunction approximation, where the mean reward function over context-action\npairs belongs to a function class. Although there are many approaches to this\nproblem, one that has gained in importance is the use of algorithms based on\nthe optimism principle such as optimistic least squares. It can be shown the\nregret of this algorithm scales as square root of the product of the eluder\ndimension (a statistical measure of the complexity of the function class), the\nlogarithm of the function class size and the time horizon. Unfortunately, even\nif the variance of the measurement noise of the rewards at each time is\nchanging and is very small, the regret of the optimistic least squares\nalgorithm scales with square root of the time horizon. In this work we are the\nfirst to develop algorithms that satisfy regret bounds of scaling not with the\nsquare root of the time horizon, but the square root of the sum of the\nmeasurement variances in the setting of contextual bandits with function\napproximation when the variances are unknown. These bounds generalize existing\ntechniques for deriving second order bounds in contextual linear problems.",

Previous work has shown that when hyperedge cut penalties are\nsubmodular, this problem can be reduced to a graph $s$-$t$ cut problem and\nhence solved in polynomial time. NP-hardness results are also known for a\ncertain class of non-submodular penalties, though the complexity remained open\nin many parameter regimes. In this paper we highlight and leverage a connection\nto Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems to show that the problem is NP-hard\nfor all non-submodular hyperedge cut penalty, except for one trivial case where\na 0-cost solution is always possible. We then turn our attention to\napproximation strategies and approximation hardness results in the\nnon-submodular case.

    "abstract": "CoVarince Root finding with classical shadows (CoVaR) was recently introduced\nas a new paradigm for training variational quantum circuits. Common approaches,\nsuch as variants of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, aim to optimise a\nnon-linear classical cost function and thus suffer from, e.g., poor local\nminima, high shot requirements and barren plateaus. In contrast, CoVaR fully\nexploits powerful classical shadows and finds joint roots of a very large\nnumber of covariances using only a logarithmic number of shots and linearly\nscaling classical computing resources. As a result, CoVaR has been demonstrated\nto be particularly robust against local traps, however, its main limitation has\nbeen that it requires a sufficiently good initial state. We address this\nlimitation by introducing an adiabatic morphing of the target Hamiltonian and\ndemonstrate in a broad range of application examples that CoVaR can\nsuccessfully prepare eigenstates of the target Hamiltonian when no initial warm\nstart is known. CoVaR succeeds even when Hamiltonian energy gaps are very small\n-- this is in stark contrast to adiabatic evolution and phase estimation\nalgorithms where circuit depths scale inversely with the Hamiltonian energy\ngaps. On the other hand, when the energy gaps are relatively small then\nadiabatic CoVaR may converge to higher excited states as opposed to a targeted\nspecific low-lying state. Nevertheless, we exploit this feature of adiabatic\nCoVaR and demonstrate that it can be used to map out the low lying spectrum of\na Hamiltonian which can be useful in practical applications, such as estimating\nthermal properties or in high-energy physics.",

However, we observe that long text generation\ncapabilities are not well investigated. Therefore, we introduce the\nHierarchical Long Text Generation Benchmark (HelloBench), a comprehensive,\nin-the-wild, and open-ended benchmark to evaluate LLMs' performance in\ngenerating long text. Based on Bloom's Taxonomy, HelloBench categorizes long\ntext generation tasks into five subtasks: open-ended QA, summarization, chat,\ntext completion, and heuristic text generation. Besides, we propose\nHierarchical Long Text Evaluation (HelloEval), a human-aligned evaluation\nmethod that significantly reduces the time and effort required for human\nevaluation while maintaining a high correlation with human evaluation. We have\nconducted extensive experiments across around 30 mainstream LLMs and observed\nthat the current LLMs lack long text generation capabilities. Specifically,\nfirst, regardless of whether the instructions include explicit or implicit\nlength constraints, we observe that most LLMs cannot generate text that is\nlonger than 4000 words. Second, we observe that while some LLMs can generate\nlonger text, many issues exist (e.g., severe repetition and quality\ndegradation). Third, to demonstrate the effectiveness of HelloEval, we compare\nHelloEval with traditional metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU, etc.) and LLM-as-a-Judge\nmethods, which show that HelloEval has the highest correlation with human\nevaluation.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nuniversal multi-vehicle cooperative decision-making method in structured roads\nwith game theory. We transform the decision-making problem into a graph path\nsearching problem within a way-point graph framework. The problem is formulated\nas a mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP) first and transformed into\na mixed-integer potential game (MIPG), which reduces the scope of problem and\nensures that no player needs to sacrifice for the overall cost. Two\nGauss-Seidel algorithms for cooperative decision-making are presented to solve\nthe MIPG problem and obtain the Nash equilibrium solutions. Specifically, the\nsequential Gauss-Seidel algorithm for cooperative decision-making considers the\nvarying degrees of CAV interactions and flexibility in adjustment strategies to\ndetermine optimization priorities, which reduces the frequency of ineffective\noptimizations. Experimental evaluations across various urban traffic scenarios\nwith different topological structures demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the proposed method compared with MILP and comparisons of\ndifferent optimization sequences validate the efficiency of the sequential\nGauss-Seidel algorithm for cooperative decision-making.",

However, existing studies either\npre-trained VL models on natural data or did not fully integrate\nvision-language architecture and pretraining, often neglecting the unique\nmultimodal complexity in radiology images and their textual contexts.\nAdditionally, their practical applicability in real-world scenarios remains\nunderexplored. Here, we present RadFound, a large and open-source\nvision-language foundation model tailored for radiology, that is trained on the\nmost extensive dataset of over 8.1 million images and 250,000 image-text pairs,\ncovering 19 major organ systems and 10 imaging modalities. To establish\nexpert-level multimodal perception and generation capabilities, RadFound\nintroduces an enhanced vision encoder to capture intra-image local features and\ninter-image contextual information, and a unified cross-modal learning design\ntailored to radiology. To fully assess the models' capability, we construct a\nbenchmark, RadVLBench, including radiology interpretation tasks like medical\nvision-language question-answering, as well as text generation tasks ranging\nfrom captioning to report generation. We also propose a human evaluation\nframework. When evaluated on the real-world benchmark involving three\nrepresentative modalities, 2D images (chest X-rays), multi-view images\n(mammograms), and 3D images (thyroid CT scans), RadFound significantly\noutperforms other VL foundation models on both quantitative metrics and human\nevaluation. In summary, the development of RadFound represents an advancement\nin radiology generalists, demonstrating broad applicability potential for\nintegration into clinical workflows.",

    "abstract": "The Sequential Recommendation modeling paradigm is shifting from Transformer\nto Mamba architecture, which comprises two generations: Mamba1, based on the\nState Space Model (SSM), and Mamba2, based on State Space Duality (SSD).\nAlthough SSD offers superior computational efficiency compared to SSM, it\nsuffers performance degradation in sequential recommendation tasks, especially\nin low-dimensional scenarios that are critical for these tasks. Considering\nthat time-aware enhancement methods are commonly employed to mitigate\nperformance loss, our analysis reveals that the performance decline of SSD can\nsimilarly be fundamentally compensated by leveraging mechanisms in time-aware\nmethods. Thus, we propose integrating time-awareness into the SSD framework to\naddress these performance issues. However, integrating current time-aware\nmethods, modeled after TiSASRec, into SSD faces the following challenges: 1)\nthe complexity of integrating these transformer-based mechanisms with the SSD\narchitecture, and 2) the computational inefficiency caused by the need for\ndimensionality expansion of time-difference modeling. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce a novel Time-aware Structured Masked Matrix that\nefficiently incorporates time-aware capabilities into SSD. Building on this, we\npropose Time-Aware Mamba for Recommendation (TiM4Rec), which mitigates\nperformance degradation in low-dimensional SSD contexts while preserving\ncomputational efficiency. This marks the inaugural application of a time-aware\nenhancement method specifically tailored for the Mamba architecture within the\ndomain of sequential recommendation. Extensive experiments conducted on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code for\nour model is accessible at https://github.com/AlwaysFHao/TiM4Rec.",

Particularly when dealing with heavy objects,\nthe powerful propellers of the drone can inadvertently blow the target object\naway as it approaches, making the task even more difficult. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce SPIBOT, a novel drone-tethered mobile gripper system\ndesigned for robust and stable autonomous target retrieval. SPIBOT operates via\na tether, much like a spider, allowing the drone to maintain a safe distance\nfrom the target. To ensure both stable mobility and secure grasping\ncapabilities, SPIBOT is equipped with six legs and sensors to estimate the\nrobot's and mission's states. It is designed with a reduced volume and weight\ncompared to other hexapod robots, allowing it to be easily stowed under the\ndrone and reeled in as needed. Designed for the 2024 MBZIRC Maritime Grand\nChallenge, SPIBOT is built to retrieve a 1kg target object in the highly\ndynamic conditions of the moving deck of a ship. This system integrates a\nreal-time action selection algorithm that dynamically adjusts the robot's\nactions based on proximity to the mission goal and environmental conditions,\nenabling rapid and robust mission execution. Experimental results across\nvarious terrains, including a pontoon on a lake, a grass field, and rubber mats\non coastal sand, demonstrate SPIBOT's ability to efficiently and reliably\nretrieve targets.

    "abstract": "Exoskeleton robots have become a promising tool in neurorehabilitation,\noffering effective physical therapy and recovery monitoring. The success of\nthese therapies relies on precise motion control systems. Although computed\ntorque control based on inverse dynamics provides a robust theoretical\nfoundation, its practical application in rehabilitation is limited by its\nsensitivity to model accuracy, making it less effective when dealing with\nunpredictable payloads. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a\nnovel model reference computed torque controller that accounts for parametric\nuncertainties while optimizing computational efficiency. A dynamic model of a\nseven-degree-of-freedom human lower limb exoskeleton is developed,\nincorporating a realistic joint friction model to accurately reflect the\nphysical behavior of the robot. To reduce computational demands, the control\nsystem is split into two loops: a slower loop that predicts joint torque\nrequirements based on input trajectories and robot dynamics, and a faster PID\nloop that corrects trajectory tracking errors. Coriolis and centrifugal forces\nare excluded from the model due to their minimal impact on system dynamics\nrelative to their computational cost. Experimental results show high accuracy\nin trajectory tracking, and statistical analyses confirm the controller's\nrobustness and effectiveness in handling parametric uncertainties.

This is due to strong (self-)occlusions, depth ambiguities,\nthe vast intra- and inter-class shape variance, and the lack of 3D ground truth\nfor natural images. Existing deep-network methods are trained on synthetic\ndatasets to predict 3D shapes, so they often struggle generalizing to\nreal-world images. Moreover, they lack an explicit feedback loop for refining\nnoisy estimates, and primarily focus on geometry without directly considering\npixel alignment. To tackle these limitations, we develop a novel\nrender-and-compare optimization framework, called SDFit. This has three key\ninnovations: First, it uses a learned category-specific and morphable\nsigned-distance-function (mSDF) model, and fits this to an image by iteratively\nrefining both 3D pose and shape. The mSDF robustifies inference by constraining\nthe search on the manifold of valid shapes, while allowing for arbitrary shape\ntopologies. Second, SDFit retrieves an initial 3D shape that likely matches the\nimage, by exploiting foundational models for efficient look-up into 3D shape\ndatabases. Third, SDFit initializes pose by establishing rich 2D-3D\ncorrespondences between the image and the mSDF through foundational features.\nWe evaluate SDFit on three image datasets, i.e., Pix3D, Pascal3D+, and COMIC.\nSDFit performs on par with SotA feed-forward networks for unoccluded images and\ncommon poses, but is uniquely robust to occlusions and uncommon poses.\nMoreover, it requires no retraining for unseen images. Thus, SDFit contributes\nnew insights for generalizing in the wild. Code is available at\nhttps://anticdimi.github.io/sdfit.",

The main novel idea for the fast evaluation of the\npreconditioner is to interpolate its symbol, not as a function of the\n(high-dimensional) phase-space variables, but as a function of the wave speed\nitself. Since the wave speed is a real-valued function, this approach allows us\nto interpolate in a univariate setting even when the original problem is posed\nin a multidimensional physical space. As a result, the needed number of\ninterpolation points is small, and the interpolation coefficients can be\ncomputed using the fast Fourier transform. The overall computational complexity\nis log-linear with respect to the degrees of freedom as inherited from the fast\nFourier transform.

Stemming from this scalable\nfoundation, there will be increased growth and competition in research and\nengineering to advance auricular bioelectronics. This activity will lead to\nincreased adoption of these smart headphone-style devices by patients and\nconsumers for tracking health, treating medical conditions, and enhancing\nhuman-computer interactions.",

    "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular technique for fine-tuning\nlarge language models (LLMs) to various domains due to its modular design and\nwidespread availability on platforms like Huggingface. This modularity has\nsparked interest in combining multiple LoRAs to enhance LLM capabilities.\nHowever, existing methods for LoRA composition primarily focus on task-specific\nadaptations that require additional training, and current model merging\ntechniques often fail to fully leverage LoRA's modular nature, leading to\nparameter interference and performance degradation. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of disassembling and reassembling multiple LoRAs at\na finer granularity, analogous to assembling LEGO blocks. We introduce the\nconcept of Minimal Semantic Units (MSUs), where the parameters corresponding to\neach rank in LoRA function as independent units. These MSUs demonstrate\npermutation invariance and concatenation-summation equivalence properties,\nenabling flexible combinations to create new LoRAs. Building on these insights,\nwe propose the LoRA-LEGO framework. This framework conducts rank-wise parameter\nclustering by grouping MSUs from different LoRAs into $k$ clusters. The\ncentroid of each cluster serves as a representative MSU, enabling the assembly\nof a merged LoRA with an adjusted rank of $k$. Additionally, we apply a dual\nreweighting strategy to optimize the scale of the merged LoRA. Experiments\nacross various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing\napproaches in LoRA merging.",

We define three variants of this optimization\nproblem being full, partial and budgeted anonymization. In each, the objective\nis to maximize the number of k-anonymous nodes, i.e., nodes for which there are\nat least k-1 equivalent nodes, according to a particular anonymity measure of\nstructural node equivalence. We propose four new heuristic algorithms for\nsolving the anonymization problem which we implement into a reusable\ncomputational framework. As a baseline, we use an edge sampling method\nintroduced in previous work. Experiments on both graph models and 23 real-world\nnetwork datasets result in three empirical findings. First, we demonstrate that\nedge deletion is the most effective graph alteration operation. Second, we\ncompare four commonly used anonymity measures from the literature and highlight\nhow the choice of anonymity measure has a tremendous effect on both the initial\nanonymity as well as the difficulty of solving the anonymization problem.\nThird, we find that the proposed algorithm that preferentially deletes edges\nwith a larger effect on nodes at a structurally unique position consistently\noutperforms heuristics solely based on network structure. Our best performing\nalgorithm retains on average 14 times more edges in full anonymization, and\noverall ensures a better trade-off between anonymity and data utility.

Here, we have made use of\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations together with a density functional theory\n(DFT) based model for the dielectric susceptibility to determine the Raman\nspectrum of barium zirconate, BaZrO$_3$ (BZO), a well-studied oxide perovskite.\nAt ambient conditions, where the system is cubic, we find excellent agreement\nwith experimentally measured Raman spectra. Our study establishes that the\nrelatively sharp spectra seen experimentally are due to second-order\nscattering. At higher pressures, where BZO is tetragonal, all first-order Raman\nactive modes are identified. Additionally, slightly below the phase transition,\nin the cubic phase, a broad \"central Raman peak\" appears. The origin of this\ntype of peak is controversial and extensively debated in connection to the\ndynamics of the halide perovskites.

As a fundamental problem in the computer\nvision and graphics community, 3D works typically require multi-view captures\nfor per-case training, which severely limits their applicability of modeling\narbitrary characters in a short time. Recent 2D methods break this limitation\nvia pre-trained diffusion models, but they struggle for pose generality and\nscene interaction. To this end, we propose MIMO, a novel framework which can\nnot only synthesize character videos with controllable attributes (i.e.,\ncharacter, motion and scene) provided by simple user inputs, but also\nsimultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality\nto novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a\nunified framework. The core idea is to encode the 2D video to compact spatial\ncodes, considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence. Concretely, we\nlift the 2D frame pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators, and\ndecompose the video clip to three spatial components (i.e., main human,\nunderlying scene, and floating occlusion) in hierarchical layers based on the\n3D depth. These components are further encoded to canonical identity code,\nstructured motion code and full scene code, which are utilized as control\nsignals of synthesis process. The design of spatial decomposed modeling enables\nflexible user control, complex motion expression, as well as 3D-aware synthesis\nfor scene interactions.

All the systems show an upper critical\nsolution temperature, which linearly increases with $n$. Intermolecular effects\nhave been investigated in alkanol + benzaldehyde systems using data from the\nliterature. Interactions in 1-alkanol mixtures are mainly of dipolar type. The\ncorresponding excess molar enthalpies, $H_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$, are large and\npositive, which reveals that interactions between like molecules are dominant.\nInteractions between unlike molecules are stronger for the methanol-containing\nsystem. For the other mixtures, the enthalpy of the (1-alkanol)-benzaldehyde\ninteractions remains more or less constant.

The excess permittivities, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{r}}^{\\text{E}}$, are\nlarge and negative for systems with DMA, whereas they are large and positive\nfor the aniline mixture. From the analysis of these\n$\\varepsilon_{\\text{r}}^{\\text{E}}$ data and of measurements previously\nreported, it is concluded: (i) the main contribution to\n$\\varepsilon_{\\text{r}}^{\\text{E}}$ in systems with linear amines arises from\nthe breaking of interactions between like molecules; (ii) in the DMF + aniline\nmixture, interactions between unlike molecules contribute positively to\n$\\varepsilon_{\\text{r}}^{\\text{E}}$, and such a contribution is dominant; (iii)\nlonger linear amines are better breakers of the amide-amide interactions; (iv)\ninteractions between unlike molecules are more easily formed when shorter\nlinear amines, or DMF, participate. These findings are confirmed by a general\nstudy conducted in terms of excess values of molar orientational and induced\npolarizabilities and of the relative Kirkwood correlation factors for systems\nand components. The ERAS model is also applied to amide + amine mixtures. ERAS\nrepresents rather accurately the excess enthalpies and volumes of the mentioned\nsystems. The variation of the cross-association equilibrium constants,\ndetermined using ERAS, with the molecular structure is in agreement with that\nobserved for $\\varepsilon_{\\text{r}}^{\\text{E}}$.",

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models are considered to be Large\nMulti-modal Models (LMM), due to their extensive training data and a large\nnumber of parameters. Mainstream OVD models prioritize object coarse-grained\ncategory rather than focus on their fine-grained attributes, e.g., colors or\nmaterials, thus failed to identify objects specified with certain attributes.\nHowever, OVD models are pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs with rich\nattribute words, whose latent feature space can represent the global text\nfeature as a linear composition of fine-grained attribute tokens without\nhighlighting them. Therefore, we propose in this paper a universal and explicit\napproach for frozen mainstream OVD models that boosts their attribute-level\ndetection capabilities by highlighting fine-grained attributes in explicit\nlinear space. Firstly, a LLM is leveraged to highlight attribute words within\nthe input text as a zero-shot prompted task. Secondly, by strategically\nadjusting the token masks, the text encoders of OVD models extract both global\ntext and attribute-specific features, which are then explicitly composited as\ntwo vectors in linear space to form the new attribute-highlighted feature for\ndetection tasks, where corresponding scalars are hand-crafted or learned to\nreweight both two vectors. Notably, these scalars can be seamlessly transferred\namong different OVD models, which proves that such an explicit linear\ncomposition is universal. Empirical evaluation on the FG-OVD dataset\ndemonstrates that our proposed method uniformly improves fine-grained\nattribute-level OVD of various mainstream models and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

Understanding how cells regulate these\ntransitions and how these transitions differ from those of inert particles\nremains an open challenge. Addressing these questions requires linking the\nmacroscopic properties of tissues to the mechanical characteristics and active\nresponses of individual cells, driven by sub-cellular processes. Here, we\nintroduce a computational model that incorporates key factors such as cell\ndeformability, lamellipodium-driven dynamics, cell-junction-mediated adhesion,\nand contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL)-a process where cells alter their\nmotion upon contact with others. We demonstrate how these factors, along with\ncell density, regulate the dynamical and mechanical properties of tissues. We\nshow that CIL imparts unique living-like behaviors to cells and tissues by\nreducing density fluctuations. This reduction in fluctuations affects the\ndynamics: it inhibits cell motion in steady states but promotes it in the\npresence of gaps, accelerating wound healing. Furthermore, the stabilization of\ntensile states by CIL, which would otherwise fracture, enables the formation of\ntensile force chains.",

    "abstract": "Developing AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) faces\nsignificant challenges in achieving true Turing completeness and adaptive,\ncode-driven evolution. Current approaches often generate code independently of\nits runtime context, relying heavily on the LLM's memory, which results in\ninefficiencies and limits adaptability. Manual protocol development in sandbox\nenvironments further constrains the agent's autonomous adaptability. Crucially,\nachieving consistency in code and context across multi-turn interactions and\nensuring isolation of local variables within each interaction remains an\nunsolved problem.\n  We introduce MOSS (llM-oriented Operating System Simulation), a novel\nframework that addresses these challenges by integrating code generation with a\ndynamic context management system. MOSS ensures consistency and adaptability by\nusing a mechanism that maintains the Python context across interactions,\nincluding isolation of local variables and preservation of runtime integrity.\nAt its core, the framework employs an Inversion of Control (IoC) container in\nconjunction with decorators to enforce the least knowledge principle, allowing\nagents to focus on abstract interfaces rather than concrete implementations.\nThis facilitates seamless integration of new tools and libraries, enables\nruntime instance replacement, and reduces prompt complexity, providing a \"what\nyou see is what you get\" environment for the agent.\n  Through a series of case studies, we show how this framework can enhance the\nefficiency and capabilities of agent development and highlight its advantages\nin moving towards Turing-complete agents capable of evolving through code.",

As a result, classification methods usually perform\npoorly with these small datasets, leading to weak predictive performance.\nIncreasing the training set with additional synthetic data, similar to data\naugmentation in images, is commonly believed to improve downstream\nclassification performance. However, current tabular generative methods that\nlearn either the joint distribution $ p(\\mathbf{x}, y) $ or the\nclass-conditional distribution $ p(\\mathbf{x} \\mid y) $ often overfit on small\ndatasets, resulting in poor-quality synthetic data, usually worsening\nclassification performance compared to using real data alone. To solve these\nchallenges, we introduce TabEBM, a novel class-conditional generative method\nusing Energy-Based Models (EBMs). Unlike existing methods that use a shared\nmodel to approximate all class-conditional densities, our key innovation is to\ncreate distinct EBM generative models for each class, each modelling its\nclass-specific data distribution individually. This approach creates robust\nenergy landscapes, even in ambiguous class distributions. Our experiments show\nthat TabEBM generates synthetic data with higher quality and better statistical\nfidelity than existing methods. When used for data augmentation, our synthetic\ndata consistently improves the classification performance across diverse\ndatasets of various sizes, especially small ones.

The paper\ndescribes the use of models based on real time records and including solar\nslews, to investigate the most extreme wind variations likely to be encountered\nin future, enabling strategies to be devised to mitigate them. Wind lulls are\nsurprisingly frequent, occasionally lasting a week or more, and are always\nlikely to be beyond the capabilities of stored or imported electrical energy to\nmitigate them. The models indicate that there will be a continuing need for gas\npowered generation to mitigate wind lulls. Currently, Combined Cycle Gas\nTurbines (CCGTs) provide most of the dispatchable generation. However, CCGTs\nare not sufficiently fast acting to cope with the wind and solar slews\nanticipated in future. The paper suggests that a range of already proven\nfast-acting sources of dispatchable generation, including Open Cycle Gas\nTurbines (OCGTs), Internal Combustion Gas-Fired Reciprocating engines (ICGRs)\nand stored electrical energy systems, should be capable of coping with the\nlargest wind and solar slews likely to be encountered up to the year 2035.\nExamples are given of the recent introduction of these fast-acting sources of\ngeneration which, it is suggested, will progressively replace CCGTs as the wind\nand solar fleets increase in size.

Beyond cryptography, protection of speech\ncan be addressed by approaches, such as perturbation, disentanglement, and\nre-synthesis, that eliminate sensitive information of the speaker, leaving the\ninformation necessary for medical analysis purposes. In order for such privacy\nprotective approaches to be developed, clear and systematic specifications of\nassumptions concerning medical settings and the needs of medical professionals\nare necessary. In this paper, we propose a Scenario of Use Scheme that\nincorporates an Attacker Model, which characterizes the adversary against whom\nthe speaker's privacy must be defended, and a Protector Model, which specifies\nthe defense. We discuss the connection of the scheme with previous work on\nspeech privacy.

This paper, by attributing task queues to each IoT device, the UAV,\nand the cloud, proposes a real-time resource allocation framework in a\nUAV-aided MEC system. Specifically, aimed at characterizing a long-term\ntrade-off between the time-averaged aggregate processed data (PD) and the\ntime-averaged aggregate communication delay (CD), a resource allocation\noptimization problem is formulated. This problem optimizes communication and\ncomputation resources as well as the UAV motion trajectory, while guaranteeing\nqueue stability. To address this long-term time-averaged problem, a Lyapunov\noptimization framework is initially leveraged to obtain an equivalent\nshort-term optimization problem. Subsequently, we reformulate the short-term\nproblem in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) form, where a Deep Q Network (DQN)\nmodel is trained to optimize its variables.

For\nthe model we use, the produced energy spectrum of the gravitational waves can\nbe detected by the Square Kilometer Array. Moreover, we propose a possible way\nto detect effects of the particle nature of dark matter, using observational\ndata coming from the guitar nebula, which can work if dark matter is\ncollisional, so interacting dark matter. Without specifying a model for\ninteracting dark matter, thus choosing an agnostic approach for interacting\ndark matter, we assume that the guitar nebula bow shock is generated by the\ninteraction of the high speed neutron star that passes through the interstellar\nmedium, which is assumed to be comprised by interacting dark matter and\nhydrogen. Our main proposal is that the opening angle of the bow shock can be\ndirectly related to the speed of sound of the dark matter particles, and a\nlarge angle of the bow shock could be a strong indicator that the interstellar\nmedium is comprised by collisional dark matter and hydrogen gas.

This phenomenon arises from the preferential\nsegregation of hydrogen around the <001> dislocation, which reduces the energy\nof the reaction product. The resulting <001> dislocation demonstrates\nremarkable stability and transforms into a <001> vacancy-type dislocation loop\nunder strain. These vacancy-type dislocation loops can accumulate during\ncontinuous deformation and dislocation reactions, serving as precursors for the\ninitiation of structural damage, such as cracking and blistering. Our findings\nhighlight the pivotal role of hydrogen in dislocation reactions, uncover a\nnovel defect accumulation mechanism crucial for interpreting recent\nexperimental observations, and represent a significant advance in understanding\nhydrogen-induced damage in bcc metals.",

However, diagnosing viscous flow is difficult as the\nmacroscopic observables of ballistic and hydrodynamic transport such as the\naverage current distribution can be deceptively similar, even if their\nrespective microscopics deviate notably. Based on kinetic Boltzmann theory,\nhere we propose to address this issue via the transverse channel voltage at\nzero magnetic field, which can efficiently detect hydrodynamic flow in a number\nof materials. To this end, we show that the transverse voltage is sensitive to\nthe interplay between anisotropic fermiology and boundary scattering, resulting\nin a non-trivial behavior in narrow channels along crystalline low-symmetry\ndirections.

It is inspired by the method of\nsuper-resolution (SR) structured illumination microscopy (SIM) for overcoming\nthe intrinsic resolution limit in microscopy due to diffraction of light. For\nimplementing the key idea underlying SIM, we propose using a rotating intensity\nmodulator of the radiation beams in front of the stationary PET detector ring\nto masquerade above-the-bandwidth signals of the projection data into\ndetectable, lower-frequency ones. Then, an SR image whose resolution is above\nthe system's bandwidth due to instrumentation is computed from several such\nmeasurements obtained at several rotational positions of the modulator. We\nformulated an imaging model that relates the SR image to the measurements and\nimplemented an ordered-subsets expectation-maximization algorithm for solving\nthe model. Based on simulation data produced by using an analytic projector, we\nshowed that 0.9~mm sources can be resolved in the SR image obtained from\nnoise-free data when using 4.2~mm detectors. Noisy data were produced either by\nadding Poisson noise to the noise-free data and by Monte-Carlo simulation. With\nnoisy data, as expected, the SR performance is diminished but the results\nremain promising. In particular, 1.2~mm sources were resolvable, and the\nvisibility and quantification of small sources are improved despite\nconsiderable sensitivity loss incurred by the modulator. Further studies are\nneeded to better understand the theoretical aspects of the proposed approach\nand for optimizing the design of the modulator and the reconstruction algorithm\nin the presence of noise.",

We apply these methods to the dark\nmatter only runs of the IllustrisTNG simulations to understand the effects of\nbaryon removal, and to the gigaparsec-volume pure dark matter simulation Uchuu,\nto understand the effects of the lower resolution or alternative metrics for\nhalo properties. We find that the machine learning model recovers accurate\nsummary statistics derived from the predicted star formation and stellar\nmetallicity histories, and correspondent spectroscopy and photometry. However,\nthe inaccuracies of the model's application to dark simulations are substantial\nfor low mass and slowly growing haloes. For these objects, the halo mass\naccretion rate is exaggerated due to the lack of stellar feedback, yet the\nformation of the halo can be severely limited by the absence of low mass\nprogenitors in a low resolution simulation. Furthermore, differences in the\nstructure and environment of higher mass haloes results in an overabundance of\nred, quenched galaxies. These results signify progress towards a machine\nlearning model which builds high fidelity mocks based on a physical\ninterpretation of the galaxy-halo connection, yet they illustrate the need to\naccount for differences in halo properties and the resolution of the\nsimulation.",

This study\ninvestigates the use of capacity-based tariffs, export tariffs, and curtailment\npolicies to reduce negative grid impacts without hampering PV deployment. We\nanalyze the effect of such export tariffs on three typical Swiss low-voltage\nnetworks (rural, semi-urban, and urban), using power flow analysis to evaluate\nthe power exchanges at the transformer station, as well as line overloading and\nvoltage violations. Finally, a simple case of mutualization of resources is\nanalyzed to assess its potential contribution to relieving network constraints\nand the economic costs of managing LV networks. We found that the tariff with\ncapacity-based components on the export (CT export daily) severely penalizes PV\npenetration. This applies to other tariffs as well (e.g. IRR monthly,\nCurtailment 30, and DT variable) but to a lesser extent.

    "abstract": "We study the decay of a homogeneous condensate of a massive scalar field of\nmass \\emph{m} into massless fields in thermal equilibrium in a radiation\ndominated cosmology. The model is a \\emph{proxy} for the non-equilibrium\ndynamics of a misaligned axion condensate decaying into radiation. After\nconsistent field quantization in the cosmological background, we obtain the\ncausal equations of motion for a homogeneous condensate including the finite\ntemperature self-energy corrections up to one loop. The dynamical\nrenormalization group is implemented to obtain the time dependent relaxation\nrate that describes the decay dynamics of the condensate amplitude from\nstimulated emission and recombination of massless quanta in the medium. It is\nexplicitly shown that a simple friction term in the equation of motion does not\ndescribe correctly the decay of the condensate. During the super-Hubble regime,\nrelevant for ultralight dark matter, the condensate amplitude decays as\n$e^{-\\frac{g^2}{10} t^2\\,\\ln(1/mt)}$. In the sub-Hubble regime the amplitude\ndecays as $e^{-\\gamma(t;T(t))/2}$ with $T(t)=T_0/a(t)$, therefore the finite\ntemperature contribution to the decay rate vanishes fast during the expansion.\nA main conclusion is that a phenomenological friction term is inadequate to\ndescribe the decay in the super-Hubble regime, the decay function $\\gamma(t)$\nis always \\emph{smaller} than that from a local friction term as a consequence\nof the cosmological expansion. For ultra light dark matter, the time scale\nduring which transient dynamics is sensitive to cosmological expansion and a\nlocal friction term is inadequate, is much longer.

Alongside conventional noise models, our study examines four types\nof miscalibration that are known to affect human annotators. The results show\nthat SLL methods outperform the hard label methods in the majority of settings.\nFinally, we evaluate the methods on a real-world dataset with confidence\nscores, where the SLL methods are shown to match the traditional methods for\npredicting the (noisy) hard labels while providing more accurate confidence\nestimates.",

We map a 0.95'x0.22'\nregion, covering the full extent of the blue-shifted lobe, the central\nprotostellar region, and a small portion of the red-shifted lobe. The jet\ndriving source is not detected even at the longest mid-IR wavelengths. The\noverall morphology of the flow consists of a highly collimated jet, mostly\nmolecular (H2, HD) with an inner atomic ([FeI], [FeII], [SI], [NiII])\nstructure. The jet shocks the ambient medium, producing several large\nbow-shocks, rich in forbidden atomic and molecular lines, and is driving an H2\nmolecular outflow, mostly traced by low-J, v=0 transitions. Moreover, 0-0 S(1)\nuncollimated emission is also detected down to 2\"-3\" (~650-1000 au) from the\nsource, tracing a cold (T=200-400 K), less dense and poorly collimated\nmolecular wind. The atomic jet ([FeII] at 26 um) is detected down to ~130 au\nfrom source, whereas the lack of H2 emission close to the source is likely due\nto the large visual extinction. Dust continuum-emission is detected at the\nterminal bow-shocks, and in the blue- and red-shifted jet, being likely dust\nlifted from the disk. The jet shows an onion-like structure, with layers of\ndifferent size, velocity, temperature, and chemical composition. Moreover,\nmoving from the inner jet to the outer bow-shocks, different physical,\nkinematic and excitation conditions for both molecular and atomic gas are\nobserved. The jet mass-flux rate, momentum, and momentum flux of the warm H2\ncomponent are up to one order of magnitude higher than those inferred from the\natomic jet component. Our findings indicate that the warm H2 component is the\nprimary mover of the outflow, namely it is the most significant dynamical\ncomponent of the jet, in contrast to jets from more evolved YSOs, where the\natomic component is dominant.",

We explore the multiwavelength\nnature of a continuum flare in the Seyfert LCRS B040659.9$-$385922. The all-sky\nX-ray surveys conducted by the eROSITA showed that its X-ray flux increased by\na factor of roughly five over six months, and concurrent optical photometric\nmonitoring with the ATLAS showed a simultaneous increase. We triggered a\nmultiwavelength follow-up monitoring program (XMM, NICER; optical spectroscopy)\nto study the evolution of the accretion disk, broad-line region, and X-ray\ncorona. During the campaign, X-ray and optical continuum flux subsided over\nroughly six months. We detected a soft X-ray excess near the flare peak and\nafter it subsided, both exhibiting a power-law (nonthermal) behavior. We\nmodeled the broadband optical/UV/X-ray spectral energy distribution at both the\nflare peak and post-flare times with the AGNSED model, incorporating thermal\ndisk emission into the optical/UV and warm thermal Comptonization in the soft\nX-rays. Additionally, we find that the broad Heii $\\lambda$4686 emission line\nfades significantly as the optical/UV/X-ray continuum fades, which could\nindicate a substantial flare of disk emission above 54 eV. We also observed a\nredshifted broad component in the H${\\beta}$ emission line that is present\nduring the high flux state of the source and disappears in subsequent\nobservations. We witnessed a likely sudden strong increase in local accretion\nrate, which manifested itself via an increase in accretion disk emission and\nthermal Comptonization emission in the soft X-rays, followed by a decrease in\naccretion and Comptonized luminosity. The physical processes leading to such\nsubstantial variations are still an open question, and future continuous\nmonitoring along with multi-wavelength studies will shed some light on it.",

Existing backdoor defense techniques, primarily\ndesigned for simpler models like image classifiers, often fail to effectively\ndetect and remove backdoors in object detectors. We propose a backdoor defense\nframework tailored to object detection models, based on the observation that\nbackdoor attacks cause significant inconsistencies between local modules'\nbehaviors, such as the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and classification head.\nBy quantifying and analyzing these inconsistencies, we develop an algorithm to\ndetect backdoors.

Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art two-stage object\ndetectors show our method achieves a 90% improvement in backdoor removal rate\nover fine-tuning baselines, while limiting clean data accuracy loss to less\nthan 4%.

Our findings\nreveal that while watermarking or input-level perturbation alone may have a\nnegligible effect on recognition accuracy, the combined effect of watermarking\nand perturbation can result in an adversarial watermarking attack,\nsignificantly degrading recognition performance. Specifically, we introduce a\nnovel threat model, the adversarial watermarking attack, which remains stealthy\nin the absence of watermarking, allowing images to be correctly recognized\ninitially. However, once watermarking is applied, the attack is activated,\ncausing recognition failures. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized\nvulnerability: adversarial perturbations can exploit the watermark message to\nevade face recognition systems.

In this work, we address these limitations by\nintroducing a whole-body RL formulation for end-effector pose tracking in a\nlarge workspace on rough, unstructured terrains.

By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE\nenhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for\neach prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model\ncapacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding\nincrease in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only\ntransformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support\nflexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We\npre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B,\nwhich spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For\nthe first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion\nparameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results\nvalidate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size\nin the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the\nsame number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our\nmodels consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements\nposition Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time\nseries forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and\nflexibility.",

Here, we construct a machine-learning potential\nto describe phonon transport with $ab$ $initio$ accuracy in pristine and\ndefect-laden AlN, following the template of Behler-Parrinello-type neural\nnetwork potentials (NNPs) but extending them to consider multiple charge states\nof defects. The high accuracy of our NNP in predicting second- and third-order\ninteratomic force constants is demonstrated through calculations of phonon\nbands, three-phonon anharmonic, phonon-isotope and phonon-defect scattering\nrates, and thermal conductivity. In particular, our NNP accurately describes\nthe difference in phonon-related properties among various native defects and\namong different charge states of the defects. They reveal that the\nphonon-defect scattering rates induced by V$_{N}^{3+}$ are the largest,\nfollowed by V$_{Al}^{3-}$, and that V$_{N}^{1+}$ is the least effective\nscatterer. This is further confirmed by the magnitude of the respective\ndepressions of the thermal conductivity of AlN. Our findings reveal the\nsignificance of the contribution from structural distortions induced by defects\nto the elastic scattering rates. The present work shows the usefulness of our\nNNP scheme to cost-efficiently study phonon transport in partially disordered\ncrystalline phases containing charged defects.",

Existing\nmethods either rely on costly manual TOG annotations or only extract coarse\ngrasping positions or regions from human demonstrations, limiting their\npracticality in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RTAGrasp, a Retrieval, Transfer, and Alignment framework inspired by\nhuman grasping strategies. Specifically, our approach first effortlessly\nconstructs a robot memory from human grasping demonstration videos, extracting\nboth TOG position and direction constraints. Then, given a task instruction and\na visual observation of the target object, RTAGrasp retrieves the most similar\nhuman grasping experience from its memory and leverages semantic matching\ncapabilities of vision foundation models to transfer the TOG constraints to the\ntarget object in a training-free manner. Finally, RTAGrasp aligns the\ntransferred TOG constraints with the robot's action for execution. Evaluations\non the public TOG benchmark, TaskGrasp dataset, show the competitive\nperformance of RTAGrasp on both seen and unseen object categories compared to\nexisting baseline methods. Real-world experiments further validate its\neffectiveness on a robotic arm. Our code, appendix, and video are available at\n\\url{https://sites.google.com/view/rtagrasp/home}.",

The amount of surfactant adsorbed onto the interface increases\nmonotonously throughout the three phases.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have tremendous potential for grounding\nlanguage, and thus enabling language-conditioned agents (LCAs) to perform\ndiverse tasks specified with text. This has motivated the study of LCAs based\non reinforcement learning (RL) with rewards given by rendering images of an\nenvironment and evaluating those images with VLMs. If single-task RL is\nemployed, such approaches are limited by the cost and time required to train a\npolicy for each new task. Multi-task RL (MTRL) is a natural alternative, but\nrequires a carefully designed corpus of training tasks and does not always\ngeneralize reliably to new tasks. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel\ndecomposition of the problem of building an LCA: first find an environment\nconfiguration that has a high VLM score for text describing a task; then use a\n(pretrained) goal-conditioned policy to reach that configuration. We also\nexplore several enhancements to the speed and quality of VLM-based LCAs,\nnotably, the use of distilled models, and the evaluation of configurations from\nmultiple viewpoints to resolve the ambiguities inherent in a single 2D view. We\ndemonstrate our approach on the Humanoid environment, showing that it results\nin LCAs that outperform MTRL baselines in zero-shot generalization, without\nrequiring any textual task descriptions or other forms of environment-specific\nannotation during training.\n  Videos and an interactive demo can be found at\nhttps://europe.naverlabs.com/text2control",

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown\nadvanced understanding capabilities but may inherit human biases from their\ntraining data. While social biases in LLMs have been well-studied, cognitive\nbiases have received less attention, with existing research focusing on\nspecific scenarios. The broader impact of cognitive biases on LLMs in various\ndecision-making contexts remains underexplored. We investigated whether LLMs\nare influenced by the threshold priming effect in relevance judgments, a core\ntask and widely-discussed research topic in the Information Retrieval (IR)\ncoummunity. The priming effect occurs when exposure to certain stimuli\nunconsciously affects subsequent behavior and decisions. Our experiment\nemployed 10 topics from the TREC 2019 Deep Learning passage track collection,\nand tested AI judgments under different document relevance scores, batch\nlengths, and LLM models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa2-13B and LLaMa2-70B.\nResults showed that LLMs tend to give lower scores to later documents if\nearlier ones have high relevance, and vice versa, regardless of the combination\nand model used. Our finding demonstrates that LLM%u2019s judgments, similar to\nhuman judgments, are also influenced by threshold priming biases, and suggests\nthat researchers and system engineers should take into account potential\nhuman-like cognitive biases in designing, evaluating, and auditing LLMs in IR\ntasks and beyond.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we restructure the Neural Interconnection and Damping\nAssignment - Passivity Based Control (Neural IDA-PBC) design methodology, and\nwe formally analyze its closed-loop properties. Neural IDA-PBC redefines the\nIDA-PBC design approach as an optimization problem by building on the framework\nof Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, the closed-loop stability\nand robustness properties under Neural IDA-PBC remain unexplored. To address\nthe issue, we study the behavior of classical IDA-PBC under approximations. Our\ntheoretical analysis allows deriving conditions for practical and asymptotic\nstability of the desired equilibrium point. Moreover, it extends the Neural\nIDA-PBC applicability to port-Hamiltonian systems where the matching conditions\ncannot be solved exactly. Our renewed optimization-based design introduces\nthree significant aspects: i) it involves a novel optimization objective\nincluding stability and robustness constraints issued from our theoretical\nanalysis; ii) it employs separate Neural Networks (NNs), which can be\nstructured to reduce the search space to relevant functions; iii) it does not\nrequire knowledge about the port-Hamiltonian formulation of the system's model.\nOur methodology is validated with simulations on three standard benchmarks: a\ndouble pendulum, a nonlinear mass-spring-damper and a cartpole. Notably,\nclassical IDA-PBC designs cannot be analytically derived for the latter.",

Its ubiquity reflects the many\nfavourable properties that arise because of it. For instance, branched\nmacromolecules are spatially compact and have a high surface functionality,\nwhich impacts their phase characteristics and self-assembly behaviour, among\nothers. The relationship between branching and physical properties has been\nstudied by mapping macromolecules to mathematical trees whose architecture can\nbe characterized using topological indices. These indices, however, do not\nallow for a comparison of macromolecules that map to trees of different size,\nbe it due to different mapping procedures or differences in their molecular\nweight. To alleviate this, we introduce a novel normalization of topological\nindices using estimates of their probability density functions. We determine\ntwo optimal normalized topological indices and construct a phase space that\nenables a robust discrimination between different architectures of branched\nmacromolecules. We demonstrate the necessity of such a phase space on two\npractical applications, one being ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules with various\nbranching topologies and the other different methods of coarse-graining\nbranched macromolecules. Our approach can be applied to any type of branched\nmolecules and extended as needed to other topological indices, making it useful\nacross a wide range of fields where branched molecules play an important role,\nincluding polymer physics, green chemistry, bioengineering, biotechnology, and\nmedicine.",

    "abstract": "The proposed muon collider presents a promising avenue to explore various\nclasses of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) particles. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the discovery prospects of the scalar leptoquark (LQ) $S_1$ at a\nmuon collider. We consider two benchmark center-of-mass (C.O.M.) energy\nscenarios: 5 TeV and 10 TeV. We assume that the LQ decays into a top quark and\na muon. The collider analysis for an LQ decaying into a top quark is distinct\nfrom that of lighter quarks. A TeV-scale LQ decaying into a top quark can\nproduce an exotic, boosted fat-jet signature. In addition to the usual searches\nbased on pair production of LQs, we also examine the single production mode,\nwhich depends on the $S_1 t \\mu$ coupling. We demonstrate that systematically\ncombining the pair and single production modes significantly enhances the\ndiscovery potential of the LQ at the muon collider. Our signal topology\nincludes at least one hadronically decaying top fat-jet and two oppositely\ncharged muons, thereby enabling the incorporation of the single production\nmode. We show that even with single production alone, it is possible to probe\nLQs as heavy as 4.5 TeV (9.0 TeV) in the 5 TeV (10 TeV) C.O.M. scenario for\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$ couplings.",

Here we apply an action-based\nprocedure for the removal of spurious degrees of freedom for the case of\ngeneral relativity supplemented by a term cubic in the Riemann tensor.

In this study, we present synthetic synchrotron\nemission signatures for different lines of sight and frequencies, derived from\nthree-dimensional relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of pc-scale AGN\njets. These simulations apply different injection nozzles, injecting steady,\nvariable, and precessing jets. Extending our previous study, here, we have\ndeveloped a bridge to connect jet dynamics and particle acceleration within\nrelativistic shocks with non-thermal radiation dominant in jets. The emission\nis derived from Lagrangian particles - injected into the jet and following the\nfluid - accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration and subsequently\ncooled by emitting energy via synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes.\nOverall, the different shocks structures lead to the formation of numerous\nlocalized emission patterns - interpreted as jet knots. These knot patterns can\nfade or flare, also as a consequence of merging or Doppler boosting, leading to\njet variability. We find knots with high-enough pattern speed supposed to be\nvisible as superluminal motion <~5c. Synchrotron spectra of all jets reveal\ndouble-humped structures, reflecting multiple electron populations\ncharacterized by the nature of underlying shock and their age. The precessing\njet is the most powerful emitter, featuring a spectrum flatter than the steady\nand the variable jet. The emission, although essentially governed by the\nacceleration through shocks, depends on the cooling history of the particle as\nwell. Overall, the continuous re-acceleration of electrons through shocks along\nthe jet we found, is an essential prerequisite for observing extended jet\nemission over large time-scales and length-scales.",

We investigate a greedy\nversion of this lattice, first introduced by Chenevi\\`ere, where cover\nrelations replace a factor $DU^k D$ by $U^kD^2$. By relating this poset to\nanother poset recently defined by Nadeau and Tewari, we prove that this still\nyields a lattice, which we call the ascent lattice, $L_n$. We then count\nintervals in $L_n$. Their generating function is found to be algebraic of\ndegree $3$. The proof is based on a recursive decomposition of intervals\ninvolving two catalytic parameters. The solution of the corresponding\nfunctional equation is inspired by recent work on the enumeration of walks\nconfined to a quadrant. We also consider the order induced in $L_{mn}$ on\n$m$-Dyck paths, that is, paths in which all ascent lengths are multiples of\n$m$, and on mirrored $m$-Dyck paths, in which all descent lengths are multiples\nof $m$. The first poset $L_{m,n}$ is still a lattice for any $m$, while the\nsecond poset $L'_{m,n}$ is only a join semilattice when $m>1$. In both cases,\nthe enumeration of intervals is still described by an equation in two catalytic\nvariables. Interesting connections arise with the sylvester congruence of\nHivert, Novelli and Thibon, and again with walks confined to a quadrant. We\ncombine the latter connection with probabilistic results to give asymptotic\nestimates of the number of intervals in both $L_{m,n}$ and $L'_{m,n}$.

    "abstract": "Zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) with style transfer and style control\naims to generate high-quality singing voices with unseen timbres and styles\n(including singing method, emotion, rhythm, technique, and pronunciation) from\naudio and text prompts. However, the multifaceted nature of singing styles\nposes a significant challenge for effective modeling, transfer, and control.\nFurthermore, current SVS models often fail to generate singing voices rich in\nstylistic nuances for unseen singers. To address these challenges, we introduce\nTCSinger, the first zero-shot SVS model for style transfer across cross-lingual\nspeech and singing styles, along with multi-level style control. Specifically,\nTCSinger proposes three primary modules: 1) the clustering style encoder\nemploys a clustering vector quantization model to stably condense style\ninformation into a compact latent space; 2) the Style and Duration Language\nModel (S\\&D-LM) concurrently predicts style information and phoneme duration,\nwhich benefits both; 3) the style adaptive decoder uses a novel mel-style\nadaptive normalization method to generate singing voices with enhanced details.\nExperimental results show that TCSinger outperforms all baseline models in\nsynthesis quality, singer similarity, and style controllability across various\ntasks, including zero-shot style transfer, multi-level style control,\ncross-lingual style transfer, and speech-to-singing style transfer.

In our\nmethod, a backbone model is trained to disentangle the identity- and\nage-related embeddings from speaker information, and an MI estimator is trained\nto minimize the correlation between age- and identity-related embeddings via MI\nminimization, resulting in age-invariant speaker embeddings. Furthermore, by\nusing the age gaps between positive and negative samples, we propose an\naging-aware MI minimization loss function that allows the backbone model to\nfocus more on the vocal changes with large age gaps.

However, to fully\nrealize deep learning at the edge, two main challenges still need to be\naddressed: (i) how to meet the high resource requirements of deep learning on\nresource-constrained devices, and (ii) how to leverage the availability of\nmultiple streams of spatially correlated data, to increase the effectiveness of\ndeep learning and improve application-level performance. To address the above\nchallenges, we explore collaborative inference at the edge, in which edge nodes\nand end devices share correlated data and the inference computational burden by\nleveraging different ways to split computation and fuse data. Besides\ntraditional centralized and distributed schemes for edge-end device\ncollaborative inference, we introduce selective schemes that decrease bandwidth\nresource consumption by effectively reducing data redundancy. As a reference\nscenario, we focus on multi-view classification in a networked system in which\nsensing nodes can capture overlapping fields of view. The proposed schemes are\ncompared in terms of accuracy, computational expenditure at the nodes,\ncommunication overhead, inference latency, robustness, and noise sensitivity.\nExperimental results highlight that selective collaborative schemes can achieve\ndifferent trade-offs between the above performance metrics, with some of them\nbringing substantial communication savings (from 18% to 74% of the transmitted\ndata with respect to centralized inference) while still keeping the inference\naccuracy well above 90%.",

To fulfill this requirement, the stakeholders' exact preferences and\nneeds need to be determined. To do so, we evaluated an explainable job\nrecommender system using a realistic, task-based, mixed-design user study\n(n=30) in which stakeholders had to make decisions based on the model's\nexplanations. This mixed-methods evaluation consisted of two objective metrics\n- correctness and efficiency, along with three subjective metrics - trust,\ntransparency, and usefulness.

With advancements in robust vision-and-language foundation models,\nthere is a growing interest in prompt-based CAC, where object categories are\nspecified using natural language. However, we identify significant limitations\nin current benchmarks for evaluating this task, which hinder both accurate\nassessment and the development of more effective solutions. Specifically, we\nargue that the current evaluation protocols do not measure the ability of the\nmodel to understand which object has to be counted. This is due to two main\nfactors: (i) the shortcomings of CAC datasets, which primarily consist of\nimages containing objects from a single class, and (ii) the limitations of\ncurrent counting performance evaluators, which are based on traditional\nclass-specific counting and focus solely on counting errors. To fill this gap,\nwe introduce the Prompt-Aware Counting (PrACo) benchmark. It comprises two\ntargeted tests coupled with evaluation metrics specifically designed to\nquantitatively measure the robustness and trustworthiness of existing\nprompt-based CAC models. We evaluate state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate\nthat, although some achieve impressive results on standard class-specific\ncounting metrics, they exhibit a significant deficiency in understanding the\ninput prompt, indicating the need for more careful training procedures or\nrevised designs.

We\nnumerically implement this model by constructing a discrete system for a given\nimage resolution using a finite volume method and employing an implicit time\napproximation scheme to avoid time-step restriction.

This effect causes blending of the absorption lines,\nhindering the measurement of the abundances of the elements that are in the\nstellar photosphere. Aims. As the exoplanet transits across its host star, it\nobscures the stellar spectrum that is emitted from directly behind the planet.\nWe aim to extract this obscured spectrum because it is less affected by\nrotational broadening, resolving the blending of weak lines of elements that\nwould otherwise remain inaccessible. This allows us to more precisely measure\nthe metal abundances in ultra-hot Jupiter systems, many of which have fast\nrotating host stars. Methods. We develop a novel method that isolates the\nstellar spectra behind the planet during a spectral time-series, and\nreconstructs the disc-integrated non-broadened spectrum of the host star. We\nhave systematically tested this method with model-generated spectra of the\ntransit of WASP-189 b across its fast-rotating A-type host star, assessing the\neffects of limb darkening, choice of absorption lines, signal to noise regime;\nand demonstrating the sensitivity to photospheric parameters ($T_{\\text{eff}}$,\n$\\log g$) and elemental abundances.

Besides its relevance to many engineering applications, it\nexhibits a rich physics due to the presence of turbulence superimposed to\nlarge-scale structures driven by centrifugal instabilities. The resulting\nsecondary motions, which depend on the channel geometry and Reynolds number,\nbreak symmetry between the convex and the concave surface. We investigate the\neffects of curvature by focusing on two cases of mildly and strongly curved\nchannel, in which shear and inertia are supposed to control the general\nfeatures of the flow, respectively. For each geometry, we examine\nsystematically the effects of the Reynolds number: we run a campaign of direct\nnumerical simulations covering flow regimes from laminar up to moderately high\nvalue of Reynolds number - based on bulk velocity and channel height - of\n87000. Our analysis pivots around the friction coefficient, which is the\nmacroscopic observable of the flow, and explores how the large-scale structures\nchange their shape and role on turbulence for increasing Reynolds numbers.\nSpecial attention is paid to the longitudinal large-scale structures\n(resembling Dean vortices), and how their dynamics of splitting and merging is\ninfluenced by curvature. In addition, we also observe and characterise\ntransverse large-scale structures populating the convex wall of strongly curved\nchannels, which are originated by streamwise instabilities and contribute to\nthe negative production of turbulence kinetic energy.",

We first analytically unravel the complete\nfragmentation structure of this model by labeling each fragment by a unique\nroot configuration and utilizing the transfer matrix method. We show that the\ngrowth of the size of each fragment of the model follows the widely studied\nDyck sequence, and is therefore analytically tractable with the help of Catalan\ntriangles. While the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) does not hold\nwithin the full Hilbert space which exhibits Poisson statistics of the energy\nlevel spacing, an examination of various quantities restricted to the largest\nfragments shows that a weaker version of the subspace-restricted thermalization\nholds. This weaker violation of the ETH within the largest fragments is\nsupported by the presence of subspace-restricted quantum many-body scars due to\nquantum fragmentation. Next, we show that the inclusion of a nearest-neighbor\ndensity-density interaction with strength $V$ induces a spectral transition\nwithin the largest fragment from a weakly ETH-violating phase containing scars\nto a statistical bubble localized phase as $V$ increases. In particular, the\n$V\\to \\infty$ limit produces an integrable model. We find that the addition of\nfinite-$V$ stabilizes the ground state near half-filling while keeping intact\nthe fragmentation structure of the East model. However, this behavior abruptly\nchanges exactly at $V = \\infty$ due to the emergence of a distinct\nfragmentation structure. The infinite-$V$ model has many interesting\nproperties, among which the appearance of the ground state and the largest\nfragment at two different filling fractions is specially noteworthy. Finally,\nwe propose an experimental setup to realize the infinite-$V$ model as a\nparticular limit of a special kind of $t-V$ model with an on-site potential.",

    "abstract": "Image vectorization converts raster images into vector graphics composed of\nregions separated by curves. Typical vectorization methods first define the\nregions by grouping similar colored regions via color quantization, then\napproximate their boundaries by Bezier curves. In that way, the raster input is\nconverted into an SVG format parameterizing the regions' colors and the Bezier\ncontrol points. This compact representation has many graphical applications\nthanks to its universality and resolution-independence. In this paper, we\nremark that image vectorization is nothing but an image segmentation, and that\nit can be built by fine to coarse region merging. Our analysis of the problem\nleads us to propose a vectorization method alternating region merging and curve\nsmoothing. We formalize the method by alternate operations on the dual and\nprimal graph induced from any domain partition. In that way, we address a\nlimitation of current vectorization methods, which separate the update of\nregional information from curve approximation. We formalize region merging\nmethods by associating them with various gain functionals, including the\nclassic Beaulieu-Goldberg and Mumford-Shah functionals. More generally, we\nintroduce and compare region merging criteria involving region number, scale,\narea, and internal standard deviation. We also show that the curve smoothing,\nimplicit in all vectorization methods, can be performed by the shape-preserving\naffine scale space. We extend this flow to a network of curves and give a\nsufficient condition for the topological preservation of the segmentation. The\ngeneral vectorization method that follows from this analysis shows explainable\nbehaviors, explicitly controlled by a few intuitive parameters.

The Lightning Network allows users to establish channels\nbetween each other and subsequently exchange off-chain payments. Together,\nthese channels form a network that facilitates payments between parties even if\nthey do not have a channel in common. The Lightning Network has gained\npopularity over the past five years as it offers an attractive alternative to\non-chain transactions by substantially reducing transaction costs and\nprocessing times. Nevertheless, due to the privacy-centric design of the\nLightning Network, little is understood about its inner workings. In this work,\nwe conduct a measurement study of the Lightning Network to shed light on the\nlifecycle of channels. By combining Lightning gossip messages with on-chain\nBitcoin data, we investigate the lifecycle of a channel from its opening\nthrough its lifetime to its closing. In particular, our analysis offers unique\ninsights into the utilization patterns of the Lightning Network. Even more so,\nthrough decoding the channel closing transactions, we obtain the first dataset\nof Lightning Network payments, observe the imbalance of channels during the\nclosing, and investigate whether both parties are involved in the closing, or\none closes the channel unilaterally. For instance, we find nearly 60% of\ncooperatively closed channels are resurrected, i.e., their outputs were used to\nfund another channel.",

We\ndescribe the tumour evolution through a diffuse interface model coupling a\nCahn-Hilliard-type equation for the tumour phase field to a reaction-diffusion\nequation for a key nutrient proportion, also accounting for chemotaxis effects.\nWe stress that the ability to reconstruct earlier tumour states is crucial for\ncalibrating the model used to predict the tumour dynamics and also to identify\nthe areas where the tumour initially began to develop. However,\nbackward-in-time inverse problems are well-known to be severely ill-posed, even\nfor linear parabolic equations. Moreover, we also face additional challenges\ndue to the complexity of a non-linear fourth-order parabolic system.\nNonetheless, we can establish uniqueness by using logarithmic convexity methods\nunder suitable a priori assumptions. To further address the ill-posedness of\nthe inverse problem, we propose a Tikhonov regularisation approach that\napproximates the solution through a family of constrained minimisation\nproblems. For such problems, we analytically derive the first-order necessary\noptimality conditions. Finally, we develop a computationally efficient\nnumerical approximation of the optimisation problems by employing standard\n$C^0$-conforming first-order finite elements.

To address these questions, we select edge-on galaxies from flagship\nJWST programs and investigate their disc structures in rest-frame,\nnear-infrared bands. For the first time, we identify thick and thin discs at\ncosmological distances, dating back over 10 Gyr, and investigate their\ndecomposed structural properties. We classify galaxies into those that require\ntwo (i.e. thin and thick) discs and those well fitted by a single disc. Disc\nradial sizes and vertical heights correlate strongly with the total galaxy mass\nand/or disc mass, independent of cosmic time. The structure of the thick disc\nresembles discs found in single-disc galaxies, suggesting that galaxies form a\nthick disc first, followed by the subsequent formation of an embedded thin\ndisc. The transition from single to double discs occurred around 8 Gyr ago in\nhigh-mass galaxies ($10^{9.75} - 10^{11}M_\\odot$), earlier than the transition\nwhich occurred 4 Gyr ago in low-mass galaxies ($10^{9.0} - 10^{9.75}M_\\odot$),\nindicating sequential formation proceeds in a \"downsizing\" manner. Toomre\n$Q$-regulated disc formation explains the delayed thin disc formation in\nlow-mass galaxies, leading to the observed anti-correlation between the\nthick-to-thin disc mass ratio and the total galaxy mass. Despite the dominant\nsequential formation, observations suggest that thick discs may continue to\nbuild up mass alongside their thin-disc counterparts.",

In its polar orbit the detector is\ncontinuously exposed to potentially harmful energetic particles. Calibration\nmeasurements taken during the eclipse are used to inspect the performance of\nthis detector. This paper explores the in-orbit degradation of the HgCdTe\ndetector. After five years, the detector is still performing within\nspecifications, even though pixels are continuously hit by cosmic radiation.\nThe bulk of the impacts have no lasting effects, and most of the damaged pixels\n(95%) appear to recover on the order of a few days to several months,\nattributed to a slow spontaneous recovery of defects in the HgCdTe detector\nmaterial. This is observed at the operational temperature of 140 K. The\ndistribution of the observed recovery times has a mean around nine days with a\nsignificant tail towards several months. Pixels that have degraded have a\nsignificant probability to degrade again. The location of faulty pixels follows\na Poissonian distribution across the detector. No new clusters have appeared,\nrevealing that impacts are dominated by relatively low energetic protons and\nelectrons. Due to the observed spontaneous recovery of pixels, the fraction of\npixels meeting all quality requirements in the nominal operations phase has\nalways been over 98.7%.

Such radii are difficult to accommodate with the present-day\norbits of BH1 and BH2 - with semi-major axes of 1.4 and 3.7 au, respectively.\nIn this letter, we show that the maximal radii of the supergiants are not\nnecessarily so large, and realistic stellar evolution models, with some assumed\novershooting above the convective core into the radiative stellar envelope,\nproduce substantially smaller maximal radii. The limited expansion of\nsupergiants is consistent with the empirical Humphreys-Davidson limit - the\nabsence of red supergiants above an upper luminosity limit, notably lower than\nthe highest luminosity of main-sequence stars.

Such denser and thicker regions, namely lipid rafts, are important\ncommunication hubs for cells. Indeed, recent experiments revealed how the most\nof active signaling proteins co-localize on such domains, thereby intensifying\nthe biochemical trafficking of substances. From a material standpoint, it is\nreasonable to assume the bilayer as a visco-elastic body accounting for both\nin-plane fluidity and elasticity. Consequently, lipid rafts contribute to\nmembrane heterogeneity by typically exhibiting higher stiffness and viscosity\nand by locally altering the bilayer dynamics and proteins activity.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented code generation utilizes Large Language Models as the\ngenerator and significantly expands their code generation capabilities by\nproviding relevant code, documentation, and more via the retriever. The current\napproach suffers from two primary limitations: 1) information redundancy. The\nindiscriminate inclusion of redundant information can result in resource\nwastage and may misguide generators, affecting their effectiveness and\nefficiency. 2) preference gap. Due to different optimization objectives, the\nretriever strives to procure code with higher ground truth similarity, yet this\neffort does not substantially benefit the generator. The retriever and the\ngenerator may prefer different golden code, and this gap in preference results\nin a suboptimal design. Additionally, differences in parameterization knowledge\nacquired during pre-training result in varying preferences among different\ngenerators.\n  To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose RRG (Retrieve,\nRefactor, Generate), a novel framework for effective and efficient code\ngeneration. This framework introduces a code refactorer module between the\nretriever and the generator to bridge them. The refactoring process transforms\nthe raw retrieved code into a more concise, efficient, and model-friendly\nversion. It eliminates redundant information and noise, reducing the input\nlength. Consequently, the generator receives higher-quality context, enabling\nit to produce more accurate results with lower inference costs. We conducted\ncomprehensive experiments on multiple datasets. In the experiments, we\nconfirmed the existence of a preference gap between the retriever and the\ngenerator, and RRG effectively bridges this gap. Specifically, RRG achieved\nsignificant performance improvements, with increases of up to 28% on EM, 13% on\nBLEU, and 6.8% on CodeBLEU.",

In this\nframework, a base station (BS) utilizes the DMA hybrid beamforming technology\ncombined with the NOMA principle to maximize communication efficiency between\nnear-field users (NUs) and far-field users (FUs). In conventional communication\nsystems, obtaining channel state information (CSI) requires substantial pilot\nsignals, significantly reducing system communication efficiency. We propose a\nbeamforming design scheme based on position information to address with this\nchallenge. This scheme does not depend on pilot signals but indirectly obtains\nCSI by analyzing the geometric relationship between user position information\nand channel models. However, in practical applications, the accuracy of\nposition information is challenging to guarantee and may contain errors. We\npropose a robust beamforming design strategy based on the worst-case scenario\nto tackle this issue. Facing with the multi-variable coupled non-convex\nproblems, we employ a dual-loop iterative joint optimization algorithm to\nupdate beamforming using block coordinate descent (BCD) and derive the optimal\npower allocation (PA) expression. We analyze its convergence and complexity to\nverify the proposed algorithm's performance and robustness thoroughly. We\nvalidate the theoretical derivation of the CSI error bound through simulation\nexperiments. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme performs better\nthan traditional beamforming schemes.

To\novercome these issues, we propose a unified framework that integrates manifold\nlearning with K-means, resulting in the self-supervised graph embedding\nframework. Specifically, we establish a connection between K-means and the\nmanifold structure, allowing us to perform K-means without explicitly defining\ncentroids.

This approach ensures consistency\nbetween the manifold structure and the labels. Our model effectively achieves\none-step clustering without the need for redundant balancing hyperparameters.\nNotably, we have discovered that maximizing the $\\ell_{2,1}$-norm naturally\nmaintains class balance during clustering, a result that we have theoretically\nproven.

This\nlast scale of power suppression appears by the combined effect of the\npreinflationary background dynamics and an associated initial vacuum state for\nthe cosmological perturbations which differs from the conventional Bunch-Davies\nstate of slow-roll inflation. We revise and correct previous discussions in the\nliterature about the relation between this scale and the scale corresponding to\nthe onset of inflation. The mechanism that produces this cutoff is intimately\nrelated to the criterion determining a privileged vacuum state for the\nprimordial perturbations. We adhere to a recent proposal based on an asymptotic\ndiagonalization of the Hamiltonian of the perturbations and leading to a\nnon-oscillatory primordial power spectrum. With this choice, we are able to\ninvestigate analytically the model, studying in detail some physically\ninteresting cases. These analytic calculations provide further support to our\narguments about the relation between the different scales of the system.",

As a result, current solutions are less effective\nfor real-world usage. This study aims to develop a comprehensive software\napplication domain taxonomy by integrating multiple datasources and leveraging\nensemble methods. The goal is to overcome the limitations of individual sources\nand configurations by creating a more robust, accurate, and reproducible\ntaxonomy. This study employs a quantitative research design involving three\ndifferent datasources: an existing Computer Science Ontology (CSO), Wikidata,\nand LLMs. The study utilises a combination of automated and human evaluations\nto assess the quality of a taxonomy. The outcome measures include the number of\nunlinked terms, self-loops, and overall connectivity of the taxonomy. The\nresults indicate that individual datasources have advantages and drawbacks: the\nCSO datasource showed minimal variance across different configurations, but a\nnotable issue of missing technical terms and a high number of self-loops. The\nWikipedia datasource required significant filtering during construction to\nimprove metric performance. LLM-generated taxonomies demonstrated better\nperformance when using context-rich prompts. An ensemble approach showed the\nmost promise, successfully reducing the number of unlinked terms and\nself-loops, thus creating a more connected and comprehensive taxonomy. The\nstudy addresses the construction of a software application domain taxonomy\nrelying on pre-existing resources. Our results indicate that an ensemble\napproach to taxonomy construction can effectively address the limitations of\nindividual datasources.

New versions of many commercial\ntools, such as DALLE, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, have been released\nrecently, and it is impractical to continually update and retrain supervised\nforensic detectors to handle such a large variety of models. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a zero-shot entropy-based detector (ZED) that neither\nneeds AI-generated training data nor relies on knowledge of generative\narchitectures to artificially synthesize their artifacts. Inspired by recent\nworks on machine-generated text detection, our idea is to measure how\nsurprising the image under analysis is compared to a model of real images. To\nthis end, we rely on a lossless image encoder that estimates the probability\ndistribution of each pixel given its context. To ensure computational\nefficiency, the encoder has a multi-resolution architecture and contexts\ncomprise mostly pixels of the lower-resolution version of the image.Since only\nreal images are needed to learn the model, the detector is independent of\ngenerator architectures and synthetic training data. Using a single\ndiscriminative feature, the proposed detector achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. On a wide variety of generative models it achieves an average\nimprovement of more than 3% over the SoTA in terms of accuracy. Code is\navailable at https://grip-unina.github.io/ZED/.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a major cardiovascular complication of diseases associated\nwith elevated oxidative stress such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\nIn these situations, low density lipoproteins (LDL) undergo oxidation. Oxidized\nLDL display proatherogenic activities through multiple and complex mechanisms\nwhich lead to dysfunctions of vascular cells (endothelial cells, smooth muscle\ncells and macrophages). Oxidized LDL are enriched in oxidized products of\ncholesterol called oxysterols formed either by autoxidation, enzymatically, or\nby both mechanisms. Several oxysterols have been shown to accumulate in\natheroma plaques and to play a key role in atherogenesis. Depending on the type\nof oxysterols, various biological effects are exerted on vascular cells to\nregulate the formation of macrophage foam cells, endothelial integrity,\nadhesion and transmigration of monocytes, plaque progression and instability.\nMost of these effects are linked to the ability of oxysterols to induce\ncellular oxidative stress and cytotoxicity mainly through apoptosis and\nproinflammatory mediators. Like for excess cholesterol, high density\nlipoproteins (HDL) can exert antiatherogenic activity stimulating the efflux of\noxysterols that have accumulated in foamy macrophages.",

To delineate the eddy processes specific to canopy flows, we develop an\n$\\mathcal{L}$-moment based event framework and apply it on a suite of\nobservational datasets encompassing both canopy and atmospheric surface layer\nflows. In this framework, the turbulent fluctuations are considered as a\nchronicle of positive and negative events having finite lengths or time scales,\nwhose statistical distributions are quantified through the $\\mathcal{L}$\nmoments. $\\mathcal{L}$ moments are statistically more robust than the\nconventional moments and have earlier been used in hydrology applications, but\nhere we show how this concept is useful even for canopy flows. The\n$\\mathcal{L}$-moment framework is complemented with wavelet analysis, leading\nto a discovery of a mixed time scale controlling the momentum exchanges between\nthe atmosphere and the canopy air space. The origin of this mixed-scale is\nintimately linked to an interaction between two different eddy processes that\ntransport momentum in the gradient and counter-gradient directions,\nrespectively. This finding gives rise to a conceptual model of canopy\nturbulence that resolves a long-standing issue in canopy flows: why the\nintegral timescale of vertical velocity increases as the heights approach the\nforest floor? Moreover, this model explains the intermittent nature of the wind\ninside a canopy despite its average being nearly zero due to canopy drag.",

    "abstract": "In specific domains like fashion, music, and movie recommendation, the\nmulti-faceted features characterizing products and services may influence each\ncustomer on online selling platforms differently, paving the way to novel\nmultimodal recommendation models that can learn from such multimodal content.\nAccording to the literature, the common multimodal recommendation pipeline\ninvolves (i) extracting multimodal features, (ii) refining their high-level\nrepresentations to suit the recommendation task, (iii) optionally fusing all\nmultimodal features, and (iv) predicting the user-item score. While great\neffort has been put into designing optimal solutions for (ii-iv), to the best\nof our knowledge, very little attention has been devoted to exploring\nprocedures for (i). In this respect, the existing literature outlines the large\navailability of multimodal datasets and the ever-growing number of large models\naccounting for multimodal-aware tasks, but (at the same time) an unjustified\nadoption of limited standardized solutions. This motivates us to explore more\nextensive techniques for the (i) stage of the pipeline. To this end, this paper\nsettles as the first attempt to offer a large-scale benchmarking for multimodal\nrecommender systems, with a specific focus on multimodal extractors.\nSpecifically, we take advantage of two popular and recent frameworks for\nmultimodal feature extraction and reproducibility in recommendation, Ducho and\nElliot, to offer a unified and ready-to-use experimental environment able to\nrun extensive benchmarking analyses leveraging novel multimodal feature\nextractors. Results, largely validated under different hyper-parameter settings\nfor the chosen extractors, provide important insights on how to train and tune\nthe next generation of multimodal recommendation algorithms.",

Unveiling the dynamics of a system of\ntwo coupled chaotic oscillators that leads to the emergence of extreme events\nin the system is an engrossing and crucial scientific research area. Our\npresent study focuses on the emergence of extreme events in a system of\ndiffusively and bidirectionally two coupled R\\\"ossler oscillators and\nunraveling the mechanism behind the genesis of extreme events. We find the\nappearance of extreme events in three different observables: average velocity,\nsynchronization error, and one transverse directional variable to the\nsynchronization manifold. The emergence of extreme events in average velocity\nvariables happens due to the occasional in-phase synchronization. The on-off\nintermittency plays for the crucial role in the genesis of extreme events in\nthe synchronization error dynamics and in the transverse directional variable\nto the synchronization manifold. The bubble transition of the chaotic attractor\ndue to the on-off intermittency is illustrated for the transverse directional\nvariable. We use generalized extreme value theory to study the statistics of\nextremes. The extreme events data sets concerning the average velocity variable\nfollow generalized extreme value distribution. The inter-event intervals of the\nextreme events in the average velocity variable spread well exponentially.

Spiking Neural\nNetworks (SNNs), which are inspired by biological neural systems and operate\nusing sparse, event-driven spikes to communicate information between neurons,\noffer a potential solution due to their lower energy requirements. An\nalternative technique for reducing a neural network's footprint is\nquantization, which compresses weight representations to decrease memory usage\nand energy consumption. In this study, we present Twin Network Augmentation\n(TNA), a novel training framework aimed at improving the performance of SNNs\nwhile also facilitating an enhanced compression through low-precision\nquantization of weights. TNA involves co-training an SNN with a twin network,\noptimizing both networks to minimize their cross-entropy losses and the mean\nsquared error between their output logits. We demonstrate that TNA\nsignificantly enhances classification performance across various vision\ndatasets and in addition is particularly effective when applied when reducing\nSNNs to ternary weight precision. Notably, during inference , only the ternary\nSNN is retained, significantly reducing the network in number of neurons,\nconnectivity and weight size representation. Our results show that TNA\noutperforms traditional knowledge distillation methods and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for the evaluated network architecture on\nbenchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR-10-DVS.

Many such integrated\nplatforms have been explored, but suffer from intrinsic significant performance\ndegradation, because conventional approaches of nonlinear photonic waveguide\ngeometry construction for dispersion engineering focus on waveguide cross\nsection and result in always being multimode as a byproduct. Here we propose\nand demonstrate a methodology that utilizes not only the impact of the\nwaveguide cross section on the modal and dispersion behavior of the waveguide\nbut also includes the impact of the waveguide bend for cutting off high-order\nmodes.

The relationship between structure and information\ntransport remains unclear and hinders the exploitation of the versatility of\ntheir morphologies to store and process electrodynamic information.

Scene\nflow is a crucial element to describe 4D occupancy map tendency. However, an\naccurate scene flow is difficult to predict in the real scene. In this paper,\nwe find that BEV scene flow can approximately represent 3D scene flow in most\ntraffic scenes. And coarse BEV scene flow is easy to generate. Under this\nthought, we propose 4D occupancy forecasting method FSF-Net based on coarse BEV\nscene flow. At first, we develop a general occupancy forecasting architecture\nbased on coarse BEV scene flow. Then, to further enhance 4D occupancy feature\nrepresentation ability, we propose a vector quantized based Mamba (VQ-Mamba)\nnetwork to mine spatial-temporal structural scene feature. After that, to\neffectively fuse coarse occupancy maps forecasted from BEV scene flow and\nlatent features, we design a U-Net based quality fusion (UQF) network to\ngenerate the fine-grained forecasting result. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on public Occ3D dataset. FSF-Net has achieved IoU and mIoU 9.56% and\n10.87% higher than state-of-the-art method.

    "abstract": "This research provides the theoretical feasibility study of a novel\narchitecture of a MEMS differential resonant accelerometer, with switchable and\ntunable electrostatic transmission between the proof mass and the vibrating\nsensing beams. The same beams are used for sensing of the inertial force, while\nthe transmission is switched ON, and for the device's calibration, when the\ntransmission is OFF. Therefore, the beams' response in the OFF state is\naffected by the same factors (temperature, electronics, packaging) as in the ON\nstate, with the only exception for the acceleration. This unique ability to\nphysically disconnect the inertial force from the sensing elements opens\npossibilities for new schemes of the signal processing, including sensitivity\ntuning, zero-bias correction and on-the-fly self-calibration of the sensor. The\ndevice includes a proof mass (PM) and two force-transmitting frames that are\nattached to the substrate by the suspension springs, such that there is no\ndirect mechanical connection between the PM and the frames. Two identical\nsensing beams are attached at their ends to the frames and the substrate. When\nthe electrostatic transmission is switched ON by applying a voltage between the\nPM and frames, the force is transmitted from the PM through the frame to the\nbeams. Disturbance in the electrostatic field, due to the\nacceleration-dependent displacement of the PM, results in the shift in the beam\naxial force and, therefore, in its resonant frequency, assuring the device's\nacceleration sensing. Furthermore, the change in the control voltage tunes the\ntransmission of the input signal, and therefore the scale factor and the\ndynamic range of the sensor. An analytic model of the generic device is\nformulated and verified using finite elements analysis. The tunability of the\ndevice and the compensation of the scale factor thermal sensitivity are\ndemonstrated using the model.",

Recent approaches incorporate\ntransformation sensitivity by explicitly modeling relationships between\noriginal and transformed inputs.

    "abstract": "A significative fraction of high mass stars sail away through the\ninterstellar medium of the galaxies. Once they evolved and died via a core\ncollapse supernova, a magnetized, rotating neutron star (a pulsar) is usually\ntheir leftover. The immediate surroundings of the pulsar is the pulsar wind,\nwhich forms a nebula whose morphology is shaped by the supernova ejecta,\nchanneled into the circumstellar medium of the progenitor star in the pre\nsupernova time. Consequently, irregular pulsar wind nebulae display a large\nvariety of radio appearances, screened by their interacting supernova blast\nwave or harboring asymmetric up down emission. Here, we present a series of 2.5\ndimensional non relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations exploring the\nevolution of the pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) generated by a red supergiant and a\nWolf Rayet massive supernova progenitors, moving with Mach number M eq. to 1\nand M eq. to 2 into the warm phase of the galactic plane. In such a simplified\napproach, the progenitors direction of motion, the local ambient medium\nmagnetic field, the progenitor and pulsar axis of rotation, are all aligned,\nwhich restrict our study to peculiar pulsar wind nebula of high equatorial\nenergy flux. We found that the reverberation of the termination shock of the\npulsar wind nebulae, when sufficiently embedded into its dead stellar\nsurroundings and interacting with the supernova ejecta, is asymmetric and\ndiffers greatly as a function of the past circumstellar evolution of its\nprogenitor, which reflects into their projected radio synchrotron emission.\nThis mechanism is particularly at work in the context of remnants involving\nslowly moving or very massive stars. We find that the mixing of material in\nplerionic core collapse supernova remnants is strongly affected by the\nasymmetric reverberation in their pulsar wind nebulae.",

So far these observables\nhave been analyzed separately, making it impossible to investigate their\ninterconnections. We perform for the first time a joint analysis of quark and\nlepton observables (22 altogether) in a modular flavour model. The model is\nbased on $2O$ flavour symmetry and, within its class, it is characterized by\nthe minimal number of free parameters (14 real constants). The joint analysis\nshows that the model is in good agreement with the experimental data for normal\nneutrino mass ordering, while predicting the leptonic Dirac CP-violating (CPV)\nphase ($\\delta_{CP}$), the two Majorana CPV phases ($\\eta_1$, $\\eta_2$), the\nlightest neutrino mass ($m_1$) and the effective neutrino masses probed by beta\nand neutrinoless double beta decay ($m_\\beta$ and $m_{\\beta\\beta}$). A detailed\ncomparison of the separate (lepton-only and quark-only) and combined (lepton\nand quark) fit results shows differences in best-fit values and jointly allowed\nregions, that reflect a nontrivial interplay between quark and lepton\nobservables in the model. Most importantly, our analysis highlights the\nexistence of significant correlations between various pairs of such\nobservables. For instance, the ratio of the strange and bottom quark masses,\n$r_{sb}$, is strongly negatively correlated with each of the three lepton\nmixing angles and with $\\delta_{CP}$, $m_1$, $m_\\beta$ and $m_{\\beta\\beta}$,\nwhile being positively correlated with $\\eta_1$ and $\\eta_2$.

Third, we offer a\nmulti-perspective investigation of current applications of diffusion models in\nITS domains, including autonomous driving, traffic simulation, trajectory\nprediction, and traffic safety. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodel techniques and highlight key ITS research directions that warrant further\ninvestigation.

The advent\nof message passing neural networks has marked a transformative era in\ngraph-based learning, particularly in the realm of predicting chemical\nproperties and expediting molecular dynamics studies. We present the Moment\nGraph Neural Network (MGNN), a rotation-invariant message passing neural\nnetwork architecture that capitalizes on the moment representation learning of\n3D molecular graphs, is adept at capturing the nuanced spatial relationships\ninherent in three-dimensional molecular structures. MGNN demonstrates new\nstate-of-the-art performance over contemporary methods on benchmark datasets\nsuch as QM9 and the revised MD17. The prowess of MGNN also extends to dynamic\nsimulations, accurately predicting the structural and kinetic properties of\ncomplex systems such as amorphous electrolytes, with results that closely align\nwith those from ab-initio simulations. The application of MGNN to the\nsimulation of molecular spectra exemplifies its potential to significantly\nenhance the computational workflow, offering a promising alternative to\ntraditional electronic structure methods",

To address these challenges caused by\nposition errors, a framework was proposed to compensate it by Channel Knowledge\nMap (CKM), which stores channel state information (CSI). By taking the\npositions with errors as input, the generated CKM could give a prediction of\nsignal attenuation which is close to true positions. Based on that, the\npredictions are utilized to calculate the received power and a PPO-based\nalgorithm is applied to optimize the compensation. After training, the\nframework is able to find a strategy that minimize the flight time under\ncommunication constraints and positioning error. Besides, the confidence\ninterval is calculated to assist the allocation of power and the update of CKM\nis studied to adapt to the dynamic environment.

The displacement\nis discretized at midpoints of edges of grid boxes while the concentrations are\ndiscretize at grid points. The local algorithm is an iteration over all the\ngrid boxes that locally minimizes the energy on each grid box, keeping Gauss'\nlaw satisfied. We prove that the energy functionals admit unique minimizers\nthat are solutions to the corresponding Poisson's and charge-conserved PB\nequation, respectively. Local equilibrium conditions are identified to\ncharacterize the finite-difference minimizers of the discretized energy\nfunctionals. These conditions are the curl free for the Poisson case and the\ndiscrete Boltzmann distributions for the PB case, respectively. Next, we obtain\nthe uniform bound with respect to the grid size h and O(h2)-error estimates in\nmaximum norm for the finite-difference minimizers. The local algorithms are\ndetailed, and a new local algorithm with shift is proposed to treat the general\ncase of a variable coefficient for the Poisson energy.

Traditional forecasting methods struggle to cope with the\ngrowing complexity and variability of gas consumption patterns across diverse\nindustries and commercial sectors. To address these challenges, we propose the\nfirst foundation model specifically tailored for natural gas demand\nforecasting. Foundation models, known for their ability to generalize across\ntasks and datasets, offer a robust solution to the limitations of traditional\nmethods, such as the need for separate models for different customer segments\nand their limited generalization capabilities. Our approach leverages\ncontrastive learning to improve prediction accuracy in real-world scenarios,\nparticularly by tackling issues such as noise in historical consumption data\nand the potential misclassification of similar data samples, which can lead to\ndegradation in the quaility of the representation and thus the accuracy of\ndownstream forecasting tasks. By integrating advanced noise filtering\ntechniques within the contrastive learning framework, our model enhances the\nquality of learned representations, leading to more accurate predictions.\nFurthermore, the model undergoes industry-specific fine-tuning during\npretraining, enabling it to better capture the unique characteristics of gas\nconsumption across various sectors. We conducted extensive experiments using a\nlarge-scale dataset from ENN Group, which includes data from over 10,000\nindustrial, commercial, and welfare-related customers across multiple regions.\nOur model outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating a\nrelative improvement in MSE by 3.68\\% and in MASE by 6.15\\% compared to the\nbest available model.",

    "abstract": "Context: Over the last decade, the forestry sector has undergone substantial\nchanges, evolving from a post-2008 financial crisis landscape to incorporating\npolicies favoring sustainable and green alternatives, especially after the 2015\nParis agreement. This evolution was drastically disrupted with the advent of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, causing unprecedented interruptions in supply\nchains, product markets, and data collection. Grasping the aftermath of the\nCOVID-19, regional instances of the forest supply chain sector need synthetic\npictures of their present state and future opportunities for emerging wood\nproducts and better regional-scale carbon balance. But given the impact of\nCOVID-19 lock-down on data collection, the production of such synthetic\npictures has become more complex, yet essential. This was the case for the\nregional supply chain of the Grand-Est region in France that we studied.\n  Aims: For this study, our aim was to demonstrate that an integrated\nmethodology could provide such synthetic picture even though we sued\nheterogenous sources of data and different analytical objectives: i.e. (1)\nretrospectively evaluate the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic on the supply chain\noutcomes within the forestry sector; and then (2) retrospectively explore\npossible options of structural change of regional supply chain that would be\nrequired to simultaneously recover from COVID-19 and transit to new objectives\nin line with the extraction of new bio-molecules from wood biomass, and with\nthe reduction of the regional scale carbon footprint (in line with the IPCC\nParis Agreement)\n  Methods: To achieve this, our methodological approach was decomposed into\nthree steps. We first used a Material Flow Analysis (MFA) recently conducted on\nthe forestry sector in the Grand Est region to establish a Sankey diagram (i.e.\na schematic representation of industrial sectors and biomass flows along the\nsupply chain) for the pre-Covid-19 period (2014-2018). Then we compared\npre-Covid-19 Sankey diagram to the only source of data we could access from the\npost-Covid-19 period (2020-2021) in order to estimate the impact of Covid-19.\nFinally, we used as input the reconciled supply chain model into a\nconsequential Wood Product Model (WPMs), called CAT (carbon accounting tool) in\norder to compare three prospective scenarios: (1) a scenario that projected\n2020-2021 Covid-19 conditions and assumed pre-Covid-19 business as usual\npractices, (2) a scenario illustrating the consequence or rerouting some of the\nbiomass to satisfy the expected increase in pulp and paper production to\nsatisfy the needs of the industry after Covid-19, and (3) a scenario that\nexplored new opportunities in term of extraction of novel bio-molecules by the\nemerging biochemical wood industry. For every scenario we also evaluated the\nregional carbon gains and losses that these changes implied.\n  Results: Our study conducted a detailed analysis of the impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the forestry sector's supply chain in the Grand Est\nregion, using a dynamic and integrated Wood Product Model. We found significant\ndisruptions during the pandemic period, with notable declines in industrial\nwood chips and timber hardwood production by 41.8% and 40%, respectively.\nConversely, there were substantial increases in fuelwood, timber sawdust, and\ntimber softwood, rising by 14.15%, 44.23%, and 15.29% respectively. These\nfluctuations underscore the resilience and vulnerabilities within the regional\nwood supply chain. Our findings also emphasize the potential for strategic\nrerouting of biomass flows to meet changing industry demands, which could play\na crucial role in supporting the sector's recovery and adaptation to\npost-pandemic conditions.\n  Discussion and conclusion: In addition, our study recognizes the limitations\nof the current approach combining MFA and WPM and suggests potential areas of\nenhancement. Ultimately, our findings shed light on the need to develop more\nintegrated analytical methods to provide useful synthetic pictures of regional\nscale supply chains, when there is a need to adapt it to evolving situations\nand complex data landscapes.",

Using the macro-maneuvers already\nidentified in previous works, a comparison method between trajectories with\ndifferent lengths using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is proposed, which\ncombined with an Expectation-Maximization (EM) inspired method, defines the\ndifferent clusters that represent the behaviors observed. This is also paired\nwith a Kullback-Liebler divergent (KL) criteria to define when the clusters\nneed to be split or merged. Finally, the behaviors for each macro-maneuver are\ndetermined by each cluster discovered, without using any map information about\nthe environment and being dynamically consistent with vehicle motion. By\nobservation it becomes clear that the two main factors for driver's behavior\nare their assertiveness and interaction with other road users.",

In this study, we introduce a new deep-learning-based phase\nretrieval method for imperfect diffraction data. This method provides robust\nphase retrieval for simulated data and performs well on weak-signal\nsingle-pulse diffraction data from X-ray free-electron lasers. Moreover, the\nmethod significantly reduces data processing time, facilitating real-time image\nreconstructions that are crucial for high-repetition-rate data acquisition.\nThus, this approach offers a reliable solution to the phase problem and is\nexpected to be widely adopted across various research areas.",

However, achieving\nagile control, which pushes the limits of robotic performance, still relies on\nspecialist models that require extensive parameter tuning. To leverage\ngeneralist-model adaptability and flexibility while achieving specialist-level\nagility, we propose AnyCar, a transformer-based generalist dynamics model\ndesigned for agile control of various wheeled robots. To collect training data,\nwe unify multiple simulators and leverage different physics backends to\nsimulate vehicles with diverse sizes, scales, and physical properties across\nvarious terrains. With robust training and real-world fine-tuning, our model\nenables precise adaptation to different vehicles, even in the wild and under\nlarge state estimation errors. In real-world experiments, AnyCar shows both\nfew-shot and zero-shot generalization across a wide range of vehicles and\nenvironments, where our model, combined with a sampling-based MPC, outperforms\nspecialist models by up to 54%. These results represent a key step toward\nbuilding a foundation model for agile wheeled robot control. We will also\nopen-source our framework to support further research.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of text-to-image models has recently sparked significant\ninterest, but the attendant is a looming shadow of potential infringement by\nviolating the user terms. Specifically, an adversary may exploit data created\nby a commercial model to train their own without proper authorization. To\naddress such risk, it is crucial to investigate the attribution of a suspicious\nmodel's training data by determining whether its training data originates,\nwholly or partially, from a specific source model. To trace the generated data,\nexisting methods require applying extra watermarks during either the training\nor inference phases of the source model. However, these methods are impractical\nfor pre-trained models that have been released, especially when model owners\nlack security expertise. To tackle this challenge, we propose an injection-free\ntraining data attribution method for text-to-image models. It can identify\nwhether a suspicious model's training data stems from a source model, without\nadditional modifications on the source model. The crux of our method lies in\nthe inherent memorization characteristic of text-to-image models. Our core\ninsight is that the memorization of the training dataset is passed down through\nthe data generated by the source model to the model trained on that data,\nmaking the source model and the infringing model exhibit consistent behaviors\non specific samples. Therefore, our approach involves developing algorithms to\nuncover these distinct samples and using them as inherent watermarks to verify\nif a suspicious model originates from the source model. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves an accuracy of over 80\\% in identifying\nthe source of a suspicious model's training data, without interfering the\noriginal training or generation process of the source model.",

    "abstract": "Context: Dust grains in the interstellar medium are heated by the integrated\nradiation from stars in the Milky Way. A knowledge of the Local Interstellar\nRadiation Field (LISRF) is thus necessary to interpret observations of dust\nemission in the infrared and constrain (some of) the properties of interstellar\ngrains. The LISRF representation most widely used in dust modelling still dates\nback to the seminal works of Mezger et al. (1982) and Mathis et al. (1983).\nAims: A new version of the LISRF is presented, starting from the photometry of\nthe Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and revisiting available data, among which\nobservations from the Pioneer 10 and 11 probes. Methods: The LISRF contribution\nby direct starlight is estimated in the Gaia bands by summing fluxes of all\nstars in DR3; the LISRF is extrapolated from the optical to the ultraviolet and\nnear-infrared, using the astrophysical parameters provided by DR3 for a\nsubsample of Gaia stars; the correlation between dust emission at 100 um and\nresidual diffuse emission in the Pioneer and other available maps is exploited\nto derive the contribution of dust-scattered starlight to the LISRF. Results:\nThe new LISRF is significantly redder and emits ~30% more energy than the old\nmodel. The old LISRF is almost a factor two lower in the near-infrared, while\nin the optical it accounts only for direct starlight. For |b|<50 degree,\ndiffuse starlight contributes on average to ~25% of the total radiation, 3x\nmore than what predicted by literature estimates at high Galactic latitude.\nConclusions: The new LISRF can modify the predicted mid-infrared dust emission\nbeyond the uncertainties normally assumed between dust models and observational\nconstraints; these differences should be taken into account to redefine the\nproperties of small grains and of the carriers of the mid-infrared emission\nbands.",

    "abstract": "Time-series forecasting is a challenging problem that traditionally requires\nspecialized models custom-trained for the specific task at hand. Recently,\ninspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained\non vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a\npromising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining\ncharacteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot\nlearning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without\nexplicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot\nlearning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic\nsystems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and $10^8$ timepoints,\nwe find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to\ncustom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when\ntraining data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, large\nfoundation models are able to preserve the geometric and statistical properties\nof the chaotic attractors. We attribute this success to foundation models'\nability to perform in-context learning and identify context parroting as a\nsimple mechanism used by these models to capture the long-term behavior of\nchaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the potential of foundation\nmodels as a tool for probing nonlinear and complex systems.",

    "abstract": "As various types of crime continue to threaten public safety and economic\ndevelopment, predicting the occurrence of multiple types of crimes becomes\nincreasingly vital for effective prevention measures. Although extensive\nefforts have been made, most of them overlook the heterogeneity of different\ncrime categories and fail to address the issue of imbalanced spatial\ndistribution. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal\nMixture-of-Graph-Experts (ST-MoGE) framework for collective multiple-type crime\nprediction. To enhance the model's ability to identify diverse spatial-temporal\ndependencies and mitigate potential conflicts caused by spatial-temporal\nheterogeneity of different crime categories, we introduce an attentive-gated\nMixture-of-Graph-Experts (MGEs) module to capture the distinctive and shared\ncrime patterns of each crime category. Then, we propose Cross-Expert\nContrastive Learning(CECL) to update the MGEs and force each expert to focus on\nspecific pattern modeling, thereby reducing blending and redundancy.\nFurthermore, to address the issue of imbalanced spatial distribution, we\npropose a Hierarchical Adaptive Loss Re-weighting (HALR) approach to eliminate\nbiases and insufficient learning of data-scarce regions. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of our methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two\nreal-world crime datasets and compare our results with twelve advanced\nbaselines. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods.",

Consequently, grids experience blackouts and\nhigh power flow oscillations. Existing grid protection mechanisms, originally\ndesigned to tackle natural faults in transmission lines and generator outages,\nare ineffective against such intelligently crafted attacks. This is because\ngrid operators overlook potential scenarios of cyber-physical attacks during\ntheir design phase. In this work, we propose a safe Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL)-based framework for mitigating attacks on smart grids. The DRL agent\neffectively neutralizes cyber-physical attacks on grid surfaces by triggering\nappropriate sequences of existing protection schemes. The safety of the DRL\nagent is formally verified through a reachability analysis method.\nAdditionally, our framework is designed for deployment on CUDA-enabled GPU\nsystems, which enables faster execution of these protection sequences and their\nreal-time validation.

However, in high-dimensional settings, such an\nidentification remains challenging in the sense of lack of detection power of\nHTEs with insufficient sample instances for each batch sequentially collected\nonline. In this article, a novel high-dimensional test is proposed, named as\nthe penalized online sequential test (POST), to identify HTEs and select useful\ncovariates simultaneously under continuous monitoring in generalized linear\nmodels (GLMs), which achieves high detection power and controls the Type I\nerror. A penalized score test statistic is developed along with an extended\np-value process for the online collection of samples, and the proposed POST\nmethod is further extended to multiple online testing scenarios, where both\nhigh true positive rates and under-controlled false discovery rates are\nachieved simultaneously. Asymptotic results are established and justified to\nguarantee properties of the POST, and its performance is evaluated through\nsimulations and analysis of real data, compared with the state-of-the-art\nonline test methods.

Our,contributions lie in two key\nareas: firstly, the development of a,robust system for evaluating textual\nanswers in STEM, leveraging,sample answers for precise comparison and grading,\nenabled by,advanced algorithms and natural language processing\ntechniques.,Secondly, a focus on enhancing diagram evaluation,\nparticularly,flowcharts, within the STEM context, by transforming diagrams,into\ntextual representations for nuanced assessment using a,Large Language Model\n(LLM). By bridging the gap between,visual representation and semantic meaning,\nour approach ensures accurate evaluation while minimizing manual\nintervention.,Through the integration of models such as CRAFT for\ntext,extraction and YoloV5 for object detection, coupled with LLMs,like\nMistral-7B for textual evaluation, our methodology facilitates,comprehensive\nassessment of multimodal answer sheets. This,paper provides a detailed account\nof our methodology, challenges,encountered, results, and implications,\nemphasizing the potential,of AI-driven approaches in revolutionizing grading\npractices in,STEM education.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a significant threat to human health. Contrastive learning\nhas emerged as an effective method to extract critical lesion features from\nmammograms, thereby offering a potent tool for breast cancer screening and\nanalysis. A crucial aspect of contrastive learning involves negative sampling,\nwhere the selection of appropriate hard negative samples is essential for\ndriving representations to retain detailed information about lesions. In\ncontrastive learning, it is often assumed that features can sufficiently\ncapture semantic content, and that each minibatch inherently includes ideal\nhard negative samples. However, the characteristics of breast lumps challenge\nthese assumptions. In response, we introduce ManiNeg, a novel approach that\nleverages manifestations as proxies to mine hard negative samples.\nManifestations, which refer to the observable symptoms or signs of a disease,\nprovide a knowledge-driven and robust basis for choosing hard negative samples.\nThis approach benefits from its invariance to model optimization, facilitating\nefficient sampling. To support ManiNeg and future research endeavors, we\ndeveloped the MVKL dataset, which includes multi-view mammograms, corresponding\nreports, meticulously annotated manifestations, and pathologically confirmed\nbenign-malignant outcomes. We evaluate ManiNeg on the benign and malignant\nclassification task.

Despite\nsignificant strides in applying deep learning to interpret mammography images,\nefforts that focus predominantly on visual features often struggle with\ngeneralization across datasets. We hypothesize that integrating additional\nmodalities in the radiology practice, notably the linguistic features of\nreports and manifestation features embodying radiological insights, offers a\nmore powerful, interpretable and generalizable representation. In this paper,\nwe announce MVKL, the first multimodal mammography dataset encompassing\nmulti-view images, detailed manifestations and reports. Based on this dataset,\nwe focus on the challanging task of unsupervised pretraining and propose ViKL,\na innovative framework that synergizes Visual, Knowledge, and Linguistic\nfeatures. This framework relies solely on pairing information without the\nnecessity for pathology labels, which are often challanging to acquire. ViKL\nemploys a triple contrastive learning approach to merge linguistic and\nknowledge-based insights with visual data, enabling both inter-modality and\nintra-modality feature enhancement. Our research yields significant findings:\n1) Integrating reports and manifestations with unsupervised visual pretraining,\nViKL substantially enhances the pathological classification and fosters\nmultimodal interactions. 2) Manifestations can introduce a novel hard negative\nsample selection mechanism. 3) The multimodal features demonstrate\ntransferability across different datasets. 4) The multimodal pretraining\napproach curbs miscalibrations and crafts a high-quality representation space.\nThe MVKL dataset and ViKL code are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/wxwxwwxxx/ViKL to support a broad spectrum of future\nresearch.",

Our method utilizes a random model to represent the\nobjective function, which is constructed from stochastic observations of the\nobjective and is designed to satisfy proper adaptive accuracy conditions with a\nhigh but fixed probability. To converge to first-order stationary points, our\nmethod computes a gradient step in each iteration defined by minimizing a\nquadratic approximation of the objective subject to a (relaxed) linear\napproximation of the problem constraints and a trust-region constraint. To\nconverge to second-order stationary points, our method additionally computes an\neigen step to explore the negative curvature of the reduced Hessian matrix, as\nwell as a second-order correction step to address the potential Maratos effect,\nwhich arises due to the nonlinearity of the problem constraints. Such an effect\nmay impede the method from moving away from saddle points. Both gradient and\neigen step computations leverage a novel parameter-free decomposition of the\nstep and the trust-region radius, accounting for the proportions among the\nfeasibility residual, optimality residual, and negative curvature. We establish\nglobal almost sure first- and second-order convergence guarantees for our\nmethod, and present computational results on CUTEst problems, regression\nproblems, and saddle-point problems to demonstrate its superiority over\nexisting line-search-based stochastic methods.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition has gained significant\ntraction due to its accuracy and objectivity. However, the non-stationary\nnature of EEG signals leads to distribution drift over time, causing severe\nperformance degradation when the model is reused. While numerous domain\nadaptation (DA) approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this\nissue, their reliance on large amounts of target data for calibration restricts\nthem to offline scenarios, rendering them unsuitable for real-time\napplications. To address this challenge, this paper proposes Evolvable Fast\nAdaptation (EvoFA), an online adaptive framework tailored for EEG data. EvoFA\norganically integrates the rapid adaptation of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and the\ndistribution matching of Domain Adaptation (DA) through a two-stage\ngeneralization process. During the training phase, a robust base meta-learning\nmodel is constructed for strong generalization. In the testing phase, a\ndesigned evolvable meta-adaptation module iteratively aligns the marginal\ndistribution of target (testing) data with the evolving source (training) data\nwithin a model-agnostic meta-learning framework, enabling the model to learn\nthe evolving trends of testing data relative to training data and improving\nonline testing performance. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoFA\nachieves significant improvements compared to the basic FSL method and previous\nonline methods. The introduction of EvoFA paves the way for broader adoption of\nEEG-based emotion recognition in real-world applications. Our code will be\nreleased upon publication.",

    "abstract": "While RGBD-based methods for category-level object pose estimation hold\npromise, their reliance on depth data limits their applicability in diverse\nscenarios. In response, recent efforts have turned to RGB-based methods;\nhowever, they face significant challenges stemming from the absence of depth\ninformation. On one hand, the lack of depth exacerbates the difficulty in\nhandling intra-class shape variation, resulting in increased uncertainty in\nshape predictions. On the other hand, RGB-only inputs introduce inherent scale\nambiguity, rendering the estimation of object size and translation an ill-posed\nproblem. To tackle these challenges, we propose LaPose, a novel framework that\nmodels the object shape as the Laplacian mixture model for Pose estimation. By\nrepresenting each point as a probabilistic distribution, we explicitly quantify\nthe shape uncertainty. LaPose leverages both a generalized 3D information\nstream and a specialized feature stream to independently predict the Laplacian\ndistribution for each point, capturing different aspects of object geometry.\nThese two distributions are then integrated as a Laplacian mixture model to\nestablish the 2D-3D correspondences, which are utilized to solve the pose via\nthe PnP module. In order to mitigate scale ambiguity, we introduce a\nscale-agnostic representation for object size and translation, enhancing\ntraining efficiency and overall robustness. Extensive experiments on the NOCS\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of LaPose, yielding state-of-the-art\nperformance in RGB-based category-level object pose estimation.

Approach: Our\nmodel provides for selection of preferred ID parameters (I_p) for RTP, that\nassociate closest to biological effects. Cluster dose is proposed to bridge the\nlarge gap between nanoscopic I_p and macroscopic RTP. Selection of I_p is\ndemonstrated using published cell survival measurements for protons through\nargon, comparing results for nineteen Ip: N_k; k = 2,3,...,10, the number of\nionizations in clusters of k or more per particle, and F_k; k = 1,2,...,10, the\nnumber of clusters of k or more per particle. We then describe application of\nthe model to ID-based RTP and propose a path to clinical translation. Main\nresults: The preferred I_p were N_4 and F_5 for aerobic cells, N_5 and F_7 for\nhypoxic cells. Signifcant differences were found in cell survival for beams\nhaving the same LET or the preferred N_k. Conversely, there was no signi?cant\ndifference for F_5 for aerobic cells and F_7 for hypoxic cells, regardless of\nion beam atomic number or energy. Further, cells irradiated with the same\ncluster dose for these I_p had the same cell survival. Based on these\npreliminary results and other compelling results in nanodosimetry, it is\nreasonable to assert that I_p exist that are more closely associated with\nbiological effects than current LET-based approaches and microdosimetric\nRBE-based models used in particle RTP. However, more biological variables such\nas cell line and cycle phase, as well as ion beam pulse structure and rate\nstill need investigation. Signifcance: Our model provides a practical means to\nselect preferred I_p from radiobiological data, and to convert I_p to the\nmacroscopic cluster dose for particle RTP.",

However, from a theoretical viewpoint, it remains uncertain whether\nthis assumption is universally valid. In this Letter, we critically examine\nthis longstanding assumption through the lens of the eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis (ETH), a cornerstone of the modern quantum thermalization theory.\nUtilizing the time-dependent configuration interaction shell model, it is found\nthat, in certain cases, the long-time averages of nucleon occupation numbers\ncan exhibit significant deviations from the microcanonical ensemble averages,\nin contrast to the conventional expectation. We attribute this discrepancy\nprimarily to the violation of the ETH in the presence of isospin symmetry and\ndiscover that incorporating a substantial isospin-breaking term into the\nshell-model Hamiltonian can effectively restore the nucleon thermalization.",

    "abstract": "The challenge of data scarcity hinders the application of deep learning in\nindustrial surface defect classification (SDC), as it's difficult to collect\nand centralize sufficient training data from various entities in Industrial\nInternet of Things (IIoT) due to privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL)\nprovides a solution by enabling collaborative global model training across\nclients while maintaining privacy. However, performance may suffer due to data\nheterogeneity-discrepancies in data distributions among clients. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel personalized FL (PFL) approach, named Adversarial Federated\nConsensus Learning (AFedCL), for the challenge of data heterogeneity across\ndifferent clients in SDC. First, we develop a dynamic consensus construction\nstrategy to mitigate the performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity.\nThrough adversarial training, local models from different clients utilize the\nglobal model as a bridge to achieve distribution alignment, alleviating the\nproblem of global knowledge forgetting. Complementing this strategy, we propose\na consensus-aware aggregation mechanism. It assigns aggregation weights to\ndifferent clients based on their efficacy in global knowledge learning, thereby\nenhancing the global model's generalization capabilities. Finally, we design an\nadaptive feature fusion module to further enhance global knowledge utilization\nefficiency. Personalized fusion weights are gradually adjusted for each client\nto optimally balance global and local features. Compared with state-of-the-art\nFL methods like FedALA, the proposed AFedCL method achieves an accuracy\nincrease of up to 5.67% on three SDC datasets.",

For the\nclosed-loop stage, a closed-loop active learning strategy is designed to select\nand learn from informative closed-loop data. The efficiency of the proposed\nclosed-loop active learning strategy is proved by showing that the unselected\ndata cannot benefit the learning performance. Furthermore, an adaptive\npredictive controller is designed in accordance with the proposed data\nacquisition approach. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the\ncontroller are proved by analyzing the effect of the closed-loop active\nlearning strategy.

We\nhighlight the different classes of agent-state based policies and the various\napproaches that have been proposed in the literature to find good policies\nwithin each class. These include the designer's approach to find optimal\nnon-stationary agent-state based policies, policy search approaches to find a\nlocally optimal stationary agent-state based policies, and the approximate\ninformation state to find approximately optimal stationary agent-state based\npolicies. We then present how ideas from the approximate information state\napproach have been used to improve Q-learning and actor-critic algorithms for\nlearning in POMDPs.",

Various feature attribution methods, especially the\nperturbation-based methods, have been proposed to indicate how much each\nnode/edge contributes to the model predictions. However, these methods fail to\ngenerate connected explanatory subgraphs that consider the causal interaction\nbetween edges within different coalition scales, which will result in\nunfaithful explanations. In our study, we propose GISExplainer, a novel\ngame-theoretic interaction based explanation method that uncovers what the\nunderlying GNNs have learned for node classification by discovering\nhuman-interpretable causal explanatory subgraphs. First, GISExplainer defines a\ncausal attribution mechanism that considers the game-theoretic interaction of\nmulti-granularity coalitions in candidate explanatory subgraph to quantify the\ncausal effect of an edge on the prediction. Second, GISExplainer assumes that\nthe coalitions with negative effects on the predictions are also significant\nfor model interpretation, and the contribution of the computation graph stems\nfrom the combined influence of both positive and negative interactions within\nthe coalitions. Then, GISExplainer regards the explanation task as a sequential\ndecision process, in which a salient edges is successively selected and\nconnected to the previously selected subgraph based on its causal effect to\nform an explanatory subgraph, ultimately striving for better explanations.\nAdditionally, an efficiency optimization scheme is proposed for the causal\nattribution mechanism through coalition sampling.

Despite the progress in NeRFs\nand Gaussian Splats, their large model size and specialized renderers make it\nchallenging to distribute free-viewpoint 3D content as easily as images. To\naddress this, we have designed a novel 3D representation that encodes the\nplenoptic function into sinusoidal function indexed dense volumes. This\napproach facilitates feature sharing across different locations, improving\ncompactness over traditional spatial voxels. The memory footprint of the dense\n3D feature grid can be further reduced using spatial decomposition techniques.\nThis design combines the strengths of spatial hashing functions and voxel\ndecomposition, resulting in a model size as small as 150 KB for each 3D scene.\nMoreover, PPNG features a lightweight rendering pipeline with only 300 lines of\ncode that decodes its representation into standard GL textures and fragment\nshaders. This enables real-time rendering using the traditional GL pipeline,\nensuring universal compatibility and efficiency across various platforms\nwithout additional dependencies.",

This problem can be\nviewed as a repeated game between a group of online players and an adversary.\nAt each round, each player selects a decision from the constraint set, and then\nthe adversary assigns an arbitrary, possibly nonconvex, loss function to this\nplayer. Only the loss value at the current round, rather than the entire loss\nfunction or any other information (e.g. gradient), is privately revealed to the\nplayer. Players aim to minimize a sequence of global loss functions, which are\nthe sum of local losses. We observe that traditional multi-point bandit\nalgorithms are unsuitable for online optimization, where the data for the loss\nfunction are not all a priori, while the one-point bandit algorithms suffer\nfrom poor regret guarantees. To address these issues, we propose a novel\none-point residual feedback distributed online algorithm. This algorithm\nestimates the gradient using residuals from two points, effectively reducing\nthe regret bound while maintaining $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ sampling complexity per\niteration. We employ a rigorous metric, dynamic regret, to evaluate the\nalgorithm's performance. By appropriately selecting the step size and smoothing\nparameters, we demonstrate that the expected dynamic regret of our algorithm is\ncomparable to existing algorithms that use two-point feedback, provided the\ndeviation in the objective function sequence and the path length of the\nminimization grows sublinearly.

Enabled by NEMAD, machine learning models were developed\nto classify materials and predict transition temperatures. Our classification\nmodel achieved an accuracy of 90% in categorizing materials as ferromagnetic\n(FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and non-magnetic (NM). The regression models\npredict Curie (N\\'eel) temperature with a coefficient of determination (R2) of\n0.86 (0.85) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 62K (32K). These models\nidentified 62 (19) FM (AFM) candidates with a predicted Curie (N\\'eel)\ntemperature above 500K (100K) from the Materials Project. This work shows the\nfeasibility of combining LLMs for automated data extraction and machine\nlearning models in accelerating the discovery of magnetic materials.",

Our objective is to understand the discourse around discussions\non such an attack, how it is received by the community, and whether developers\nrespond to the attack in a timely manner. We study two notable protestware\ncases i.e., colors.js and es5-ext. Results indicate that protestware\ndiscussions are spread more quickly on the GitHub platform, while security\nvulnerabilities are faster on social media. By establishing a taxonomy of\nprotestware discussions, we identify posts that express stances and provide\ntechnical mitigation instructions. We applied a thematic analysis to 684\nprotestware related posts to identify five major themes during the discussions:\ni. disseminate and response, ii. stance, iii. reputation, iv. communicative\nstyles, v. rights and ethics. This work sheds light on the nuanced landscape of\nprotestware discussions, offering insights for both researchers and developers\ninto maintaining a healthy balance between the political or social actions of\ndevelopers and the collective well-being of the open-source community.",

SNNs are developing\nrapidly and can compete with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in many fields.\nTo ensure that the widespread use of SNNs does not cause serious security\nincidents, much research has been conducted to explore the robustness of SNNs\nunder adversarial sample attacks. However, many other unassessed security\nthreats exist, such as highly stealthy backdoor attacks. Therefore, to fill the\nresearch gap in this and further explore the security vulnerabilities of SNNs,\nthis paper explores the robustness performance of SNNs trained by supervised\nlearning rules under backdoor attacks. Specifically, the work herein includes:\ni) We propose a generic backdoor attack framework that can be launched against\nthe training process of existing supervised learning rules and covers all\nlearnable dataset types of SNNs. ii) We analyze the robustness differences\nbetween different learning rules and between SNN and ANN, which suggests that\nSNN no longer has inherent robustness under backdoor attacks. iii) We reveal\nthe vulnerability of conversion-dependent learning rules caused by backdoor\nmigration and further analyze the migration ability during the conversion\nprocess, finding that the backdoor migration rate can even exceed 99%. iv)\nFinally, we discuss potential countermeasures against this kind of backdoor\nattack and its technical challenges and point out several promising research\ndirections.",

    "abstract": "Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish\nlong-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract\ninstructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face\nlogical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided\nwith highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant\nexamples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a\nnovel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can\ncomplete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by\nlearning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large\nvision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These\nfunctions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also\nequipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot\nConfiguration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we\npropose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When\nconstructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships,\nenabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel\nhallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon\ntasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even\non unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

To address these issues, we\nintroduce Cambricon-LLM, a chiplet-based hybrid architecture with NPU and a\ndedicated NAND flash chip to enable efficient on-device inference of 70B LLMs.\nSuch a hybrid architecture utilizes both the high computing capability of NPU\nand the data capacity of the NAND flash chip, with the proposed hardware-tiling\nstrategy that minimizes the data movement overhead between NPU and NAND flash\nchip.

Simultaneously, the NPU collaborates with the flash chip for\nmatrix operations and handles special function computations beyond the flash's\non-die processing capabilities. Overall, Cambricon-LLM enables the on-device\ninference of 70B LLMs at a speed of 3.44 token/s, and 7B LLMs at a speed of\n36.34 token/s, which is over 22X to 45X faster than existing flash-offloading\ntechnologies, showing the potentiality of deploying powerful LLMs in edge\ndevices.",

Recent studies use reinforcement learning to learn\npolicies that automate different surgical tasks.

Inspired by how human surgeons build their expertise, we train surgical\nautomation policies through Surgical Incremental Reinforcement Learning\n(SurgIRL). SurgIRL aims to (1) acquire new skills by referring to external\npolicies (knowledge) and (2) accumulate and reuse these skills to solve\nmultiple unseen tasks incrementally (incremental learning). Our SurgIRL\nframework includes three major components. We first define an expandable\nknowledge set containing heterogeneous policies that can be helpful for\nsurgical tasks. Then, we propose Knowledge Inclusive Attention Network with\nmAximum Coverage Exploration (KIAN-ACE), which improves learning efficiency by\nmaximizing the coverage of the knowledge set during the exploration process.\nFinally, we develop incremental learning pipelines based on KIAN-ACE to\naccumulate and reuse learned knowledge and solve multiple surgical tasks\nsequentially.

Our approach is\ncompletely unsupervised and does not require any access to additional\nannotations like keypoints or pose. Our approach builds on a pretrained\ntext-to-image latent diffusion model and learns the characteristics of the\nsource and the driving image by finetuning the diffusion model for a small\nnumber of iterations. At inference time, ImPoster performs step-wise text\nprompting i.e. it denoises by first moving in the direction of the image\nmanifold corresponding to the driving image followed by the direction of the\nimage manifold corresponding to the text description of the desired target\nimage. We propose a novel diffusion guidance formulation, image frequency\nguidance, to steer the generation towards the manifold of the source subject\nand the driving action at every step of the inference denoising. Our frequency\nguidance formulations are derived from the frequency domain properties of\nimages. We extensively evaluate ImPoster on a diverse set of source-driving\nimage pairs to demonstrate improvements over baselines.

This can\nresult in policies that are misaligned with community needs or perceived as\nillegitimate. How can we support more collaborative, participatory approaches\nto policy design? In this paper, we present PolicyCraft, a system that\nstructures collaborative policy design through case-grounded deliberation.\nBuilding on past research that highlights the value of concrete cases in\nestablishing common ground, PolicyCraft supports users in collaboratively\nproposing, critiquing, and revising policies through discussion and voting on\ncases. A field study across two university courses showed that students using\nPolicyCraft reached greater consensus and developed better-supported course\npolicies, compared with those using a baseline system that did not scaffold\ntheir use of concrete cases.

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe in 1998,\nmodified gravity (MG) theories have attracted considerable attention as\nalternatives to dark energy (DE). While distinguishing the effects of MG from\nthose of DE using cosmic background expansion alone is difficult, the\nlarge-scale structure is expected to differ significantly. Among the plethora\nof MG models, we are particularly interested in those that introduce a scale\ndependence in the growth of perturbations; specifically, theories that\nintroduce fifth forces mediated by scalar fields with a finite range accessible\nto cosmological probes. This is the case with $f(R)$ gravity, which is widely\nregarded as the most studied model in cosmology. In this work, we utilize, for\nthe first time, the full-shape power spectrum of galaxies to constrain\nscale-dependent modified gravity theories. By using BOSS DR12 dataset, along\nwith a big bang nucleosynthesis prior on $ \\omega_b $ and a Planck 2018 prior\non $ n_s $, we obtain an upper bound of $ |f_{R0}| < 5.89 \\times 10^{-6} $ at\n68% confidence level (c.l.) and $ < 1.53 \\times 10^{-5} $ at 95% c.l. for the\nHu-Sawicki ($ n=1 $) model.

The plaquette interaction appears naturally as a\nring-exchange term in the low-energy description of exciton Bose liquids, cold\natomic gases, and quantum dimer models. Using first-principle Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we study the phase diagram and the vortex dynamics in the\nXY-plaquette model on a square lattice in two spatial dimensions. In its\nminimal formulation, the model contains a ring-exchange plaquette term in two\nspatial dimensions and a standard XY-link term in the (imaginary) time\ndirection. We show that the phase diagram of the minimal XY-plaquette model\npossesses two phases: (i) a disordered vortex-dominated phase in which a single\npercolating vortex trajectory occupies the whole 3d spacetime; (ii) a partially\ndisordered phase in which the vortices become partially immobile, with their\nworldlines strictly confined to one or several infinite two-dimensional planes.\nThe spatial positions and spatial orientations (along $x$ or $y$ axis) of these\nvortex domain walls appear to be spontaneous. Individual vortices form a\ndisordered system within each vortex domain wall, so the fractal spacetime\ndimension of vortex trajectories approaches $D_f = 2$. We argue that the\nappearance of the vortex walls could be interpreted as a consequence of the\nspontaneous breaking of a global internal symmetry in the compact XY-plaquette\nmodel.",

Obtaining supervised data from humans\nis costly, and automatic data collection through exploration or reinforcement\nlearning relies on complex environmental and content setup, resulting in\ndatasets that lack comprehensive coverage of various scenarios. On the other\nhand, there is abundant knowledge that may indirectly assist task completion,\nsuch as online tutorials that were created for human consumption.

In this approach, each client trains its local model and\nonly sends the backbone weights to the server. These weights are then\naggregated to create a global backbone, which is returned to each client for\nupdating. However, the client's local backbone lacks personalization because of\nthe common representation. To solve this problem, each client further performs\nbackbone self-distillation by using the global backbone as a teacher and\ntransferring knowledge to update the local backbone. This process involves\nlearning two components: the shared backbone for common representation and the\nprivate head for local personalization, which enables effective global\nknowledge transfer.

    "abstract": "While disproven by S. Carnot 200 years ago, corpuscularianism (the philosophy\nthat the states of individual molecules determine the state of a system of\nthose molecules) is still widely used to describe biological function. Nowhere\nis this more evident than in proposed power stroke mechanisms of muscle\ncontraction. Muscle's power stroke occurs when muscle shortens against a\nmechanical load, performing work over time. While many mechanisms have been\nproposed, the actual power stroke mechanism of muscle contraction remains\ncontested. Here I consider four distinctly different proposed mechanisms and\nassess their history and scientific merit. I show that over the past 65 years,\nmolecular biologists have ignored Carnot for their corpuscular mechanic\nconvictions in proposing a series of molecular power stroke mechanisms that\nregress from 19th century thermodynamics to an obsolete 17th century philosophy\nto a structural determinism invoked today that predates science. An isothermal\npower stroke in a thermodynamic muscle work loop, analogous to the power stoke\nin a Carnot cycle, rectifies this historic scientific blunder, defining the\nconfluence of the bottom-up mechanics and chemistry of myosin motors and the\ntop-down mechanics and chemistry of muscle. Specifically, created by thermal\nscaling, the increase in entropy with muscle's thermodynamic power stroke\nchemically exists within muscle and defines the irreversible energetics and\nkinetics of muscle contraction (the arrow of time).",

Traditional approaches often decompose decision-making into\nhierarchical modules for prediction and planning.

Additionally,\ntheir solutions could be suboptimal due to the use of inaccurate mathematical\nmodel assumptions and simplifications aimed at achieving computational\nefficiency. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces the NavRL\nframework, a deep reinforcement learning-based navigation method built on the\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. NavRL utilizes our carefully\ndesigned state and action representations, allowing the learned policy to make\nsafe decisions in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles, with\nzero-shot transfer from simulation to real-world flight. Furthermore, the\nproposed method adopts a simple but effective safety shield for the trained\npolicy, inspired by the concept of velocity obstacles, to mitigate potential\nfailures associated with the black-box nature of neural networks. To accelerate\nthe convergence, we implement the training pipeline using NVIDIA Isaac Sim,\nenabling parallel training with thousands of quadcopters.

A fundamental aspect that governs\noptical and electronic behaviors within these materials is the intricate\ncoupling between charges and their surrounding lattice. Unravelling the role of\ncharge-lattice interactions on the optoelectronic properties in lead halide\nperovskites is necessary to understand their photophysics. Unlike traditional\nsemiconductors where a harmonic approximation often suffices to capture lattice\nfluctuations, lead halide perovskites have a significant anharmonicity\nattributed from the rocking and tilting motions of inorganic framework. Thus,\nwhile there is broad consensus on the importance of the structural deformations\nand polar fluctuations on the behavior of charge carriers and quasiparticles,\nthe strongly anharmonic nature of these fluctuations and their strong\ninteractions render theoretical descriptions of lead halides perovskites\nchallenging. In this Account, we review our recent efforts to understand how\nthe soft, polar lattice of this class of materials alter their quasiparticle\nbinding energies and fine structure, charge mobilities, and lifetimes of\nphonons and excess charges. Throughout, these are aimed at characterizing the\ninterplay between lattice fluctuations and optoelectronic properties of lead\nhalide perovskites and are reviewed in the context of the effective models we\nhave built, and the novel theoretical methods we have developed to understand\nbulk crystalline materials, as well as nanostructures, and lower dimensionality\nlattices.

Second, a tensor factorization method is used to impute\nmissing values in sparse tensors of collected learner data, thereby grounding\nthe imputation on knowledge tracing tasks that predict missing performance\nvalues based on real observations. Third, a module for generating patterns of\nlearning is used. This study contrasts two forms of generative Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and\nGenerate Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) to generate data associated with\ndifferent clusters of learner data. We tested this approach on an adult\nliteracy dataset from AutoTutor lessons developed for Adult Reading\nComprehension (ARC). We found that: (1) tensor factorization improved the\nperformance in tracing and predicting knowledge mastery compared with other\nknowledge tracing techniques without data augmentation, showing higher relative\nfidelity for this imputation method, and (2) the GAN-based simulation showed\ngreater overall stability and less statistical bias based on a divergence\nevaluation with varying simulation sample sizes compared to GPT.",

    "abstract": "K$_2$YF$_5$ crystals doped with lanthanide ions have a variety of possible\noptical applications. Owing to the low symmetry of the system, the crystal\nstructure cannot be unambiguously determined by x-ray diffraction. However,\nelectron-paramagnetic resonance studies have demonstrated that lanthanide ions\nsubstitute for yttrium in sites of C$_{\\rm s}$ local symmetry. In this work, we\nuse high-resolution absorption and laser spectroscopy to determine electronic\nenergy levels for Er$^{3+}$ ions in K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. A total of 39\ncrystal-field energy levels, distributed among 7 multiplets of the Er$^{3+}$\nion, have been assigned. This optical data is used for crystal-field modelling\nof the electronic structure of Er$^{3+}$ in K$_2$YF$_5$. Our model is fitted\nnot only to the electronic energy levels, but also to the ground-state\ng-tensor. This magnetic-splitting data defines the axis system of the\ncalculation, avoiding ambiguities associated with low-symmetry crystal-field\nfits.",

    "abstract": "Human-involved interactive environments pose significant challenges for\nautonomous vehicle decision-making processes due to the complexity and\nuncertainty of human behavior. It is crucial to develop an explainable and\ntrustworthy decision-making system for autonomous vehicles interacting with\npedestrians. Previous studies often used traditional game theory to describe\ninteractions for its interpretability. However, it assumes complete human\nrationality and unlimited reasoning abilities, which is unrealistic. To solve\nthis limitation and improve model accuracy, this paper proposes a novel\nframework that integrates the partially observable markov decision process with\nbehavioral game theory to dynamically model AV-pedestrian interactions at the\nunsignalized intersection. Both the AV and the pedestrian are modeled as\ndynamic-belief-induced quantal cognitive hierarchy (DB-QCH) models, considering\nhuman reasoning limitations and bounded rationality in the decision-making\nprocess. In addition, a dynamic belief updating mechanism allows the AV to\nupdate its understanding of the opponent's rationality degree in real-time\nbased on observed behaviors and adapt its strategies accordingly. The analysis\nresults indicate that our models effectively simulate vehicle-pedestrian\ninteractions and our proposed AV decision-making approach performs well in\nsafety, efficiency, and smoothness. It closely resembles real-world driving\nbehavior and even achieves more comfortable driving navigation compared to our\nprevious virtual reality experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Topic modeling is a widely used technique for uncovering thematic structures\nfrom large text corpora. However, most topic modeling approaches e.g. Latent\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA) struggle to capture nuanced semantics and contextual\nunderstanding required to accurately model complex narratives. Recent\nadvancements in this area include methods like BERTopic, which have\ndemonstrated significantly improved topic coherence and thus established a new\nstandard for benchmarking. In this paper, we present a novel approach, the\nQualitative Insights Tool (QualIT) that integrates large language models (LLMs)\nwith existing clustering-based topic modeling approaches. Our method leverages\nthe deep contextual understanding and powerful language generation capabilities\nof LLMs to enrich the topic modeling process using clustering. We evaluate our\napproach on a large corpus of news articles and demonstrate substantial\nimprovements in topic coherence and topic diversity compared to baseline topic\nmodeling techniques. On the 20 ground-truth topics, our method shows 70% topic\ncoherence (vs 65% & 57% benchmarks) and 95.5% topic diversity (vs 85% & 72%\nbenchmarks). Our findings suggest that the integration of LLMs can unlock new\nopportunities for topic modeling of dynamic and complex text data, as is common\nin talent management research contexts.",
