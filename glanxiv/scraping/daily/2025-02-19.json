    "abstract": "Graph neural networks have been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for\neffectively learning graph-structured data on the web and mining content from\nit.Current leading graph models require a large number of labeled samples for\ntraining, which unavoidably leads to overfitting in few-shot scenarios. Recent\nresearch has sought to alleviate this issue by simultaneously leveraging graph\nlearning and meta-learning paradigms. However, these graph meta-learning models\nassume the availability of numerous meta-training tasks to learn transferable\nmeta-knowledge. Such assumption may not be feasible in the real world due to\nthe difficulty of constructing tasks and the substantial costs involved.\nTherefore, we propose a SiMple yet effectIve approach for graph few-shot\nLearning with fEwer tasks, named SMILE. We introduce a dual-level mixup\nstrategy, encompassing both within-task and across-task mixup, to\nsimultaneously enrich the available nodes and tasks in meta-learning. Moreover,\nwe explicitly leverage the prior information provided by the node degrees in\nthe graph to encode expressive node representations. Theoretically, we\ndemonstrate that SMILE can enhance the model generalization ability.\nEmpirically, SMILE consistently outperforms other competitive models by a large\nmargin across all evaluated datasets with in-domain and cross-domain settings.\nOur anonymous code can be found here.",

This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs)\ncan emulate the breadth of human reasoning by predicting both intuitive, fast\nSystem 1 and deliberate, slow System 2 processes. We investigate the potential\nof AI to mimic diverse reasoning behaviors across a human population,\naddressing what we call the \"full reasoning spectrum problem\". We designed\nreasoning tasks using a novel generalization of the Natural Language Inference\n(NLI) format to evaluate LLMs' ability to replicate human reasoning. The\nquestions were crafted to elicit both System 1 and System 2 responses. Human\nresponses were collected through crowd-sourcing and the entire distribution was\nmodeled, rather than just the majority of the answers. We used\npersonality-based prompting inspired by the Big Five personality model to\nelicit AI responses reflecting specific personality traits, capturing the\ndiversity of human reasoning, and exploring how personality traits influence\nLLM outputs. Combined with genetic algorithms to optimize the weighting of\nthese prompts, this method was tested alongside traditional machine learning\nmodels. The results show that LLMs can mimic human response distributions, with\nopen-source models like Llama and Mistral outperforming proprietary GPT models.\nPersonality-based prompting, especially when optimized with genetic algorithms,\nsignificantly enhanced LLMs' ability to predict human response distributions,\nsuggesting that capturing suboptimal, naturalistic reasoning may require\nmodeling techniques incorporating diverse reasoning styles and psychological\nprofiles. The study concludes that personality-based prompting combined with\ngenetic algorithms is promising for enhancing AI's 'human-ness' in reasoning.",

While parameter-efficient techniques like\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Matrix of Rank Adaptation (MoRA) address\nadaptation challenges, their uniform parameter distribution overlooks the\nfeature hierarchy in deep networks, where earlier layers, that learn general\nfeatures, require more parameters than later ones.

Briefly,\na differential linear category is a symmetric monoidal category that is\nenriched over commutative monoids (called additive enrichment) and has a\nmonoidal coalgebra modality that is equipped with a codereliction. The\ncodereliction is what captures the ability of differentiating non-linear proofs\nvia linearization in Differential Linear Logic. The additive enrichment plays\nan important role since it allows one to express the famous Leibniz rule.\nHowever, the axioms of a codereliction can be expressed without any sums or\nzeros. Therefore, it is natural to ask if one can consider a possible\nnon-additive enriched version of differential linear categories. In this paper,\nwe show that even if a codereliction can be technically defined in an\nnon-additive setting, it nevertheless induces an additive enrichment via\nbialgebra convolution. Thus we obtain a novel characterization of a\ndifferential linear category as a symmetric monoidal category with a monoidal\nbialgebra modality equipped with a codereliction. Moreover, we also show that\ncoderelictions are, in fact, unique. We also introduce monoidal Hopf coalgebra\nmodalities and discuss how antipodes relate to enrichment over Abelian groups.",

Compared to human-engineered features, these\nembeddings provide automatic and effective representations for classification\nmodel training. However, they also introduce a challenge: we lose the ability\nto manually remove unintended features, such as sensitive or task-irrelevant\nfeatures, to guarantee regulatory compliance or improve the generalizability of\nclassification models. This limitation arises because LLM embeddings are opaque\nand difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to\nidentify and regularize unintended features in the LLM latent space.\nSpecifically, we first pre-train a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to extract\ninterpretable features from LLM latent spaces. To ensure the SAE can capture\ntask-specific features, we further fine-tune it on task-specific datasets. In\ntraining the classification model, we propose a simple and effective\nregularizer, by minimizing the similarity between the classifier weights and\nthe identified unintended feature, to remove the impact of these unintended\nfeatures on classification. We evaluate the proposed framework on three\nreal-world tasks, including toxic chat detection, reward modeling, and disease\ndiagnosis. Results show that the proposed self-regularization framework can\nimprove the classifier's generalizability by regularizing those features that\nare not semantically correlated to the task.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also\nknown as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning\n(offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or\n$Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this\npaper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these\nproblems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards.\nThe novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization\n(ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state\ntransition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our\nmethod is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural\nnetworks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to\nhigh-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying\nour approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL)\ncondition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient\nto ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nbenchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.",

Although neural reconstruction approaches based on Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) have shown remarkable capabilities, their processing costs remain\nsubstantial. Recently, the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) largely\nimproves the training efficiency and facilitates to generate realistic\nrendering in real-time. However, due to the limited ability of Spherical\nHarmonics (SH) to represent high-frequency information, 3D-GS falls short in\nreconstructing glossy objects. Researchers have turned to enhance the specular\nexpressiveness of 3D-GS through inverse rendering. Yet these methods often\nstruggle to maintain the training and rendering efficiency, undermining the\nbenefits of Gaussian Splatting techniques. In this paper, we introduce\nGlossGau, an efficient inverse rendering framework that reconstructs scenes\nwith glossy surfaces while maintaining training and rendering speeds comparable\nto vanilla 3D-GS. Specifically, we explicitly model the surface normals,\nBidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters, as well as\nincident lights and use Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) to approximate the\nper-Gaussian Normal Distribution Function under the microfacet model. We\nutilize 2D Gaussian Splatting (2D-GS) as foundational primitives and apply\nregularization to significantly alleviate the normal estimation challenge\nencountered in related works. Experiments demonstrate that GlossGau achieves\ncompetitive or superior reconstruction on datasets with glossy surfaces.\nCompared with previous GS-based works that address the specular surface, our\noptimization time is considerably less.",

Prompt learning, a method of constructing prompts for text\nencoders or image encoders, elicits the potentials of pre-trained models and\nreadily adapts them to new scenarios. Compared to fine-tuning, prompt learning\nenables the model to achieve comparable or better performance using fewer\ntrainable parameters. Besides, prompt learning freezes the pre-trained model\nand avoids the catastrophic forgetting issue in the fine-tuning. Continuous\nprompts inserted into the input of every transformer layer (i.e. deep prompts)\ncan improve the performances of pre-trained models on downstream tasks. For\ni-th transformer layer, the inserted prompts replace previously inserted\nprompts in the $(i-1)$-th layer. Although the self-attention mechanism\ncontextualizes newly inserted prompts for the current layer and embeddings from\nthe previous layer's output, removing all inserted prompts from the previous\nlayer inevitably loses information contained in the continuous prompts. In this\nwork, we propose Modular Prompt Learning (MPL) that is designed to promote the\npreservation of information contained in the inserted prompts.

Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are commonly\nused to navigate these tradeoffs, but selecting the appropriate algorithm to\ntackle these problems is often unclear, particularly when system\nrepresentations vary from fully equation-based (white-box) to entirely\ndata-driven (black-box) models.

In this chapter, we introduce a unifying approach to\ngrey-box MOO by leveraging network representations, which provide a general and\nflexible framework for modeling interconnected systems as a series of function\nnodes that share various inputs and outputs.

The object which is employed to obtain this power series is the time\nordered exponential of the interaction Lagrangian which is the $S$-matrix of\nthe theory and thus itself a power series in the coupling constant of the\ntheory. We analyze a regularization procedure which makes the $S$-matrix\nconvergent to well defined unitary operators. This regularization depends on\ntwo parameters.

Hardware Trojans can give rise to\ndiverse attack vectors such as information leakage (e.g. MOLES Trojan) and\ndenial-of-service (rarely triggered bit flip). Such an attack in critical\nsystems (e.g. healthcare and aviation) can endanger human lives and lead to\ncatastrophic financial loss. Several techniques have been developed to detect\nsuch malicious modifications in digital designs, particularly for designs\nsourced from third-party intellectual property (IP) vendors. However, most\ntechniques have scalability concerns (due to unsound assumptions during\nevaluation) and lead to large number of false positive detections (false\nalerts). Our framework (SALTY) mitigates these concerns through the use of a\nnovel Graph Neural Network architecture (using Jumping-Knowledge mechanism) for\ngenerating initial predictions and an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)\napproach for fine tuning the outcomes (post-processing).

This\npaper reviews scheduling-based and real-time optimization methods for\ncontrolling HPs with a focus on energy flexibility in distribution networks.\nScheduling-based methods fall into two categories: rule-based controllers\n(RBCs), which rely on predefined control rules without explicitly seeking\noptimal solutions, and optimization models, which are designed to determine the\noptimal scheduling of operations. Real-time optimization is achieved through\nmodel predictive control (MPC), which relies on a predictive model to optimize\ndecisions over a time horizon, and reinforcement learning (RL), which takes a\nmodel-free approach by learning optimal strategies through direct interaction\nwith the environment. The paper also examines studies on the impact of HPs on\ndistribution networks, particularly those leveraging energy flexibility\nstrategies. Key takeaways suggest the need to validate control strategies for\nextreme cold-weather regions that require backup heaters, as well as develop\napproaches designed for demand charge schemes that integrate HPs with other\ncontrollable loads. From a grid impact assessment perspective, studies have\nfocused primarily on RBCs for providing energy flexibility through HP\noperation, without addressing more advanced methods such as real-time\noptimization using MPC or RL-based algorithms.

In this paper, we\npropose the Explainable DCOP (X-DCOP) model, which extends a DCOP to include\nits solution and a contrastive query for that solution. We formally define some\nkey properties that contrastive explanations must satisfy for them to be\nconsidered as valid solutions to X-DCOPs as well as theoretical results on the\nexistence of such valid explanations. To solve X-DCOPs, we propose a\ndistributed framework as well as several optimizations and suboptimal variants\nto find valid explanations. We also include a human user study that showed that\nusers, not surprisingly, prefer shorter explanations over longer ones. Our\nempirical evaluations showed that our approach can scale to large problems, and\nthe different variants provide different options for trading off explanation\nlengths for smaller runtimes. Thus, our model and algorithmic contributions\nextend the state of the art by reducing the barrier for users to understand\nDCOP solutions, facilitating their adoption in more real-world applications.",

SMART fits SEDs exclusively\nwith multicomponent radiative transfer models. Mid-infrared spectroscopy can be\nincluded in the fitting at a spectral resolution matched to that of the\nradiative transfer models. We fit the SEDs of the HERUS ULIRGs with four\ndifferent models for the active galactic nucleus (AGN) torus, a starburst and a\nspheroidal galaxy model, to put constraints on the AGN fraction of the galaxies\nand their star formation rate (SFR). Two of the AGN torus models we explored\nare smooth and two are two-phase. We find that, in most cases, a smooth tapered\nAGN torus provides the best fit to the data. We also find that solutions with\nother torus models may predict AGN and total luminosities up to an order of\nmagnitude or more lower, but very rarely higher than the best-fitting model. In\ncontrast, we find that, with minor exceptions, the predicted SFR and stellar\nmass of the ULIRGs are generally robustly estimated irrespective of the assumed\ntorus model. This is despite the fact that one of the AGN torus models we use\nassumes fluffy grains with high emissivity in the far-infrared and\nsubmillimetre, which could potentially reduce the contribution of a starburst\nat those wavelengths and reduce the SFR.",

They tend to over-rely on external knowledge, making them\nvulnerable to misleading and unhelpful contexts. To address this, we propose\nthe concept of context-robust LLMs, which can effectively balance internal\nknowledge with external context, similar to human cognitive processes.\nSpecifically, context-robust LLMs should rely on external context only when\nlacking internal knowledge, identify contradictions between internal and\nexternal knowledge, and disregard unhelpful contexts. To achieve this goal, we\nintroduce Grft, a lightweight and plug-and-play gated representation\nfine-tuning approach. Grft consists of two key components: a gating mechanism\nto detect and filter problematic inputs, and low-rank representation adapters\nto adjust hidden representations. By training a lightweight intervention\nfunction with only 0.0004\\% of model size on fewer than 200 examples, Grft can\neffectively adapt LLMs towards context-robust behaviors.",

    "abstract": "In the current age, users consume multimedia content in very heterogeneous\nscenarios in terms of network, hardware, and display capabilities. A naive\nsolution to this problem is to encode multiple independent streams, each\ncovering a different possible requirement for the clients, with an obvious\nnegative impact in both storage and computational requirements. These drawbacks\ncan be avoided by using codecs that enable scalability, i.e., the ability to\ngenerate a progressive bitstream, containing a base layer followed by multiple\nenhancement layers, that allow decoding the same bitstream serving multiple\nreconstructions and visualization specifications. While scalable coding is a\nwell-known and addressed feature in conventional image and video codecs, this\npaper focuses on a new and very different problem, notably the development of\nscalable coding solutions for deep learning-based Point Cloud (PC) coding. The\npeculiarities of this 3D representation make it hard to implement flexible\nsolutions that do not compromise the other functionalities of the codec. This\npaper proposes a joint quality and resolution scalability scheme, named\nScalable Resolution and Quality Hyperprior (SRQH), that, contrary to previous\nsolutions, can model the relationship between latents obtained with models\ntrained for different RD tradeoffs and/or at different resolutions.\nExperimental results obtained by integrating SRQH in the emerging JPEG Pleno\nlearning-based PC coding standard show that SRQH allows decoding the PC at\ndifferent qualities and resolutions with a single bitstream while incurring\nonly in a limited RD penalty and increment in complexity w.r.t. non-scalable\nJPEG PCC that would require one bitstream per coding configuration.",

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained significant attention in\nrecent years, revolutionizing various applications across industries. Among\nthese, advanced vision models for image super-resolution are in high demand,\nparticularly for deployment on edge devices where real-time processing is\ncrucial. However, deploying such models on edge devices is challenging due to\nlimited computing power and memory. In this paper, we present MambaLiteSR, a\nnovel lightweight image Super-Resolution (SR) model that utilizes the\narchitecture of Vision Mamba. It integrates State Space Blocks and a\nreconstruction module for efficient feature extraction. To optimize efficiency\nwithout affecting performance, MambaLiteSR employs knowledge distillation to\ntransfer key insights from a larger Mamba-based teacher model to a smaller\nstudent model via hyperparameter tuning. Through mathematical analysis of model\nparameters and their impact on PSNR, we identify key factors and adjust them\naccordingly. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that MambaLiteSR outperforms\nstate-of-the-art edge SR methods by reducing power consumption while\nmaintaining competitive PSNR and SSIM scores across benchmark datasets. It also\nreduces power usage during training via low-rank approximation. Moreover,\nMambaLiteSR reduces parameters with minimal performance loss, enabling\nefficient deployment of generative AI models on resource-constrained devices.\nDeployment on the embedded NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano confirms the superior\nbalance of MambaLiteSR size, latency, and efficiency. Experiments show that\nMambaLiteSR achieves performance comparable to both the baseline and other edge\nmodels while using 15% fewer parameters. It also improves power consumption by\nup to 58% compared to state-of-the-art SR edge models, all while maintaining\nlow energy use during training.",

    "abstract": "Breathing pyrochlores are a unique class of materials characterized by a\nthree-dimensional lattice of corner-sharing tetrahedra. However, unlike\nconventional pyrochlores where all tetrahedra are identical in size, the\nbreathing pyrochlore lattice is composed of alternating large and small\ntetrahedra. Experimental realizations of the breathing pyrochlore lattice are\nrare but they do occur in $A$-site ordered spinels, as in the prototype\nmaterials LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and LiInCr$_4$O$_8$. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat Cr cannot be straightforwardly substituted with other magnetic transition\nmetals while retaining the breathing pyrochlore structure. To explain this\nobservation, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations to\ninvestigate the formation and stability of LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and LiInCr$_4$O$_8$,\nfocusing on the energy scales associated with $A$ and $B$-site orderings as\nwell as the magnetic exchange interactions of Cr ions. We identify the strong\noctahedral site preference of Cr$^{3+}$ as a key factor in protecting the\nstructural integrity of the pyrochlore sublattice, which in turn enables the\nbreathing distortion to proceed. We also demonstrate that the charge order\nbetween the $A$ (Li) and $A'$ sites (Ga or In) is maintained at all\ntemperatures up to decomposition. Furthermore, while the magnetic exchange\ninteractions constitute a relatively small energy scale and therefore do not\nplay a fundamental role in the structural stability of LiGaCr$_4$O$_8$ and\nLiInCr$_4$O$_8$, magnetism may play a critical role in setting the magnitude of\nthe tetrahedral distortion. Ultimately, we conclude that the scarcity of\nbreathing pyrochlores is a consequence of the stringent requirement on site\nordering for their formation.",

This paper bridges\nthat gap by systematically examining the challenges and opportunities of\nadapting VLMs for EO regression tasks. The discussion first contrasts the\ndistinctive properties of EO data with conventional computer vision datasets,\nthen identifies four core obstacles in applying VLMs to EO regression: 1) the\nabsence of dedicated benchmarks, 2) the discrete-versus-continuous\nrepresentation mismatch, 3) cumulative error accumulation, and 4) the\nsuboptimal nature of text-centric training objectives for numerical tasks.\nNext, a series of methodological insights and potential subtle pitfalls are\nexplored. Lastly, we offer some promising future directions for designing\nrobust, domain-aware solutions.

However, under partial observations, disturbances cannot be\ndirectly computed. To address this, Simchowitz et.al. 2020 proposed to\nconstruct oblivious signals, which are counterfactual observations with zero\ncontrol, as a substitute. This raises several challenges in our setting: (1)\nhow to construct oblivious signals under simplex constraints, where zero\ncontrol is infeasible; (2) how to design a sufficiently expressive convex\ncontroller parameterization tailored to these signals; and (3) how to enforce\nthe simplex constraint on control when projections may break the convexity of\ncost functions.\n  Our main contribution is a new controller that achieves the optimal\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret with respect to a natural class of mixing linear\ndynamic controllers. To tackle these challenges, we construct signals based on\nhypothetical observations under a constant control adapted to the simplex\ndomain, and introduce a new controller parameterization that approximates\ngeneral control policies linear in non-oblivious observations.

Recent\nwork has shown the data efficiency benefits of learning a single parameterized\nmodel for families of related games. In Bayesian games - a typical model for\nmechanism design - payoffs depend on both the actions and types of the players.\nWe show how to exploit this structure by learning an interim game-family model\nthat conditions on a single player's type.

We validate our\nmethod through a case study of a dynamic sponsored search auction. In our\nexperiments, the interim model more reliably approximates equilibria than the\nex ante model and exhibits effective parameter extrapolation.

It is also well known that a field-dependent\nFayet-Iliopoulos like term is induced at one-loop in string perturbation theory\nin such compactifications and that this leads to a mass for the $U(1)$ gauge\nfield.

We consider such theories further\ncompactified on a circle of radius $R$. There is then an infinite tower of BPS\nstates with winding and momenta on the circle. BPS strings which wind the\ncircle can, at large $R$, be viewed as macroscopic or cosmic strings in four\nspacetime dimensions, or, at generic $R$, as BPS states in three dimensions.

In recent years, the problem has garnered\nsignificant attention from the research community, leading to achievability\nschemes and converse results for many important PIR settings.\n  This paper focuses on the Multi-message Private Information Retrieval (MPIR)\nsetting, where a user aims to retrieve \\(D\\) messages from a database of \\(K\\)\nmessages, with identical copies of the database available on \\(N\\) remote\nservers. The user's goal is to maximize the download rate while keeping the\nidentities of the retrieved messages private. Existing approaches to the MPIR\nproblem primarily focus on either scalar-linear solutions or vector-linear\nsolutions, the latter requiring a high degree of subpacketization. Furthermore,\nprior scalar-linear solutions are restricted to the special case of \\(N =\nD+1\\). This limitation hinders the practical adoption of these schemes, as\nreal-world applications demand simple, easily implementable solutions that\nsupport a broad range of scenarios.\n  In this work, we present a solution for the MPIR problem, which applies to a\nbroader range of system parameters and requires a limited degree of\nsubpacketization. In particular, the proposed scheme applies to all values of\n\\(N=DL+1\\) for any integer \\(L\\geq 1\\), and requires a degree of\nsubpacketization \\(L\\). Our scheme achieves capacity when \\(D\\) divides \\(K\\),\nand in all other cases, its performance matches or comes within a small\nadditive margin of the best-known scheme that requires a high degree of\nsubpacketization.",

To\nsupport our claim, we first perform a broad, thorough, and reproducible\nevaluation of the top-performing models on the most popular benchmark by\ntraining 3,500+ networks over 14 datasets. Then, through a comprehensive\nanalysis, we find that slight changes to experimental setups or current\nevaluation metrics drastically shift the common belief that newly published\nresults are advancing the state of the art. Our findings suggest the need for\nrigorous and standardized evaluation methods that enable more substantiated\nclaims, including reproducible hyperparameter setups and statistical testing.",

However, they often\nstruggle with fine-grained visual reasoning, failing to identify\ndomain-specific objectives and provide justifiable explanations for their\npredictions. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel visual\nrejection sampling framework to improve the cognition and explainability of\nLMMs using self-synthesized data. Specifically, visual fine-tuning requires\nimages, queries, and target answers. Our approach begins by synthesizing\ninterpretable answers that include human-verifiable visual features. These\nfeatures are based on expert-defined concepts, and carefully selected based on\ntheir alignment with the image content. After each round of fine-tuning, we\napply a reward model-free filtering mechanism to select the highest-quality\ninterpretable answers for the next round of tuning. This iterative process of\nsynthetic data generation and fine-tuning progressively improves the model's\nability to generate accurate and reasonable explanations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving both the accuracy and\nexplainability of specialized visual classification tasks.",

Such limit has been previously\nanalyzed in momentum-space Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum models, but not\nin a real-space formalism. In this regime, the Hubbard interaction ($U_1$) of\nthe $f$-electrons is larger than the bandwidth ($2M$) of the flat bands but\nsmaller than the gap ($\\gamma$) between the flat and remote bands. In the THF\nmodel, concentrated charge (in real space) and concentrated Berry curvature (in\nmomentum space) are respectively realized by exponentially localized\n$f$-orbitals and itinerant Dirac $c$-electrons. Local moments naturally arise\nfrom $f$-orbitals. Hybridizing the $f$-electrons with $c$-electrons produces\npower-law tails of the flat-band Wannier functions, raising the question of\nrelevance of the local moment picture in the projected $U_1\\ll \\gamma$ limit.\nNonetheless, we find that the local moments remain stable as long as $U_1 \\gg\n\\Delta(\\omega)$ for $|\\omega|\\lesssim U_1$, where $\\Delta(\\omega)\\sim \\gamma^2\nN(\\omega)$ is the hybridization function seen by each $f$-site, and $N(\\omega)$\nis the density of states of the Dirac $c$-bands. Notably, the comparison\nbetween $U_1$ and $\\gamma$ is irrelevant to the local moment formation if\n$N(\\omega)$ is unknown. Within the framework of THF, we also derive the\ncorrelated self-energy of the flat bands using the Hubbard-I approximation and\nestimate the coupling strength between the local moments. Finally, we comment\nthat, in the regime of extremely concentrated Berry curvature, the\nsingle-particle gap between flat bands and remote bands vanishes and the\ninteraction is always larger than the gap.",

We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced\nphase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states.\nIn this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to\nsymmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we\ninvestigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the\ndecoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the\ntoric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected\ntopological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the\nboundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The\ncorresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\\to1$ limit of the\n2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at\n$\\Theta$-angle $\\pi$, and represents a \"measurement-version\" of the Cho-Fisher\nnetwork model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of\nself-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or\n(non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from\nthis self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel\ntype of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising\nmodel in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach\ncombining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we\nchart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and\nentanglement entropy measures. Our results point to a way towards a general\nunderstanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of\nsymmetry and topology.",

By drawing analogies between nematic systems and\nfield-tuned altermagnets, we further show that similar responses are expected\nfor the ECE near altermagnetic QCPs. We classify the types of piezomagnetic\ncouplings and analyse the regimes arising from field-tuned magnetoelastic\ninteractions. Our findings are shown to be consistent with the scaling theory\nfor elastic quantum criticality and they further emphasize the suitability of\nthe ECE as a sensitive probe near QCPs.",

We present multi-epoch observations\nand examine the variability in accretion signatures within this system,\nfocusing on PDS 70 b and c. Using Hubble Space Telescope narrowband H-alpha\nimaging from 2020 and 2024, we achieve high signal-to-noise ratio detections of\nthese planets and reveal significant changes in H-alpha flux. For PDS 70 c, the\nH-alpha flux more than doubled between 2020 and 2024. The trend is consistent\nwith the one identified in recently published MagAO-X data, further confirming\nthat PDS 70 c has become significantly brighter in H between 2023 March and\n2024 May. The observed variability suggests dynamic accretion processes,\npossibly modulated by circumplanetary disk properties or transient accretion\nbursts. High-amplitude variability in PDS 70 c motivates simultaneous\nmonitoring of multiple accretion tracers to probe the mechanisms of mass growth\nof gas giant planets. We quantify the impact of variability on the\ndetectability of protoplanets in imaging surveys and emphasize the need for\ncontinued and regular monitoring to accurately assess the occurrence and\ncharacteristics of young, forming planets.",

When fitting composite models, there exists the\npotential for systematics from a poor fit of one model component to be absorbed\nby another, resulting in the composite model providing an accurate fit to the\ndata in aggregate but yielding biased a posteriori estimates for individual\ncomponents. We begin by defining a classification scheme for composite model\ncomparison scenarios, identifying two categories: category I, where models with\naccurate and predictive components are separable through Bayesian comparison of\nthe unvalidated composite models, and category II, where models with accurate\nand predictive components may not be separable due to interactions between\ncomponents, leading to spurious detections or biased signal estimation. To\naddress the limitations of category II model comparisons, we introduce the\nBayesian Null Test Evidence Ratio-based (BaNTER) validation framework. Applying\nthis classification scheme and BaNTER to a composite model comparison problem\nin 21-cm cosmology, where minor systematics from imperfect foreground modelling\ncan bias global 21-cm signal recovery, we validate six composite models using\nmock data.

In this work, we fit observations of 138\nspectroscopically confirmed $z>6$ galaxies adopting standard spectral energy\ndistribution modeling assumptions and compare standard attenuation law\nprescriptions to a flat attenuation law. Compared to SMC dust, flat attenuation\nclose to what may be expected from dust produced in SNe yields up to $0.5$ mag\nhigher $A_V$, and $0.4$ dex larger stellar masses. It also finds better fits to\nthe rest-frame UV photometry with lower $\\chi^2_{\\rm UV}$, allowing the\nobserved UV luminosities taken from the models to be fainter by $0.2$ dex on\naverage. The systematically fainter observed UV luminosities for fixed observed\nphotometry could help resolve current tension between the ionizing photon\nproduction implied by \\textit{JWST} observations and the redshift evolution of\nthe neutral hydrogen fraction.

While traditional approaches use 2D grid\ntokenization, recent methods like TiTok have shown that 1D tokenization can\nachieve high generation quality by eliminating grid redundancies. However,\nthese methods typically use a fixed number of tokens and thus cannot adapt to\nan image's inherent complexity. We introduce FlexTok, a tokenizer that projects\n2D images into variable-length, ordered 1D token sequences. For example, a\n256x256 image can be resampled into anywhere from 1 to 256 discrete tokens,\nhierarchically and semantically compressing its information. By training a\nrectified flow model as the decoder and using nested dropout, FlexTok produces\nplausible reconstructions regardless of the chosen token sequence length. We\nevaluate our approach in an autoregressive generation setting using a simple\nGPT-style Transformer. On ImageNet, this approach achieves an FID<2 across 8 to\n128 tokens, outperforming TiTok and matching state-of-the-art methods with far\nfewer tokens. We further extend the model to support to text-conditioned image\ngeneration and examine how FlexTok relates to traditional 2D tokenization. A\nkey finding is that FlexTok enables next-token prediction to describe images in\na coarse-to-fine \"visual vocabulary\", and that the number of tokens to generate\ndepends on the complexity of the generation task.",

    "abstract": "Many everyday mobile manipulation tasks require precise interaction with\nsmall objects, such as grasping a knob to open a cabinet or pressing a light\nswitch. In this paper, we develop Servoing with Vision Models (SVM), a\nclosed-loop training-free framework that enables a mobile manipulator to tackle\nsuch precise tasks involving the manipulation of small objects. SVM employs an\nRGB-D wrist camera and uses visual servoing for control. Our novelty lies in\nthe use of state-of-the-art vision models to reliably compute 3D targets from\nthe wrist image for diverse tasks and under occlusion due to the end-effector.\nTo mitigate occlusion artifacts, we employ vision models to out-paint the\nend-effector thereby significantly enhancing target localization. We\ndemonstrate that aided by out-painting methods, open-vocabulary object\ndetectors can serve as a drop-in module to identify semantic targets (e.g.\nknobs) and point tracking methods can reliably track interaction sites\nindicated by user clicks. This training-free method obtains an 85% zero-shot\nsuccess rate on manipulating unseen objects in novel environments in the real\nworld, outperforming an open-loop control method and an imitation learning\nbaseline trained on 1000+ demonstrations by an absolute success rate of 50%.",

This framework enables us to analytically study the learning\ndynamics and generalization performance of deep networks compared to shallow\nones in the high-dimensional limit.

We benchmark our mean-field description by comparing\nit to density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations in quasi-one\ndimensional settings and find remarkably good agreement. For the\ntwo-dimensional system relevant to LNO our mean-field calculations predict a\nBCS pairing gap with an extended $s$-wave symmetry, directly resulting from the\npairing mechanism's Feshbach-origin.

Our investigation complements the simulation studies of\nthe same process within this special issue. It provides information about both\nelectronic state population and structural dynamics through well-separable\ninelastic and elastic electron scattering signatures. We observe the\ndepopulation of the photoexcited S$_2$ state of cyclobutanone with n3s Rydberg\ncharacter through its inelastic electron scattering signature with a time\nconstant of $(0.29 \\pm 0.2)$ ps towards the S$_1$ state. The S$_1$ state\npopulation undergoes ring-opening via a Norrish Type-I reaction, likely while\npassing through a conical intersection with S$_0$. The corresponding structural\nchanges can be tracked by elastic electron scattering signatures. These changes\nappear with a delay of $(0.14 \\pm 0.05)$ ps with respect the initial\nphotoexcitation, which is less than the S$_2$ depopulation time constant. This\nbehavior provides evidence for the ballistic nature of the ring-opening once\nthe S$_1$ state is reached. The resulting biradical species react further\nwithin $(1.2 \\pm 0.2)$ ps via two rival fragmentation channels yielding ketene\nand ethylene, or propene and carbon monoxide.

This work\nintroduces a novel system that combines knowledge distillation and ensemble\nlearning to bridge the performance gap between artificial neural networks\n(ANNs) and SNNs. A foundation AI model acts as a teacher network, guiding\nsmaller student SNNs organized into an ensemble, called Spiking Neural Ensemble\n(SNE). SNE enables the disentanglement of the teacher's knowledge, allowing\neach student to specialize in predicting a distinct aspect of it, while\nprocessing the same input.

By dynamically activating\nonly a subset of these student SNNs, the system balances accuracy and energy\nefficiency, achieving substantial energy savings with minimal accuracy loss.\nMoreover, SNE is significantly more efficient than the teacher network,\nreducing computational requirements by up to 20x with only a 2% drop in\naccuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

    "abstract": "Content creators often draw inspiration from multiple visual sources,\ncombining distinct elements to craft new compositions. Modern computational\napproaches now aim to emulate this fundamental creative process. Although\nrecent diffusion models excel at text-guided compositional synthesis, text as a\nmedium often lacks precise control over visual details. Image-based composition\napproaches can capture more nuanced features, but existing methods are\ntypically limited in the range of concepts they can capture, and require\nexpensive training procedures or specialized data. We present IP-Composer, a\nnovel training-free approach for compositional image generation that leverages\nmultiple image references simultaneously, while using natural language to\ndescribe the concept to be extracted from each image. Our method builds on\nIP-Adapter, which synthesizes novel images conditioned on an input image's CLIP\nembedding. We extend this approach to multiple visual inputs by crafting\ncomposite embeddings, stitched from the projections of multiple input images\nonto concept-specific CLIP-subspaces identified through text. Through\ncomprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach enables more precise\ncontrol over a larger range of visual concept compositions.",

Considering the practical limitation on the\nsize of the Ising machine(IM), our algorithm partitions the QUBO problem into a\ncollection of QUBO subproblems (called subQUBOs) and utilizes the IM to solve\neach subQUBO. Our proposed heuristic algorithm uses a set of control parameters\nto generate the subQUBOs and explore the search space.

We have evaluated the effectiveness\nof our IC-D2S algorithm on three large-sized problem sets and compared its\nefficiency in finding the (near-)optimal solution with three QUBO solvers. One\nof the solvers is a software-based algorithm (D2TS), while the other one\n(D-Wave) employs a similar approach to ours, utilizing both classical and Ising\nmachines.

    "abstract": "Traffic congestion continues to escalate with urbanization and socioeconomic\ndevelopment, necessitating advanced modeling to understand and mitigate its\nimpacts. In large-scale networks, traffic congestion can be studied using\ncascade models, where congestion not only impacts isolated segments, but also\npropagates through the network in a domino-like fashion. One metric for\nunderstanding these impacts is congestion cost, which is typically defined as\nthe additional travel time caused by traffic jams. Recent data suggests that\ncongestion cost exhibits a universal scale-free-tailed behavior. However, the\nmechanism driving this phenomenon is not yet well understood. To address this\ngap, we propose a stochastic cascade model of traffic congestion. We show that\ntraffic congestion cost is driven by the scale-free distribution of traffic\nintensities. This arises from the catastrophe principle, implying that severe\ncongestion is likely caused by disproportionately large traffic originating\nfrom a single location. We also show that the scale-free nature of congestion\ncost is robust to various congestion propagation rules, explaining the\nuniversal scaling observed in empirical data. These findings provide a new\nperspective in understanding the fundamental drivers of traffic congestion and\noffer a unifying framework for studying congestion phenomena across diverse\ntraffic networks.",

Despite this, there is\nstill a significant domain gap between the modalities of vision and language,\nespecially when training data is scarce in few-shot settings, where only very\nlimited data are available for training. In order to mitigate this issue, a\nmulti-modal meta-learning framework has been proposed to bridge the gap between\ntwo frozen pretrained large vision and language models by introducing a tunable\nprompt connecting these two large models. For few-shot image captioning, the\nexisting multi-model meta-learning framework utilizes a one-step prompting\nscheme to accumulate the visual features of input images to guide the language\nmodel, which struggles to generate accurate image descriptions with only a few\ntraining samples. Instead, we propose a chain-of-thought (CoT) meta-learning\nscheme as a multi-step image captioning procedure to better imitate how humans\ndescribe images. In addition, we further propose to learn different\nmeta-parameters of the model corresponding to each CoT step in distinct\nsubspaces to avoid interference.

This motivates the search for polynomial-time\nsolvable subclasses. A special type of imperfect recall, called A-loss recall,\nis amenable to efficient polynomial-time algorithms. In this work, we present\nnovel techniques to simplify non-absent-minded imperfect recall games into\nequivalent A-loss recall games. The first idea involves shuffling the order of\nactions, and leads to a new polynomial-time solvable class of imperfect recall\ngames that extends A-loss recall. The second idea generalises the first one, by\nconstructing a new set of action sequences which can be \"linearly combined\" to\ngive the original game. The equivalent game has a simplified information\nstructure, but it could be exponentially bigger in size (in accordance with the\nNP-hardness).

To enhance visual\nfeedback during VLM training, we propose S-VCO (Symmetrical Visual Contrastive\nOptimization), a novel finetuning objective that steers the model toward\ncapturing important visual details and aligning them with corresponding text\ntokens. To further facilitate this detailed alignment, we introduce MVC, a\npaired image-text dataset built by automatically filtering and augmenting\nvisual counterfactual data to challenge the model with hard contrastive cases\ninvolving Minimal Visual Contrasts. Experiments show that our method\nconsistently improves VLM performance across diverse benchmarks covering\nvarious abilities and domains, achieving up to a 22% reduction in\nhallucinations, and significant gains in vision-centric and general tasks.\nNotably, these improvements become increasingly pronounced in benchmarks with\nhigher visual dependency.

Our evaluation\nof $16$ state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, reveals a\nsignificant performance gap compared to human capabilities, particularly in\ntasks that require reordering shuffled sequential images. For instance, GPT-4o\nachieves only 23.93% accuracy in the reordering subtask, which is 56.07% lower\nthan human performance. Further quantitative analysis discuss several factors,\nsuch as input format of images, affecting the performance of LLMs in sequential\nunderstanding, underscoring the fundamental challenges that remain in the\ndevelopment of LMMs.",

However, instrumental\nnoise, computational requirements, and varying levels of physical realism make\nit challenging to derive reliable solar magnetic field estimates. In this\nstudy, we present a novel approach for spectropolarimetric inversions based on\nPhysics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to infer the photospheric magnetic\nfield under the Milne-Eddington approximation (PINN ME). Our model acts as a\nrepresentation of the parameter space, mapping input coordinates (t, x, y) to\nthe respective spectropolarimetric parameters, which are used to synthesize the\ncorresponding stokes profiles. By iteratively sampling coordinate points,\nsynthesizing profiles, and minimizing the deviation from the observed stokes\nprofiles, our method can find the set of Milne-Eddington parameters that best\nfit the observations. In addition, we directly include the\npoint-spread-function to account for instrumental effects. We use a predefined\nparameter space as well as synthetic profiles from a radiative MHD simulation\nto evaluate the performance of our method and to estimate the impact of\ninstrumental noise. Our results demonstrate that PINN ME achieves an intrinsic\nspatio-temporal coupling, which can largely mitigate observational noise and\nprovides a memory-efficient inversion even for extended fields-of-view.\nFinally, we apply our method to observations and show that our method provides\na high spatial coherence and can resolve small-scale features both in strong-\nand weak-field regions.",

Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap\nforward in understanding and interacting with the world through enhanced visual\nrecognition, precise object localization, robust document parsing, and\nlong-video comprehension. A standout feature of Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to\nlocalize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately. It provides robust\nstructured data extraction from invoices, forms, and tables, as well as\ndetailed analysis of charts, diagrams, and layouts. To handle complex inputs,\nQwen2.5-VL introduces dynamic resolution processing and absolute time encoding,\nenabling it to process images of varying sizes and videos of extended durations\n(up to hours) with second-level event localization. This allows the model to\nnatively perceive spatial scales and temporal dynamics without relying on\ntraditional normalization techniques. By training a native dynamic-resolution\nVision Transformer (ViT) from scratch and incorporating Window Attention, we\nreduce computational overhead while maintaining native resolution. As a result,\nQwen2.5-VL excels not only in static image and document understanding but also\nas an interactive visual agent capable of reasoning, tool usage, and task\nexecution in real-world scenarios such as operating computers and mobile\ndevices. Qwen2.5-VL is available in three sizes, addressing diverse use cases\nfrom edge AI to high-performance computing.

However, superior short-context LLMs may\nunderperform in long-context scenarios due to insufficient long-context\nalignment. This alignment process remains challenging due to the impracticality\nof human annotation for extended contexts and the difficulty in balancing\nshort- and long-context performance. To address these challenges, we introduce\nLongPO, that enables short-context LLMs to self-evolve to excel on long-context\ntasks by internally transferring short-context capabilities. LongPO harnesses\nLLMs to learn from self-generated short-to-long preference data, comprising\npaired responses generated for identical instructions with long-context inputs\nand their compressed short-context counterparts, respectively. This preference\nreveals capabilities and potentials of LLMs cultivated during short-context\nalignment that may be diminished in under-aligned long-context scenarios.\nAdditionally, LongPO incorporates a short-to-long KL constraint to mitigate\nshort-context performance decline during long-context alignment. When applied\nto Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 from 128K to 512K context lengths, LongPO fully\nretains short-context performance and largely outperforms naive SFT and DPO in\nboth long- and short-context tasks.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in code generation have illuminated the potential of\nemploying large language models (LLMs) for general-purpose programming\nlanguages such as Python and C++, opening new opportunities for automating\nsoftware development and enhancing programmer productivity. The potential of\nLLMs in software programming has sparked significant interest in exploring\nautomated hardware generation and automation. Although preliminary endeavors\nhave been made to adopt LLMs in generating hardware description languages\n(HDLs), several challenges persist in this direction. First, the volume of\navailable HDL training data is substantially smaller compared to that for\nsoftware programming languages. Second, the pre-trained LLMs, mainly tailored\nfor software code, tend to produce HDL designs that are more error-prone.\nThird, the generation of HDL requires a significantly higher number of tokens\ncompared to software programming, leading to inefficiencies in cost and energy\nconsumption. To tackle these challenges, this paper explores leveraging LLMs to\ngenerate High-Level Synthesis (HLS)-based hardware design. Although code\ngeneration for domain-specific programming languages is not new in the\nliterature, we aim to provide experimental results, insights, benchmarks, and\nevaluation infrastructure to investigate the suitability of HLS over low-level\nHDLs for LLM-assisted hardware design generation. To achieve this, we first\nfinetune pre-trained models for HLS-based hardware generation, using a\ncollected dataset with text prompts and corresponding reference HLS designs. An\nLLM-assisted framework is then proposed to automate end-to-end hardware code\ngeneration, which also investigates the impact of chain-of-thought and feedback\nloops promoting techniques on HLS-design generation. Limited by the timeframe\nof this research, we plan to evaluate more advanced reasoning models in the\nfuture.",

Therefore, Socrates is mortal.''\nThis form of argument illustrates a typical pattern of two-hop reasoning.\nFormally, two-hop reasoning refers to the process of inferring a conclusion by\nmaking two logical steps, each connecting adjacent concepts, such that the\nfinal conclusion depends on the integration of both steps. It is one of the\nmost fundamental components of human reasoning and plays a crucial role in both\nformal logic and everyday decision-making. Despite recent progress in large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we surprisingly find that they can fail at solving\nsimple two-hop reasoning problems when distractors are present. We observe on a\nsynthetic dataset that pre-trained LLMs often resort to random guessing among\nall plausible conclusions. However, after few steps of fine-tuning, models\nachieve near-perfect accuracy and exhibit strong length generalization. To\nunderstand the underlying mechanisms, we train a 3-layer Transformer from\nscratch on a synthetic two-hop reasoning task and reverse-engineer its internal\ninformation flow. We observe a clear progression in the attention logits\nthroughout training. This pictures a sharp phase transition from an initial\nstage of random guessing to the emergence of a structured sequential query\nmechanism, where the model first retrieves the preceding and the bridge\nconcepts in the early layers and then uses them to infer the final answer.\nFinally, we show that these dynamics can be captured by a minimal\nthree-parameter attention-only network.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) radiotherapy has become a novel\ncancer treatment technique because of its similar tumor-killing efficacy as\nconventional particle therapy while significantly protecting normal tissues.\nHowever, due to the limitation of particle number, achieving FLASH condition in\na compact heavy-ion synchrotron requires a short extraction time of tens of\nmilliseconds, which is challenging for the conventional RF-KO method. To tackle\nthis challenge, we introduce autoresonance into the third-order resonant\nextraction for the first time, offering an alternative to the conventional\napproach of merely increasing the excitation strength. By leveraging a strong\ndetuning effect, a frequency sweeping excitation with small amplitude can drive\nthe entire beam into the autoresonant state, thus enabling rapid beam\nextraction within a single sweeping period. Compared with the conventional\nmethod, this innovative method requires only the addition of an octupole\nmagnet. At the same time, it shows that the conventional RF-KO method has a\nhigh autoresonance threshold, so that only a small number of particles that\nmeet the threshold can be excited to large amplitude and be extracted in each\nsweeping period. In this paper, the autoresonance threshold of a particle in\nthe presence of sextupole and octupole magnetic fields is analyzed, and the\nsingle particle simulation shows good agreement with the theoretical formula.\nFurthermore, the autoresonance based rapid extraction process is simulated and\nstudied, revealing the possibility of millisecond scale beam extraction.",

Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that\nrequire fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by\ntraining only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in\nreal-world applications.

For example, in the phrase \"10 dollars per kilo,\" LLMs might\nnot recognize that \"per\" means \"for each,\" leading to calculation errors. We\nintroduce a novel, post-training approach called **Stick to the Facts (SIFT)**\nto tackle this. SIFT leverages increasing inference-time compute to ground LLM\nreasoning in contexts. At the core of SIFT lies the *Sticker*, which is\ngenerated by the model itself to explicitly emphasize the key information\nwithin the context. Given the curated Sticker, SIFT generates two predictions\n-- one from the original query and one from the query augmented with the\nSticker. If they differ, the Sticker is sequentially refined via *forward*\noptimization (to better align the extracted facts with the query) and *inverse*\ngeneration (to conform with the model's inherent tendencies) for more faithful\nreasoning outcomes. Studies across diverse models (from 3B to 100B+) and\nbenchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, MATH-500) reveal consistent performance improvements.\nNotably, SIFT improves the pass@1 accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 on AIME2024 from\n78.33% to **85.67**%, establishing a new state-of-the-art in the open-source\ncommunity.

    "abstract": "This paper presents DataSciBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating\nLarge Language Model (LLM) capabilities in data science. Recent related\nbenchmarks have primarily focused on single tasks, easily obtainable ground\ntruth, and straightforward evaluation metrics, which limits the scope of tasks\nthat can be evaluated. In contrast, DataSciBench is constructed based on a more\ncomprehensive and curated collection of natural and challenging prompts for\nuncertain ground truth and evaluation metrics. We develop a semi-automated\npipeline for generating ground truth (GT) and validating evaluation metrics.\nThis pipeline utilizes and implements an LLM-based self-consistency and human\nverification strategy to produce accurate GT by leveraging collected prompts,\npredefined task types, and aggregate functions (metrics). Furthermore, we\npropose an innovative Task - Function - Code (TFC) framework to assess each\ncode execution outcome based on precisely defined metrics and programmatic\nrules. Our experimental framework involves testing 6 API-based models, 8\nopen-source general models, and 9 open-source code generation models using the\ndiverse set of prompts we have gathered. This approach aims to provide a more\ncomprehensive and rigorous evaluation of LLMs in data science, revealing their\nstrengths and weaknesses. Experimental results demonstrate that API-based\nmodels outperform open-sourced models on all metrics and\nDeepseek-Coder-33B-Instruct achieves the highest score among open-sourced\nmodels.

The first is\nthe constancy theorem, which states that the isomorphism types of connected\ncomponents of the stacks of graded and filtered points stay constant within\nchambers in the component lattice. The second is the finiteness theorem, which\nprovides a criterion for the finiteness of the number of possible isomorphism\ntypes of these components.

As our first main contribution, we prove that\ntwo states of the Markov chain are in graph-based product form if and only if\nthe following two equivalent conditions are satisfied: (i) a cut-based\ncondition, reminiscent of classical results on product-form queueing systems,\nand (ii) a novel characterization that we call joint-ancestor freeness. The\nlatter characterization allows us in particular to introduce a graph-traversal\nalgorithm that checks product-form relationships for all pairs of states, with\ntime complexity $O(|V|^2 |E|)$, if the Markov chain has a finite transition\ngraph $G = (V, E)$. We then generalize graph-based product form to encompass\nmore complex relationships, which we call ``higher-level product-form'', and we\nagain show these can be identified via a graph-traversal algorithm when the\nMarkov chain has a finite state space.

However, gait impairment, particularly\nfreezing of gait (FOG), remains a significant challenge in DYT-KMT2B patients\npost-DBS. Objectives: To characterize the emergence of FOG in DYT-KMT2B\npatients treated with GPi-DBS and explore potential underlying mechanisms,\nincluding striatonigral degeneration. Methods: Five patients (four females)\nwith KMT2B-related dystonia and protein-truncating variants (PTVs) were\nretrospectively analyzed. Clinical progression, response to GPi-DBS, and the\npresence of FOG were documented. Dopaminergic function was assessed using\nDaTscan (SPECT for ^123I-ioflupane) in four patients. Results: FOG developed in\nall patients, with onset ranging from 1 to 15.5 years post-DBS. DaTscan\nabnormalities, indicative of bilateral striatal dopaminergic denervation, were\nobserved in four cases. Prior to DBS, all patients exhibited dystonia\nunresponsive to L-dopa, and post-DBS, FOG remained refractory to dopaminergic\ntreatment in most cases. Despite initial improvements in gait post-DBS, only\none patient maintained independent ambulation at the last follow-up.\nConclusions: FOG is an emerging complication in DYT-KMT2B patients with PTVs\nundergoing GPi-DBS, potentially linked to underlying striatonigral\ndegeneration. The findings suggest a need for long-term motor surveillance and\nconsideration of alternative therapeutic strategies, including dopaminergic\ntrials, in this patient population. Further studies are required to elucidate\nthe precise mechanisms driving DBS-related hypokinetic gait disturbances in\nDYT-KMT2B dystonia.",

    "abstract": "Active mode mismatch sensing and control can facilitate optimal coupling in\noptical cavity experiments such as interferometric gravitational wave\ndetectors. In this paper, we demonstrate a radio-frequency (RF) beam wavefront\ncurvature modulation-based mode mismatch sensing scheme inspired by the\npreviously proposed RF beam jitter alignment sensing scheme. The proposed mode\nmismatch sensing scheme uses an electro-optic lens (EOL) device that is\ndesigned to provide the required beam wavefront curvature actuation, as well as\na mode converting telescope that rephases the RF second-order modes and\ngenerates a non-vanishing mode mismatch sensing signal. We carefully\ninvestigate the total second-order mode generation from the wavefront actuation\nboth analytically and numerically, taking the effects of Gaussian beam size\nevolution and the second-order mode phase mismatch cancellation into\nconsideration. We demonstrate the second-order mode generation as a function of\nthe incident beam waist size and the electro-optic crystal size, which along\nwith a ``trade-off'' consideration of the beam size at the edges of the crystal\nand the clipping loss, provides us with guidance for designing the beam profile\nthat interacts with the crystal to improve the EOL modulation efficiency.",

Surgical activity recognition (SAR) is a key computer vision task\nthat detects activities or phases from multi-view camera recordings. Existing\nSAR models often fail to account for fine-grained clinician movements and\nmulti-view knowledge, or they require calibrated multi-view camera setups and\nadvanced point-cloud processing to obtain better results. In this work, we\npropose a novel calibration-free multi-view multi-modal pretraining framework\ncalled Multiview Pretraining for Video-Pose Surgical Activity Recognition\nPreViPS, which aligns 2D pose and vision embeddings across camera views. Our\nmodel follows CLIP-style dual-encoder architecture: one encoder processes\nvisual features, while the other encodes human pose embeddings. To handle the\ncontinuous 2D human pose coordinates, we introduce a tokenized discrete\nrepresentation to convert the continuous 2D pose coordinates into discrete pose\nembeddings, thereby enabling efficient integration within the dual-encoder\nframework. To bridge the gap between these two modalities, we propose several\npretraining objectives using cross- and in-modality geometric constraints\nwithin the embedding space and incorporating masked pose token prediction\nstrategy to enhance representation learning. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies demonstrate improvements over the strong baselines, while\ndata-efficiency experiments on two distinct operating room datasets further\nhighlight the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "The property of triality only appears in one linear simple Lie algebra:\n$D_4$, a.k.a. $\\mathfrak{so}(8, \\mathbb{C})$. Though often explored in\nabstract, it is desirable to have an explicit realization of the concept since\nthere are no other linear examples to gain intuition from. In this paper\nseveral convenient representations and bases are constructed in order to\nfacilitate the exploration of the three fold symmetry known as the triality of\nrepresentations. In particular the three $8$ dimensional representations for\nthe Euclidean and Lorentzian real forms of $\\mathfrak{so}(8,\\mathbb{C})$ are\nconstructed, and the maps between representations are given in each case,\nrespectively. It is also seen explicitly how $\\mathfrak{g}_2 \\subset\n\\mathfrak{so}(8, \\mathbb{R})$ arises as the intersection of non-conjugate\n$\\mathfrak{spin}(7,\\mathbb{R})$ sub-algebras, and also as the stabilizer of the\nouter automorphism group $\\mathrm{Out}(\\mathfrak{so}(8,\\mathbb{R}))$. It is\nargued that $\\mathfrak{spin}(1,7)$ is in some sense the more natural stage for\ntriality to play out upon, and it is shown that triality can be seen to be\nsimply the multiplication of bases by third roots of unity, just as dualities\nare often the application of second roots of unity upon Lie algebra bases.

A\nwell-known result of Burr, Erd\\H{o}s and Spencer states that $R(mK_3)=5m$ for\nevery $m\\ge2$.

Crucially, in Moon's result, distinct copies of $K_3$\nmight receive different colours.\n  In this paper, we investigate the analogous questions where the complete host\ngraph is replaced by a graph of large minimum degree. We determine the\n(asymptotic) minimum degree threshold for forcing a~$K_3$-tiling covering a\nprescribed proportion of the vertices in a $2$-edge-coloured graph such that\nevery copy of $K_3$ in the tiling is monochromatic.

Rather than optimising memory\npatterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution\nto the unique architecture of NPUs.

Popular\npost-hoc explanation methods like SHAP provide marginal feature attributions,\nwhile their extensions to interaction importances only scale to small input\nlengths ($\\approx 20$). We propose Spectral Explainer (SPEX), a model-agnostic\ninteraction attribution algorithm that efficiently scales to large input\nlengths ($\\approx 1000)$. SPEX exploits underlying natural sparsity among\ninteractions -- common in real-world data -- and applies a sparse Fourier\ntransform using a channel decoding algorithm to efficiently identify important\ninteractions. We perform experiments across three difficult long-context\ndatasets that require LLMs to utilize interactions between inputs to complete\nthe task. For large inputs, SPEX outperforms marginal attribution methods by up\nto 20% in terms of faithfully reconstructing LLM outputs. Further, SPEX\nsuccessfully identifies key features and interactions that strongly influence\nmodel output. For one of our datasets, HotpotQA, SPEX provides interactions\nthat align with human annotations.

Furthermore, aggregation\nstrategies that preserve the problem structure are compared against approximate\nmaximum aggregation.

Methods: In a multi-scale analysis from parsec\nto ~50au scales, we combined multiple single-dish and interferometric\nobservations to study the gas flow from large-scale sizes of several parsec\n(Mopra) via intermediate-scale filamentary gas flows (ALMA-IMF) to the central\ncores (ALMA DIHCA and configuration 10 data). The highest-resolution\nmulti-configuration ALMA dataset achieved a spatial resolution of\n0.027''x0.022'' or 50au. Results: This multi-scale study allows us to follow\nthe gas from the environment of the high-mass star-forming region (~2pc) via\nintermediate-scale (~0.25pc) filamentary gas flows down to the innermost cores\nwithin the central few 1000au. The intermediate-scale filaments connect\nspatially and kinematically to the larger-scale cloud as well as the innermost\ncores. We estimate a filamentary mass inflow rate around 10^-3M_sun/yr, feeding\ninto the central region that hosts at least a dozen mm cores. While the flow\nfrom the cloud via the filaments down to 10^4au appears relatively ordered,\nwithin the central 10^4au the kinematic structures become much more complicated\nand disordered. We speculate that this is caused by the interplay of the\nconverging infalling gas with feedback processes from the forming central\nprotostars. Conclusions: This multi-scale study characterises and quantifies\nthe hierarchical gas flow from clouds down to the central protostars for a\nprototypical infrared dark cloud with several embedded cores at an\nunprecedented detail. While comparatively ordered gas flows are found over a\nbroad range of scales, the innermost area exhibits more disordered structures,\nlikely caused by the combination of inflow, outflow and cluster dynamical\nprocesses.",

However, methyl halides (CH3 + halogen) have\nnot yet been robustly examined with self-consistent photochemical and spectral\nmodels for planets with H2-dominated atmospheres. Here we demonstrate that\nmethyl chloride (CH3Cl), predominantly produced by marine microbes, could be\ndetected using JWST in tens of transits or fewer for Hycean planets, comparable\nto detection requirements for other potential atmospheric biosignatures. The\nthreshold atmospheric mixing ratio for detectability is $\\sim$10 ppm, which can\naccumulate with global fluxes comparable to moderately productive local\nenvironments on Earth.",

While text-to-image generation has made strides in\nphotorealistic imagery, creating accurate geometric diagrams remains a\nchallenge due to the need for precise spatial relationships and the scarcity of\ngeometry-specific datasets. This paper presents MagicGeo, a training-free\nframework for generating geometric diagrams from textual descriptions. MagicGeo\nformulates the diagram generation process as a coordinate optimization problem,\nensuring geometric correctness through a formal language solver, and then\nemploys coordinate-aware generation. The framework leverages the strong\nlanguage translation capability of large language models, while formal\nmathematical solving ensures geometric correctness. We further introduce\nMagicGeoBench, a benchmark dataset of 220 geometric diagram descriptions, and\ndemonstrate that MagicGeo outperforms current methods in both qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations. This work provides a scalable, accurate solution for\nautomated diagram generation, with significant implications for educational and\nacademic applications.",

The prover is a powerful entity that assigns certificates to nodes,\nwhich are then locally checked by the verifier.\n  An LCP is correct if it satisfies completeness and soundness. Completeness\nmeans that, for any graph $G$ satisfying a property $\\Pi$, there exists a\ncertificate assignment accepted by all nodes. Soundness ensures that for every\ngraph not satisfying $\\Pi$, at least one node rejects any certificate\nassignment.\n  We study how to certify that a graph is bipartite (i.e., $2$-colorable) with\nan LCP that hides the $2$-coloring from the verifier. An LCP is hiding if no\nlocal algorithm can reconstruct the coloring from a valid certificate.\nMotivated by promise-free separations in the LOCAL model and its variants, we\nalso require strong soundness: in a no-instance, the subgraph induced by\naccepting nodes must be $2$-colorable. An LCP with completeness, soundness,\nhiding, and strong soundness is called strong and hiding.\n  We show that such LCPs for $2$-coloring exist in specific graph classes,\nusing only $O(\\log n)$-size certificates. If the input is a cycle or has a node\nof degree 1, these LCPs also work in anonymous networks with constant-size\ncertificates.\n  We also prove that no strong and hiding LCP exists for general graphs unless\nnode identifiers are available and certificates are of size $\\omega(1)$. In\nanonymous networks, this lower bound holds regardless of the certificate size.\nWe also present a characterization of the hiding property for $k$-coloring,\nwhich plays a key role in future investigations.",

In this work, we introduce RNNAL, a method for solving\nDNN relaxations of large-scale mixed-binary quadratic programs by leveraging\ntheir solutions' possible low-rank property. RNNAL is a globally convergent\nRiemannian augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) that penalizes the nonnegativity\nand complementarity constraints while preserving all other constraints as an\nalgebraic variety. After applying the low-rank decomposition to the ALM\nsubproblem, its feasible region becomes an algebraic variety with favorable\ngeometric properties. Our low-rank decomposition model is different from the\nstandard Burer-Monteiro (BM) decomposition model in that we make the key\nimprovement to equivalently reformulate most of the quadratic constraints after\nthe BM decomposition into fewer and more manageable affine constraints. This\nmodification is also important in helping us to alleviate the violation of\nSlater's condition for the primal DNN problem. Moreover, we make the crucial\nstep to show that the metric projection onto the algebraic variety, although\nnon-convex, can be transformed into a solvable convex optimization problem\nunder certain regularity conditions, which can be ensured by a\nconstraint-relaxation strategy. RNNAL is able to handle general semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) with additional polyhedral cone constraints, thus serving as\na prototype algorithm for solving general DNN problems.

To address this, we explored multi-indication meta-analysis\nmethods that share evidence across indications.\n  We conducted a simulation study to evaluate alternative multi-indication\nsynthesis models.

    "abstract": "Nanoscale optoelectronic components achieve functionality via spatial\nvariation in electronic structure induced by composition, defects, and dopants.\nTo dynamically change the local band alignment and influence defect states, a\nscanning gate electrode is highly useful. However, this technique is rarely\ncombined with photoexcitation by a controlled external light source. We explore\na setup that combines several types of light excitation with high resolution\nscanning gate and atomic force microscopy (SGM/AFM). We apply the technique to\nInAs nanowires with an atomic scale defined InP segment, that have attracted\nconsiderable attention for studies of hot carrier devices. Using AFM we image\nthe topography of the nanowire device. SGM measurements without light\nexcitation show how current profiles can be influenced by local gating near the\nInP segment. Modelling of the tip and nanowire can well predict the results\nbased on the axial band structure variation and an asymmetric tip. SGM studies\nincluding light excitation are then performed using both a white light LED and\nlaser diodes at 515 and 780nm. Both negative and positive photoconductance can\nbe observed and the combined effect of light excitation and local gating is\nobserved. SGM can then be used to discriminate between effects related to the\nwire axial compositional structure and surface states.

With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI),\nprogress has been made in reconstructing videos using high-level semantic\ninformation. In this paper, we propose a scalable generative video semantic\ncommunication framework that extracts and transmits semantic information to\nachieve high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, at the transmitter,\ndescription and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are\nextracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics,\nrespectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are\nutilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing\nthe video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel\nbandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to\nreconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different\nsignal-to-noise ratios. Notably, the proposed ``First Frame+Desc.\" scheme\nconsistently achieves CLIP score exceeding 0.92 at CBR = 0.0057 for SNR > 0 dB.\nThis demonstrates its robust performance even under low SNR conditions.",

Moreover, while finetuned models are\nstate-of-the-art on closed-domain tasks, general-purpose models like GPT-4o\nexhibit strong zero-shot performance. This raises questions about the\ntrade-offs between memorization, generalization, and retrieval. In this work,\nwe analyze the extent to which multimodal retrieval-augmented VLMs memorize\ntraining data compared to baseline VLMs. Using the WebQA benchmark, we contrast\nfinetuned models with baseline VLMs on multihop retrieval and question\nanswering, examining the impact of finetuning on data memorization. To quantify\nmemorization in end-to-end retrieval and QA systems, we propose several proxy\nmetrics by investigating instances where QA succeeds despite retrieval failing.\nIn line with existing work, we find that finetuned models rely more heavily on\nmemorization than retrieval-augmented VLMs, and achieve higher accuracy as a\nresult (72% vs 52% on WebQA test set). Finally, we present the first empirical\ncomparison of the parametric effect between text and visual modalities. Here,\nwe find that image-based questions have parametric response rates that are\nconsistently 15-25% higher than for text-based questions in the WebQA dataset.\nAs such, our measures pose a challenge for future work, both to account for\ndifferences in model memorization across different modalities and more\ngenerally to reconcile memorization and generalization in joint Retrieval-QA\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "We study the round complexity of secure multi-party computation (MPC) in the\npost-quantum regime. Our focus is on the fully black-box setting, where both\nthe construction and security reduction are black-box. Chia, Chung, Liu, and\nYamakawa [FOCS'22] demonstrated the infeasibility of achieving standard\nsimulation-based security within constant rounds unless $\\mathbf{NP} \\subseteq\n\\mathbf{BQP}$. This leaves crucial feasibility questions unresolved.\nSpecifically, it remains unknown whether black-box constructions are achievable\nwithin polynomial rounds; also, the existence of constant-round constructions\nwith respect to $\\epsilon$-simulation, a relaxed yet useful alternative to\nstandard simulation, remains unestablished.\n  This work provides positive answers. We introduce the first black-box\nconstruction for PQ-MPC in polynomial rounds, from the minimal assumption of\npost-quantum semi-honest oblivious transfers. In the two-party scenario, our\nconstruction requires only $\\omega(1)$ rounds. These results have already been\napplied in the oracle separation between classical-communication quantum MPC\nand $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{NP}$ in Kretschmer, Qian, and Tal [STOC'25].\n  As for $\\epsilon$-simulation, Chia, Chung, Liang, and Yamakawa [CRYPTO'22]\nresolved the issue for the two-party setting, leaving the multi-party case\nopen. We complete the picture by presenting the first black-box, constant-round\nconstruction in the multi-party setting, instantiable using various standard\npost-quantum primitives.\n  En route, we obtain a black-box, constant-round post-quantum commitment\nachieving a weaker version of 1-many non-malleability, from post-quantum\none-way functions. Besides its role in our MPC construction, this commitment\nalso reduces the assumption used in the quantum parallel repetition lower bound\nby Bostanci, Qian, Spooner, and Yuen [STOC'24]. We anticipate further\napplications in the future.",

Algorithms based on proximity graph indices are\nthe most efficient indices for ANNS, winning many benchmark competitions.\nHowever, it is challenging to update such graph index at a high rate, while\nsupporting stable recall after many updates. Since the graph is singly-linked,\ndeletions are hard because there is no fast way to find in-neighbors of a\ndeleted vertex.

When a single electron undergoes Bragg\ndiffraction at a free-falling nanoparticle, momentum conservation implies that\nthe superposition of Bragg momenta is imprinted onto the relative coordinate\nbetween electron and nanoparticle, which entangles their wavefunctions. By\nimaging the electron interferogram, one maps the nanoparticle state onto a\nsuperposition of Bragg momenta, as if it was diffracted by its own lattice.\nThis results in a coherent momentum splitting approximately 1000 times greater\nthan what is achievable with two-photon recoils in conventional standing-wave\ngratings. Self-interference of the nanoparticle can thus be observed within\ndrastically shorter free-fall times in a time-domain Talbot interferometer\nconfiguration, significantly relaxing source requirements and alleviating\ndecoherence from environmental factors such as residual gas and thermal\nradiation. Shorter interference times also allow for a recapture of the\nnanoparticle within its initial trapping volume, facilitating its reuse in many\nrapid experimental duty cycles.

    "abstract": "In X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging, the choice of reconstruction\nkernel is crucial as it significantly impacts the quality of clinical images.\nDifferent kernels influence spatial resolution, image noise, and contrast in\nvarious ways. Clinical applications involving lung imaging often require images\nreconstructed with both soft and sharp kernels. The reconstruction of images\nwith different kernels requires raw sinogram data and storing images for all\nkernels increases processing time and storage requirements. The Display\nField-of-View (DFOV) adds complexity to kernel synthesis, as data acquired at\ndifferent DFOVs exhibit varying levels of sharpness and details. This work\nintroduces an efficient, DFOV-agnostic solution for image-based kernel\nsynthesis using model-based deep learning. The proposed method explicitly\nintegrates CT kernel and DFOV characteristics into the forward model.\nExperimental results on clinical data, along with quantitative analysis of the\nestimated modulation transfer function using wire phantom data, clearly\ndemonstrate the utility of the proposed method in real-time. Additionally, a\ncomparative study with a direct learning network, that lacks forward model\ninformation, shows that the proposed method is more robust to DFOV variations.",

In this theoretical study, we show that\nAl-rich Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N-channel HEMTs (with $x \\geq 0.5$) outperform the\nGaN-channel counterparts at and above room temperature, across all Al\ncompositions, $x$.

Unlike previous assumptions of a\nconstant two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density across the entire\ncomposition range $x$, we show that the 2DEG density is highly sensitive to\nboth the Al content and thickness of the individual layers in a HEMT structure.\nWe demonstrate that the superior performance of Al-rich (Al,Ga)N-channel HEMTs\nis driven by a competing effect between 2DEG density and electron mobility.\nThis work challenges the assumptions of prior studies, which can result in a\nsignificant under or overestimation of the potential of high Al content HEMTs.\nThe insights gained from our work provide a comprehensive understanding of the\ntrade-offs between device and material parameters, thus help to guide the\ndesign of future Al-rich ($x = 0.5-1.0$) Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N-channel HEMTs for\nhigh-power applications.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in various clinical\napplications. A major challenge in medical image segmentation is achieving\naccurate delineation of regions of interest in the presence of noise, low\ncontrast, or complex anatomical structures. Existing segmentation models often\nneglect the integration of multi-grained information and fail to preserve edge\ndetails, which are critical for precise segmentation. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel image semantic segmentation model called the\nMulti-Grained Feature Integration Network (MGFI-Net). Our MGFI-Net is designed\nwith two dedicated modules to tackle these issues. First, to enhance\nsegmentation accuracy, we introduce a Multi-Grained Feature Extraction Module,\nwhich leverages hierarchical relationships between different feature scales to\nselectively focus on the most relevant information. Second, to preserve edge\ndetails, we incorporate an Edge Enhancement Module that effectively retains and\nintegrates boundary information to refine segmentation results. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MGFI-Net not only outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in terms of segmentation accuracy but also achieves superior time\nefficiency, establishing it as a leading solution for real-time medical image\nsegmentation.",

    "abstract": "Hidden-variable theories effectively solve the measurement problem. However,\na serious issue of this route towards a realistic completion of quantum theory\nis raised by Bell's proof that the resulting theories are nonlocal. A possible\nresolution is to reject the assumption that measurements have single actual\noutcomes. Indeed, relaxing this premise, Deutsch and Hayden showed that Bell's\ntheorem can be evaded by delaying the buildup of the correlations until the\nparties compare their outcomes at a meeting point. However, the Deutsch-Hayden\ntheory, which is deterministic and psi-ontic, leads to an infinite information\nflow towards the meeting point. Furthermore, alternative branches are weighted\nby amplitudes, leading to interpretative issues. In this paper, we introduce a\ngeneral framework that combines the randomness of single-world theories with\nthe coexistence of diverse instances, as found in many-worlds theory. This\nframework incorporates the existing theories as limiting cases. We explore how\nthis hybrid approach addresses key challenges of single-world and\nDeutsch-Hayden theories. On one hand, the multiplicity of coexisting instances\nallows us to circumvent nonlocality and, possibly, contextuality. On the other\nhand, randomness makes it possible to derive quantum probabilities from\nunweighted counts of instances and ensemble averages. Furthermore, it can lead\nto a reduction of the information flow. We illustrate this framework with a\nlocal model for two spatially separate maximally entangled qubits. The model\nrequires two unweighted instances and a finite information flow -- just one bit\nper measurement is communicated to the meeting point. Setting aside its\nfoundational motivations, this framework has also relevance in quantum\ncommunication complexity and leads to novel technical questions, potentially\nproviding new insights into some peculiarities of entanglement.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel hybrid model that integrates long-short-term\nmemory (LSTM) networks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to significantly\nenhance the accuracy of stock market predictions. The LSTM component adeptly\ncaptures temporal patterns in stock price data, effectively modeling the time\nseries dynamics of financial markets. Concurrently, the GNN component leverages\nPearson correlation and association analysis to model inter-stock relational\ndata, capturing complex nonlinear polyadic dependencies influencing stock\nprices. The model is trained and evaluated using an expanding window validation\napproach, enabling continuous learning from increasing amounts of data and\nadaptation to evolving market conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on\nhistorical stock data demonstrate that our hybrid LSTM-GNN model achieves a\nmean square error (MSE) of 0.00144, representing a substantial reduction of\n10.6% compared to the MSE of the standalone LSTM model of 0.00161.

A central aspect of this model is that it\nassigns nodes to random positions in a latent space, such that the probability\nof an interaction between each pair of individuals or nodes is determined by\ntheir distance in this latent space. A key feature of this model is that it\nallows one to visualize nuanced structures via the latent space representation.\nThe LPM can be further extended to the Latent Position Cluster Model (LPCM), to\naccommodate the clustering of nodes by assuming that the latent positions are\ndistributed following a finite mixture distribution. In this paper, we extend\nthe LPCM to accommodate missing network data and apply this to non-negative\ndiscrete weighted social networks. By treating missing data as ``unusual'' zero\ninteractions, we propose a combination of the LPCM with the zero-inflated\nPoisson distribution. Statistical inference is based on a novel partially\ncollapsed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, where a\nMixture-of-Finite-Mixtures (MFM) model is adopted to automatically determine\nthe number of clusters and optimal group partitioning. Our algorithm features a\ntruncated absorb-eject move, which is a novel adaptation of an idea commonly\nused in collapsed samplers, within the context of MFMs. Another aspect of our\nwork is that we illustrate our results on 3-dimensional latent spaces,\nmaintaining clear visualizations while achieving more flexibility than\n2-dimensional models.

For massive ellipticals, the SMBH mass\n($M_\\text{BH}$) strongly correlates with the central stellar velocity\ndispersion ($\\sigma_e$), via the $M_\\text{BH}-\\sigma_e$ relation. However, SMBH\nmass measurements have traditionally relied on central stellar dynamics in\nnearby galaxies ($z < 0.1$), limiting our ability to explore the SMBHs across\ncosmic time. In this work, we present a self-consistent analysis combining 2D\nstellar dynamics and lens modelling of the Cosmic Horseshoe gravitational lens\nsystem ($z = 0.44$), one of the most massive galaxies ever observed. Using\nintegral-field spectroscopic data from MUSE and high-resolution imaging from\nHST, we model the radial arc and stellar kinematics, constraining the galaxy's\ncentral mass distribution and SMBH mass. Bayesian model comparison yields a\n$5\\sigma$ detection of an ultramassive black hole (UMBH) with\n$\\log_{10}(M_\\text{BH}/M_{\\odot}) = 10.56^{+0.07}_{-0.08} \\pm\n(0.12)^\\text{sys}$, consistent across various systematic tests. Our findings\nplace the Cosmic Horseshoe $\\sim$$1.5\\sigma$ above the $M_\\text{BH}-\\sigma_e$\nrelation, supporting an emerging trend observed in BGCs and other massive\ngalaxies. This suggests a steeper $M_\\text{BH}-\\sigma_e$ relationship at the\nhighest masses, potentially driven by a different co-evolution of SMBHs and\ntheir host galaxies. Future surveys will uncover more radial arcs, enabling the\ndetection of SMBHs over a broader redshift and mass range.

    "abstract": "mRNA-based vaccines have become a major focus in the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe coding sequence as well as the Untranslated Regions (UTRs) of an mRNA can\nstrongly influence translation efficiency, stability, degradation, and other\nfactors that collectively determine a vaccine's effectiveness. However,\noptimizing mRNA sequences for those properties remains a complex challenge.\nExisting deep learning models often focus solely on coding region optimization,\noverlooking the UTRs. We present Helix-mRNA, a structured state-space-based and\nattention hybrid model to address these challenges. In addition to a first\npre-training, a second pre-training stage allows us to specialise the model\nwith high-quality data. We employ single nucleotide tokenization of mRNA\nsequences with codon separation, ensuring prior biological and structural\ninformation from the original mRNA sequence is not lost. Our model, Helix-mRNA,\noutperforms existing methods in analysing both UTRs and coding region\nproperties. It can process sequences 6x longer than current approaches while\nusing only 10% of the parameters of existing foundation models. Its predictive\ncapabilities extend to all mRNA regions. We open-source the model\n(https://github.com/helicalAI/helical) and model weights\n(https://huggingface.co/helical-ai/helix-mRNA).",

    "abstract": "A complex but important challenge in understanding quantum mechanical\nphenomena is the simulation of quantum many-body dynamics. Although quantum\ncomputers offer significant potential to accelerate these simulations, their\npractical application is currently limited by noise and restricted scalability.\nIn this work, we address these problems by proposing a hybrid ansatz combining\nthe strengths of quantum and classical computational methods. Using\nTrotterization, we evolve an initial state on the quantum computer according to\na simplified Hamiltonian, focusing on terms that are difficult to simulate\nclassically. A classical model then corrects the simulation by including the\nterms omitted in the quantum circuit. While the classical ansatz is optimized\nduring the time evolution, the quantum circuit has no variational parameters.\nDerivatives can thus be calculated purely classically, avoiding challenges\narising in the optimization of parameterized quantum circuits. We demonstrate\nthree applications of this hybrid method. First, our approach allows us to\navoid SWAP gates in the quantum circuit by restricting the quantum part of the\nansatz to hardware-efficient terms of the Hamiltonian. Second, we can mitigate\nerrors arising from the Trotterization of the time evolution unitary. Finally,\nwe can extend the system size while keeping the number of qubits on the quantum\ndevice constant by including additional degrees of freedom in the classical\nansatz.",

    "abstract": "Balancing user agency and system automation is essential for effective\nhuman-AI interactions. Fully automated systems can deliver efficiency but risk\nundermining usability and user autonomy, while purely manual tools are often\ninefficient and fail to enhance user capabilities. This dissertation addresses\nthe question: \"How can we balance user agency and system automation for\ninteractions with intelligent systems?\"\n  We present four main contributions. First, we develop a spherical\nelectromagnet that provides adjustable forces on an untethered tool, allowing\nhaptic feedback while preserving user agency. Second, we create an integrated\nsensing and actuation system that tracks a passive magnetic tool in 3D and\ndelivers haptic feedback without external tracking. Third, we propose an\noptimal control method for electromagnetic haptic guidance that balances user\ninput with system control, enabling users to adjust trajectories and speed.\nFinally, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning approach for adaptive\ninterfaces that learns interface adaptations without heuristics or real user\ndata. Our simulations and user studies show that shared control significantly\noutperforms naive strategies. By incorporating explicit or implicit models of\nhuman behavior into control strategies, intelligent systems can better account\nfor user agency. We demonstrate that the trade-off between agency and\nautomation is both an algorithmic challenge and an engineering concern, shaped\nby the design of physical devices and user interfaces.

We show that\nSTM-IETS can reveal the energy dispersion of magnons in ferromagnets and\ntriplons in valence bond crystals, but not that of spinons, the spin\nexcitations in Heisenberg spin-1/2 chains.

    "abstract": "In rank aggregation problems (RAP), the solution is usually a consensus\nranking that generalizes a set of input orderings. There are different variants\nthat differ not only in terms of the type of rankings that are used as input\nand output, but also in terms of the objective function employed to evaluate\nthe quality of the desired output ranking. In contrast, in some machine\nlearning tasks (e.g. subgroup discovery) or multimodal optimization tasks,\nattention is devoted to obtaining several models/results to account for the\ndiversity in the input data or across the search landscape. Thus, in this paper\nwe propose to provide, as the solution to an RAP, a set of rankings to better\nexplain the preferences expressed in the input orderings. We exemplify our\nproposal through the Optimal Bucket Order Problem (OBOP), an RAP which consists\nin finding a single consensus ranking (with ties) that generalizes a set of\ninput rankings codified as a precedence matrix. To address this, we introduce\nthe Optimal Set of Bucket Orders Problem (OSBOP), a generalization of the OBOP\nthat aims to produce not a single ranking as output but a set of consensus\nrankings. Experimental results are presented to illustrate this proposal,\nshowing how, by providing a set of consensus rankings, the fitness of the\nsolution significantly improves with respect to the one of the original OBOP,\nwithout losing comprehensibility.",

However, with\nadvancements in machine vision technology, automating rice classification and\nquality evaluation based on its cultivar and characteristics has become\nincreasingly feasible, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency.

It not only acquires latent action features across time scales, but\nalso considers local latent action details, enhancing the coherence and\nsensitiveness of latent action representations. Secondly, a visual-action\nsemantic aware module is proposed to adaptively capture semantic\nrepresentations related to object behavior, enhancing the richness and\naccurateness of action representations. By harnessing the collaborative efforts\nof these two modules,we can acquire rich behavior representations to generate\nhuman-like natural descriptions. Finally, this rich behavior representations\nand object representations are used to construct a temporal objects-action\ngraph, which is fed into the graph transformer to model the complex temporal\ndependencies between objects and actions. To avoid adding complexity in the\ninference phase, the behavioral knowledge of the objects will be distilled into\na simple network through knowledge distillation. The experimental results on\nMSVD and MSR-VTT datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nsignificant performance improvements across multiple metrics.",

While effective, engression can struggle with highly complex\ndistributions, such as those encountered in image data. In this work, we\npropose reverse Markov learning (RML), a framework that defines a general\nforward process transitioning from the target distribution to a known\ndistribution (e.g., Gaussian) and then learns a reverse Markov process using\nmultiple engression models. This reverse process reconstructs the target\ndistribution step by step. This framework accommodates general forward\nprocesses, allows for dimension reduction, and naturally discretizes the\ngenerative process. In the special case of diffusion-based forward processes,\nRML provides an efficient discretization strategy for both training and\ninference in diffusion models. We further introduce an alternating sampling\nscheme to enhance post-training performance. Our statistical analysis\nestablishes error bounds for RML and elucidates its advantages in estimation\nefficiency and flexibility in forward process design. Empirical results on\nsimulated and climate data corroborate the theoretical findings, demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of RML in capturing complex distributions.",

This paper\npresents an urban-focused DT that combines computational fluid dynamics\nsimulations with live meteorological data to analyze pollution dispersion.\nAddressing the health impacts of pollutants like particulate matter and\nnitrogen dioxide, the DT provides real-time updates on air quality, wind speed,\nand direction. Using OpenStreetMaps XML-based data, the model distinguishes\nbetween porous elements like trees and solid structures, enhancing urban flow\nanalysis. The framework employs the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) within the\nopen-source software OpenLB to simulate pollution transport. Nitrogen dioxide\nand particulate matter concentrations are estimated based on traffic and\nbuilding emissions, enabling hot-spot identification. The DT was used from\nNovember 7 to 23, 2024, with hourly updates, capturing pollution trends\ninfluenced by wind patterns. Results show that alternating east-west winds\nduring this period create a dynamic pollution distribution, identifying\ncritical residential exposure areas.

Unlike\nexisting DTs, which focus on structural monitoring or large-scale environmental\nfactors, this approach enables fine-grained, dynamic analyses of urban airflow\nand pollution dispersion.

Pre-stellar cores are the birthplaces of Sun-like stars and\nrepresent the initial conditions for the assembly of protoplanetary systems.\nDue to their short lifespans, they are rare. In recent efforts to increase the\nnumber of such sources identified in the Solar neighbourhood, we have selected\na sample of 40 starless cores from the publicly available core catalogs of the\nHerschel Gould Belt survey. In this work, we focus on one of the sources that\nstands out for its high central density: Corona Australis 151. Aims. We use\nmolecular lines that trace dense gas (n>=10^6 cm-3) to confirm the\nexceptionally high density of this object, to study its physical structure, and\nto understand its evolutionary stage. Methods. We detected the N2H+ 3-2 and 5-4\ntransitions, and the N2D+ 3-2, 4-3, and 6-5 lines with the APEX telescope. We\nuse the Herschel continuum data to infer a spherically symmetric model of the\ncore's density and temperature. This is used as input to perform\nnon-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to fit the observed five\nlines. Results. Our analysis confirms that this core is characterised by very\nhigh densities (a few x 10^7 cm-3 at the centre) and cold temperatures. We\ninfer a high deuteration level of N2D+/N2H+=0.50, indicative of an advanced\nevolutionary stage. In the large bandwidth covered by the APEX data, we detect\nseveral other deuterated species, including CHD2OH, D2CO, and ND3. We also\ndetect multiple sulphurated species that present broader lines with signs of\nhigh-velocity wings. Conclusions. The observation of high-velocity wings and\nthe fact that the linewidths of N2H+ and N2D+ become larger with increasing\nfrequency can be interpreted either as an indication of supersonic infall\nmotions developing in the central parts of a very evolved pre-stellar core or\nas the signature of outflows from a very low luminosity object (VeLLO).\n*SHORTENED*",

    "abstract": "Each year, the European Space Agency (ESA) organizes challenges for\nuniversity students, from BSc to PhD levels. The ESA Concurrent Engineering\nChallange 2024 was hosted by four Concurrent Design Facilites (CDF) across\nEurope: ESEC Galazia, ISAE SUPAERO, the University of Athens, and the\nUniversity of Portsmouth. A total of 102 students participated in the event.\nOver five days, students worked on a feasibility study for a space mission,\nsimulating ESA's design session at ESTEC, the ESA headquarters. Students were\ndivided into specializes groups based on their backgrounds, reflecting ESA's\nconcurrent engineering teams. This paper discusses the design of subsystems by\nstudents, their trade-off results, and the outcomes of the CDF study. It\nhighlights the effectiveness of concurrent engineering, which enabled rapid and\nefficient results even from non-esxpert teams. The future development roadmap\nand lessons learned are also presented. The students used CDP4-Comet software\nwithin the replicated ESA CDF, resulting in the PEDRO-V mission proposal:\nPlanetary Exploration Deployment and Research Operation - Venus. The teams\ncollaboratively defined the Concept of Operations, identified actors,\nworst-case scenarios, use cases, and activities. Their output included a list\nof requirements, a draft product breakdown structure, and key subsystems\ninformation. The concurrent engineering process led to continuous improvement\nand convergence of key parameters. This approach proved to be effective by\naligning different teams' solutions and comparing them to similar missions. The\nPEDRO-V mission feasibility was confirmed, demonstrating the potential of\nconcurrent engineering in accademic settings for space missions. (summarized\nwith AI)",

    "abstract": "Two kinetic exchange models are proposed to explore the dynamics of closed\neconomic markets characterized by random exchanges, saving propensities, and\ncollective transactions. Model I simulates a system where individual\ntransactions occur among agents with saving tendencies, along with collective\ntransactions between groups. Model II restricts individual transactions to\nagents within the same group, but allows for collective transactions between\ngroups. A three-step trading process--comprising intergroup transactions,\nintragroup redistribution, and individual exchanges--is developed to capture\nthe dual-layered market dynamics. The saving propensity is incorporated using\nthe Chakraborti-Chakrabarti model, applied to both individual and collective\ntransactions. Results reveal that collective transactions increase wealth\ninequality by concentrating wealth within groups, as indicated by higher Gini\ncoefficients and Kolkata indices. In contrast, individual transactions across\ngroups mitigate inequality through more uniform wealth redistribution. The\ninterplay between saving propensities and collective transactions governs\ndeviation degree and entropy, which display inverse trends. Higher saving\npropensities lead to deviations from the Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium, whereas\nspecific thresholds result in collective transaction dominance, producing\nnotable peaks or troughs in these metrics. These findings underscore the\ncritical influence of dual-layered market interactions on wealth distribution\nand economic dynamics.",

For pixel-wise\nregression tasks, specifically utilizing remote sensing data from satellite\nimagery in EO Foundation Models, confidence quantification is a critical\nchallenge. The focus of this research work is on developing a Foundation Model\nusing EO satellite data that computes and assigns a confidence metric alongside\nregression outputs to improve the reliability and interpretability of\npredictions generated by deep neural networks. To this end, we develop, train\nand evaluate the proposed Confidence-Aware Regression Estimation (CARE)\nFoundation Model. Our model CARE computes and assigns confidence to regression\nresults as downstream tasks of a Foundation Model for EO data, and performs a\nconfidence-aware self-corrective learning method for the low-confidence\nregions. We evaluate the model CARE, and experimental results on multi-spectral\ndata from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite constellation to estimate the\nbuilding density (i.e. monitoring urban growth), show that the proposed method\ncan be successfully applied to important regression problems in EO and remote\nsensing.

RAPTOR addresses recurrent TD and TSR issues, improving both\nprecision and structural predictions. For TD, we use DETR (trained on ICDAR\n2019) and TATR (trained on PubTables-1M and FinTabNet), while TSR only relies\non TATR. A Genetic Algorithm is incorporated to optimize RAPTOR's module\nparameters, using a private dataset of product tables to align with industrial\nneeds. We evaluate our method on two private datasets of product tables, the\npublic DOCILE dataset (which contains tables similar to our target product\ntables), and the ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2019 datasets.

    "abstract": "Since heterogeneity presents a fundamental challenge in graph federated\nlearning, many existing methods are proposed to deal with node feature\nheterogeneity and structure heterogeneity. However, they overlook the critical\nhomophily heterogeneity, which refers to the substantial variation in homophily\nlevels across graph data from different clients. The homophily level represents\nthe proportion of edges connecting nodes that belong to the same class. Due to\nadapting to their local homophily, local models capture inconsistent spectral\nproperties across different clients, significantly reducing the effectiveness\nof collaboration. Specifically, local models trained on graphs with high\nhomophily tend to capture low-frequency information, whereas local models\ntrained on graphs with low homophily tend to capture high-frequency\ninformation. To effectively deal with homophily heterophily, we introduce the\nspectral Graph Neural Network (GNN) and propose a novel Federated learning\nmethod by mining Graph Spectral Properties (FedGSP). On one hand, our proposed\nFedGSP enables clients to share generic spectral properties (i.e.,\nlow-frequency information), allowing all clients to benefit through\ncollaboration. On the other hand, inspired by our theoretical findings, our\nproposed FedGSP allows clients to complement non-generic spectral properties by\nacquiring the spectral properties they lack (i.e., high-frequency information),\nthereby obtaining additional information gain. Extensive experiments conducted\non six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets, across both\nnon-overlapping and overlapping settings, validate the superiority of our\nmethod over eleven state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our FedGSP outperforms\nthe second-best method by an average margin of 3.28% on all heterophilic\ndatasets.",

We propose a novel non-parametric approach that\ncomputes tight bounds on counterfactual transition probabilities across all\ncompatible causal models. Unlike previous methods that require solving\nprohibitively large optimisation problems (with variables that grow\nexponentially in the size of the MDP), our approach provides closed-form\nexpressions for these bounds, making computation highly efficient and scalable\nfor non-trivial MDPs. Once such an interval counterfactual MDP is constructed,\nour method identifies robust counterfactual policies that optimise the\nworst-case reward w.r.t. the uncertain interval MDP probabilities.

To\nmitigate these risks, we propose a Secure Federated Data Distillation (SFDD)\nframework to decentralize the distillation process while preserving privacy.\nUnlike existing Federated Distillation techniques that focus on training global\nmodels with distilled knowledge, our approach aims to produce a distilled\ndataset without exposing local contributions. We leverage the\ngradient-matching-based distillation method, adapting it for a distributed\nsetting where clients contribute to the distillation process without sharing\nraw data. The central aggregator iteratively refines a synthetic dataset by\nintegrating client-side updates while ensuring data confidentiality. To make\nour approach resilient to inference attacks perpetrated by the server that\ncould exploit gradient updates to reconstruct private data, we create an\noptimized Local Differential Privacy approach, called LDPO-RLD.

While pre-trained foundation\nmodels have made impressive strides in the fields of natural language\nprocessing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), their development in time series\ndomains has been constrained by data sparsity. A series of recent studies have\ndemonstrated that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern\nrecognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However,\nthe current literature have yet striked a high-quality balance between (a)\neffectively aligning the time series and natural language modalities, and (b)\nkeeping the inference efficiency. To address the above issues, we now propose\nthe Time-LlaMA framework. Time-LlaMA first converts the time series input into\ntoken embeddings through a linear tokenization mechanism. Second, the time\nseries token embeddings are aligned with the text prompts. Third, to further\nadapt the LLM backbone for time series modeling, we have developed a dynamic\nlow-rank adaptation technique (D-LoRA). D-LoRA dynamically chooses the most\nsuitable LoRA modules at each layer of the Transformer backbone for each time\nseries input, enhancing the model's predictive capabilities. Our experimental\nresults on an extensive collection of challenging real-world time series tasks\nconfirm that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Alpha clustering is an important dynamic in nuclear physics, with growing\ninterest to its study in heavy nuclei in recent years. Theoretically, the\nmicroscopic cluster models taking nucleons as relevant degrees of freedom have\nbeen widely used to study $\\alpha$-cluster structures in light nuclei. However,\na straightforward application on same footing in heavy nuclei is obstructed by\nthe complexity of handling numerous nucleons. As a simplified alternative, the\nmacroscopic cluster models built upon cluster degrees of freedom are usually\nemployed in heavy nuclei, though these approaches typically lose several\ncritical structural details. In this work, we propose to study the\n$\\alpha$-cluster structures within the framework of valence-space microscopic\ncluster model (VS-MCM), which is a hybrid between microscopic and macroscopic\ncluster models and inherits features from both models, making it capable to\ninvestigate the $\\alpha$-cluster structures in heavy nuclei from a relatively\nmicroscopic viewpoint. In VS-MCM, the valence $\\alpha$ clusters are described\nby antisymmetrized microscopic wave functions, with single-particle orbits in\ncore nuclei removed systematically from the model space via the Pauli\nprojection to simulate the antisymmetrization between $\\alpha$ clusters and\ndoubly magic cores. As a proof of principle, we apply the VS-MCM to study the\n$\\alpha$-cluster structures in ${}^{20}$Ne and ${}^{44}$Ti at first, with the\ntheoretical energy levels of the $K^{\\pi}=0_1^{\\pm}$ bands for ${}^{20}$Ne and\n${}^{44}$Ti showing reasonable agreement with experimental data. These\ncalculations lay the foundation for future applications of VS-MCM in general\ncluster structures across the nuclide chart, where more $\\alpha$ clusters and\nvalence nucleons can exist outside the heavy doubly magic core, opening new\navenues to study the $\\alpha$ and cluster decays in heavy nuclei\nmicroscopically.",

    "abstract": "Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is arguably the most prevalent benchmark\nfor trade execution as it provides an unbiased standard for comparing\nperformance across market participants. However, achieving VWAP is inherently\nchallenging due to its dependence on two dynamic factors, volumes and prices.\nTraditional approaches typically focus on forecasting the market's volume\ncurve, an assumption that may hold true under steady conditions but becomes\nsuboptimal in more volatile environments or markets such as cryptocurrency\nwhere prediction error margins are higher. In this study, I propose a deep\nlearning framework that directly optimizes the VWAP execution objective by\nbypassing the intermediate step of volume curve prediction. Leveraging\nautomatic differentiation and custom loss functions, my method calibrates order\nallocation to minimize VWAP slippage, thereby fully addressing the complexities\nof the execution problem. My results demonstrate that this direct optimization\napproach consistently achieves lower VWAP slippage compared to conventional\nmethods, even when utilizing a naive linear model presented in\narXiv:2410.21448. They validate the observation that strategies optimized for\nVWAP performance tend to diverge from accurate volume curve predictions and\nthus underscore the advantage of directly modeling the execution objective.\nThis research contributes a more efficient and robust framework for VWAP\nexecution in volatile markets, illustrating the potential of deep learning in\ncomplex financial systems where direct objective optimization is crucial.\nAlthough my empirical analysis focuses on cryptocurrency markets, the\nunderlying principles of the framework are readily applicable to other asset\nclasses such as equities.",

A potential driver of such coexistence is environmental fluctuations\nthat favor different species over time. How to include and treat such temporal\nvariability in existing consumer-resource models is still an open problem. In\nthis work, we study correlated temporal fluctuations in species' resource\nuptake rates -- i.e. metabolic strategies -- within a stochastic\nconsumer-resource framework. In a biologically relevant regime, we are able to\nfind analytically the species abundance distributions through the path integral\nformalism. Our results reveal that stochastic dynamic metabolic strategies\ninduce community structures that align more closely with empirical ecological\nobservations. Within this framework, ecological communities show a higher\ndiversity than expected under static competitive scenarios. We find that all\nspecies become extinct when the ratio of the number of species to the number of\nresources exceeds a critical threshold. Conversely, diversity peaks at\nintermediate values of the same ratio. Furthermore, when metabolic strategies\nof different species are different on average, maximal biodiversity is achieved\nfor intermediate values of the amplitude of fluctuations.

    "abstract": "We present TALKPLAY, a novel multimodal music recommendation system that\nreformulates recommendation as a token generation problem using large language\nmodels (LLMs). By leveraging the instruction-following and natural language\ngeneration capabilities of LLMs, our system effectively recommends music from\ndiverse user queries while generating contextually relevant responses. While\npretrained LLMs are primarily designed for text modality, TALKPLAY extends\ntheir scope through two key innovations: a multimodal music tokenizer that\nencodes audio features, lyrics, metadata, semantic tags, and playlist\nco-occurrence signals; and a vocabulary expansion mechanism that enables\nunified processing and generation of both linguistic and music-relevant tokens.\nBy integrating the recommendation system directly into the LLM architecture,\nTALKPLAY transforms conventional systems by: (1) unifying previous two-stage\nconversational recommendation systems (recommendation engines and dialogue\nmanagers) into a cohesive end-to-end system, (2) effectively utilizing long\nconversational context for recommendation while maintaining strong performance\nin extended multi-turn interactions, and (3) generating natural language\nresponses for seamless user interaction. Our qualitative and quantitative\nevaluation demonstrates that TALKPLAY significantly outperforms unimodal\napproaches based solely on text or listening history in both recommendation\nperformance and conversational naturalness.",

    "abstract": "Nanoscale silicate dust particles are the most abundant refractory component\nobserved in the interstellar medium and thought to play a key role in\ncatalysing the formation of complex organic molecules in the star forming\nregions of space. We present a method to synthesise a laboratory analogue of\nnanoscale silicate dust particles on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)\nsubstrates by co-deposition of the atomic constituents. The resulting\nnanoparticulate films are sufficiently thin and conducting to allow for surface\nscience investigations, and are characterised here, in situ under UHV, using\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption atomic fine\nspectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy, and, ex situ, using scanning\nelectron microscopy. We compare SiO$_{x}$ film growth with and without the use\nof atomic O beams during synthesis and conclude that exposure of the sample to\natomic O leads to homogeneous films of interconnected nanoparticle networks.\nThe networks covers the graphite substrate and demonstrate superior thermal\nstability, up to 1073 K, when compared to oxides produced without exposure to\natomic O. In addition, control over the flux of atomic O during growth allows\nfor control of the average oxidation state of the film produced. Photoelectron\nspectroscopy measurements demonstrate that fully oxidised films have an\nSiO$_{2}$ stoichiometry very close to bulk SiO$_{2}$ and scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy images show the basic cluster building unit to have a radius of\napproximately 2.5 nm. The synthesis of SiO$_{x}$ films with adjustable\nstoichiometry and suitable for surface science experiments that require\nconducting substrates will be of great interest to the astrochemistry\ncommunity, and will allow for nanoscale-investigation of the chemical processes\nthought to be catalysed at the surface of dust grains in space.",

In\nthis paper, we present the design and real-world implementation of a\nDMA-assisted wireless communication platform operating in the license-free 60\nGHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) band.

A proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates\nhigh-definition quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulated video\ntransmission at 62 GHz. Furthermore, leveraging the DMA's multi-beam\ncapability, we simultaneously transmit video to two spatially separated\nreceivers, achieving accurate demodulation. We envision the proposed mmWave\ntestbed as a platform for enabling the seamless integration of sensing and\ncommunication by allowing video transmission to be replaced with sensing data\nor utilizing an auxiliary wireless channel to transmit sensing information to\nmultiple receivers. This synergy paves the way for advancing integrated sensing\nand communication (ISAC) in beyond-5G and 6G networks.

In contrast, real-world clinical data\noften involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and\nstem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper,\nwe introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture\nincorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer\narchitecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image\nclassification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce\ncomputational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT.\nAdditionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we\npropose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the\nefficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global\ncontext and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and\naddressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is\nintroduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception\nblocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature\nperceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image\nclassification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate\nthat MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments\nwith reduced computational complexity.

To mitigate the gap, we introduce Repo2Run, the first\nLLM-based agent aiming at automating the building of executable test\nenvironments for any repositories at scale. Specifically, given a code\nrepository, Repo2Run iteratively builds the Docker image, runs unit tests based\non the feedback of the building, and synthesizes the Dockerfile until the\nentire pipeline is executed successfully. The resulting Dockerfile can then be\nused to create Docker container environments for running code and tests. We\ncreated a benchmark containing 420 Python repositories with unit tests for\nevaluation. The results illustrate that Repo2Run achieves an 86.0% success\nrate, outperforming SWE-agent by 77.0%. The resources of Repo2Run are available\nat https://github.com/bytedance/Repo2Run.",

We obtain\nsignificantly low lattice thermal conductivity values ranging 0.9-0.5 W\nm$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at 300~K, challenging established thermoelectric materials\nsuch as SnSe, PbTe, Bi$_2$Te$_3$ as well as other Zintl phases. We trace such\nastonishingly low values to lattice anharmonicity, large phonon scattering\nphase space, low phonon velocities, and lifetimes. In K-based materials, the\nlow phonon velocities are further linked to flattened phonon modes arising from\nthe gap in the optical spectrum. Furthermore, the existence of bonding\nheterogeneity could hamper heat conduction in these materials. In addition, an\navoided crossing in the phonon dispersions suggesting rattling behavior,\nobserved in all materials except Na$_2$AgSb, suppresses the dispersion of\nacoustic modes, further reducing the phonon velocities. When combined with\nelectrical transport calculations, the materials exhibit high figure of merit\nvalues at 700~K, i.e., $ZT\\sim2.1$ for Na$_2$AgSb, $1.7$ for Na$_2$AgBi, $0.9$\nfor K$_2$AgSb, and $1.0$ for K$_2$AgBi. Our predicted $ZT$ values are\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials such as\nMg$_3$Sb$_2$, ZrCoBi, PbTe, SnSe, and as well as with contemporary Zintl\nphases.

Situational\nAwareness (SA) is vital for enabling HRT, to support navigation, planning, and\ndecision-making. This paper explores issues of higher-level ``semantic''\ninformation and understanding in SA. In semi-autonomous, or variable-autonomy\nparadigms, different types of semantic information may be important, in\ndifferent ways, for both the human operator and an autonomous agent controlling\nthe robot. We propose a generalizable framework for acquiring and combining\nmultiple modalities of semantic-level SA during remote deployments of mobile\nrobots. We demonstrate the framework with an example application of search and\nrescue (SAR) in disaster response robotics. We propose a set of ``environment\nsemantic indicators\" that can reflect a variety of different types of semantic\ninformation, e.g. indicators of risk, or signs of human activity, as the robot\nencounters different scenes. Based on these indicators, we propose a metric to\ndescribe the overall situation of the environment called ``Situational Semantic\nRichness (SSR)\". This metric combines multiple semantic indicators to summarise\nthe overall situation. The SSR indicates if an information-rich and complex\nsituation has been encountered, which may require advanced reasoning for robots\nand humans and hence the attention of the expert human operator. The framework\nis tested on a Jackal robot in a mock-up disaster response environment.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic indicators are\nsensitive to changes in different modalities of semantic information in\ndifferent scenes, and the SSR metric reflects overall semantic changes in the\nsituations encountered.",

When\ncombined with explicit time integration, poorly cut elements with little\nsupport in the physical domain lead to a severely reduced critical time step\nsize, posing a major challenge for immersed wave propagation simulations. The\nfinite cell method stabilizes cut elements by defining the weak form of the\nproblem also in the fictitious domain, but scaled by a small value $\\alpha$.\nThis paper investigates the effect of the finite cell method on the critical\ntime step size for explicit time integration. Starting with an analytical\none-degree-of-freedom model, we systematically study the influence of\n$\\alpha$-stabilization on the maximum eigenvalue, and thus on the critical time\nstep size, for corner and sliver cuts. The analysis is complemented by a\nnumerical study of an example with one element and increasing polynomial\ndegree, confirming that the critical time step size does not decrease below a\ncertain limit, even as the cut fraction tends to zero. This lower bound is\ncontrolled by the choice of $\\alpha$. In higher dimensions, sliver cuts are\nfound to be more detrimental than corner cuts, thus determining the minimum\ncritical time step size. Increasing the polynomial degree has only little\neffect on this degradation. Based on these observations, we derive an estimate\nof the minimum critical time step size as a function of $\\alpha$, which we use\nto propose a modified CFL condition for the finite cell method.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the induced divergence, a new quantum divergence\nmeasure that replaces the hypothesis testing divergence in position-based\ndecoding, simplifying the analysis of quantum communication and state\nredistribution while yielding tighter achievability bounds. Derived from a\nparent quantum relative entropy, it retains key properties such as data\nprocessing inequality and L\\\"owner monotonicity. Like the hypothesis testing\ndivergence, it depends on a smoothing parameter and interpolates between the\nparent relative entropy (as the smoothing parameter approaches one) and the\nmin-relative entropy (as it approaches zero), the latter holding when applied\nto the sandwiched R\\'enyi relative entropy of order $\\alpha\\in[0,2]$. This\nframework refines the position-based decoding lemma, extending its\napplicability to a broader class of states and improving decoding success\nprobabilities. Two key applications are considered: classical communication\nover quantum channels, where the induced divergence improves lower bounds on\nthe distillable communication rate, and quantum state redistribution, where it\nleads to sharper bounds on communication costs. These results provide new\ninsights into fundamental single-shot quantum information protocols and enhance\nexisting analytical techniques.",

A case study for Belgium demonstrates that a lack of electrofuel\nimports in 2050 is the main dealbreaker, while accelerating the deployment of\nrenewables is the most robust policy.

    "abstract": "Cognitive aerial-terrestrial networks (CATNs) offer a solution to spectrum\nscarcity by sharing spectrum between aerial and terrestrial networks. However,\naerial users (AUs) experience significant interference from numerous\nterrestrial base stations (BSs). To alleviate such interference, we investigate\na user association and coordinated beamforming (CBF) problem in CATN, where the\naerial network serves as the primary network sharing its spectrum with the\nterrestrial network. Specifically, we maximize the sum rate of the secondary\nterrestrial users (TUs) under the interference temperature constraints of the\nAUs. Traditional iterative optimization schemes are impractical due to their\nhigh computational complexity and information exchange overhead. Although deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) based schemes can address these challenges, their\nperformance is sensitive to the weights of the weighted penalty terms for\nviolating constraints in the reward function. Motivated by these issues, we\npropose a safe DRL-based user association and CBF scheme for CATN, eliminating\nthe need for training multiple times to find the optimal penalty weight before\nactual deployment. Specifically, the CATN is modeled as a networked constrained\npartially observable Markov game. Each TU acts as an agent to choose its\nassociated BS, and each BS acts as an agent to decide its beamforming vectors,\naiming to maximize the reward while satisfying the safety constraints\nintroduced by the interference constraints of the AUs. By exploiting a safe DRL\nalgorithm, the proposed scheme incurs lower deployment expenses than the\npenalty-based DRL schemes since only one training is required before actual\ndeployment. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a\nhigher sum rate of TUs than a two-stage optimization scheme while the average\nreceived interference power of the AUs is generally below the threshold.",

Then, we focus on the\npolarization relations fulfilled by the eigenmodes and their corresponding\nratios of magnetic to kinetic energies, and we study their dependence on the\nrelations between the oscillation, collision and cyclotron frequencies. For low\nwave frequencies, the two components of the plasma are strongly coupled, the\ndamping due to the charge-neutral interaction is weak and the effect of Hall's\nterm is negligible. However, as the wave frequency increases, phase shifts\nbetween the velocity of charges, the velocity of neutrals, and the magnetic\nfield appear, leading to enhanced damping. The effect of collisions on the\npropagation of waves strongly depends on their polarization state, with the\nleft-handed circularly polarized ion-cyclotron modes being more efficiently\ndamped than the linearly polarized Alfv\\'en waves and the right-handed\ncircularly polarized whistler modes. Moreover, the equipartition relation\nbetween the magnetic energy and the kinetic energy of Alfv\\'en waves does not\nhold in general when the collisional interaction and Hall's current are taken\ninto account, with the magnetic energy usually dominating over the kinetic\nenergy.

This\nproblem has created a recent surge in interest in self-supervised learning\nmethods that do not require GT. Although recent methods are now fast\napproaching \"oracle\" supervised performance, the lack of systematic comparison\nand standard experimental setups are hindering targeted methodological research\nand precluding widespread trustworthy industry adoption.

We evaluate 18 methods across\n4 realistic MRI scenarios on real data, showing a wide performance landscape\nwhose method ranking differs across scenarios and metrics, exposing the need\nfor further SSI research.

Delta-matroids generalize matroids by\nencapsulating structures such as non-maximum matchings in general graphs and\nvarious path-packing and topological configurations. Linear delta-matroids\n(represented by skew-symmetric matrices) offer significant expressive power and\nenable powerful algorithms. We investigate parameterized complexity aspects of\nproblems defined over linear delta-matroids or with delta-matroid constraints.\nOur analysis of basic intersection and packing problems reveals a different\ncomplexity landscape compared to the familiar matroid case. In particular,\nthere is a stark contrast between the cardinality parameter $k$ and the rank\nparameter $r$. For example, finding an intersection of size $k$ of three linear\ndelta-matroids is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $k$, while more general\nproblems (e.g., finding a set packing of size $k$ feasible in a linear\ndelta-matroid) are FPT when parameterized by $r$. We extend the recent\ndeterminantal sieving procedure of Eiben, Koana and Wahlstr\\\"om (SODA 2024) to\nsieve a polynomial for a monomial whose support is feasible in a linear\ndelta-matroid by $r$.\n  Second, we investigate a class of problems that remains FPT when\nparameterized by $k$, even on delta-matroids of unbounded rank. We begin with\nDelta-matroid Triangle Cover - finding a feasible set of size $k$ that can be\ncovered by a vertex-disjoint packing of triangles (sets of size 3) from a given\ncollection. This approach allows us to find a packing of $K_3$'s and $K_2$'s in\na graph with a maximum number of edges, parameterized above the matching\nnumber. As applications, we settle questions on the FPT status of Cluster\nSubgraph and Strong Triadic Closure parameterized above the matching number.",

Methods: A dataset of 72 patients who underwent coronary\ncomputed tomography angiography (CCTA) was analyzed, with 3D segmentation and\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations from a prior study. Centerlines\nof the main epicardial branches were automatically extracted, and lesions\nidentified using Gaussian kernel regression to estimate healthy branch caliber.\nPCAT features were computed per vessel following guideline recommendations and\nper lesion within a region extending radially for two vessel radii. Features\nlike fat volume and mean attenuation (FAI) were analyzed for their relationship\nwith CFD-derived hemodynamic biomarkers, such as fractional flow reserve (FFR)\nand wall shear stress (WSS). These features also informed a machine learning\n(ML) model for classifying potentially ischemic lesions. Results: PCAT\nexhibited, on average, higher attenuation in the presence of hemodynamically\nsignificant lesions (i.e., FFR < 0.80), although this difference was of limited\nstatistical significance. The ML classifier, trained on PCAT features,\nsuccessfully distinguished potentially ischemic lesions, yielding average\naccuracy of 0.84. Conclusion: PCAT attenuation is correlated with the\nfunctional status of coronary stenosis and can be used to inform ML models for\npredicting potential ischemia.

    "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of recorded human speech, spoken language\nunderstanding (SLU) is essential for its efficient processing. In order to\nprocess the speech, it is commonly transcribed using automatic speech\nrecognition technology. This speech-to-text transition introduces errors into\nthe transcripts, which subsequently propagate to downstream NLP tasks, such as\ndialogue summarization. While it is known that transcript noise affects\ndownstream tasks, a systematic approach to analyzing its effects across\ndifferent noise severities and types has not been addressed. We propose a\nconfigurable framework for assessing task models in diverse noisy settings, and\nfor examining the impact of transcript-cleaning techniques. The framework\nfacilitates the investigation of task model behavior, which can in turn support\nthe development of effective SLU solutions. We exemplify the utility of our\nframework on three SLU tasks and four task models, offering insights regarding\nthe effect of transcript noise on tasks in general and models in particular.\nFor instance, we find that task models can tolerate a certain level of noise,\nand are affected differently by the types of errors in the transcript.",

These services heavily rely on map-based traffic information to\nreduce uncertainties in recognizing lane shapes, traffic light locations, and\ntraffic signs. Achieving this level of reliance on map information requires\ncentimeter-level localization accuracy, which is currently only achievable with\nLiDAR sensors. However, LiDAR is known to be vulnerable to spoofing attacks\nthat emit malicious lasers against LiDAR to overwrite its measurements. Once\nlocalization is compromised, the attack could lead the victim off roads or make\nthem ignore traffic lights. Motivated by these serious safety implications, we\ndesign SLAMSpoof, the first practical LiDAR spoofing attack on localization\nsystems for self-driving to assess the actual attack significance on autonomous\nvehicles. SLAMSpoof can effectively find the effective attack location based on\nour scan matching vulnerability score (SMVS), a point-wise metric representing\nthe potential vulnerability to spoofing attacks. To evaluate the effectiveness\nof the attack, we conduct real-world experiments on ground vehicles and confirm\nits high capability in real-world scenarios, inducing position errors of\n$\\geq$4.2 meters (more than typical lane width) for all 3 popular LiDAR-based\nlocalization algorithms.

However, these methods suffer from key\nlimitations, including reliance on labeled concept datasets and significant\narchitectural modifications that challenges re-integration into existing system\npipelines. In this work, we introduce a new methodology for incorporating\ninterpretability and intervenability into an existing model by integrating\nConcept Layers (CLs) into its architecture. Our approach projects the model's\ninternal vector representations into a conceptual, explainable vector space\nbefore reconstructing and feeding them back into the model. Furthermore, we\neliminate the need for a human-selected concept set by algorithmically\nsearching an ontology for a set of concepts that can be either task-specific or\ntask-agnostic. We evaluate CLs across multiple tasks, demonstrating that they\nmaintain the original model's performance and agreement while enabling\nmeaningful interventions. Additionally, we present a proof of concept\nshowcasing an intervenability interface, allowing users to adjust model\nbehavior dynamically, such as mitigating biases during inference.",

Subsequent advances have focused on\nimproving the efficiency of quantum linear solvers and extending their core\ntechniques to address various challenges, such as least-squares data fitting.\nIn this article, we introduce a new quantum algorithm for solving linear\nsystems based on the gradient descent method. Inspired by the vector/density\nstate formalism, we represent a point, or vector, as a density state-like\nentity, enabling us to leverage recent advancements in quantum algorithmic\nframeworks, such as block encoding, to directly manipulate operators and carry\nout the gradient descent method in a quantum setting. The operator\ncorresponding to the intermediate solution is updated iteratively, with a\nprovable guarantee of convergence.

In cuprate high-$T_c$\nsuperconductors, no equivalent $\\lambda$ has yet been identified, despite the\nfact that at high doping, $\\alpha$ - the low-$T$ $T$-linear coefficient of\n$\\rho(T)$ - also scales with $T_c$. Here, we use dc resistivity and high-field\nmagnetoresistance to extract $\\tau^{-1}$ in electron-doped\nLa$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ (LCCO) as a function of $x$ from optimal doping to\nbeyond the superconducting dome. A highly anisotropic inelastic component to\n$\\tau^{-1}$ is revealed whose magnitude diminishes markedly across the doping\nseries. Using known Fermi surface parameters and subsequent modelling of the\nHall coefficient, we demonstrate that the form of $\\tau^{-1}$ in LCCO is\nconsistent with scattering off commensurate antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations\nof variable strength $\\lambda_{\\rm sf}$. The clear correlation between\n$\\alpha$, $\\lambda_{\\rm sf}$ and $T_c$ then identifies low-energy\nspin-fluctuations as the primary pairing glue in electron-doped cuprates. The\ncontrasting magnetotransport behaviour in hole-doped cuprates suggests that the\nhigher $T_c$ in the latter cannot be attributed solely to an increase in\n$\\lambda_{\\rm sf}$. Indeed, the success in modelling LCCO serves to reinforces\nthe notion that resolving the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in\nhole-doped cuprates may require more than a simple extension of BCS theory.",

This allows precise derivations of the molecular\nabundances, which in turn informs our understanding of vertical transport in\nthese atmospheres and can provide clues about the formation of cold brown\ndwarfs and exoplanets. This study presents the first JWST/MRS mid-IR spectrum\n(R ~ 1500-3000) of a T-dwarf: the T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary WISE\nJ045853.90+643451.9. We fit the spectrum using a parameterized P-T profile and\nfree molecular abundances (i.e., a retrieval analysis), treating the binary as\nunresolved. We find a good fit with a cloud-free atmosphere and identify H2O,\nCH4 and NH3 features. Moreover, we make the first detections of HCN and C2H2\n(at 13.4$\\sigma$ and 9.5$\\sigma$ respectively) in any brown dwarf atmosphere.\nThe detection of HCN suggests intense vertical mixing\n($K_{zz}\\sim10^{11}$cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), challenging previous literature\nderivations of $K_{zz}$ values for T-type brown dwarfs. Even more surprising is\nthe C2H2 detection, which cannot be explained with existing atmospheric models\nfor isolated objects. This result challenges model assumptions about vertical\nmixing, and/or our understanding of the C2H2 chemical network, or might hint\ntowards a more complex atmospheric processes such as magnetic fields driving\naurorae, or lightning driving ionization. These findings open a new frontier in\nstudying carbon chemistry within brown dwarf atmospheres.",

Recent encoding models using deep neural networks (DNNs) have\nsuccessfully predicted voxel-wise activity. However, interpreting the\nproperties that explain voxel responses remains challenging because of the\nblack-box nature of DNNs. As a solution, we propose LLM-assisted Visual Cortex\nCaptioning (LaVCa), a data-driven approach that uses large language models\n(LLMs) to generate natural-language captions for images to which voxels are\nselective. By applying LaVCa for image-evoked brain activity, we demonstrate\nthat LaVCa generates captions that describe voxel selectivity more accurately\nthan the previously proposed method. Furthermore, the captions generated by\nLaVCa quantitatively capture more detailed properties than the existing method\nat both the inter-voxel and intra-voxel levels. Furthermore, a more detailed\nanalysis of the voxel-specific properties generated by LaVCa reveals\nfine-grained functional differentiation within regions of interest (ROIs) in\nthe visual cortex and voxels that simultaneously represent multiple distinct\nconcepts. These findings offer profound insights into human visual\nrepresentations by assigning detailed captions throughout the visual cortex\nwhile highlighting the potential of LLM-based methods in understanding brain\nrepresentations.

The primary\nobjective of ALICE is to investigate the properties of quark-gluon plasma\n(QGP), a state of matter where quarks and gluons are deconfined under extreme\nconditions of temperature and energy density. One of the key observables for\nstudying QGP is the production of hadrons carrying heavy quarks in Pb-Pb\ncollisions. To detect heavy quarks via their muonic decays, ALICE is equipped\nwith a forward muon spectrometer (MS). During LHC Run 1 and Run 2, a dedicated\nmuon trigger system based on Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) was used for muon\nphysics events selection. In preparation for Run 3, ALICE underwent a major\nupgrade, transitioning to a continuous readout (triggerless) mode to cope with\nhigher interaction rates. As a result, the muon trigger system was replaced by\nthe Muon Identifier (MID). In order to prevent ageing effects and to improve\nthe RPC rate capability, the RPCs are now operated with lower gain by reducing\nthe operating voltage while maintaining the same gas mixture. The front-end and\nreadout electronics were also upgraded to support low-gain operation and\ntriggerless readout. This paper presents an assessment of the stability and\nperformance of the MID RPCs during the first two and a half years of Run 3 at\nunprecedented collision energies.",

The underlying atomic-level mechanisms can be\nsuccinctly summarized as energy-favorable stacking sequences facilitating\nout-of-plane phonon energy transmission. This work demonstrates that MLP-driven\nMD simulations can serve as a new paradigm for probing and understanding\nthermal transport mechanisms in 2D heterostructures and other layered\nmaterials.",

A double-well potential is well chosen and the related\nnonlinearity governing the evolution is assumed to satisfy a suitable growth\ncondition. The viscous variant of the Cahn--Hilliard system is also considered\nalong with the inertial term. The existence of a global solution is proved via\nthe analysis of some approximate problems with Yosida regularizations, and the\nuse of the Cauchy--Lipschitz--Picard theorem in an abstract setting.

Their computation relies on\ncomputational simulations, and hence a simple prediction without such\nsimulation is envisioned. We present a framework, where a data-driven model is\ndeveloped using the dataset of Yang et al. 2023 \\cite{yang_2023} with $93$ high\nfidelity direct numerical simulations of a fully-developed turbulent channel\nflow at $Re_\\tau \\approx 800$ and $Pr = 0.71$. The model provides robust\npredictive capabilities (mean squared error $\\text{MSE}_{k} = 0.09$ and\n$\\text{MSE}_\\theta = 0.096$), but lacks interpretability. Simplistic\nstatistical roughness parameters provide a more understandable route, so the\nframework is extended with a symbolic regression approach to distill an\nempirical correlation from the data-driven model. The derived expression leads\nto a predictive correlation for the equivalent sand-grain roughness $k_\\text{s}\n= k_\\text{99} (ES_x ( - ES_x + Sk + 2.37) + 0.772)$ with reasonable predictive\npowers. The predictive capability of the temperature roughness function is\nsubject to limitations due to the missing Prandtl-number variation in the\ndataset. Nevertheless, the interpretable correlation and the neural network as\nwell as the original dataset can be used to explore the roughness functions.\nThe functional form of the derived correlations, along with visual analysis of\nthese surfaces, suggests a strong relationship with roughness wavelengths,\nfurther linking them to explanations based on sheltered and windward regions.",

    "abstract": "Text embeddings are typically evaluated on a limited set of tasks, which are\nconstrained by language, domain, and task diversity. To address these\nlimitations and provide a more comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the\nMassive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) - a large-scale,\ncommunity-driven expansion of MTEB, covering over 500 quality-controlled\nevaluation tasks across 250+ languages. MMTEB includes a diverse set of\nchallenging, novel tasks such as instruction following, long-document\nretrieval, and code retrieval, representing the largest multilingual collection\nof evaluation tasks for embedding models to date. Using this collection, we\ndevelop several highly multilingual benchmarks, which we use to evaluate a\nrepresentative set of models. We find that while large language models (LLMs)\nwith billions of parameters can achieve state-of-the-art performance on certain\nlanguage subsets and task categories, the best-performing publicly available\nmodel is multilingual-e5-large-instruct with only 560 million parameters. To\nfacilitate accessibility and reduce computational cost, we introduce a novel\ndownsampling method based on inter-task correlation, ensuring a diverse\nselection while preserving relative model rankings. Furthermore, we optimize\ntasks such as retrieval by sampling hard negatives, creating smaller but\neffective splits. These optimizations allow us to introduce benchmarks that\ndrastically reduce computational demands. For instance, our newly introduced\nzero-shot English benchmark maintains a ranking order similar to the full-scale\nversion but at a fraction of the computational cost.",

We\nconsider both leading-order (LO) and higher-order approximations for the DIS\nentropy, incorporating the evolved gluon distribution function at the initial\nscale. The DIS entropy, influenced by purely gluonic emissions, varies with\nhigher-order corrections to the running coupling.

Non-transferable learning (NTL), a task aimed at reshaping the\ngeneralization abilities of deep learning models, was proposed to address these\nchallenges. While numerous methods have been proposed in this field, a\ncomprehensive review of existing progress and a thorough analysis of current\nlimitations remain lacking.

Furthermore, we\nemphasize the often-overlooked issue of robustness against various attacks that\ncan destroy the non-transferable mechanism established by NTL.

However,\nthese datasets raise privacy concerns and often reflect platform-specific\nproperties. For example, interactions between speakers may be limited due to\nrigid platform structures (e.g., threads, tree-like discussions), which yield\noverly simplistic interaction patterns (e.g., as a consequence of ``reply-to''\nlinks). This work explores the feasibility of generating diverse MPCs with\ninstruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing deterministic\nconstraints such as dialogue structure and participants' stance. We investigate\ntwo complementary strategies of leveraging LLMs in this context: (i.) LLMs as\nMPC generators, where we task the LLM to generate a whole MPC at once and (ii.)\nLLMs as MPC parties, where the LLM generates one turn of the conversation at a\ntime, provided the conversation history. We next introduce an analytical\nframework to evaluate compliance with the constraints, content quality, and\ninteraction complexity for both strategies. Finally, we assess the quality of\nobtained MPCs via human annotation and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. We find\nstark differences among LLMs, with only some being able to generate\nhigh-quality MPCs. We also find that turn-by-turn generation yields better\nconformance to constraints and higher linguistic variability than generating\nMPCs in one pass.

For LHC Run 4 (starting 2030), ALICE\nwill replace the three innermost cylindrical layers of its inner tracking\nsystem during Long Shutdown 3 (2026-2029).

These sensors can be bent, forming a truly cylindrical\nbarrel with an innermost radius of 19 mm and an average material budget of 0.09\nX/X0 per layer. ITS3 development involves cutting-edge R&D, including MAPS\nproduction in 65 nm CMOS, stitched wafer-scale fabrication, ultra-light\nmechanics, and a novel air cooling system. The 65 nm CMOS technology was\nvalidated using Multi-Layer Reticle 1 test structures. In mid-2023, the first\nstitched prototypes, MOnolithic Stitched Sensors (MOSS), were produced to\ndemonstrate stitching feasibility and assess wafer-scale sensor yield and\nperformance.

These layouts help evaluate yield variations based on\ndensity and spacing. This work presents results from MOSS characterization,\nincluding power domain impedance, DAC performance, pixel readout, threshold,\nand fake-hit rate scans.

Exploring a range of SN/AGN feedback\nstrengths and cosmologies ($\\Omega_{\\rm m}, \\sigma_8$), we find a U-shaped\nrelation between dark-to-stellar mass ratio and stellar mass, with a minimum at\nthe golden mass, in line with observations. Cosmology affects the normalization\nof this relation, while feedback shapes its form and the emergence of the\ngolden mass. Stronger SN feedback lowers its value; AGN feedback, especially\nradiative efficiency, alters the high-mass slope and shifts the golden mass.\nThe golden mass appears earlier with stronger feedback, which quenches star\nformation more rapidly. Passive galaxies retain the U-shape; star-forming ones\nshow decreasing dark matter fraction with stellar mass, with possible reversal\nat low redshift. Global stellar fractions also exhibit a U-shaped trend: in\npassive galaxies, the golden mass shifts to lower masses or vanishes; in\nstar-forming ones, it emerges only at low redshift. Feedback governs the golden\nmass up to $z \\sim 1.5-2$, with a secondary role from cold streams and virial\nshocks. We speculate that at $z \\gtrsim 1.5-2$, a single stream-regulated scale\ngoverns galaxy growth, which later bifurcates into two: a low-mass scale tied\nto gas richness and a higher-mass golden mass regulating efficiency and\nquenching.

Notably, LGGPT strikes a\nprominent balance between proficiency and efficiency with a compact 1.5B\nparameter LLM, which beats prior 7B or 175B models even in the most extensive\nand challenging unified scenario.

To alleviate the impractical constraints on\ncamera trajectories across training states, we propose a Mutual State\nRegularization mechanism to enhance the spatial density consistency of movable\nparts.

    "abstract": "Rare-earth compounds RCoSi exhibit unique properties, with distinct\nstructural behaviors depending on whether R is a light, middle or heavy\nrare-earth element. Among them, CeCoSi undergoes a structural phase transition\nunder high pressure, with the phase transition pressure increasing as\ntemperature rises. Some experimental studies suggest that the transition is\nclosely related to the behavior of Ce-4f electrons. In this work, we\nsystematically studied the evolution of the electronic structure of CeCoSi with\ntemperature and pressure. First, we used the DFT+DMFT to calculate the\nenergy-volume curve of CeCoSi, which was in good agreement with the\nexperimental results and far superior to the DFT method. Next, we studied the\nelectronic structure of CeCoSi under different pressures and temperatures using\nDFT+DMFT. Our results show that CeCoSi is a Kondo metal with hybridization of\nCe-4f and Co-3d. As pressure increases, the renormalization factor Z of\nCe-4f5/2 increases, the occupancy number of Ce-4f electrons decreases, and\nCeCoSi transitions to a mixed-valence state at ~5.5 GPa in 100 K. The pressure\nof the quantum phase transition PQ is slightly higher than the experimentally\nobserved structural phase transition pressure PS, and the PQ increases with\nincreasing temperature, which is consistent with the behavior of PS in\nexperiment. In addition, the hybridization strength of Ce-4f in the\nmixed-valence state is significantly greater than in the Kondo metal state. Our\nresults suggest that the valence instability of Ce-4f is the cause of the\nstructural phase transition. As pressure increases, Ce-4f electrons delocalize\nand CeCoSi transitions to mixed-valence state. This valence instability may\ncause redistribution of electron density, thus inducing a structural phase\ntransition. Our work reveals the cause of the structural phase transition of\nCeCoSi under high pressure.",

In particular, the anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior\nof excitation density, namely, larger excitation density at slower quench, is\nobserved at suitable model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that particle's\nonsite occupation can be used as a local measurable quantity to probe the\nbreakdown of adiabatic evolution. The difference of onsite occupation between\nthe time-evolved state and instantaneous ground state at the end of the quench\ncan successfully capture the key features of excitation density for both the\nHaldane and Kane-Mele models under periodic and more realistic open boundary\nconditions, thus facilitating the experimental characterization of the quench\ndynamics in these models.",

One promising approach\nfor test-time compute scaling is search against a process reward model, where a\nmodel generates multiple potential candidates at each step of the search, and\nthese partial trajectories are then scored by a separate reward model in order\nto guide the search process. The diversity of trajectories in the tree search\nprocess affects the accuracy of the search, since increasing diversity promotes\nmore exploration.

Previous search methods either do not perform\nsufficient exploration, or else explore diverse trajectories but have high\nlatency. We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS),\nwhich promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining\nnecessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost\nmodel to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained,\nwhile incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that\nwe retain trajectories which are semantically different.

Moreover, there is no one-to-one correspondence between\nsource and target samples. Although various SHDA methods have been developed to\ntackle this problem, the nature of the knowledge transferred across\nheterogeneous domains remains unclear. This paper delves into this question\nfrom an empirical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on about 330\nSHDA tasks, employing two supervised learning methods and seven representative\nSHDA methods. Surprisingly, our observations indicate that both the category\nand feature information of source samples do not significantly impact the\nperformance of the target domain. Additionally, noise drawn from simple\ndistributions, when used as source samples, may contain transferable knowledge.\nBased on this insight, we perform a series of experiments to uncover the\nunderlying principles of transferable knowledge in SHDA. Specifically, we\ndesign a unified Knowledge Transfer Framework (KTF) for SHDA. Based on the KTF,\nwe find that the transferable knowledge in SHDA primarily stems from the\ntransferability and discriminability of the source domain. Consequently,\nensuring those properties in source samples, regardless of their origin (e.g.,\nimage, text, noise), can enhance the effectiveness of knowledge transfer in\nSHDA tasks.

Drawing inspiration from this spike-based\ncomputation, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been developed to construct\nevent-driven models that emulate this efficiency. Despite these advances, deep\nSNNs continue to suffer from over-parameterization during training and\ninference, a stark contrast to the brain's ability to self-organize.\nFurthermore, existing sparse SNNs are challenged by maintaining optimal pruning\nlevels due to a static pruning ratio, resulting in either under- or\nover-pruning. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage dynamic structure\nlearning approach for deep SNNs, aimed at maintaining effective sparse training\nfrom scratch while optimizing compression efficiency. The first stage evaluates\nthe compressibility of existing sparse subnetworks within SNNs using the PQ\nindex, which facilitates an adaptive determination of the rewiring ratio for\nsynaptic connections based on data compression insights. In the second stage,\nthis rewiring ratio critically informs the dynamic synaptic connection rewiring\nprocess, including both pruning and regrowth. This approach significantly\nimproves the exploration of sparse structure training in deep SNNs, adapting\nsparsity dynamically from the point view of compression efficiency. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that this sparse training approach not only aligns with\nthe performance of current deep SNNs models but also significantly improves the\nefficiency of compressing sparse SNNs.

In contrast, graph\nrepresentation learning-based methods have gained wide attention for overcoming\nthis limitation by learning user representations to capture influence\ncharacteristics. However, existing studies are built on Euclidean space, which\nfails to effectively capture the latent hierarchical features of social\ninfluence distribution. As a result, users' influence spread cannot be\neffectively measured through the learned representations. To alleviate these\nlimitations, we propose HIM, a novel diffusion model agnostic method that\nleverages hyperbolic representation learning to estimate users' potential\ninfluence spread from social propagation data. HIM consists of two key\ncomponents. First, a hyperbolic influence representation module encodes\ninfluence spread patterns from network structure and historical influence\nactivations into expressive hyperbolic user representations. Hence, the\ninfluence magnitude of users can be reflected through the geometric properties\nof hyperbolic space, where highly influential users tend to cluster near the\nspace origin. Second, a novel adaptive seed selection module is developed to\nflexibly and effectively select seed users using the positional information of\nlearned user representations.

Interestingly, the best open generative\nmodel (Llama-3-70B-Instruct) reaches almost the same performance, at 87.7%\nF-score, demonstrating that open models are becoming a viable alternative for\nsome practical tasks even on non-English data. Additionally, we test a\nsupervised learning alternative, where we fine-tune a Finnish BERT model\n(FinBERT) using GPT-4 generated training data. By this method, we achieved an\nF-score of 84.1% already with 6K interviews up to an F-score of 86.3% with 30k\ninterviews. Such an approach would be particularly appealing in cases where the\ncomputational resources are limited, or there is a substantial mass of data to\nprocess.",

    "abstract": "The development of turbulent mixing layers can be altered by the application\nof anisotropic strain rates, potentially arising from radial motion in\nconvergent geometry or movement through non-uniform geometry. Previous closure\nmodels and calibrations of compressible turbulence models tend to focus on\nincompressible flows or isotropic strain cases, which is in contrast to many\nreal flow conditions. The treatment of bulk compression under anisotropic\nstrain is investigated using the K-L turbulence model, a two-equation\nReynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model that is commonly used for\nsimulating interfacial instabilities. One-dimensional simulations of\nshock-induced turbulent mixing layers under applied axial or transverse strain\nrates are performed using three different closures for the bulk compression of\nthe turbulent length scale. The default closure method using the mean isotropic\nstrain rate is able to reasonably predict the integral width and turbulent\nkinetic energy of the mixing layer under the applied strain rates. However, the\nK-L model's performance is improved with the transverse strain closure, while\nthe axial strain closure worsens the model. The effects of this new closure are\ninvestigated for the buoyancy-drag model, showing that a three-equation model\nwhich evolves the integral width and turbulent length scale separately is most\neffective for modelling anisotropic strain. Through the equivalence of\ntwo-equation RANS models, the modification of the bulk compression closure for\nthe turbulent length scale also suggests an alteration to the K-$\\epsilon$ and\nK-$\\omega$ models.",

As a result, without additional fine-tuning, their\nperformance significantly lags behind that of graph neural networks (GNNs) in\ngraph learning tasks. In this paper, we show that learning on graph data can be\nconceptualized as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process, where\nspecific instances (e.g., nodes or edges) act as queries, and the graph itself\nserves as the retrieved context. Building on this insight, we propose a series\nof RAG frameworks to enhance the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs for\ngraph learning tasks.

Most of the existing augmentation\nmethods overlook the context information inherited from the dataset as they\nrely solely on the graph structure for augmentation. Despite the success of\nsome large language model-based (LLM) graph learning methods, they are mostly\nwhite-box which require access to the weights or latent features from the\nopen-access LLMs, making them difficult to be democratized for everyone as\nexisting LLMs are mostly closed-source for commercial considerations.

To control the sparsity of the augmented graph, we further devise a\ngranularity-aware prompting strategy and an instruction fine-tuning module,\nwhich seamlessly generates text prompts according to different granularity\nlevels of the dataset.

Our method prompts the LLM\nto produce detailed reasoning steps for SQL queries and fine-tunes it on\nrationales that lead to correct outcomes. Unlike traditional methods, STaR-SQL\ndedicates additional test-time computation to reasoning, thereby positioning\nLLMs as spontaneous reasoners rather than mere prompt-based agents. To further\nscale the inference process, we incorporate an outcome-supervised reward model\n(ORM) as a verifier, which enhances SQL query accuracy.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the critical need for detecting bias in government\ndocuments, an underexplored area with significant implications for governance.\nExisting methodologies often overlook the unique context and far-reaching\nimpacts of governmental documents, potentially obscuring embedded biases that\nshape public policy and citizen-government interactions. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce the Dutch Government Data for Bias Detection (DGDB), a dataset\nsourced from the Dutch House of Representatives and annotated for bias by\nexperts. We fine-tune several BERT-based models on this dataset and compare\ntheir performance with that of generative language models. Additionally, we\nconduct a comprehensive error analysis that includes explanations of the\nmodels' predictions. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned models achieve\nstrong performance and significantly outperform generative language models,\nindicating the effectiveness of DGDB for bias detection. This work underscores\nthe importance of labeled datasets for bias detection in various languages and\ncontributes to more equitable governance practices.",

The C-type antiferromagnetic order emerges from the interplay\nbetween intralayer antiferromagnetism and interlayer ferromagnetism. The\nsystem's topological properties are characterized by the spin Chern number. We\npresent the topological phase diagram of the bilayer honeycomb lattice,\nproviding a detailed insight into the stability and tunability of the quantum\nspin Hall effect in this system. The presence of helical edge states is\nconfirmed by the measurement of quantized longitudinal resistance values of\n3/2(h/e2) and 1/2(h/e2) in a sixterminal Hall-bar device. Remarkably, this\nquantum spin Hall insulator phase is protected by interlayer parity-time (PT)\nsymmetry, despite the breaking of time-reversal symmetry.",

To bridge this gap, we conduct a\nbottom-up decomposition of LCTG sub-abilities with human patterns as reference\nand perform a detailed error analysis. On this basis, we propose MarkerGen, a\nsimple-yet-effective plug-and-play approach that:(1) mitigates LLM fundamental\ndeficiencies via external tool integration;(2) conducts explicit length\nmodeling with dynamically inserted markers;(3) employs a three-stage generation\nscheme to better align length constraints while maintaining content quality.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that MarkerGen significantly improves\nLCTG across various settings, exhibiting outstanding effectiveness and\ngeneralizability.",

Under the guidance of environmental jurisprudence,\nenterprises are responsible for setting up practical legal fulfillment routes\nfor their environmental compliance-related rights and obligations.

Existing solutions first\nproposed the sliding-window approach to accumulate a set of historical\n\\textbf{key-value} (KV) pairs for reuse, then further improvements selectively\nretain its subsets at each step. However, due to the sparse attention\ndistribution across a long context, it is hard to identify and recall relevant\nKV pairs, as the attention is distracted by massive candidate pairs.\nAdditionally, we found it promising to select representative tokens as\nprobe-Query in each sliding window to effectively represent the entire context,\nwhich is an approach overlooked by existing methods. Thus, we propose\n\\textbf{ActQKV}, a training-free, \\textbf{Act}ivation-aware approach that\ndynamically determines probe-\\textbf{Q}uery and leverages it to retrieve the\nrelevant \\textbf{KV} pairs for inference. Specifically, ActQKV monitors a\ntoken-level indicator, Activation Bias, within each context window, enabling\nthe proper construction of probe-Query for retrieval at pre-filling stage. To\naccurately recall the relevant KV pairs and minimize the irrelevant ones, we\ndesign a dynamic KV cut-off mechanism guided by information density across\nlayers at the decoding stage.

Employing a one-channel K-matrix approach for the description\nof the dynamics of the $K^0_S K^0_S$ system, the data sample is well described\nwith four poles for the $f_0$-wave and three poles for the $f_2$-wave. The\ndetermined pole positions are consistent with those of well-established\nresonance states. The observed $f_0$ and $f_{2}$ states are found to be in\nagreement with those produced in radiative $J/\\psi$ decays. The production\nbehaviors of $f_0$ and $f_2$ poles in $\\psi(3686)\\to\\gamma K_S^0 K_S^0$ are\nqualified with their residues and the converted branching fractions.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs) often suffer from the feedback loop phenomenon,\ne.g., RSs are trained on data biased by their recommendations. This leads to\nthe filter bubble effect that reinforces homogeneous content and reduces user\nsatisfaction. To this end, serendipity recommendations, which offer unexpected\nyet relevant items, are proposed. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have\nshown potential in serendipity prediction due to their extensive world\nknowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, they still face challenges in\naligning serendipity judgments with human assessments, handling long user\nbehavior sequences, and meeting the latency requirements of industrial RSs. To\naddress these issues, we propose SERAL (Serendipity Recommendations with\nAligned Large Language Models), a framework comprising three stages: (1)\nCognition Profile Generation to compress user behavior into multi-level\nprofiles; (2) SerenGPT Alignment to align serendipity judgments with human\npreferences using enriched training data; and (3) Nearline Adaptation to\nintegrate SerenGPT into industrial RSs pipelines efficiently. Online\nexperiments demonstrate that SERAL improves exposure ratio (PVR), clicks, and\ntransactions of serendipitous items by 5.7%, 29.56%, and 27.6%, enhancing user\nexperience without much impact on overall revenue. Now, it has been fully\ndeployed in the \"Guess What You Like\" of the Taobao App homepage.",

    "abstract": "Designing materials with controlled photovoltaic response may lead to\nimproved solar cells or photosensors. In this regard, ferroelectric\nsuperlattices have emerged as a rich platform to engineer functional\nproperties. In addition, ferroelectrics are naturally endowed with a bulk\nphotovoltaic response stemming from non-thermalized photoexcited carriers,\nwhich can overcome the fundamental limits of current solar cells. Yet, their\nphotovoltaic output has been limited by poor optical absorption and poor charge\ncollection or photo-excited carrier mean free path. We use Density Functional\nTheory and Wannierization to compute the so-called Bulk Photovoltaic shift\ncurrent and the optical properties of BiFeO3/LaFeO3 superlattices. We show\nthat, by stacking these two materials, not only the optical absorption is\nimproved at larger wavelengths (due to LaFeO3 smaller bandgap), but the\nphotovolgavanic shift current is also enhanced compared to that of pure BiFeO3\n, by suppressing the destructive interferences occurring between different\nwavelengths.",

We show theoretically and empirically that the numerical error of the\nquantile function is typically several orders of magnitude larger than the\nnumerical error of the cumulative distribution function for probabilities close\nto zero or one. We introduce the COS method for computing the quantile\nfunction. This method converges exponentially when the density is smooth and\nhas semi-heavy tails and all parameters necessary to tune the COS method are\ngiven explicitly. Finally, we numerically test our theoretical results on the\nnormal-inverse Gaussian and the tempered stable distributions.",

To prepare an arbitrary\n$N$-dimensional state exactly, existing state-preparation approaches generally\nrequire a runtime of $O(N)$, which will ruin the speedup of the HHL algorithm.\nHere we show that the states can be prepared approximately with a runtime of\n$O(poly(\\log N))$ by employing a slightly modified version of the HHL algorithm\nitself.

Low-Rank Adaption\n(LoRA) offers a cost-effective fine-tuning solution, freezing the original\nmodel parameters and training only lightweight, low-rank adapter matrices.\nHowever, the memory footprint of LoRA is largely dominated by the original\nmodel parameters. To mitigate this, we propose LoRAM, a memory-efficient LoRA\ntraining scheme founded on the intuition that many neurons in\nover-parameterized LLMs have low training utility but are essential for\ninference. LoRAM presents a unique twist: it trains on a pruned (small) model\nto obtain pruned low-rank matrices, which are then recovered and utilized with\nthe original (large) model for inference. Additionally, minimal-cost continual\npre-training, performed by the model publishers in advance, aligns the\nknowledge discrepancy between pruned and original models. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the efficacy of LoRAM across various pruning strategies\nand downstream tasks. For a model with 70 billion parameters, LoRAM enables\ntraining on a GPU with only 20G HBM, replacing an A100-80G GPU for LoRA\ntraining and 15 GPUs for full fine-tuning. Specifically, QLoRAM implemented by\nstructured pruning combined with 4-bit quantization, for LLaMA-3.1-70B\n(LLaMA-2-70B), reduces the parameter storage cost that dominates the memory\nusage in low-rank matrix training by 15.81$\\times$ (16.95$\\times$), while\nachieving dominant performance gains over both the original LLaMA-3.1-70B\n(LLaMA-2-70B) and LoRA-trained LLaMA-3.1-8B (LLaMA-2-13B).

    "abstract": "Traditional sequential recommendation (SR) methods heavily rely on explicit\nitem IDs to capture user preferences over time. This reliance introduces\ncritical limitations in cold-start scenarios and domain transfer tasks, where\nunseen items and new contexts often lack established ID mappings. To overcome\nthese limitations, recent studies have shifted towards leveraging text-only\ninformation for recommendation, thereby improving model generalization and\nadaptability across domains. Although promising, text-based SR faces unique\ndifficulties: items' text descriptions often share semantic similarities that\nlead to clustered item representations, compromising their uniformity, a\nproperty essential for promoting diversity and enhancing generalization in\nrecommendation systems. In this paper, we explore a novel framework to improve\nthe uniformity of item representations in text-based SR. Our analysis reveals\nthat items within a sequence exhibit marked semantic similarity, meaning they\nare closer in representation than items overall, and that this effect is more\npronounced for less popular items, which form tighter clusters compared to\ntheir more popular counterparts. Based on these findings, we propose UniT, a\nframework that employs three pairwise item sampling strategies: Unified General\nSampling Strategy, Sequence-Driven Sampling Strategy, and Popularity-Driven\nSampling Strategy. Each strategy applies varying degrees of repulsion to\nselectively adjust the distances between item pairs, thereby refining\nrepresentation uniformity while considering both sequence context and item\npopularity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art models, validating the\neffectiveness of UniT in enhancing both representation uniformity and\nrecommendation accuracy.The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ccwwhhh/Model-Rec.",

With respect to\nencoding, we employ parameter-sharing encoders with distinct diffusion\noperators to generate diverse, noise-resistant graph views. For contrastive\nloss, we introduce an upper-bound loss function that promotes generalization by\nmaintaining a balanced distribution of intra- and inter-class distance.

Utilizing classical force\nfield and ab initio datasets, we demonstrate that transfer learning surpasses\ntraditional training from scratch in force prediction, leading to more stable\nsimulations and improved temperature transferability. These advantages become\neven more pronounced as the training dataset size decreases. The out-of-target\nproperty analysis shows that transfer learning leads to beneficial but\nsometimes adversarial effects. Our findings demonstrate that transfer learning\nacross chemical elements is a promising technique for developing accurate and\nnumerically stable MLPs, particularly in a data-scarce regime.",

    "abstract": "The task of automatically coding the International Classification of Diseases\n(ICD) in the medical field has been well-established and has received much\nattention. Automatic coding of the ICD in the medical field has been successful\nin English but faces challenges when dealing with Chinese electronic medical\nrecords (EMRs). The first issue lies in the difficulty of extracting disease\ncode-related information from Chinese EMRs, primarily due to the concise\nwriting style and specific internal structure of the EMRs. The second problem\nis that previous methods have failed to leverage the disease-based multi-axial\nknowledge and lack of association with the corresponding clinical evidence.\nThis paper introduces a novel framework called MKE-Coder: Multi-axial Knowledge\nwith Evidence verification in ICD coding for Chinese EMRs. Initially, we\nidentify candidate codes for the diagnosis and categorize each of them into\nknowledge under four coding axes.Subsequently, we retrieve corresponding\nclinical evidence from the comprehensive content of EMRs and filter credible\nevidence through a scoring model. Finally, to ensure the validity of the\ncandidate code, we propose an inference module based on the masked language\nmodeling strategy. This module verifies that all the axis knowledge associated\nwith the candidate code is supported by evidence and provides recommendations\naccordingly. To evaluate the performance of our framework, we conduct\nexperiments using a large-scale Chinese EMR dataset collected from various\nhospitals. The experimental results demonstrate that MKE-Coder exhibits\nsignificant superiority in the task of automatic ICD coding based on Chinese\nEMRs. In the practical evaluation of our method within simulated real coding\nscenarios, it has been demonstrated that our approach significantly aids coders\nin enhancing both their coding accuracy and speed.",

Herein, we report the preparation of a series of\nelectrocatalysts based on octadecyl amine (ODA) coated Cu2O nanoparticles.\nHRTEM images show ODA coatings with thickness from 1.2 to 4 nm. DFT\ncalculations predict that at low surface coverage, ODA tends to lay on the Cu2O\nsurface, leaving hydrophilic regions. Oppositely, at high surface coverage, the\nODA molecules are densely packed, being detrimental for both mass and charge\ntransfer.

In situ Raman spectroscopy has revealed that the optimum\nODA thickness contributes to the stabilization of key intermediates in the\nformation of C2+ products, especially ethanol. Electrochemical impedance\nspectroscopy and pulse voltammetry measurements confirm that the thicker ODA\nshells increase charge transfer resistance, while the lowest ODA content\npromotes faster intermediate desorption rates. At the optimum thickness, the\nintermediates desorption rates are the slowest, in agreement with the maximum\nconcentration of intermediates observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, thereby\nresulting in a Faradaic efficiency to ethanol and ethylene over 73 %.",

However, due to the unique sensor imaging mechanism, main\nvision-based processing methods, like image denoising and mosaicking are still\nin the early stages. Due to the complex noise interference in acoustic images\nand the narrow field of view of acoustic cameras, it is difficult to restore\nthe entire detection scene even if enough acoustic images are collected.\nRelevant research work addressing these issues focuses on the design of\nhandcrafted operators for acoustic image processing based on prior knowledge\nand sensor models. However, such methods lack robustness due to noise\ninterference and insufficient feature details on acoustic images. This study\nproposes an acoustic image denoising and mosaicking method based on a\ndata-driven paradigm and conducts experimental testing using collected acoustic\ncamera images. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancement in machine learning algorithms reaches a point where\nmedical devices can be equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) models for\ndiagnostic support and routine automation in clinical settings. In medicine and\nhealthcare, there is a particular demand for sufficient and objective\nexplainability of the outcome generated by AI models. However, AI models are\ngenerally considered as black boxes due to their complexity, and the\ncomputational process leading to their response is often opaque. Although\nseveral methods have been proposed to explain the behavior of models by\nevaluating the importance of each feature in discrimination and prediction,\nthey may suffer from biases and opacities arising from the scale and sampling\nprotocol of the dataset used for training or testing. To overcome the\nshortcomings of existing methods, we explore an alternative approach to provide\nan objective explanation of AI models that can be defined independently of the\nlearning process and does not require additional data. As a preliminary study\nfor this direction of research, this work examines a numerical availability of\nthe Jacobian matrix of deep learning models that measures how stably a model\nresponses against small perturbations added to the input. The indicator, if\navailable, are calculated from a trained AI model for a given target input.\nThis is a first step towards a perturbation-based explanation, which will\nassist medical practitioners in understanding and interpreting the response of\nthe AI model in its clinical application.",

Traditional speech integration methods usually\ninvolves a separate speech recognition system, which complicates the model and\nintroduces error propagation. Moreover, the transcription procedure would lose\nnon-semantic information in the raw speech, such as voiceprint, which may be\ncrucial for robots to successfully complete customized tasks. To overcome above\nchallenges, we propose VLAS, a novel end-to-end VLA that integrates speech\nrecognition directly into the robot policy model. VLAS allows the robot to\nunderstand spoken commands through inner speech-text alignment and produces\ncorresponding actions to fulfill the task. We also present two new datasets,\nSQA and CSI, to support a three-stage tuning process for speech instructions,\nwhich empowers VLAS with the ability of multimodal interaction across text,\nimage, speech, and robot actions. Taking a step further, a voice\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm is designed to enable our model\nto effectively handle tasks that require individual-specific knowledge.

This shortcoming is primarily due to\nthe lack of effective constraints during the simultaneous integration of visual\nand textual prompts, leading to unhealthy mutual interference that compromises\nthe full expression of both types of input. Building on prior research that\nsuggests visual and textual conditions influence different regions of an image\nin distinct ways, we introduce a novel Dual-Pathway Adapter (DP-Adapter) to\nenhance both high-fidelity identity preservation and textual consistency in\npersonalized human image generation.

To seamlessly integrate these\npathways, we develop a Fine-Grained Feature-Level Blending (FFB) module that\nefficiently combines hierarchical semantic features from both pathways,\nresulting in more natural and coherent synthesis outcomes.

In an MRT, each participant is sequentially randomized among\ntreatment options hundreds of times. While the interventions tested in MRTs\ntarget short-term behavioral responses (proximal outcomes), their ultimate goal\nis to drive long-term behavior change (distal outcomes). However, existing\ncausal inference methods, such as the causal excursion effect, are limited to\nproximal outcomes, making it challenging to quantify the long-term impact of\ninterventions. To address this gap, we introduce the distal causal excursion\neffect (DCEE), a novel estimand that quantifies the long-term effect of\ntime-varying treatments. The DCEE contrasts distal outcomes under two excursion\npolicies while marginalizing over most treatment assignments, enabling a\nparsimonious and interpretable causal model even with a large number of\ndecision points. We propose two estimators for the DCEE -- one with\ncross-fitting and one without -- both robust to misspecification of the outcome\nmodel. We establish their asymptotic properties and validate their performance\nthrough simulations. We apply our method to the HeartSteps MRT to assess the\nimpact of activity prompts on long-term habit formation.

In this work,\nwe extend this by studying whether LLM-generated web design contains dark\npatterns. This work evaluated designs of ecommerce web components generated by\nfour popular LLMs: Claude, GPT, Gemini, and Llama. We tested 13 commonly used\necommerce components (e.g., search, product reviews) and used them as prompts\nto generate a total of 312 components across all models. Over one-third of\ngenerated components contain at least one dark pattern. The majority of dark\npattern strategies involve hiding crucial information, limiting users' actions,\nand manipulating them into making decisions through a sense of urgency. Dark\npatterns are also more frequently produced in components that are related to\ncompany interests. These findings highlight the need for interventions to\nprevent dark patterns during front-end code generation with LLMs and emphasize\nthe importance of expanding ethical design education to a broader audience.",

    "abstract": "The object goal visual navigation is the task of navigating to a specific\ntarget object using egocentric visual observations. Recent end-to-end\nnavigation models based on deep reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable\nperformance in finding and reaching target objects. However, the collision\nproblem of these models during navigation remains unresolved, since the\ncollision is typically neglected when evaluating the success. Although\nincorporating a negative reward for collision during training appears\nstraightforward, it results in a more conservative policy, thereby limiting the\nagent's ability to reach targets. In addition, many of these models utilize\nonly RGB observations, further increasing the difficulty of collision avoidance\nwithout depth information. To address these limitations, a new concept --\ncollision-free success is introduced to evaluate the ability of navigation\nmodels to find a collision-free path towards the target object. A two-stage\ntraining method with collision prediction is proposed to improve the\ncollision-free success rate of the existing navigation models using RGB\nobservations. In the first training stage, the collision prediction module\nsupervises the agent's collision states during exploration to learn to predict\nthe possible collision. In the second stage, leveraging the trained collision\nprediction, the agent learns to navigate to the target without collision. The\nexperimental results in the AI2-THOR environment demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod greatly improves the collision-free success rate of different navigation\nmodels and outperforms other comparable collision-avoidance methods.",

In this study, we\ninvestigate some crucial aspects of BHs endowed with a global monopole charge\nin the self-interacting KR field. Specifically, we study the quasinormal modes\n(QNMs) corresponding to scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational\nperturbations; derive rigorous bounds for the greybody factors (GBFs); and\nexamine the sparsity of Hawking radiation. The effects of the model parameters\n$\\ell$ (Lorentz-violating parameter in KR gravity) and $\\eta$ (monopole charge)\non these phenomena are elaborated. First, QNMs are evaluated with high\nprecision using the 13\\textsuperscript{th}-order Pad\\'{e}-averaged WKB method\nand cross-examined via time-domain analyses within an acceptable parameter\nspace. The results show that the estimated QNMs are more sensitive to $\\ell$;\nhowever, both model parameters influence the frequency spectra.

It is shown\nthat $\\ell$ and $\\eta$ have a similar effect on the greybody bounds.\nFurthermore, positive and negative values of $\\ell$ have opposing effects in\nthat the bounds are reversed for the two cases. The analyses of the Hawking\nradiation sparsity highlight the effect of $\\ell$, and two scenarios are noted:\neither the radiation emitted is less sparse than Hawking radiation, or it is\nmore sparse during the evaporation phase.

This topology, defined on the\nspaces of Bochner integrable functions from a signal space to a space of\nprobability measures endowed with a Hilbert space structure, allows for a\nversatile formulation. This construction allows one to obtain both a strong and\nweak formulation. (i) For its weak formulation, we highlight the utility on\nrelaxed policy spaces, and investigate connections with the Young narrow\ntopology and Borkar (or $w^*$)-topology, and establish equivalence properties.\nWe report that, while both the $w^*$-topology and kernel mean embedding\ntopology are relatively compact, they are not closed. Conversely, while the\nYoung narrow topology is closed, it lacks relative compactness. (ii) We show\nthat the strong form provides an appropriate formulation for placing topologies\non spaces of models characterized by stochastic kernels with explicit\nrobustness and learning theoretic implications on optimal stochastic control\nunder discounted or average cost criteria. (iii) We show that this topology\npossesses several properties making it ideal to study optimality,\napproximations, robustness and continuity properties. In particular, the kernel\nmean embedding topology has a Hilbert space structure, which is particularly\nuseful for approximating stochastic kernels through simulation data.",

In this context, evaluations are mostly\nbased on single-value metrics such as QA accuracy. However, these metrics often\nfail to capture the nuanced retention of harmful knowledge components, making\nit difficult to assess the true effectiveness of unlearning. To address this\nissue, we propose UNCD (UNlearning evaluation via Cognitive Diagnosis), a novel\nframework that leverages Cognitive Diagnosis Modeling for fine-grained\nevaluation of LLM unlearning. Our dedicated benchmark, UNCD-Cyber, provides a\ndetailed assessment of the removal of dangerous capabilities. Moreover, we\nintroduce UNCD-Agent, which refines unlearning by diagnosing knowledge remnants\nand generating targeted unlearning data. Extensive experiments across eight\nunlearning methods and two base models demonstrate that UNCD not only enhances\nevaluation but also effectively facilitates the removal of harmful LLM\nabilities.",

This\npaper introduces a novel framework for the collaborative design of FD and FTC,\naimed at optimizing fault diagnostic performance while ensuring fault tolerance\nunder NSTL specifications. The proposed framework consists of four key steps:\n(1) construction of the Signal Temporal Logic Tree (STLT), (2) fault detection\nvia the construction of fault-tolerant feasible sets, (3) evaluation of fault\ndetection performance, and (4) synthesis of fault-tolerant control. Initially,\na controller for nonlinear systems is designed to satisfy NSTL specifications,\nand a fault detection observer is developed alongside fault-tolerant feasible\nsets. To address the challenge of maintaining solution feasibility in dynamic\noptimization control problems, the concept of fault-tolerant control recursive\nfeasibility is introduced. Subsequently, suboptimal controller gains are\nderived through a quadratic programming approach to ensure fault tolerance.

Additionally, after\nblending the 2D and 3D features as guidance, instead of naively employing\ncross-attention to inject guidance cues into DiT layers, a learnable\nlayer-aware adaptive mechanism is employed to selectively inject the fused\nfeatures into each individual DiT layers, facilitating balanced modeling of\nidentity preservation and motion dynamics.

Our goal is to\nenhance the visual fidelity of materials with detail that is often tedious to\nauthor, by adding signs of wear, aging, weathering, etc. As these appearance\ndetails are often rooted in real-world processes, we leverage a generative\nimage model trained on a large dataset of natural images with corresponding\nvisuals in context. Starting with a given geometry, UV mapping, and basic\nappearance, we render multiple views of the object. We use these views,\ntogether with an appearance-defining text prompt, to condition a diffusion\nmodel. The details it generates are then backpropagated from the enhanced\nimages to the material parameters via inverse differentiable rendering. For\ninverse rendering to be successful, the generated appearance has to be\nconsistent across all the images. We propose two priors to address the\nmulti-view consistency of the diffusion model. First, we ensure that the\ninitial noise that seeds the diffusion process is itself consistent across\nviews by integrating it from a view-independent UV space. Second, we enforce\ngeometric consistency by biasing the attention mechanism via a projective\nconstraint so that pixels attend strongly to their corresponding pixel\nlocations in other views. Our approach does not require any training or\nfinetuning of the diffusion model, is agnostic of the material model used, and\nthe enhanced material properties, i.e., 2D PBR textures, can be further edited\nby artists.

    "abstract": "Commonsense plausibility estimation is critical for evaluating language\nmodels (LMs), yet existing generative approaches--reliant on likelihoods or\nverbalized judgments--struggle with fine-grained discrimination. In this paper,\nwe propose ComPaSS, a novel discriminative framework that quantifies\ncommonsense plausibility by measuring semantic shifts when augmenting sentences\nwith commonsense-related information. Plausible augmentations induce minimal\nshifts in semantics, while implausible ones result in substantial deviations.\nEvaluations on two types of fine-grained commonsense plausibility estimation\ntasks across different backbones, including LLMs and vision-language models\n(VLMs), show that ComPaSS consistently outperforms baselines. It demonstrates\nthe advantage of discriminative approaches over generative methods in\nfine-grained commonsense plausibility evaluation. Experiments also show that\n(1) VLMs yield superior performance to LMs, when integrated with ComPaSS, on\nvision-grounded commonsense tasks. (2) contrastive pre-training sharpens\nbackbone models' ability to capture semantic nuances, thereby further enhancing\nComPaSS.",

    "abstract": "The exponential growth in parameter size and computational complexity of deep\nmodels poses significant challenges for efficient deployment. The core problem\nof existing compression methods is that different layers of the model have\nsignificant differences in their tolerance to compression levels. For instance,\nthe first layer of a model can typically sustain a higher compression level\ncompared to the last layer without compromising performance. Thus, the key\nchallenge lies in how to allocate compression levels across layers in a way\nthat minimizes performance loss while maximizing parameter reduction. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a Compression Error Theory (CET) framework,\ndesigned to determine the optimal compression level for each layer. Taking\nquantization as an example, CET leverages differential expansion and algebraic\ngeometry to reconstruct the quadratic form of quantization error as ellipsoids\nand hyperbolic paraboloids, and utilizes their geometric structures to define\nan error subspace. To identify the error subspace with minimal performance\nloss, by performing orthogonal decomposition of the geometric space, CET\ntransforms the optimization process of the error subspace into a complementary\nproblem. The final theoretical analysis shows that constructing the\nquantization subspace along the major axis results in minimal performance\ndegradation. Through experimental verification of the theory, CET can greatly\nretain performance while compressing. Specifically, on the ResNet-34 model, CET\nachieves nearly 11$\\times$ parameter compression while even surpassing\nperformance comparable to the original model.",

Understanding gene functions and interactions in\ndifferent spatial domains is crucial, as it can enhance our comprehension of\nbiological mechanisms, such as cancer-immune interactions and cell\ndifferentiation in various regions. It is necessary to cluster tissue regions\ninto distinct spatial domains and identify discriminating genes that elucidate\nthe clustering result, referred to as spatial domain-specific discriminating\ngenes (DGs). Existing methods for identifying these genes typically rely on a\ntwo-stage approach, which can lead to the phenomenon known as\n\\textit{double-dipping}. To address the challenge, we propose a unified\nBayesian latent block model that simultaneously detects a list of DGs\ncontributing to spatial domain identification while clustering these DGs and\nspatial locations. The efficacy of our proposed method is validated through a\nseries of simulation experiments, and its capability to identify DGs is\ndemonstrated through applications to benchmark SRT datasets.",

This paper introduces\nAILuminate v1.0, the first comprehensive industry-standard benchmark for\nassessing AI-product risk and reliability. Its development employed an open\nprocess that included participants from multiple fields. The benchmark\nevaluates an AI system's resistance to prompts designed to elicit dangerous,\nillegal, or undesirable behavior in 12 hazard categories, including violent\ncrimes, nonviolent crimes, sex-related crimes, child sexual exploitation,\nindiscriminate weapons, suicide and self-harm, intellectual property, privacy,\ndefamation, hate, sexual content, and specialized advice (election, financial,\nhealth, legal). Our method incorporates a complete assessment standard,\nextensive prompt datasets, a novel evaluation framework, a grading and\nreporting system, and the technical as well as organizational infrastructure\nfor long-term support and evolution. In particular, the benchmark employs an\nunderstandable five-tier grading scale (Poor to Excellent) and incorporates an\ninnovative entropy-based system-response evaluation.\n  In addition to unveiling the benchmark, this report also identifies\nlimitations of our method and of building safety benchmarks generally,\nincluding evaluator uncertainty and the constraints of single-turn\ninteractions. This work represents a crucial step toward establishing global\nstandards for AI risk and reliability evaluation while acknowledging the need\nfor continued development in areas such as multiturn interactions, multimodal\nunderstanding, coverage of additional languages, and emerging hazard\ncategories. Our findings provide valuable insights for model developers, system\nintegrators, and policymakers working to promote safer AI deployment.",

We empirically demonstrate a significant improvement in 3-SAT\nperformance out of the box by switching to a Gibbs-sampling style discrete\ndiffusion model which does not assume factorizability. Motivated by this, we\nintroduce IGD which generalizes discrete time Gibbs sampling type Markov chain\nfor the case of discrete-continuous generation.

Whilst these modifications are usually quantified by the\ncompression rate and convergence rate of the mixing layer, an alternative\nframework is proposed, describing the evolution of the mixing layer through the\neffects of the mean strain rates experienced by the mixing layer. An\ninvestigation into the effect of the transverse strain rate on the mixing layer\ndevelopment is conducted through application of transverse strain rates in\nplanar geometry. A model for the linear regime in planar geometry with\ntransverse strain rate is derived, with equivalent solutions to convergent\ngeometry, and validated with two-dimensional simulations demonstrating the\namplification of the instability growth under transverse compression. The\neffect of the transverse strain rate on the transitional-to-turbulent mixing\nlayer is investigated with implicit large eddy simulation based on the\nmulti-mode quarter-scale $\\theta$-group case by Thornber et al. (Phys. Fluids,\nvol. 29, 2017, 105107). The mixing layer's growth exhibits the opposite trend\nto the linear regime model, with reduced growth under transverse compression.\nThe effect of shear-production under transverse compression causes the mixing\nlayer to become more mixed and the turbulent kinetic energy is increasingly\ndominated by the transverse directions, deviating from the unstrained\nself-similar state. The mixing layer width is able to be predicted by adjusting\nthe buoyancy-drag model by Youngs & Thornber (Physica D, vol. 410, 2020,\n132517) to utilise a drag length scale that scales with the transverse\nexpansion.",

Combining\nmachine learning and passive acoustics enables continuous monitoring over\nextended periods without direct human involvement. However, most existing\ntechniques require extensive expert-labeled datasets for training and cannot\neasily detect time-overlapping calls in busy soundscapes. We propose a\nsemi-supervised acoustic bird detector designed to allow both the detection of\ntime-overlapping calls (when separated in frequency) and the use of few labeled\ntraining samples. The classifier is trained and evaluated on a combination of\ncommunity-recorded open-source data and long-duration soundscape recordings\nfrom Singapore. It achieves a mean F0.5 score of 0.701 across 315 classes from\n110 bird species on a hold-out test set, with an average of 11 labeled training\nsamples per class. It outperforms the state-of-the-art BirdNET classifier on a\ntest set of 103 bird species despite significantly fewer labeled training\nsamples. The detector is further tested on 144 microphone-hours of continuous\nsoundscape data. The rich soundscape in Singapore makes suppression of false\npositives a challenge on raw, continuous data streams.

We observed the radio\nafterglow from $7$ to $456\\,$d post-burst: an initial, steep decay ($F_{\\nu}\n\\propto t^{-2}$) is followed by a shallower decline ($F_{\\nu} \\propto\nt^{-1/2}$) after ${\\sim} 20\\,$d. Our afterglow modelling shows that these radio\nproperties can be explained by the presence of a slow, wide ejecta component in\naddition to a fast, narrow ejecta component, consistent with the picture of a\nhighly-collimated jet and its thermal cocoon decelerating into the ambient\nmedium. The properties of the cocoon point toward a progenitor with a large\nstellar radius, supporting the blue supergiant scenario proposed for ultra-long\nGRBs.

The proposed pilot design is distinguishable\nfrom the existing work in that it is applicable in general system environments,\nincluding correlated channel and multi-cell environments. We demonstrate that\nthe proposed method outperforms the channel estimation accuracy performance\ncompared to the conventional approaches.",

Semantic parsing-based KBQA methods\nare particularly challenging as these approaches require locating elements from\nknowledge bases and generating logical forms, demanding not only extensive\nannotated data but also strong reasoning capabilities. Although recent\napproaches leveraging LLMs as agents have demonstrated considerable potential,\nthese studies are inherently constrained by their linear decision-making\nprocesses. To address this limitation, we propose a MCTS-based framework that\nenhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities through tree search methodology. We\ndesign a carefully designed step-wise reward mechanism that requires only\ndirect prompting of open-source instruction LLMs without additional\nfine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly\noutperforms linear decision-making methods, particularly in low-resource\nscenarios. Additionally, we contribute new data resources to the KBQA community\nby annotating intermediate reasoning processes for existing question-SPARQL\ndatasets using distant supervision.

Since $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ bits\ncommunication is required with the classical SMP scheme for the equality\nproblem first shown by Newman and Szegedy (STOC 1996), there exists an\nexponential quantum advantage in the amount of communication.\n  In this paper, we consider a setting in which the referee can do only\nincoherent measurements rather than coherent measurements including the SWAP\ntests. We first show that, in the case of one-way LOCC measurements,\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ qubits communication is required.

We study both non-adaptive and adaptive codes. Some\ncommunication and graph problems already studied in BN admit fast randomized\nalgorithms.

    "abstract": "The issue of local government debt is widely recognized as one of the \"gray\nrhinos\" affecting the stable development of China's economy. Government debt\ncan transmit risks to local banks, which are among the primary holders of local\ndebt, thereby triggering systemic financial risks. Consequently, exploring debt\nresolution pathways and evaluating the systematic effects of debt servicing\npolicies has become critically important. This study employs panel data from\n348 local commercial banks across 29 provincial-level administrative regions in\nChina from 2010 to 2023, and constructs a difference-in-differences (DID) model\nto investigate the impact of the State Council's special supervision of debt\nservicing on local bank risks. The findings indicate that the government's debt\nservicing policy essentially represents a shift of government debt from\nexplicit to implicit forms, significantly increasing the risks faced by local\nbanks and producing outcomes contrary to the policy's original intent. This\neffect is particularly pronounced for rural commercial banks and banks with\nhigh customer concentration and fewer branches. Mechanism analysis reveals two\nkey insights. First, local banks are heavily influenced by local government\ncontrol; the government's debt servicing requires banks to support the\ngovernment by purchasing government bonds and other financial instruments,\nwhich leads to a deterioration in asset quality and an expansion of risk\nexposure. Second, government debt crowds out private credit from local banks,\nweakening the region's repayment capacity and ultimately increasing bank risk.\nOur research uncovers the counterintuitive effects of government debt servicing\nand offers corresponding policy recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) face the challenge of hallucinations -- outputs\nthat seem coherent but are actually incorrect. A particularly damaging type is\nfact-conflicting hallucination (FCH), where generated content contradicts\nestablished facts. Addressing FCH presents three main challenges: 1)\nAutomatically constructing and maintaining large-scale benchmark datasets is\ndifficult and resource-intensive; 2) Generating complex and efficient test\ncases that the LLM has not been trained on -- especially those involving\nintricate temporal features -- is challenging, yet crucial for eliciting\nhallucinations; and 3) Validating the reasoning behind LLM outputs is\ninherently difficult, particularly with complex logical relationships, as it\nrequires transparency in the model's decision-making process.\n  This paper presents Drowzee, an innovative end-to-end metamorphic testing\nframework that utilizes temporal logic to identify fact-conflicting\nhallucinations (FCH) in large language models (LLMs). Drowzee builds a\ncomprehensive factual knowledge base by crawling sources like Wikipedia and\nuses automated temporal-logic reasoning to convert this knowledge into a large,\nextensible set of test cases with ground truth answers. LLMs are tested using\nthese cases through template-based prompts, which require them to generate both\nanswers and reasoning steps. To validate the reasoning, we propose two\nsemantic-aware oracles that compare the semantic structure of LLM outputs to\nthe ground truths. Across nine LLMs in nine different knowledge domains,\nexperimental results show that Drowzee effectively identifies rates of\nnon-temporal-related hallucinations ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%, and rates of\ntemporal-related hallucinations ranging from 16.7% to 39.2%.",

    "abstract": "Public exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ act as\nauctioneers in a public double auction system, where buyers submit their\nhighest bids and sellers offer their lowest asking prices, along with the\nnumber of shares (volume) they wish to trade. The auctioneer matches compatible\norders and executes the trades when a match is found. However, auctioneers\ninvolved in high-volume exchanges, such as dark pools, may not always be\nreliable. They could exploit their position by engaging in practices like\nfront-running or face significant conflicts of interest, i.e., ethical breaches\nthat have frequently resulted in hefty fines and regulatory scrutiny within the\nfinancial industry.\n  Previous solutions, based on the use of fully homomorphic encryption (Asharov\net al., AAMAS 2020), encrypt orders ensuring that information is revealed only\nwhen a match occurs. However, this approach introduces significant\ncomputational overhead, making it impractical for high-frequency trading\nenvironments such as dark pools.\n  In this work, we propose a new system based on differential privacy combined\nwith lightweight encryption, offering an efficient and practical solution that\nmitigates the risks of an untrustworthy auctioneer. Specifically, we introduce\na new concept called Indifferential Privacy, which can be of independent\ninterest, where a user is indifferent to whether certain information is\nrevealed after some special event, unlike standard differential privacy. For\nexample, in an auction, it's reasonable to disclose the true volume of a trade\nonce all of it has been matched.

However,\nconstructing a knowledge-rich and reliable API KG presents several challenges.\nExisting schema-based methods rely heavily on manual annotations to design KG\nschemas, leading to excessive manual overhead. On the other hand, schema-free\nmethods, due to the lack of schema guidance, are prone to introducing noise,\nreducing the KG's reliability. To address these issues, we propose the\nExplore-Construct-Filter framework, an automated approach for API KG\nconstruction based on large language models (LLMs). This framework consists of\nthree key modules: 1) KG exploration: LLMs simulate the workflow of annotators\nto automatically design a schema with comprehensive type triples, minimizing\nhuman intervention; 2) KG construction: Guided by the schema, LLMs extract\ninstance triples to construct a rich yet unreliable API KG; 3) KG filtering:\nRemoving invalid type triples and suspicious instance triples to construct a\nrich and reliable API KG. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art method, achieving a 25.2% improvement in F1\nscore. Moreover, the Explore-Construct-Filter framework proves effective, with\nthe KG exploration module increasing KG richness by 133.6% and the KG filtering\nmodule improving reliability by 26.6%.

Yet, there is no known mechanism that provides\nincentives to elicit explanations for beliefs from agents. This likely stems\nfrom the fact that standard Bayesian models make assumptions (like conditional\nindependence of signals) that preempt the need for explanations, in order to\nshow efficient information aggregation. A natural justification for the value\nof explanations is that agents' beliefs tend to be drawn from overlapping\nsources of information, so agents' belief reports do not reveal all that needs\nto be known. Indeed, this work argues that rationales-explanations of an\nagent's private information-lead to more efficient aggregation by allowing\nagents to efficiently identify what information they share and what information\nis new. Building on this model of rationales, we present a novel 'deliberation\nmechanism' to elicit rationales from agents in which truthful reporting of\nbeliefs and rationales is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium.",

In this work, by employing a ``gauge-discontinuity\"\nformalism, we resolve this long-standing issue and rigorously derive a\nquantized layer-resolved OME response in 3D Chern insulators. We demonstrate\nthat the difference of the layer-resolved OME coupling between adjacent layers\nis universally quantized in unit of $-C e^2/h$, where $C$ is the Chern number.\nThis quantization arises from an anomalous contribution to the Chern-Simons OME\ncoupling, which is closely associated with the Berry curvature of the occupied\nbands and the hybrid Wannier centers along the direction of the Chern vector\n$(0,0, C)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomalous Chern-Simons\ncoupling can be transported by an exact integer quantum from one unit cell to\nits neighboring cell through an adiabatic cyclic pumping process, accompanied\nby a quantized displacement of Wannier center along the direction of the Chern\nvector.

    "abstract": "Robotic assembly tasks require object-pose estimation, particularly for tasks\nthat avoid costly mechanical constraints. Object symmetry complicates the\ndirect mapping of sensory input to object rotation, as the rotation becomes\nambiguous and lacks a unique training target. Some proposed solutions involve\nevaluating multiple pose hypotheses against the input or predicting a\nprobability distribution, but these approaches suffer from significant\ncomputational overhead. Here, we show that representing object rotation with a\nneural population code overcomes these limitations, enabling a direct mapping\nto rotation and end-to-end learning. As a result, population codes facilitate\nfast and accurate pose estimation. On the T-LESS dataset, we achieve inference\nin 3.2 milliseconds on an Apple M1 CPU and a Maximum Symmetry-Aware Surface\nDistance accuracy of 84.7% using only gray-scale image input, compared to 69.7%\naccuracy when directly mapping to pose.",

While\nartificial intelligence has demonstrated excellent denoising capabilities, most\nexisting methods rely on supervised learning with labeled data, which imposes\nstringent requirements on the quality of the labels.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed RFTT on mathematical benchmarks, significantly boosting\nQwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (70.6% to 79.8%) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (32.2% to\n60.2%) on the MATH dataset. Moreover, the performance of RFTT consistently\nimproves with more search rollouts at inference time. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/sastpg/RFTT.",

    "abstract": "Studies have been conducted to prevent specific concepts from being generated\nfrom pretrained text-to-image generative models, achieving concept erasure in\nvarious ways. However, the performance evaluation of these studies is still\nlargely reliant on visualization, with the superiority of studies often\ndetermined by human subjectivity. The metrics of quantitative evaluation also\nvary, making comprehensive comparisons difficult. We propose EraseEval, an\nevaluation method that differs from previous evaluation methods in that it\ninvolves three fundamental evaluation criteria: (1) How well does the prompt\ncontaining the target concept be reflected, (2) To what extent the concepts\nrelated to the erased concept can reduce the impact of the erased concept, and\n(3) Whether other concepts are preserved. These criteria are evaluated and\nintegrated into a single metric, such that a lower score is given if any of the\nevaluations are low, leading to a more robust assessment. We experimentally\nevaluated baseline concept erasure methods, organized their characteristics,\nand identified challenges with them. Despite being fundamental evaluation\ncriteria, some concept erasure methods failed to achieve high scores, which\npoint toward future research directions for concept erasure methods.

Inspired by the\nrecent increase in the number of people and businesses preferring and promoting\ndiversity, we propose swap games under three diversity-seeking utility\nfunctions: the binary utility of an agent is 1 if it has a neighbor of a\ndifferent type, and 0 otherwise; the difference-seeking utility of an agent is\nequal to the number of its neighbors of a different type; the variety-seeking\nutility of an agent is equal to the number of types different from its own in\nits neighborhood. We consider four global measures of diversity: degree of\nintegration, number of colorful edges, neighborhood variety, and evenness, and\nprove asymptotically tight or almost tight bounds on the price of anarchy with\nrespect to these measures on both general graphs, as well as on cycles,\ncylinders, and tori that model residential neighborhoods. We complement our\ntheoretical results with simulations of our swap games starting either from\nrandom placements of agents, or from segregated placements. Our simulation\nresults are generally consistent with our theoretical results, showing that\nsegregation is effectively removed when agents are diversity-seeking; however\nstrong diversity, such as measured by neighborhood variety and evenness, is\nharder to achieve by our swap games.",

We introduce MoVer, a motion verification\nDSL based on first-order logic that can check spatio-temporal properties of a\nmotion graphics animation. We identify a general set of such properties that\npeople commonly use to describe animations (e.g., the direction and timing of\nmotions, the relative positioning of objects, etc.). We implement these\nproperties as predicates in MoVer and provide an execution engine that can\napply a MoVer program to any input SVG-based motion graphics animation. We then\ndemonstrate how MoVer can be used in an LLM-based synthesis and verification\npipeline for iteratively refining motion graphics animations. Given a text\nprompt, our pipeline synthesizes a motion graphics animation and a\ncorresponding MoVer program. Executing the verification program on the\nanimation yields a report of the predicates that failed and the report can be\nautomatically fed back to LLM to iteratively correct the animation.

This idea has been recently rekindled\nby the observation (signal-to-noise ratio of about 15$\\sigma$) of a phosphine\n(PH$_3$) absorption-line profile against the thermal background from deeper,\nhotter layers of the atmosphere. There is a chance that this observation could\nbe a sign of life, because the PH$_3$ gas observed on Earth originates mostly\nin decaying organic material. Furthermore, it has been shown that there is no\nother natural process on Venus that could otherwise produce the observed PH$_3$\nabsorption line. On the other hand, cosmic rays and the particle cascades they\nproduce in the Earth's atmosphere are hazardous to living organisms, because\nthe ionizing radiation produced in air showers can blow apart chemical\nmolecules and disrupt biochemical processes, causing cells to die or undergo\ndangerous mutations. Compared to Earth, the hypothesized biosphere of Venus\ncould be exposed to substantially more ionizing radiation. This is because\nVenus has no protective intrinsic magnetic field, orbits closer to the Sun, and\nthe entire eventual habitable region lies in the clouds high in the atmosphere.\nThereby, if the clouds were sterilized there would be no reservoir of deeper\nlife that can recolonize afterwards. In this communication we study the effects\nof particle cascades in the venusian atmosphere using the AIRES simulation\npackage properly configured.

This paper introduces RGAR, a recurrence generation-augmented retrieval\nframework that retrieves both relevant factual and conceptual knowledge from\ndual sources (i.e., EHRs and the corpus), allowing them to interact and refine\neach another. Through extensive evaluation across three factual-aware medical\nquestion answering benchmarks, RGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art\nperformance among medical RAG systems. Notably, the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model\nwith RGAR surpasses the considerably larger, RAG-enhanced GPT-3.5. Our findings\ndemonstrate the benefit of extracting factual knowledge for retrieval, which\nconsistently yields improved generation quality.",

However, these\nNAS-based denoising methods explore limited search space and are hard to extend\nin terms of search space due to high computational burden. To tackle these\nlimitations, we propose the first search framework to explore mainstream\ndenoising designs. In our framework, the search space consists of the\nnetwork-level, the cell-level and the kernel-level search space, which aims to\ninherit as many denoising designs as possible. Coordinating search strategies\nare proposed to facilitate the extension of various denoising designs. In such\na giant search space, it is laborious to search for an optimal architecture. To\nsolve this dilemma, we introduce the first regularization, i.e., denoising\nprior-based regularization, which reduces the search difficulty. To get an\nefficient architecture, we introduce the other regularization, i.e., inference\ntime-based regularization, optimizes the search process on model complexity.\nBased on our framework, our searched architecture achieves state-of-the-art\nresults for image denoising on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets. The\nparameters of our searched architecture are $1/3$ of Restormer's, and our\nmethod surpasses existing NAS-based denoising methods by $1.50$ dB in the\nreal-world dataset.

However, existing methods\ntypically improve compression performance by incorporating explicit semantic\npriors, such as segmentation maps and textual features, into the encoder or\ndecoder, which increases model complexity by adding parameters and\nfloating-point operations. This limits the model's practicality, as image\ncompression often occurs on resource-limited mobile devices. To alleviate this\nproblem, we propose a lightweight perceptual Image Compression method using\nImplicit Semantic Priors (ICISP). We first develop an enhanced visual state\nspace block that exploits local and global spatial dependencies to reduce\nredundancy. Since different frequency information contributes unequally to\ncompression, we develop a frequency decomposition modulation block to\nadaptively preserve or reduce the low-frequency and high-frequency information.\nWe establish the above blocks as the main modules of the encoder-decoder, and\nto further improve the perceptual quality of the reconstructed images, we\ndevelop a semantic-informed discriminator that uses implicit semantic priors\nfrom a pretrained DINOv2 encoder.

For conventional, s-wave\nsuperconductors, such scaling has been shown to be a natural consequence of\nelastic-scattering disorder, not only in the extreme dirty limit but across a\nbroad range of scattering parameters. Here we show that when an analogous\ncalculation is carried out for elastic scattering in d-wave superconductors, a\nstark contrast emerges, with $\\rho_{s0} \\propto \\left(\\sigma_\\mathrm{dc} T_c\n\\right)^2$ in the dirty limit, in apparent violation of Homes scaling. Within a\nsimple approximate Migdal--Eliashberg treatment of inelastic scattering, we\nshow how Homes scaling is recovered. The normal-state behavior of near\noptimally doped cuprates is dominated by inelastic scattering, but significant\ndeviations from Homes scaling occur for disorder-dominated cuprate systems,\nsuch as underdoped YBCO and overdoped LSCO, and in very clean materials with\nlittle inelastic scattering, such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We present a revised\nanalysis where both axes of the original Homes scaling plot are normalized by\nthe Drude plasma weight, $\\omega_{p,D}^2$, and show that new universal scaling\nemerges, in which the superfluid fractions of dirty s-wave and dirty d-wave\nsuperconductors coalesce to a single point at which normal-state scattering is\noccurring at the Planckian bound. The combined result is a new tool for\nclassifying superconductors in terms of order parameter symmetry, as well as\nscattering strength and character.

Our approach achieves 87% reassembly accuracy on a dataset of 142 real\nfragments from 10 different pots, outperforming other methods in handling\ncomplex fracture patterns with mixed datasets and achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Understanding how individuals perceive and recall information in their\nnatural environments is critical to understanding potential failures in\nperception (e.g., sensory loss) and memory (e.g., dementia). Event\nsegmentation, the process of identifying distinct events within dynamic\nenvironments, is central to how we perceive, encode, and recall experiences.\nThis cognitive process not only influences moment-to-moment comprehension but\nalso shapes event specific memory. Despite the importance of event segmentation\nand event memory, current research methodologies rely heavily on human\njudgements for assessing segmentation patterns and recall ability, which are\nsubjective and time-consuming. A few approaches have been introduced to\nautomate event segmentation and recall scoring, but validity with human\nresponses and ease of implementation require further advancements. To address\nthese concerns, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate event\nsegmentation and assess recall, employing chat completion and text-embedding\nmodels, respectively. We validated these models against human annotations and\ndetermined that LLMs can accurately identify event boundaries, and that human\nevent segmentation is more consistent with LLMs than among humans themselves.\nUsing this framework, we advanced an automated approach for recall assessments\nwhich revealed semantic similarity between segmented narrative events and\nparticipant recall can estimate recall performance. Our findings demonstrate\nthat LLMs can effectively simulate human segmentation patterns and provide\nrecall evaluations that are a scalable alternative to manual scoring. This\nresearch opens novel avenues for studying the intersection between perception,\nmemory, and cognitive impairment using methodologies driven by artificial\nintelligence.",

    "abstract": "This paper characterizes integration and coordination gains in dense\nmillimeter-wave ISAC networks through a dual-mode framework that combines\nmonostatic and multistatic sensing. A comprehensive system-level analysis is\nconducted, accounting for base station (BS) density, power allocation, antenna\nmisalignment, radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations, clutter, bistatic\ngeometry, channel fading, and self-interference cancellation (SIC) efficiency.\nUsing stochastic geometry, coverage probabilities and ergodic rates for sensing\nand communication are derived, revealing tradeoffs among BS density, beamwidth,\nand power allocation. It is shown that the communication performance sustained\nreliable operation despite the overlaid sensing functionality. In contrast, the\nresults reveal the foundational role of spatial sensing diversity, driven by\nthe dual-mode operation, to compensate for the weak sensing reflections and\nvulnerability to imperfect SIC along with interference and clutter. To this\nend, we identify a system transition from monostatic to multistatic-dominant\nsensing operation as a function of the SIC efficiency. In the latter case,\nusing six multistatic BSs instead of a single bistatic receiver improved\nsensing coverage probability by over 100%, highlighting the coordination gain.\nMoreover, comparisons with pure communication networks confirm substantial\nintegration gain. Specifically, dual-mode networked sensing with four\ncooperative BSs can double throughput, while multistatic sensing alone improves\nthroughput by over 50%.",

Our experiments on a web graph containing 900\nmillion webpages from a commercial search engine's index demonstrate the\nefficiency of Craw4LLM in obtaining high-quality pretraining data.

Correlations between contextual richness and hallucination rate (r =\n-0.368, p = 0.003) reveal the kinds of images that are likely to cause\nhallucinations.

An analytical description of the\nevolution of the kinetic temperature is proposed in both discrete (exact) and\ncontinuum (approximate) formulations. The continualization of the discrete\nsolution for kinetic temperature is performed through a large-time asymptotic\nestimate of the fundamental solution of the dynamical problem for the instantly\nperturbed conservative semi-infinite chain at the fronts of the incident and\nreflected thermal waves. By analyzing the continuum solution, we observe that\nany instantaneous heat supply (i.e., a heat pulse) results in the\nanti-localization of the reflected thermal wave. We demonstrate that sudden\npoint heat supply leads to a transition to a non-equilibrium steady state,\nwhich, unexpectedly, may exist even in the non-dissipative case. The results of\nthis paper are expected to provide insight into the continuum description of\nnanoscale heat transport.",

Large pre-training datasets for leading LLMs remain\ninaccessible to the public, whereas many open datasets are small in size (less\nthan 5 trillion tokens), limiting their suitability for training large models.\n  In this paper, we introduce GneissWeb, a large dataset yielding around 10\ntrillion tokens that caters to the data quality and quantity requirements of\ntraining LLMs. Our GneissWeb recipe that produced the dataset consists of\nsharded exact sub-string deduplication and a judiciously constructed ensemble\nof quality filters. GneissWeb achieves a favorable trade-off between data\nquality and quantity, producing models that outperform models trained on\nstate-of-the-art open large datasets (5+ trillion tokens).\n  We show that models trained using GneissWeb dataset outperform those trained\non FineWeb-V1.1.0 by 2.73 percentage points in terms of average score computed\non a set of 11 commonly used benchmarks (both zero-shot and few-shot) for\npre-training dataset evaluation.
