    "abstract": "The human brain functions very differently from artificial neural networks\n(ANN) and possesses unique features that are absent in ANN. An important one\namong them is \"adaptive synaptogenesis\" that modifies synaptic weights when\nneeded to avoid catastrophic forgetting and promote lifelong learning. The key\naspect of this algorithm is supervised Hebbian learning, where weight\nmodifications in the neocortex driven by temporal coincidence are further\naccepted or vetoed by an added control mechanism from the hippocampus during\nthe training cycle, to make distant synaptic connections highly sparse and\nstrategic. In this work, we discuss various algorithmic aspects of adaptive\nsynaptogenesis tailored to edge computing, demonstrate its function using\nsimulations, and design nanomagnetic hardware accelerators for specific\nfunctions of synaptogenesis.",

    "abstract": "As the post-training of large language models (LLMs) advances from\ninstruction-following to complex reasoning tasks, understanding how different\ndata affect finetuning dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we\npresent a spectral analysis of layer-wise gradients induced by low/high-quality\ninstruction and reasoning data for LLM post-training. Our analysis reveals that\nwidely-studied metrics for data evaluation, e.g., IFD, InsTag, Difficulty, and\nReward, can be explained and unified by spectral properties computed from\ngradients' singular value decomposition (SVD). Specifically, higher-quality\ndata are usually associated with lower nuclear norms and higher effective\nranks. Notably, effective rank exhibits better robustness and resolution than\nnuclear norm in capturing subtle quality differences. For example, reasoning\ndata achieves substantially higher effective ranks than instruction data,\nimplying richer gradient structures on more complex tasks. Our experiments also\nhighlight that models within the same family share similar gradient patterns\nregardless of their sizes, whereas different model families diverge\nsignificantly. Providing a unified view on the effects of data quality across\ninstruction and reasoning data, this work illuminates the interplay between\ndata quality and training stability, shedding novel insights into developing\nbetter data exploration strategies for post-training.",

    "abstract": "A solar panel harvests the most energy when pointing in the direction that\nmaximizes the total illumination (irradiance) falling on it. Given an arbitrary\npanel orientation and an arbitrary environmental illumination, we address the\nproblem of finding the direction of maximum total irradiance. We develop a\nminimal sensing approach where measurements from just four photodetectors are\nused to iteratively vary the tilt of the panel to maximize the irradiance. Many\nenvironments produce irradiance functions with multiple local maxima. As a\nresult, simply measuring the gradient of the irradiance function and applying\ngradient ascent will not work. We show that a larger, optimized tilt between\nthe detectors and the panel is equivalent to blurring the irradiance function.\nThis has the effect of eliminating local maxima and turning the irradiance\nfunction into a unimodal one, whose maximum can be found using gradient ascent.\nWe show that there is a close relationship between our approach and scale space\ntheory. We collected a large dataset of high-dynamic range lighting\nenvironments in Manhattan, called UrbanSky. We use this dataset to conduct\nsimulations to verify the robustness of our approach. Next, we simulate the\nenergy harvested using our approach under dynamic illumination. Finally, we\nbuilt a portable solar panel with four compact detectors and an actuator to\nconduct experiments in various real-world settings: direct sunlight, cloudy\nsky, urban settings with occlusions and shadows, and complex indoor lighting.\nIn all cases, we show improvements in harvested energy compared to standard\napproaches for orienting a solar panel.",

    "abstract": "Posidonia oceanica meadows are a species of seagrass highly dependent on\nrocks for their survival and conservation. In recent years, there has been a\nconcerning global decline in this species, emphasizing the critical need for\nefficient monitoring and assessment tools. While deep learning-based semantic\nsegmentation and visual automated monitoring systems have shown promise in a\nvariety of applications, their performance in underwater environments remains\nchallenging due to complex water conditions and limited datasets. This paper\nintroduces a framework that combines machine learning and computer vision\ntechniques to enable an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to inspect the\nboundaries of Posidonia oceanica meadows autonomously. The framework\nincorporates an image segmentation module using an existing Mask R-CNN model\nand a strategy for Posidonia oceanica meadow boundary tracking. Furthermore, a\nnew class dedicated to rocks is introduced to enhance the existing model,\naiming to contribute to a comprehensive monitoring approach and provide a\ndeeper understanding of the intricate interactions between the meadow and its\nsurrounding environment. The image segmentation model is validated using real\nunderwater images, while the overall inspection framework is evaluated in a\nrealistic simulation environment, replicating actual monitoring scenarios with\nreal underwater images. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework\nenables the AUV to autonomously accomplish the main tasks of underwater\ninspection and segmentation of rocks. Consequently, this work holds significant\npotential for the conservation and protection of marine environments, providing\nvaluable insights into the status of Posidonia oceanica meadows and supporting\ntargeted preservation efforts",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and among\nits many forms, brain tumors are particularly notorious due to their aggressive\nnature and the critical challenges involved in early diagnosis. Recent advances\nin artificial intelligence have shown great promise in assisting medical\nprofessionals with precise tumor segmentation, a key step in timely diagnosis\nand treatment planning. However, many state-of-the-art segmentation methods\nrequire extensive computational resources and prolonged training times,\nlimiting their practical application in resource-constrained settings.

Braiding protocols which involve the\nphysical exchange of MZMs are typically envisioned on a network of topological\nsuperconducting wires. An essential component of these protocols is the\ntransport of MZMs, which can be performed by using electric gates to locally\ntune sections (\"piano keys\") of the wire between topologically trivial and\nnon-trivial phases. In this work, we numerically simulate this piano key\ntransport on a superconducting wire which contains either disorder\n(uncorrelated and correlated) or noise. We focus on the impact of these\nadditional effects on the diabatic error, which describes unwanted transitions\nbetween the ground state and excited states. We show that the behavior of the\naverage diabatic error is predominantly controlled by the statistics of the\nminimum bulk energy gap which is suppressed in the presence of disorder. The\nincrease in diabatic error can be several orders of magnitude and is most\ndeleterious when the disorder correlation length is a finite fraction of the\npiano key size and negligible when these lengths are far apart. In the presence\nof noise, the diabatic error is significantly enhanced due to optical\ntransitions which depend on the minimum bulk energy gap as well as the\nfrequency modes present in the noise.

    "abstract": "We study subgraph counting over fully dynamic graphs, which undergo edge\ninsertions and deletions. Counting subgraphs is a fundamental problem in graph\ntheory with numerous applications across various fields, including database\ntheory, social network analysis, and computational biology.\n  Maintaining the number of triangles in fully dynamic graphs is very well\nstudied and has an upper bound of O(m^{1/2}) for the update time by Kara, Ngo,\nNikolic, Olteanu, and Zhang (TODS 20). There is also a conditional lower bound\nof approximately Omega(m^{1/2}) for the update time by Henzinger, Krinninger,\nNanongkai, and Saranurak (STOC 15) under the OMv conjecture implying that\nO(m^{1/2}) is the ``right answer'' for the update time of counting triangles.\nMore recently, Hanauer, Henzinger, and Hua (SAND 22) studied the problem of\nmaintaining the number of 4-cycles in fully dynamic graphs and designed an\nalgorithm with O(m^{2/3}) update time which is a natural generalization of the\napproach for counting triangles. Thus, it seems natural that O(m^{2/3}) might\nbe the correct answer for the complexity of the update time for counting\n4-cycles.\n  In this work, we present an improved algorithm for maintaining the number of\n4-cycles in fully dynamic graphs. Our algorithm achieves a worst-case update\ntime of O(m^{2/3-eps}) for some constant eps>0. Our approach crucially uses\nfast matrix multiplication and leverages recent developments therein to get an\nimproved runtime. Using the current best value of the matrix multiplication\nexponent omega=2.371339 we get eps=0.009811 and if we assume the best possible\nexponent i.e. omega=2 then we get eps=1/24. The lower bound for the update time\nis Omega(m^{1/2}), so there is still a big gap between the best-known upper and\nlower bounds. The key message of our paper is demonstrating that O(m^{2/3}) is\nnot the correct answer for the complexity of the update time.",

This is at odds with most applications, where\ndistributions are rough predictions based on historical data. Thus, commonly,\nstochastic algorithms are making decisions using imperfect predicted\ndistributions, while trying to optimize over some unknown true distributions.\nWe consider the fundamental problem of scheduling stochastic jobs preemptively\non a single machine to minimize expected mean completion time in the setting\nwhere the scheduler is only given imperfect predicted job size distributions.\nIf the predicted distributions are perfect, then it is known that this problem\ncan be solved optimally by the Gittins index policy. The goal of our work is to\ndesign a scheduling policy that is robust in the sense that it produces nearly\noptimal schedules even if there are modest discrepancies between the predicted\ndistributions and the underlying real distributions. Our main contributions\nare:\n  (1) We show that the standard Gittins index policy is not robust in this\nsense. If the true distributions are perturbed by even an arbitrarily small\namount, then running the Gittins index policy using the perturbed distributions\ncan lead to an unbounded increase in mean completion time.\n  (2) We explain how to modify the Gittins index policy to make it robust, that\nis, to produce nearly optimal schedules, where the approximation depends on a\nnew measure of error between the true and predicted distributions that we\ndefine.\n  Looking forward, the approach we develop here can be applied more broadly to\nmany other stochastic optimization problems to better understand the impact of\nmispredictions, and lead to the development of new algorithms that are robust\nagainst such mispredictions.",

Current approaches struggle with temporal\nintegration and cross-modal associations that humans accomplish effortlessly\nthrough hippocampal-cortical networks. We introduce HippoMM, a\nbiologically-inspired architecture that transforms hippocampal mechanisms into\ncomputational advantages for multimodal understanding. HippoMM implements three\nkey innovations: (i) hippocampus-inspired pattern separation and completion\nspecifically designed for continuous audiovisual streams, (ii) short-to-long\nterm memory consolidation that transforms perceptual details into semantic\nabstractions, and (iii) cross-modal associative retrieval pathways enabling\nmodality-crossing queries. Unlike existing retrieval systems with static\nindexing schemes, HippoMM dynamically forms integrated episodic representations\nthrough adaptive temporal segmentation and dual-process memory encoding.\nEvaluations on our challenging HippoVlog benchmark demonstrate that HippoMM\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches (78.2% vs. 64.2%\naccuracy) while providing substantially faster response times (20.4s vs.\n112.5s). Our results demonstrate that translating neuroscientific memory\nprinciples into computational architectures provides a promising foundation for\nnext-generation multimodal understanding systems.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) and integrated\nvehicle-road-cloud systems has increased the demand for accurate, real-time HD\nmap updates. However, ensuring map reliability remains challenging due to\ninconsistencies in crowdsourced data, which suffer from motion blur, lighting\nvariations, adverse weather, and lane marking degradation. This paper\nintroduces CleanMAP, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based\ndistillation framework designed to filter and refine crowdsourced data for\nhigh-confidence HD map updates. CleanMAP leverages an MLLM-driven lane\nvisibility scoring model that systematically quantifies key visual parameters,\nassigning confidence scores (0-10) based on their impact on lane detection. A\nnovel dynamic piecewise confidence-scoring function adapts scores based on lane\nvisibility, ensuring strong alignment with human evaluations while effectively\nfiltering unreliable data. To further optimize map accuracy, a\nconfidence-driven local map fusion strategy ranks and selects the top-k\nhighest-scoring local maps within an optimal confidence range (best score minus\n10%), striking a balance between data quality and quantity. Experimental\nevaluations on a real-world autonomous vehicle dataset validate CleanMAP's\neffectiveness, demonstrating that fusing the top three local maps achieves the\nlowest mean map update error of 0.28m, outperforming the baseline (0.37m) and\nmeeting stringent accuracy thresholds (<= 0.32m). Further validation with\nreal-vehicle data confirms 84.88% alignment with human evaluators, reinforcing\nthe model's robustness and reliability. This work establishes CleanMAP as a\nscalable and deployable solution for crowdsourced HD map updates, ensuring more\nprecise and reliable autonomous navigation.

Now in phase B\n(preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure\ncompliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties\nsurrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG\ncosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the\nperformance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH)\nlight cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited\nresolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing.\nThe resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to\ncurrent X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a\nhigher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested\nby recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts\n250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z > 3 and 35 in the Epoch of\nReionization (z > 6); notably, only AGN with LX > 43.5 erg/s are detectable at\nz > 6.

In contrast, intelligent\ntransportation systems (ITS) prefer to steer driver-vehicle systems (DVS)\ntoward system-optimal route recommendations, which are primarily designed to\nmitigate network congestion. However, due to the misalignment in motives,\ndrivers exhibit a lack of trust in the ITS. This paper models the interaction\nbetween a DVS and an ITS as a novel, multi-stage routing game where the DVS\nexhibits dynamics in its trust towards the recommendations of ITS based on\ncounterfactual and observed game outcomes. Specifically, DVS and ITS are\nrespectively modeled as a travel-time minimizer and network congestion\nminimizer, each having nonidentical prior beliefs about the network state. A\nnovel approximate algorithm to compute the Bayesian Nash equilibrium, called\nROSTER(Recommendation Outcome Sampling with Trust Estimation and\nRe-evaluation), is proposed based on Monte Carlo sampling with trust belief\nupdating to determine the best response route recommendations of the ITS at\neach stage of the game. Simulation results demonstrate that the trust\nprediction error in the proposed algorithm converges to zero with a growing\nnumber of multi-stage DVS-ITS interactions and is effectively able to both\nmitigate congestion and reduce driver travel times when compared to alternative\nroute recommendation strategies.",

In this\npaper, we present our experience teaching a course on self-adaptive software\nsystems that integrates theoretical knowledge and hands-on learning with\nindustry-relevant technologies. To close the gap between academic education and\nindustry practices, we incorporated guest lectures from experts and showcases\nfeaturing industry professionals as judges, improving technical and\ncommunication skills for our students. Feedback based on surveys from 21\nstudents indicates significant improvements in their understanding of\nself-adaptive systems. The empirical analysis of the developed course\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed course syllabus and teaching\nmethodology. In addition, we provide a summary of the educational challenges of\nrunning this unique course, including balancing theory and practice, addressing\nthe diverse backgrounds and motivations of students, and integrating the\nindustry-relevant technologies. We believe these insights can provide valuable\nguidance for educating students in other emerging topics within software\nengineering.",

    "abstract": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) presents critical challenges due to\nthe inherent trade-offs associated with key performance metrics, such as\nlatency, accuracy, and throughput. Typically, gains in one metric is\naccompanied with degradation in others. Early-Exit LLMs (EE-LLMs) efficiently\nnavigate this trade-off space by skipping some of the later model layers when\nit confidently finds an output token early, thus reducing latency without\nimpacting accuracy. However, as the early exits taken depend on the task and\nare unknown apriori to request processing, EE-LLMs conservatively load the\nentire model, limiting resource savings and throughput. Also, current\nframeworks statically select a model for a user task, limiting our ability to\nadapt to changing nature of the input queries.\n  We propose HELIOS to address these challenges. First, HELIOS shortlists a set\nof candidate LLMs, evaluates them using a subset of prompts, gathering\ntelemetry data in real-time. Second, HELIOS uses the early exit data from these\nevaluations to greedily load the selected model only up to a limited number of\nlayers. This approach yields memory savings which enables us to process more\nrequests at the same time, thereby improving throughput. Third, HELIOS monitors\nand periodically reassesses the performance of the candidate LLMs and if\nneeded, switches to another model that can service incoming queries more\nefficiently (such as using fewer layers without lowering accuracy). Our\nevaluations show that HELIOS achieves 1.48$\\times$ throughput, 1.10$\\times$\nenergy-efficiency, 1.39$\\times$ lower response time, and 3.7$\\times$\nimprovements in inference batch sizes compared to the baseline, when optimizing\nfor the respective service level objectives.",

Harnessing the experimental identification of effective interactions\namong neuronal units involved in stick insect stepping pattern generation,\nprevious studies proposed computational models simulating aspects of stick\ninsect locomotor activity. While these models generate diverse stepping\npatterns and transitions between them, there has not been an in-depth analysis\nof the mechanisms underlying their dynamics. In this study, we focus on\nmodeling rhythm generation by the neurons associated with the\nprotraction-retraction, levitation-depression, and extension-flexion\nantagonistic muscle pairs of the mesothoracic (middle) leg of stick insects.\nOur model features a reduced central pattern generator (CPG) circuit for each\njoint and includes synaptic interactions among the CPGs; we also consider\nextensions such as the inclusion of motoneuron pools controlled by the CPG\ncomponents. The resulting network is described by an 18-dimensional system of\nordinary differential equations. We use fast-slow decomposition, projection\ninto interacting phase planes, and a heavy reliance on input-dependent\nnullclines to analyze this model. Specifically, we identify and elucidate\ndynamic mechanisms capable of generating a stepping rhythm, with a sequence of\nbiologically constrained phase relationships, in a three-joint stick insect\nlimb model. Furthermore, we explain the robustness to parameter changes and\ntunability of these patterns.

In this study, we introduce a novel methodology\nthat leverages Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) to attempt to improve both the\nefficiency and accuracy of FWI. The proposed DeepONet methodology inverts\nseismic waveforms for the subsurface velocity field. This approach is able to\ncapture some key features of the subsurface velocity field.

We also test our proposed\nmethod with out-of-distribution prediction for different velocity models. The\nproposed DeepONet shows comparable and better accuracy in some velocity models\nthan some other machine learning methods. To improve the FWI workflow, we\npropose using the DeepONet output as a starting model for conventional FWI and\nthat it may improve FWI performance. While we have only shown that DeepONet\nfacilitates faster convergence than starting with a homogeneous velocity field,\nit may have some benefits compared to other approaches to constructing starting\nmodels.

It\naddresses critical challenges related to fairness, transparency, and ethical\nimplications in these systems, providing a comparative analysis of key tasks\nsuch as Visual Question Answering (VQA), image captioning, and visual dialogue.\nBackground: Multimodal models, particularly vision-language models, enhance\nartificial intelligence (AI) capabilities by integrating visual and textual\ndata, mimicking human learning processes. Despite significant advancements, the\ntrustworthiness of these models remains a crucial concern, particularly as AI\nsystems increasingly confront issues regarding fairness, transparency, and\nethics. Methods: This review examines research conducted from 2017 to 2024\nfocusing on forenamed core vision-language tasks.

Traditional ML and DL methods are often\nhampered by challenges such as the need for extensive training data,\ncatastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language\nModels have emerged as powerful alternatives for code-related tasks, but their\npotential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make\ntwo contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including\nGPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional\nsequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and\n(2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to\naddress the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework\nintegrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious\nPHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the\nmost behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function\nProfiling that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant\ndemonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results\nshow that, stemming from their distinct analytical strategies, larger LLMs\nachieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit\nthe opposite trade-off. However, all baseline models lag behind previous SOTA\nmethods. With the application of BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improves\nsignificantly, yielding an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Notably, larger\nmodels now outperform SOTA benchmarks, while smaller models such as\nQwen-2.5-Coder-3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods.\nThis work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for\nWebShell detection and provides solutions to address the challenges in this\ntask.",

While EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, they contribute to an\nincrease in another type of vehicular emission: tire emissions.\nBattery-operated EVs are generally heavier than their combustion-engine\ncounterparts and require greater acceleration forces, which their high-torque\nelectric motors provide. This combination of increased weight and traction\nforces leads to higher tire emissions, which possess various adverse health and\nenvironmental effects. Here, we propose a control solution with promising\nresults in mitigating tire wear in all-wheel-drive EVs.

Derived from detailed mathematical analyses, we\npropose a simple control scheme to counteract the performance difference from\nusing the low-traction tires. The proposed control mechanism then distributes\ntorque optimally between the two axes, maximizing usage from the low-wear axis\nand simultaneously maintaining stability and performance by leveraging\nhigh-traction tires.

By realistically\nrepresenting the long-term water balance, the model revealed widespread shifts\n- up to ~20% over 20 years - in fundamental green-blue-water partitioning and\nbaseflow ratios worldwide. Shifts in these response patterns, previously\nconsidered static, contributed to increasing flood risks in northern\nmid-latitudes, heightening water supply stresses in southern subtropical\nregions, and declining freshwater inputs to many European estuaries, all with\necological implications.

Here, we model the optical/infrared light curves of the GW170817\nkilonova, using the properties and physical conditions of the ejecta as\ninferred from detailed modeling of its spectra. Using our software tool SPARK,\nwe first infer the $r$-process abundance pattern of the kilonova ejecta from\nspectra obtained at 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, and 4.4 days post-merger. From these\nabundances, we compute time-dependent radioactive heating rates and the\nwavelength-, time-, and velocity-dependent opacities of the ejecta. We use\nthese inferred heating rates and opacities to inform a kilonova light curve\nmodel, to self-consistently reproduce the observed early-time light curves and\nto infer a total ejecta mass of $M_{\\mathrm{ej}} = {0.11}~M_{\\odot}$, towards\nthe higher end of that inferred from previous studies. The combination of a\nlarge ejecta mass from our light curve modeling and the presence of both red\nand blue ejecta from our spectral modeling suggests the existence of a highly\nmagnetized hypermassive neutron star remnant that survives for $\\sim$$0.01 -\n0.5$ s and launches a blue wind, followed by fast, red neutron-rich winds\nlaunched from a magnetized accretion disk.

Since the utility of most unsafe answers (e.g., bomb\ninstructions) is hard to evaluate rigorously, we build new jailbreak evaluation\nsets with known ground truth answers, by aligning models to refuse questions\nrelated to benign and easy-to-evaluate topics (e.g., biology or math).

We consider a fluid model in which continuous flows of\nrequests arrive at different frontends and need to be routed to distant\nbackends for processing whose processing rates are workload dependent. Network\nlatencies can lead to long travel times for requests and delayed feedback from\nbackends. The objective is to minimize the average latency of requests,\ncomposed of the network latency and the serving latency at the backends.\n  We introduce Distributed Gradient Descent Load Balancing (DGD-LB), a\nprobabilistic routing algorithm in which each frontend adjusts the routing\nprobabilities dynamically using gradient descent. Our algorithm is distributed:\nthere is no coordination between frontends, except by observing the delayed\nimpact other frontends have on shared backends. The algorithm uses an\napproximate gradient that measures the marginal impact of an additional request\nevaluated at a delayed system state. Equilibrium points of our algorithm\nminimize the centralized optimal average latencies, and we provide a novel\nlocal stability analysis showing that our algorithm converges to an optimal\nsolution when started sufficiently close to that point. Moreover, we present\nsufficient conditions on the step-size of gradient descent that guarantee\nconvergence in the presence of network latencies. Numerical experiments show\nthat our algorithm is globally stable and optimal, confirm our stability\nconditions are nearly tight, and demonstrate that DGD-LB can lead to\nsubstantial gains relative to other load balancers studied in the literature\nwhen network latencies are large.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the growing impact of large language models (LLMs) and\nGenerative AI (GenAI) tools on Internet traffic, focusing on their role as a\nnew and significant source of network load. As these AI tools continue to gain\nimportance in applications ranging from virtual assistants to content\ngeneration, the volume of traffic they generate is expected to increase\nmassively. These models use the Internet as the global infrastructure for\ndelivering multimedia messages (text, voice, images, video, etc.) to users, by\ninterconnecting users and devices with AI agents typically deployed in the\ncloud. We believe this represents a new paradigm that will lead to a\nconsiderable increase in network traffic, and network operators must be\nprepared to address the resulting demands. To support this claim, we provide a\nproof-of-concept and source code for measuring traffic in remote user-agent\ninteractions, estimating the traffic generated per prompt for some of the most\npopular open-source LLMs in 2025. The average size of each prompt query and\nresponse is 7,593 bytes, with a standard deviation of 369 bytes. These numbers\nare comparable with email and web browsing traffic. However, we envision AI as\nthe next \"killer application\" that will saturate networks with traffic, such as\nPeer-to-Peer traffic and Video-on-demand dominated in previous decades.",

    "abstract": "If we two-colour a circle, we can always find an inscribed triangle with\nangles $(\\frac{\\pi}{7},\\frac{2\\pi}{7},\\frac{4\\pi}{7})$ whose three vertices\nhave the same colour. In fact, Bialostocki and Nielsen showed that it is enough\nto consider the colours on the vertices of an inscribed heptagon. We prove that\nfor every other triangle $T$ there is a two-colouring of the circle without any\nmonochromatic copy of $T$.\n  More generally, for $k\\geq 3$, call a $k$-tuple $(d_1,d_2,\\dots,d_k)$ with\n$d_1\\geq d_2\\geq \\dots \\geq d_k>0$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^k d_i=1$ a Ramsey $k$-tuple\nif the following is true: in every two-colouring of the circle of unit\nperimeter, there is a monochromatic $k$-tuple of points in which the distances\nof cyclically consecutive points, measured along the arcs, are\n$d_1,d_2,\\dots,d_k$ in some order. By a conjecture of Stromquist, if\n$d_i=\\frac{2^{k-i}}{2^k-1}$, then $(d_1,\\dots,d_k)$ is Ramsey.\n  Our main result is a proof of the converse of this conjecture. That is, we\nshow that if $(d_1,\\dots,d_k)$ is Ramsey, then $d_i=\\frac{2^{k-i}}{2^k-1}$. We\ndo this by finding connections of the problem to certain questions from number\ntheory about partitioning $\\mathbb{N}$ into so-called Beatty sequences. We also\ndisprove a majority version of Stromquist's conjecture, study a robust version,\nand discuss a discrete version.",

Yet, precise control of their transport\ncharacteristics has remained elusive, thereby limiting the performance of\nsolid-state electrochemical devices. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented\nmanipulation of space charge controlled ionic grain boundary resistance (up to\n12 orders of magnitude) in metal oxide thin films. We exploit the orders of\nmagnitude higher grain boundary diffusivities of substrate cation elements\n(i.e. Al from $Al_2O_3$ and Mg from MgO) relative to the bulk to modify the\ngrain boundary chemistry, and thereby GB core charge, in a model oxygen ion\nconducting polycrystalline thin film solid electrolyte, Gd-doped $CeO_2$. This\napproach, confirmed jointly by TEM imaging and by extracting the respective GB\nand bulk diffusivities from measured SIMS profiles, enabled us to selectively\ncontrol the chemistry of the GBs, while minimally modifying grain (bulk)\nchemistry or film microstructure, thereby ruling out potential effects of\nmicrostructure, strain or secondary phases. Broad tuning of GB space charge\npotentials is achieved by manipulating GB core charge density by over an order\nof magnitude, thereby providing a powerful tool for systematic studies of grain\nboundary phenomena across various functional materials. The implications of\nsuch control are far-reaching in achieving new functionality, improving\nefficiency and longevity of solid-state electrochemical devices.",

As\nthis airglow can even outshine scattered moonlight in the near-infrared regime,\nthe understanding of the Earth's night-sky brightness requires good knowledge\nof the complex airglow emission spectrum and its variability. As airglow\nmodelling is very challenging, the comprehensive characterisation of airglow\nemission requires large data sets of empirical data. For fixed locations, this\ncan be best achieved by archived spectra of large astronomical telescopes with\na wide wavelength coverage, high spectral resolving power, and good temporal\nsampling. Using 10 years of data from the X-shooter echelle spectrograph in the\nwavelength range from 0.3 to 2.5 $\\mu$m and additional data from the\nUltraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at\nCerro Paranal in Chile, we have succeeded to build a comprehensive\nspectroscopic airglow model for this low-latitude site under consideration of\ntheoretical data from the HITRAN database for molecules and from different\nsources for atoms. The Paranal Airglow Line And Continuum Emission (PALACE)\nmodel comprises 9 chemical species, 26,541 emission lines, and 3 unresolved\ncontinuum components. Moreover, there are climatologies of relative intensity,\nsolar cycle effect, and residual variability with respect to local time and day\nof year for 23 variability classes. Spectra can be calculated with a\nstand-alone code for different conditions, also including optional atmospheric\nabsorption and scattering. In comparison to the observed X-shooter spectra,\nPALACE shows convincing agreement and is significantly better than the\nprevious, widely used airglow model for Cerro Paranal.",

    "abstract": "While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly\nenhanced performance across diverse natural language tasks, the high\ncomputational and financial costs associated with their deployment remain\nsubstantial barriers. Existing routing strategies partially alleviate this\nchallenge by assigning queries to cheaper or specialized models, but they\nfrequently rely on extensive labeled data or fragile task-specific heuristics.\nConversely, fusion techniques aggregate multiple LLM outputs to boost accuracy\nand robustness, yet they often exacerbate cost and may reinforce shared biases.\n  We introduce EMAFusion, a new framework that self-optimizes for seamless LLM\nselection and reliable execution for a given query. Specifically, EMAFusion\nintegrates a taxonomy-based router for familiar query types, a learned router\nfor ambiguous inputs, and a cascading approach that progressively escalates\nfrom cheaper to more expensive models based on multi-judge confidence\nevaluations. Through extensive evaluations, we find EMAFusion outperforms the\nbest individual models by over 2.6 percentage points (94.3% vs. 91.7%), while\nbeing 4X cheaper than the average cost. EMAFusion further achieves a remarkable\n17.1 percentage point improvement over models like GPT-4 at less than 1/20th\nthe cost. Our combined routing approach delivers 94.3% accuracy compared to\ntaxonomy-based (88.1%) and learned model predictor-based (91.7%) methods alone,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our unified strategy. Finally, EMAFusion\nsupports flexible cost-accuracy trade-offs, allowing users to balance their\nbudgetary constraints and performance needs.",

    "abstract": "High-yield inertial fusion offers a transformative path to affordable clean\nfirm power and advanced defense capabilities. Recent milestones at large\nfacilities, particularly the National Ignition Facility (NIF), have\ndemonstrated the feasibility of ignition but highlight the need for approaches\nthat can deliver large amounts of energy to fusion targets at much higher\nefficiency and lower cost. We propose that pulser-driven inertial fusion energy\n(IFE), which uses high-current pulsed-power technology to compress targets to\nthermonuclear conditions, can achieve this goal. In this paper, we detail the\nphysics basis for pulser IFE, focusing on magnetized liner inertial fusion\n(MagLIF), where cylindrical metal liners compress DT fuel under strong magnetic\nfields and pre-heat. We discuss how the low implosion velocities, direct-drive\nefficiency, and scalable pulser architecture can achieve ignition-level\nconditions at low capital cost. Our multi-dimensional simulations, benchmarked\nagainst experiments at the Z facility, show that scaling from 20 MA to 50-60 MA\nof current enables net facility gain. We then introduce our Demonstration\nSystem (DS), a pulsed-power driver designed to deliver more than 60 MA and\nstore approximately 80 MJ of energy. The DS is designed to achieve a 1000x\nincrease in effective performance compared to the NIF, delivering approximately\n100x greater facility-level energy gain -- and importantly, achieving net\nfacility gain, or Qf>1 -- at just 1/10 the capital cost. We also examine the\nengineering requirements for repetitive operation, target fabrication, and\nchamber maintenance, highlighting a practical roadmap to commercial power\nplants.",

    "abstract": "We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising\nmodels in a transverse field $g$, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field\n$h$ across their {\\em magnetic} first-order quantum transition at $h=0$, for\nsufficiently small values of $|g|$. We consider nearest-neighbor Ising chains\nof size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. We focus on the\nout-of-equilibrium behavior arising from Kibble-Zurek protocols, in which $h$\nis varied linearly in time with time scale $t_s$, i.e., $h(t)=t/t_s$. The\nsystem starts from the ground state at $h_i\\equiv h(t_i)<0$, where the\nlongitudinal magnetization $M$ is negative. Then it evolves unitarily up to\npositive values of $h(t)$, where $M(t)$ becomes eventually positive. We\nidentify several scaling regimes characterized by a nontrivial interplay\nbetween the size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$, which can be observed when the\nsystem is close to one of the many avoided level crossings that occur for $h\\ge\n0$. In the $L\\to\\infty$ limit, all these crossings approach $h=0^+$, making the\nstudy of the thermodynamic limit, defined as the limit $L\\to\\infty$ keeping $t$\nand $t_s$ constant, problematic. We study such limit numerically, by first\ndetermining the large-$L$ quantum evolution at fixed $t_s$, and then analyzing\nits behavior with increasing $t_s$. Our analysis shows that the system switches\nfrom the initial state with $M<0$ to a positively magnetized state at $h =\nh_*(t_s)>0$, where $h_*(t_s)$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, apparently as\n$h_*\\sim 1/\\ln t_s$. This suggests the existence of a scaling behavior in terms\nof the rescaled time $\\Omega = t \\ln t_s/t_s$. The numerical results also show\nthat the system converges to a nontrivial stationary state in the large-$t$\nlimit, characterized by an energy significantly larger than that of the\ncorresponding homogeneously magnetized ground state.",

These high Mg\nand Ca contents are observed at low temperatures and high silica content in the\nsilicate melt, respectively. High-pressure melts (2 to 5 GPa, 160--400 km depth\nin Mercury) are Mg-rich, similar to those in Mercury's high-magnesium region\n(HMR), while low-pressure melts (0.5 to 1 GPa, 40--80 km depth) are Si-rich,\ncomparable to the northern volcanic plains (NVP).

We investigated the orbital-phase spectral\nvariability over the two orbital cycles. We divided the entire observation data\ninto multiple segments, each covering an orbital interval of\n$\\Delta\\Phi=0.005$. The phenomenological spectral modeling applied to these\norbital-phase-resolved spectra reveals that the photon index is the key\nparameter with the most variability and a strong correlation with the continuum\nflux. The photon index becomes softer during the high-flux phases and harder in\nthe low-flux phases. The relation between the photon index and continuum flux\nremains consistent when investigating specific spin phases, suggesting that the\nspectral variability originates from extrinsic factors apart from the neutron\nstar. Furthermore, the 3-5 keV pulse fraction also exhibits variability, being\nenhanced in the high-flux phases and suppressed in the low-flux phases, which\nindicates the presence of multiple emission components with different pulse\nfractions. These phenomenological analysis results enabled us to estimate the\nphysical origin of the spectral variability. We successfully fitted the\norbital-phase-resolved spectra with a physical model that assumes (1) stable\nemission from the neutron star, (2) attenuation by inhomogeneous, clumpy\nstellar wind, and (3) an additional non-pulsed emission component arising from\nthermal emission from the accretion disk.

    "abstract": "Optimal statistical decisions should transcend the language used to describe\nthem. Yet, how do we guarantee that the choice of coordinates - the\nparameterisation of an optimisation problem - does not subtly dictate the\nsolution? This paper reveals a fundamental geometric invariance principle. We\nfirst analyse the optimal combination of two asymptotically normal estimators\nunder a strictly convex trace-AMSE risk. While methods for finding optimal\nweights are known, we prove that the resulting optimal estimator is invariant\nunder direct affine reparameterisations of the weighting scheme. This\nexemplifies a broader principle we term meta-equivariance: the unique minimiser\nof any strictly convex, differentiable scalar objective over a matrix space\ntransforms covariantly under any invertible affine reparameterisation of that\nspace. Distinct from classical statistical equivariance tied to data\nsymmetries, meta-equivariance arises from the immutable geometry of convex\noptimisation itself. It guarantees that optimality, in these settings, is not\nan artefact of representation but an intrinsic, coordinate-free truth.",

    "abstract": "The growing use of large language models has raised environmental and\neconomic concerns about their intensity of resource usage during inference.\nServing these models to each user requires substantial energy and water for\ncooling. Model compression techniques like quantization can shrink large\nlanguage models and make them more resource efficient at the cost of potential\nperformance degradation. Quantization methods compress model size through\nreplacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower\nprecision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy\npreservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to\nextend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we\nlook into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's\npartial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ\nmethod with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key\ninsights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through\nfull retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This\ngain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware\ntraining. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we\npropose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends\nits performance without the need for full retraining. This publicly available\nmethod relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes\npreserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments\non LLaMA 7B and 13B benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces the ApiQ's\naccuracy degradation by 10.85% and 7.54% respectively.

    "abstract": "Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) is a popular framework for estimating a\ncausal effect in settings where treatment is assigned if an observed covariate\nexceeds a fixed threshold. We consider estimation and inference in the common\nsetting where the sample consists of multiple known sub-populations with\npotentially heterogeneous treatment effects. In the applied literature, it is\ncommon to account for heterogeneity by either fitting a parametric model or\nconsidering each sub-population separately. In contrast, we develop a Bayesian\nhierarchical model using Gaussian process regression which allows for\nnon-parametric regression while borrowing information across sub-populations.\nWe derive the posterior distribution, prove posterior consistency, and develop\na Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampling algorithm. In extensive\nsimulations, we show that the proposed procedure outperforms existing methods\nin both estimation and inferential tasks. Finally, we apply our procedure to\nU.S. Senate election data and discover an incumbent party advantage which is\nheterogeneous over different time periods.",

    "abstract": "The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is an algorithm for finding the\nground states of a given Hamiltonian. Its application to binary-formulated\ncombinatorial optimization (CO) has been widely studied in recent years.\nHowever, typical VQE approaches for CO problems often suffer from local minima\nor barren plateaus, limiting their ability to achieve optimal solutions. The\nquantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) offers an alternative approach for\neffective ground-state preparation but requires large circuits to approximate\nnon-unitary operations. Although compressed QITE (cQITE) reduces circuit depth,\naccumulated errors eventually cause energy increases. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an Adaptive Weighted QITE-VQE (AWQV) algorithm that\nintegrates the VQE gradients with the cQITE updates through an adaptive\nweighting scheme during optimization. In numerical simulations for MaxCut on\nunweighted regular graphs, AWQV achieves near-optimal approximation ratios,\nwhile for weighted Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi instances, it outperforms the classical\nGoemans-Williamson algorithm.",

While written\ncommunication can signal identity through lexical and stylistic choices,\nvoice-based interactions inherently amplify socioindexical elements - such as\naccent, intonation, and speech style - which more prominently convey social\nidentity and group affiliation. There is evidence that even passive media such\nas television is likely to influence the audience's linguistic patterns. Unlike\npassive media, conversational AI is interactive, creating a more immersive and\nreciprocal dynamic that holds a greater potential to impact how individuals\nspeak in everyday interactions. Such heightened influence can be expected to\narise from phenomena such as acoustic-prosodic entrainment and linguistic\naccommodation, which occur naturally during interaction and enable users to\nadapt their speech patterns in response to the system. While this phenomenon is\nstill emerging, its potential societal impact could provide organisations,\nmovements, and brands with a subtle yet powerful avenue for shaping and\ncontrolling public perception and social identity.

Although numerous algorithms have been developed for the\nRide-pool Assignment Problem (RAP) -- a core component of ride-pooling systems,\nthere is a lack of open-source implementations, making it difficult to\nbenchmark these algorithms on a common dataset and objective. In this paper, we\npresent the implementation details of a ride-pool simulator that encompasses\nseveral key ride-pool assignment algorithms, along with associated components\nsuch as vehicle routing and rebalancing. We also open-source a highly optimized\nand modular C++ codebase, designed to facilitate the extension of new\nalgorithms and features. Additionally, we introduce a family of swapping-based\nlocal-search heuristics to enhance existing ride-pool assignment algorithms,\nachieving a better balance between performance and computational efficiency.\nExtensive experiments on a large-scale, real-world dataset from Manhattan, NYC\nreveal that while all selected algorithms perform comparably, the newly\nproposed Multi-Round Linear Assignment with Cyclic Exchange (LA-MR-CE)\nalgorithm achieves a state-of-the-art service rate with significantly reduced\ncomputational time.

    "abstract": "Estimating the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between language models has\nmany applications, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF),\ninterpretability, and knowledge distillation. However, computing the exact KL\ndivergence between two arbitrary language models is intractable. Thus,\npractitioners often resort to the use of sampling-based estimators. While it is\neasy to fashion a simple Monte Carlo (MC) estimator that provides an unbiased\nestimate of the KL divergence between language models, this estimator\nnotoriously suffers from high variance, and can even result in a negative\nestimate of the KL divergence, a non-negative quantity. In this paper, we\nintroduce a Rao--Blackwellized estimator that is also unbiased and provably has\nvariance less than or equal to that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator. In\nan empirical study on sentiment-controlled fine-tuning, we show that our\nestimator provides more stable KL estimates and reduces variance substantially\nin practice. Additionally, we derive an analogous Rao--Blackwellized estimator\nof the gradient of the KL divergence, which leads to more stable training and\nproduces models that more frequently appear on the Pareto frontier of reward\nvs. KL compared to the ones trained with the MC estimator of the gradient.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there is no general theory for deriving diffusion approximations\nof queueing systems with high- or infinite-dimensional state descriptors. In\nthis paper, we address this by developing a novel framework for deriving\ndiffusion limit equations of queueing models. The method hinges on a martingale\ndecomposition of dynamics driven by time-changed renewal processes, which are a\ncommon feature of many queueing models. We then prove a central limit theorem\nfor models decomposed in this way, which gives the form of stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDEs) that will be satisfied in the diffusion limit of\nsuch a system. Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require state\nspace collapse or tractable workload representations, enabling its application\nto systems with features such as reneging. We demonstrate the approach on a\nmulticlass, multi-server random order of service queue with reneging and\ngenerally distributed interarrival, service, and patience times. In this\nsetting, the state descriptor is measure-valued and the workload is nonlinear\nin the fluid limit. We prove tightness and derive SDEs satisfied by the\ndiffusion limit.

As evidenced by the presence of similar\nexpressions across languages and cultures, this phenomenon represents a\nuniversal feature of human conversation. At the same time, the meaning\nattributed to silence can differ greatly across national, cultural, and\ninterpersonal contexts. Consequently, a wide range of studies have focused on\nthe impact of silence on organizational productivity, its relationship to ideas\nand creativity, and its potential effectiveness in medical settings. Despite\nthe important role that silence plays, very few studies have attempted to\ncharacterize its features using mathematical modeling. In this study, we\npropose a Markov chain model to describe the dynamics of silence in a\nco-present group and attempt to analyze its behavior. Our results reveal a\nphase-transition-like phenomenon, where the probability of silence abruptly\ndrops to zero once individuals' awareness of the surrounding conversation falls\nbelow a critical threshold. In other words, such silence can emerge only when\nindividuals retain a minimal degree of mutual awareness of those around them.\nThe model proposed in this study not only offers a deeper understanding of\nconversational dynamics, but also holds potential for contributing to\nintercultural communication, organizational productivity, and medical practice.",

    "abstract": "Scheduling a stream of jobs whose holding cost changes over time is a classic\nand practical problem. Specifically, each job is associated with a holding cost\n(penalty), where a job's instantaneous holding cost is some increasing function\nof its class and current age (the time it has spent in the system since its\narrival). The goal is to schedule the jobs to minimize the time-average total\nholding cost across all jobs.\n  The seminal paper on this problem, by Van Mieghem in 1995, introduced the\ngeneralized c-mu rule for scheduling jobs. Since then, this problem has\nattracted significant interest but remains challenging due to the absence of a\nfinite-dimensional state space formulation. Consequently, subsequent works\nfocus on more tractable versions of this problem.\n  This paper returns to the original problem, deriving a heuristic that\nempirically improves upon the generalized c-mu rule and all existing\nheuristics. Our approach is to first translate the holding cost minimization\nproblem to a novel Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (R-MAB) problem with a finite\nnumber of arms. Based on our R-MAB, we derive a novel Whittle Index policy,\nwhich is both elegant and intuitive.",

Within the flare ribbon,\nthe intensities of the Si IV 1402.77, C II 1334.53 and Mg II k 2796.35 lines\npeaked at different times, with the transition region Si IV typically peaking\nbefore the chromospheric Mg II line by 1 - 6 seconds. To understand the nature\nof these delays, we probed a grid of radiative hydrodynamic flare simulations\nheated by electron beams, thermal conduction-only, or Alfv\\'en waves. Electron\nbeam parameters were constrained by hard X-ray observations from the Gamma-ray\nBurst Monitor (GBM) onboard the Fermi spacecraft. Reproducing lightcurves where\nSi IV peaks precede those in Mg II proved to be a challenge, as only a subset\nof Fermi/GBM-constrained electron beam models were consistent with the\nobservations. Lightcurves with relative timings consistent with the\nobservations were found in simulations heated by either high-flux electron\nbeams or by Alfv\\'en waves, while the thermal conduction heating does not\nreplicate the observed delays.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can perform reasoning computations both\ninternally within their latent space and externally by generating explicit\ntoken sequences like chains of thought. Significant progress in enhancing\nreasoning abilities has been made by scaling test-time compute. However,\nunderstanding and quantifying model-internal reasoning abilities - the\ninferential \"leaps\" models make between individual token predictions - remains\ncrucial. This study introduces a benchmark (n = 4,000 items) designed to\nquantify model-internal reasoning in different domains. We achieve this by\nhaving LLMs indicate the correct solution to reasoning problems not through\ndescriptive text, but by selecting a specific language of their initial\nresponse token that is different from English, the benchmark language. This not\nonly requires models to reason beyond their context window, but also to\noverrise their default tendency to respond in the same language as the prompt,\nthereby posing an additional cognitive strain. We evaluate a set of 18 LLMs,\nshowing significant performance variations, with GPT-4.5 achieving the highest\naccuracy (74.7%), outperforming models like Grok-2 (67.2%), and Llama 3.1 405B\n(65.6%). Control experiments and difficulty scaling analyses suggest that while\nLLMs engage in internal reasoning, we cannot rule out heuristic exploitations\nunder certain conditions, marking an area for future investigation. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that LLMs can \"think\" via latent-space computations,\nrevealing model-internal inference strategies that need further understanding,\nespecially regarding safety-related concerns such as covert planning,\ngoal-seeking, or deception emerging without explicit token traces.",

We address this\nissue by proposing Energy Matching, a framework that endows flow-based\napproaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far from the data manifold, samples\nmove along curl-free, optimal transport paths from noise to data. As they\napproach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a\nBoltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying\nlikelihood structure of the data. We parameterize this dynamic with a single\ntime-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a\nflexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. Our method\nsubstantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in\nterms of fidelity, while retaining simulation-free training of transport-based\napproaches away from the data manifold. Furthermore, we leverage the method's\nflexibility to introduce an interaction energy that supports diverse mode\nexploration, which we demonstrate in a controlled protein-generation setting.\nOur approach focuses on learning a scalar potential energy--without\ntime-conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks--which marks a\nsignificant departure from recent EBM methods.

We also comment on the validity of the heuristic Gaussian\nrandom noise (GRN) model, through comparisons with our exact simulations: We\nfind discrepancies in the stabilizer expectation values when homodyne\nmeasurement is involved in cluster state preparation, yet we find a close\nagreement between the two approaches on average.",

However, extracting concentration information from the NIR\nspectrum requires training a statistical model on a large collection of\nmeasurements, which can be impractical, expensive, or dangerous. In this work,\nwe propose a method for simulating NIR spectra on a quantum computer, as part\nof a larger workflow to improve NIR-based chemical detection. The quantum\nalgorithm is highly optimized, exhibiting a cost reduction of many orders of\nmagnitude relative to prior approaches. The main optimizations include the\nlocalization of vibrational modes, an efficient real-space-based representation\nof the Hamiltonian with a quantum arithmetic-based implementation of the\ntime-evolution, optimal Trotter step size determination, and specific targeting\nof the NIR region. Overall, our algorithm achieves a O(M^2) scaling, compared\nwith the O(M^12) coming from equivalent high-accuracy classical methods. As a\nconcrete application, we show that simulating the spectrum of azidoacetylene\n(HC2N3), a highly explosive molecule with strong anharmonicities consisting of\nM = 12 vibrational modes, requires circuits with a maximum 8.47 x 10^8 T gates\nand 173 logical qubits.

Leveraging insights from [GST24] where certain qubits play an\noutsized role in the amplitude encoding, we extend the hierarchical learning\nframework to encode images into quantum states. We successfully load digits\nfrom the MNIST dataset as well as road scenes from the Honda Scenes dataset.\nAdditionally, we consider the use of block amplitude encoding, where different\nparts of the image are encoded in a tensor product of smaller states. The\nsimulations and overall orchestration of workflows was done on the BlueQubit\nplatform.

    "abstract": "The Tully-Fisher relation is a vital distance indicator, but its precise\ninference is challenged by selection bias, statistical bias, and uncertain\ninclination corrections. This study presents a Bayesian framework that\nsimultaneously addresses these issues. To eliminate the need for individual\ninclination corrections, inclination is treated as a latent variable with a\nknown probability distribution. To correct for the distance-dependent Malmquist\nbias arising from sample selection, the model incorporates Gaussian scatter in\nthe dependent variable, the distribution of the independent variable, and the\nobservational selection function into the data likelihood. To mitigate the\nstatistical bias -- termed the ``general Eddington bias'' -- caused by Gaussian\nscatter and the non-uniform distribution of the independent variable, two\nmethods are introduced: (1) analytical bias corrections applied to the\ndependent variable before likelihood computation, and (2) a dual-scatter model\nthat accounts for Gaussian scatter in the independent variable within the\nlikelihood function. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated using\nsimulated datasets. By rigorously addressing selection and statistical biases\nin a latent-variable regression analysis, this work provides a robust approach\nfor unbiased distance estimates from standardizable candles, which is critical\nfor improving the accuracy of Hubble constant determinations.",

We first prove that such dynamics necessarily satisfy the second law.\nWe then show how these dynamics may be constructed, proposing dynamics that\ngeneralise the standard Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for classical\nsystems in thermal environments to include back-reaction from a quantum degree\nof freedom. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for\ncompletely-positive, linear and continuous classical-quantum dynamics to\nsatisfy detailed balance, we find this property satisfied by our dynamics. To\nillustrate the formalism and its applications we introduce two models.

In particular, the GRAND project aims to observe\nthe $\\nu_\\tau$ and $\\bar \\nu_\\tau$ components of the cosmogenic neutrino flux\nin the near future using radio antennas. In this work, we investigate how the\ndetection of cosmogenic neutrinos by GRAND can be used to probe beyond the\nStandard Model physics.

We\nshow these scenarios can be tested by GRAND, using 10 years of cosmogenic\nneutrino data, in a region of parameter space complementary to current\nexperiments. For the $\\nu$SI model,, we find that GRAND can constrain the\ncoupling to $\\nu_\\tau$ in the range [$10^{-2},10^{-1}$] for a scalar with mass\nin the range 0.1 to 1 GeV.

The systematic uncertainty between different de-wiggling\nprocedures is at most $2$%, depending on the scale. The ShapeFit parameter\ncompression aims to compute the slope $m$ of the power spectrum at large\nscales, sensitive to matter-radiation equality and the baryonic suppression.

In\nparticular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for a localization\ntransition in disordered, non-reciprocal systems to the interacting case. When\nonly U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a\nskin effect phase, in which charges cluster at a boundary, and a many-body\nlocalized phase, in which charges localize at random positions. In the dynamics\nof entanglement, this coincides with an area to volume law transition. For\nsystems without boundaries, the skin effect becomes a delocalized phase with a\nunidirectional current. If dipoles or higher multipoles are conserved, we show\nthat the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable to arbitrary disorder.\nCounterintuitively, the system is therefore always delocalized under periodic\nboundary conditions, regardless of disorder strength.",

    "abstract": "Direct collapse of pristine gas in early galaxies is a promissing pathway for\nforming supermassive black holes (BHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs)\nat the epoch of reionization (EoR). This seeding mechanism requires suppression\nof molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) cooling during primordial star formation via\nintense far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby starburst galaxies clustered in\noverdense regions. However, non-detection of 21 cm signals from the EoR\nreported by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment suggests\nthat such galaxies may also emit X-rays more efficiently than in the local\nuniverse, promoting H$_2$ production and thereby potentially quenching massive\nBH seed formation. In this study, we examine the thermal and chemical evolution\nof collapsing gas in dark matter halos using a semi-analytic model\nincorporating observationally calibrated X-ray intensities. We find that strong\nX-ray irradiation, as suggested by HERA, significantly suppresses direct\ncollapse and leads most halos to experience H$_2$ cooling. Nevertheless,\nmassive BH seeds with $M_\\mathrm{BH} \\gtrsim 10^4~M_\\odot$ still form by\n$z\\simeq 15$, particularly in regions with baryonic streaming motion, and their\nabundance reaches $\\sim 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ sufficient to explain the\nSMBHs identified by JWST spectroscopy at $3<z<6$. While the formation of highly\novermassive BHs with masses comparable to their host galaxies is prohibited by\nX-ray ionization, our model predicts that BH-to-stellar mass ratios of $\\simeq\n0.01-0.1$ were already established at seeding.",

The resulting size-mass relation has a significantly higher scatter\nthan similar-redshift field samples, despite comparable best-fit relations in\nboth the dwarf and intermediate-mass regimes. Both \"progenitor bias\", where\nlarger, diskier low-mass galaxies enter the cluster at later epochs, and a\ngeneral expansion of galaxy structure from dynamical interactions could be at\nplay. This evolutionary framework is further supported by the tentative\nevidence that older low-mass quiescent galaxies in the cluster are more\nspheroidal. The star-formation histories derived for our cluster sample imply\ntheir formation and quenching occurs relatively late, at $z<1.5$. In this\nscenario, the progenitor population would have disky axis-ratio distributions\nat cosmic noon, in agreement with recent observations.

Additionally, we\nalso show that free (i.e., non-torsion) factors count the number of\nhigher-dimensional branes which couple to the localized singularity. We use\nthis to also extract quadratic pairing terms in the associated symmetry theory\n(SymTh) for these systems, and explain how these considerations generalize to a\nbroader class of backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we tackle a fundamental question: \"Can we train latent\ndiffusion models together with the variational auto-encoder (VAE) tokenizer in\nan end-to-end manner?\" Traditional deep-learning wisdom dictates that\nend-to-end training is often preferable when possible. However, for latent\ndiffusion transformers, it is observed that end-to-end training both VAE and\ndiffusion-model using standard diffusion-loss is ineffective, even causing a\ndegradation in final performance. We show that while diffusion loss is\nineffective, end-to-end training can be unlocked through the\nrepresentation-alignment (REPA) loss -- allowing both VAE and diffusion model\nto be jointly tuned during the training process. Despite its simplicity, the\nproposed training recipe (REPA-E) shows remarkable performance; speeding up\ndiffusion model training by over 17x and 45x over REPA and vanilla training\nrecipes, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that end-to-end tuning with\nREPA-E also improves the VAE itself; leading to improved latent space structure\nand downstream generation performance. In terms of final performance, our\napproach sets a new state-of-the-art; achieving FID of 1.26 and 1.83 with and\nwithout classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256 x 256.

They\nstruggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the\nreference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final\nanswer from long, complex responses. To address this issue, we propose xVerify,\nan efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations. xVerify\ndemonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to\neffectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are\nequivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions. To\ntrain and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting\nquestion-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets,\nleveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed\nspecifically for reasoning model assessment. A multi-round annotation process\nis employed to ensure label accuracy. Based on the VAR dataset, we train\nmultiple xVerify models of different scales. In evaluation experiments\nconducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models\nachieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\\%.

    "abstract": "We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series\nfeaturing a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a\ntext-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model\n(MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and\nlinguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora\nduring a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively\naddresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in\nconventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve\nperformance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position\nencoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced\npost-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed\npreference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies\nalongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of\nmulti-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the\nMMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its\ncapabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models,\nincluding ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also\nmaintaining strong pure-language proficiency.

Focusing on\nthree specific $U(1)$ symmetries -- $L_e - L_\\mu$, $L_e - L_\\tau$, and $L_\\mu -\nL_\\tau$, we demonstrate that ESSnuSB offers a favourable environment to search\nfor LRF effects. Our analyses reveal that ESSnuSB can set $90\\%$ confidence\nlevel bounds of $V_{e\\mu} < 2.99 \\times 10^{-14} \\, \\text{eV}$, $V_{e\\tau} <\n2.05 \\times 10^{-14} \\, \\text{eV}$, and $V_{\\mu\\tau} < 1.81 \\times 10^{-14} \\,\n\\text{eV}$, which are competitive to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino\nExperiment (DUNE). It is also observed that reducing the systematic\nuncertainties from $5\\%$ to $2\\%$ improves the ESSnuSB limits on\n$V_{\\alpha\\beta}$. Interestingly, we find limited correlations between LRF\nparameters and the less constrained lepton mixing parameters $\\theta_{23}$ and\n$\\delta_{\\text{CP}}$, preserving the robustness of ESSnuSB's sensitivity to CP\nviolation. Even under extreme LRF potentials ($V_{\\alpha\\beta} \\gg 10^{-13} \\,\n\\text{eV}$), the CP-violation sensitivity and $\\delta_{\\text{CP}}$ precision\nremain largely unaffected. These results establish ESSnuSB as a competitive\nexperimental setup for probing LRF effects, complementing constraints from\nother neutrino sources and offering critical insights into the physics of\nlong-range forces.",

However, their practical implementations require an\nunderstanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces.\nHere, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of\nsurfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC,\nand we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their\nbulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling.\nFurthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an\nelectron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied\nsurface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that\nvanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles\nnaturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole\ncoupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant\npolarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and\nphotoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders\nof magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The\nnear-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the\ndevelopment of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to\nmediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic\ncircuits.",

However, it is challenging to determine how to optimally\nadjust reconfigurable parameters for a given task, especially when the\ncontroller depends on the robot's configuration. In this paper, we address this\nproblem using a tendon-driven reconfigurable manipulator composed of multiple\nserially connected origami-inspired modules as an example. Under tendon\nactuation, these modules can achieve different shapes and motions, governed by\njoint stiffnesses (reconfiguration parameters) and the tendon displacements\n(control inputs). We leverage recent advances in co-optimization of design and\ncontrol for robotic system to treat reconfiguration parameters as design\nvariables and optimize them using reinforcement learning techniques. We first\nestablish a forward model based on the minimum potential energy method to\npredict the shape of the manipulator under tendon actuations. Using the forward\nmodel as the environment dynamics, we then co-optimize the control policy (on\nthe tendon displacements) and joint stiffnesses of the modules for goal\nreaching tasks while ensuring collision avoidance. Through co-optimization, we\nobtain optimized joint stiffness and the corresponding optimal control policy\nto enable the manipulator to accomplish the task that would be infeasible with\nfixed reconfiguration parameters (i.e., fixed joint stiffness).

    "abstract": "This paper introduces SAIL, a single transformer unified multimodal large\nlanguage model (MLLM) that integrates raw pixel encoding and language decoding\nwithin a singular architecture. Unlike existing modular MLLMs, which rely on a\npre-trained vision transformer (ViT), SAIL eliminates the need for a separate\nvision encoder, presenting a more minimalist architecture design. Instead of\nintroducing novel architectural components, SAIL adapts mix-attention\nmechanisms and multimodal positional encodings to better align with the\ndistinct characteristics of visual and textual modalities. We systematically\ncompare SAIL's properties-including scalability, cross-modal information flow\npatterns, and visual representation capabilities-with those of modular MLLMs.\nBy scaling both training data and model size, SAIL achieves performance\ncomparable to modular MLLMs. Notably, the removal of pretrained ViT components\nenhances SAIL's scalability and results in significantly different cross-modal\ninformation flow patterns. Moreover, SAIL demonstrates strong visual\nrepresentation capabilities, achieving results on par with ViT-22B in vision\ntasks such as semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Layered control architectures have been a standard paradigm for efficiently\nmanaging complex constrained systems. A typical architecture consists of: i) a\nhigher layer, where a low-frequency planner controls a simple model of the\nsystem, and ii) a lower layer, where a high-frequency tracking controller\nguides a detailed model of the system toward the output of the higher-layer\nmodel. A fundamental problem in this layered architecture is the design of\nplanners and tracking controllers that guarantee both higher- and lower-layer\nsystem constraints are satisfied. Toward addressing this problem, we introduce\na principled approach for layered multirate control of linear systems subject\nto output and input constraints. Inspired by discrete-time simulation\nfunctions, we propose a streamlined control design that guarantees the\nlower-layer system tracks the output of the higher-layer system with computable\nprecision. Using this design, we derive conditions and present a method for\npropagating the constraints of the lower-layer system to the higher-layer\nsystem. The propagated constraints are integrated into the design of an\narbitrary planner that can handle higher-layer system constraints. Our\nframework ensures that the output constraints of the lower-layer system are\nsatisfied at all high-level time steps, while respecting its input constraints\nat all low-level time steps.

    "abstract": "Social interactions among classroom peers, represented as social learning\nnetworks (SLNs), play a crucial role in enhancing learning outcomes. While SLN\nanalysis has recently garnered attention, most existing approaches rely on\ncentralized training, where data is aggregated and processed on a local/cloud\nserver with direct access to raw data. However, in real-world educational\nsettings, such direct access across multiple classrooms is often restricted due\nto privacy concerns. Furthermore, training models on isolated classroom data\nprevents the identification of common interaction patterns that exist across\nmultiple classrooms, thereby limiting model performance. To address these\nchallenges, we propose one of the first frameworks that integrates Federated\nLearning (FL), a distributed and collaborative machine learning (ML) paradigm,\nwith SLNs derived from students' interactions in multiple classrooms' online\nforums to predict future link formations (i.e., interactions) among students.\nBy leveraging FL, our approach enables collaborative model training across\nmultiple classrooms while preserving data privacy, as it eliminates the need\nfor raw data centralization. Recognizing that each classroom may exhibit unique\nstudent interaction dynamics, we further employ model personalization\ntechniques to adapt the FL model to individual classroom characteristics. Our\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing both shared\nand classroom-specific representations of student interactions in SLNs.\nAdditionally, we utilize explainable AI (XAI) techniques to interpret model\npredictions, identifying key factors that influence link formation across\ndifferent classrooms. These insights unveil the drivers of social learning\ninteractions within a privacy-preserving, collaborative, and distributed ML\nframework -- an aspect that has not been explored before.",

Given an (m+n)-mode Gaussian state G, we express it as an (m+n)-mode\n\"Gaussian core state\" G_core followed by a fixed m-mode Gaussian transformation\nT that only acts on the first m modes. The defining property of the Gaussian\ncore state G_core is that measuring the last n of its modes in the\nphoton-number basis leaves the first m modes on a finite Fock support, i.e. a\ncore state. Since T is measurement-independent and G_core has an exact and\nfinite Fock representation, this decomposition exactly describes all\nnon-Gaussian states obtainable by projecting n modes of G onto the Fock basis.\nFor pure states we prove that a physical pair (G_core, T) always exists with\nG_core pure and T unitary. For mixed states, we establish necessary and\nsufficient conditions for (G_core, T) to be a Gaussian mixed state and a\nGaussian channel. Finally, we develop a semidefinite program to extract the\n\"largest\" possible Gaussian channel when these conditions fail. The stellar\ndecomposition leads to practical bounds on achievable state quality in photonic\ncircuits and for GKP state generation in particular. Our results are based on a\nnew characterization of Gaussian completely positive maps in the Bargmann\npicture, which may be of independent interest. As a result, this work provides\nnovel tools for improved simulations of quantum optical systems, and for\nunderstanding the generation of non-Gaussian resource states.",

    "abstract": "Spin-orbit torque arising from the spin-orbit-coupled surface states of\ntopological insulators enables current-induced control of magnetization with\nhigh efficiency. Here, alternating-current (AC) driven magnetization reversal\nis demonstrated in a semi-magnetic topological insulator\n(Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, facilitated by a low threshold current density of\n1.5x10^9 A/m^2. Time-domain Hall voltage measurements using an oscilloscope\nreveal a strongly nonlinear and nonreciprocal Hall response during the\nmagnetization reversal process. Fourier analysis of the time-varying Hall\nvoltage identifies higher-harmonic signals and a rectified direct-current (DC)\ncomponent, highlighting the complex interplay among the applied current,\nexternal magnetic field, and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, a hysteretic\nbehavior in the current-voltage characteristics gives rise to frequency mixing\nunder dual-frequency excitation. This effect, distinct from conventional\npolynomial-based nonlinearities, allows for selective extraction of specific\nfrequency components. The results demonstrate that AC excitation can not only\nswitch magnetization efficiently but also induce tunable nonlinear responses,\noffering a new pathway for multifunctional spintronic devices with potential\napplications in energy-efficient memory, signal processing, and frequency\nconversion.",

    "abstract": "Effective reasoning is crucial to solving complex mathematical problems.\nRecent large language models (LLMs) have boosted performance by scaling\ntest-time computation through long chain-of-thought reasoning. However,\ntransformer-based models are inherently limited in extending context length due\nto their quadratic computational complexity and linear memory requirements. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel hybrid linear RNN reasoning model, M1, built\non the Mamba architecture, which allows memory-efficient inference. Our\napproach leverages a distillation process from existing reasoning models and is\nfurther enhanced through RL training. Experimental results on the AIME and MATH\nbenchmarks show that M1 not only outperforms previous linear RNN models but\nalso matches the performance of state-of-the-art Deepseek R1 distilled\nreasoning models at a similar scale. We also compare our generation speed with\na highly performant general purpose inference engine, vLLM, and observe more\nthan a 3x speedup compared to a same size transformer. With throughput speedup,\nwe are able to achieve higher accuracy compared to DeepSeek R1 distilled\ntransformer reasoning models under a fixed generation time budget using\nself-consistency voting. Overall, we introduce a hybrid Mamba reasoning model\nand provide a more effective approach to scaling test-time generation using\nself-consistency or long chain of thought reasoning.",

By tuning the\ncontrol parameter, one transitions from uniformly distributed weights to an\noptimal transport regime in which weights condense onto cost-favorable edges.\nWe quantify this dense-to-sparse transition, showing with numerical analyses\nthat the process does not hinge on specific assumptions about the node-strength\nor cost distributions.

In\nthis work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the\ntemporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC).\nFirstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on\ninter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio\nencoders. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce\nthe number of tokens within each segment. Specifically, we employ a query-based\nTransformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a\nlimited set of temporal context tokens. Finally, we feed the static frame\ntokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding.\nFurthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free\nchain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple\nvideo segments.

    "abstract": "Streaming data pipelines remain challenging and expensive to build and\nmaintain, despite significant advancements in stronger consistency, event time\nsemantics, and SQL support over the last decade. Persistent obstacles continue\nto hinder usability, such as the need for manual incrementalization, semantic\ndiscrepancies across SQL implementations, and the lack of enterprise-grade\noperational features. While the rise of incremental view maintenance (IVM) as a\nway to integrate streaming with databases has been a huge step forward,\ntransaction isolation in the presence of IVM remains underspecified, leaving\nthe maintenance of application-level invariants as a painful exercise for the\nuser. Meanwhile, most streaming systems optimize for latencies of 100 ms to 3\nsec, whereas many practical use cases are well-served by latencies ranging from\nseconds to tens of minutes.\n  We present delayed view semantics (DVS), a conceptual foundation that bridges\nthe semantic gap between streaming and databases, and introduce Dynamic Tables,\nSnowflake's declarative streaming transformation primitive designed to\ndemocratize analytical stream processing. DVS formalizes the intuition that\nstream processing is primarily a technique to eagerly compute derived results\nasynchronously, while also addressing the need to reason about the resulting\nsystem end to end. Dynamic Tables then offer two key advantages: ease of use\nthrough DVS, enterprise-grade features, and simplicity; as well as scalable\ncost efficiency via IVM with an architecture designed for diverse latency\nrequirements.\n  We first develop extensions to transaction isolation that permit the\npreservation of invariants in streaming applications. We then detail the\nimplementation challenges of Dynamic Tables and our experience operating it at\nscale. Finally, we share insights into user adoption and discuss our vision for\nthe future of stream processing.",

    "abstract": "Model order reduction aims to determine a low-order approximation of\nhigh-order models with least possible approximation errors. For application to\nphysical systems, it is crucial that the reduced order model (ROM) is robust to\nany disturbance that acts on the full order model (FOM) -- in the sense that\nthe output of the ROM remains a good approximation of that of the FOM, even in\nthe presence of such disturbances. In this work, we present a framework for\nonline model order reduction for a class of continuous-time linear systems that\nensures this property for any $\\mathcal{L}_2$ disturbance. Apart from\nrobustness to disturbances in this sense, the proposed framework also displays\nother desirable properties for model order reduction: (1) a provable bound on\nthe error defined as the $L_2$ norm of the difference between the output of the\nROM and FOM, (2) preservation of stability, (3) compositionality properties and\na provable error bound for arbitrary interconnected systems, (4) a provable\nbound on the output of the FOM when the controller designed for the ROM is used\nwith the FOM, and finally, (5) compatibility with existing approaches such as\nbalanced truncation and moment matching. Property (4) does not require\ncomputation of any gap metric and property (5) is beneficial as existing\napproaches can also be equipped with some of the preceding properties.

A common strategy is to introduce an external field to prevent the\nplasma distribution from becoming turbulent.

In this work, we present an integrated method\nwhere we first perform an analytical derivation of the VP system's dispersion\nrelation to construct a high-quality initial guess for the stabilizing field.\nThis analytically-derived field is then used to initialize a PDE-constrained\noptimization loop that refines the control to a local optimum.

This behavior arises regardless of the choice of loss function (e.g.,\nKL divergence or electric energy). In contrast, integrating the loss function\nover time yields a landscape with a convex basin near the global minimum,\nfacilitating convergence.

Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have\nre-emerged as powerful alternatives, leveraging next-token generation to match\ndiffusion models. However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion\nmodels fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences\nin structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of\nattention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image\nediting, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we\nintroduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing\nstrategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention\nmanipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by\ndynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the\nAnchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural\nconsistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing\nwhile maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nISLock achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional\ntraining and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our\nfindings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing,\nfurther bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive\ngenerative models.

    "abstract": "Graph-based social recommendation systems have shown significant promise in\nenhancing recommendation performance, particularly in addressing the issue of\ndata sparsity in user behaviors. Typically, these systems leverage Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to capture user preferences by incorporating high-order social\ninfluences from observed social networks. However, existing graph-based social\nrecommendations often overlook the fact that social networks are inherently\nnoisy, containing task-irrelevant relationships that can hinder accurate user\npreference learning. The removal of these redundant social relations is\ncrucial, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth. In this\npaper, we approach the social denoising problem from the perspective of graph\ninvariant learning and propose a novel method, Social Graph Invariant\nLearning(SGIL). Specifically,SGIL aims to uncover stable user preferences\nwithin the input social graph, thereby enhancing the robustness of graph-based\nsocial recommendation systems. To achieve this goal, SGIL first simulates\nmultiple noisy social environments through graph generators. It then seeks to\nlearn environment-invariant user preferences by minimizing invariant risk\nacross these environments. To further promote diversity in the generated social\nenvironments, we employ an adversarial training strategy to simulate more\npotential social noisy distributions.

Nevertheless, it\nsuffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per single acquisition due to the\ndynamic range limitation of photodetectors imposed by the high-peak-power\nmode-locked pulses, making coherent averaging an essential means to improve\nSNR, at the price of compromising the exceptional time resolution and placing\nmore stringent demands on mutual coherence and stability. In this study, a\nnovel approach to enhance SNR by exploiting the spectral mode enhancement\nmechanism in coherent-harmonic pulses is demonstrated. As a proof-of-concept,\ntwo frequency combs with mode spacing of $\\sim$12.5 MHz, operated at a 20th\nharmonic repetition rate of $\\sim$250 MHz, are employed, demonstrating a\n$>$300-fold reduction in averaging time for comparable SNR in conventional DCS.\nThis reduction is expected to be further enhanced through integration with\nultra-high repetition rate combs like microresonator combs. This new approach\npromises both a recovery of the inherent high-speed capability and a mitigation\nof the coherence-time requirements, thereby making it possible to significantly\nfacilitate subsequent DCS investigations and field deployments.",

Replay-based methods address this by maintaining a small memory\nbuffer of previous samples, achieving competitive performance. For effective\nreplay under constrained storage, recent approaches leverage distilled data to\nenhance the informativeness of memory. However, such approaches often involve\nsignificant computational overhead due to the use of bi-level optimization.\nMotivated by these limitations, we introduce Grid-based Patch Sampling (GPS), a\nlightweight and effective strategy for distilling informative memory samples\nwithout relying on a trainable model. GPS generates informative samples by\nsampling a subset of pixels from the original image, yielding compact\nlow-resolution representations that preserve both semantic content and\nstructural information. During replay, these representations are reassembled to\nsupport training and evaluation. Experiments on extensive benchmarks\ndemonstrate that GRS can be seamlessly integrated into existing replay\nframeworks, leading to 3%-4% improvements in average end accuracy under\nmemory-constrained settings, with limited computational overhead.",

However, direct downloading of these\nmodels for fine-tuning on the ground is impeded by privacy concerns and limited\nbandwidth. Satellite federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling\nmodel fine-tuning directly on-board satellites and aggregating model updates\nwithout data downloading. Nevertheless, for large foundation models, the\ncomputational capacity of satellites is insufficient to support effective\non-board fine-tuning in traditional satellite FL frameworks. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a satellite-ground collaborative federated fine-tuning\nframework. The key of the framework lies in how to reasonably decompose and\nallocate model components to alleviate insufficient on-board computation\ncapabilities. During fine-tuning, satellites exchange intermediate results with\nground stations or other satellites for forward propagation and back\npropagation, which brings communication challenges due to the special\ncommunication topology of space transmission networks, such as intermittent\nsatellite-ground communication, short duration of satellite-ground\ncommunication windows, and unstable inter-orbit inter-satellite links (ISLs).\nTo reduce transmission delays, we further introduce tailored communication\nstrategies that integrate both communication and computing resources.\nSpecifically, we propose a parallel intra-orbit communication strategy, a\ntopology-aware satellite-ground communication strategy, and a\nlatency-minimalization inter-orbit communication strategy to reduce space\ncommunication costs.

However, some recent structural results on\nthe combinatorial list decoding of randomly punctured Reed--Solomon codes\nsuggest that Johnson bound can likely be broken for some subclasses of RS\ncodes. Motivated by these results, we seek to make traction on understanding\nadversarial decoding by considering a new model: semi-adversarial errors. This\nerror model bridges between fully random errors and fully adversarial errors by\nallowing some symbols of a message to be corrupted by an adversary while others\nare replaced with uniformly random symbols.\n  As our main quest, we seek to understand optimal efficient unique decoding\nalgorithms in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, we revisit some\nclassical results on decoding interleaved Reed--Solomon codes (aka subfield\nevaluation RS codes) in the random error model by Bleichenbacher--Kiayias--Yung\n(BKY) and work to improve and extend their analysis. First, we give an improved\nimplementation and analysis of the BKY algorithm for interleaved Reed--Solomon\ncodes in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, our algorithm runs in\nnear-linear time, and for most mixtures of random and adversarial errors, our\nanalysis matches the information-theoretic optimum.\n  Moreover, inspired by the BKY algorithm, we use a novel interpolation to\nextend our approach to the settings of folded Reed--Solomon and multiplicity\ncodes, resulting in fast algorithms for unique decoding against\nsemi-adversarial errors. A particular advantage of our near-linear time\nalgorithm over state-of-the-art decoding algorithms for adversarial errors is\nthat its running time depends only on a polynomial function of the folding\nparameter rather than on an exponential function.",

This method is very effective in detecting debris from accretion\nevents that occur less than 6-7 Gyr ago but struggles to detect most of the\ndebris from older accretion. Furthermore, most of the detected structures\nsuffer from significant contamination by in-situ stars. Our results also show\nthat the method may also generate artificial detections.\n  Conclusions.

Validation\ntechniques included structural equation modeling (SEM) to verifying\nrelationships, and measures such as entropy, predictive accuracy, and\nrobustness to compare network structures.\n  Results and Discussion: LLM-generated BNs demonstrated lower entropy than\nexpert-elicited and statistically generated BNs, suggesting higher confidence\nand precision in predictions. However, limitations such as contextual\nconstraints, hallucinated dependencies, and potential biases inherited from\ntraining data require further investigation.\n  Conclusion: LLMs represent a novel frontier in expert elicitation for\nprobabilistic causal modeling, promising to improve transparency and reduce\nuncertainty in the decision-making using such models.",

We present three bright\nbursts with detailed temporal/spectral structures. We also report that one\nburst carries a narrow component with a width of only 0.3 ms, which is\nsurrounded by broader components. This suggests that repeaters can make both\nnarrow and broad components in one burst. With the narrow spike, we precisely\nmeasure the dispersion measure (DM) of $362.85 \\pm 0.15 \\;{\\rm pc\\,cm^{-3}}$\nand the Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of and $-12249.0\\pm 1.5 \\; {\\rm\nrad\\,m^{-2}}$. We also analyze the statistical distribution of the burst\nparameters, including waiting times, temporal widths, central frequencies and\nfrequency widths, fluences and energies, all showing typical distributions of\nknown active repeaters. In particular, most bursts show narrow spectra with\n$\\Delta\\nu/\\nu_0 = 0.125\\pm 0.001$. This fact, together with the narrow 0.3 ms\nspike, strongly suggests a magnetospheric origin of the FRB emission. Based on\na predicted correlation between RM and the luminosity of a persistent radio\nsource (PRS) by Yang et al., we predict that PRS should have a specific\nluminosity of the order of $10^{29} \\ {\\rm erg \\ s^{-1} \\ Hz^{-1}}$ and\nencourage a search for such a PRS.",

Incorporating\nmulti-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting\npairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a\nspin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending\non the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level,\nthe Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the\n$A_1(S_{\\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\\pm})$ irreducible representations\n(IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group.

Copy creation\nis inherently iterative for humans, starting with an initial draft followed by\nsuccessive refinements. However, manual copy creation is time-consuming and\nexpensive, resulting in only a few copies for each use case. This limitation\nrestricts our ability to personalize content to customers. Contrary to the\nmanual approach, LLMs can generate copies quickly, but the generated content\ndoes not consistently meet all the constraints on the first attempt (similar to\nhumans).

Existing research typically focuses on\ncandidates with a single attribute. However, crowdsourcing tasks often require\ncontributions from individuals across various demographics. Further motivated\nby the dynamic nature of crowdsourcing and hiring, we study the diversity-fair\nonline selection problem, in which a recruiter must make real-time decisions to\nfoster workforce diversity across many dimensions. We propose two scenarios for\nthis problem. The fixed-capacity scenario, suited for short-term hiring for\ncrowdsourced workers, provides the recruiter with a fixed capacity to fill\ntemporary job vacancies. In contrast, in the unknown-capacity scenario,\nrecruiters optimize diversity across recruitment seasons with increasing\ncapacities, reflecting that the firm honors diversity consideration in a\nlong-term employee acquisition strategy. By modeling the diversity over $d$\ndimensions as a max-min fairness objective, we show that no policy can surpass\na competitive ratio of $O(1/d^{1/3})$ for either scenario, indicating that any\nachievable result inevitably decays by some polynomial factor in $d$. To this\nend, we develop bilevel hierarchical randomized policies that ensure compliance\nwith the capacity constraint. For the fixed-capacity scenario, leveraging\nmarginal information about the arriving population allows us to achieve a\ncompetitive ratio of $1/(4\\sqrt{d} \\lceil \\log_2 d \\rceil)$. For the\nunknown-capacity scenario, we establish a competitive ratio of\n$\\Omega(1/d^{3/4})$ under mild boundedness conditions.

It simultaneously\nresolves the solitonic core of the host halo and tracks the complex tidal\nevolution of subhaloes down to redshift z = 0. We examine the internal\nstructure of subhaloes by analyzing their density profiles, velocity\ndispersions, and density power spectra across various redshifts. Our findings\nshow that partially tidally stripped subhaloes deviate from the core-halo mass\nrelation; their solitons remain intact and are enveloped by smaller granules\npredominantly from the host halo. Furthermore, our simulation unravels a\ncomplex tidal evolution of FDM subhaloes. On the one hand, we observe a subhalo\ncore undergoing complete tidal disruption at z ~ 0.14, which later reemerges\nnear the outskirts of the host halo around z ~ 0. This disruption event,\ncharacterized by a core contaminated with interference fringes from the host\nhalo's wave function, occurs earlier than previously predicted. On the other\nhand, FDM subhaloes have denser cores before infall due to the presence of\ncentral solitons, making them more resilient to tidal disruption than their\nN-body counterparts. Our results demonstrate GAMER-2's capability to resolve\nnon-linear FDM substructure down to z = 0, paving the way for future studies of\nlarger FDM subhalo samples with heavier particle masses.

Although these codes have shed new\nlight on conceptual aspects of these dualities, they have widely been believed\nto lack a crucial feature of practical quantum error correction: The ability to\nsupport universal fault-tolerant quantum logic. In this work, we introduce a\nnew class of holographic codes that realize this feature. These heterogeneous\nholographic codes are constructed by combining two seed codes in a tensor\nnetwork on an alternating hyperbolic tiling. We show how this construction\ngeneralizes previous strategies for fault tolerance in tree-type concatenated\ncodes, allowing one to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly on the\nholographic boundary. We also demonstrate that these codes allow for high\nerasure thresholds under a suitable heterogeneous combination of specific seed\ncodes. Compared to previous concatenated codes, heterogeneous holographic codes\nachieve large overhead savings in physical qubits, e.g., a $21.8\\%$ reduction\nfor a two-layer Steane/quantum Reed-Muller combination. Unlike standard\nconcatenated codes, we establish that the new codes can encode more than a\nsingle logical qubit per code block by applying ``black hole'' deformations\nwith tunable rate and distance, while possessing fully addressable, universal\nfault-tolerant gate sets.

Deep\nlearning methods offer state-of-the-art performance but often require\nsensor-specific training when used in a supervised setting.

This paper introduces PG-DPIR, an\nefficient PnP method for high-count Poisson-Gaussian inverse problems, adapted\nfrom DPIR. While DPIR is designed for white Gaussian noise, a naive adaptation\nto Poisson-Gaussian noise leads to prohibitively slow algorithms due to the\nabsence of a closed-form proximal operator. To address this, we adapt DPIR for\nthe specificities of Poisson-Gaussian noise and propose in particular an\nefficient initialization of the gradient descent required for the proximal step\nthat accelerates convergence by several orders of magnitude.

However, the governing equations for\nmany complex systems remain unknown due to intricate underlying mechanisms.\nRecent advancements in machine learning and data science offer a new paradigm\nfor modeling unknown equations from measurement or simulation data. This\nparadigm shift, known as data-driven discovery or modeling, stands at the\nforefront of AI for science, with significant progress made in recent years. In\nthis paper, we introduce a systematic framework for data-driven modeling of\nunknown equations using deep learning. This versatile framework is capable of\nlearning unknown ODEs, PDEs, DAEs, IDEs, SDEs, reduced or partially observed\nsystems, and non-autonomous differential equations. Based on this framework, we\nhave developed Deep Unknown Equations (DUE), an open-source software package\ndesigned to facilitate the data-driven modeling of unknown equations using\nmodern deep learning techniques. DUE serves as an educational tool for\nclassroom instruction, enabling students and newcomers to gain hands-on\nexperience with differential equations, data-driven modeling, and contemporary\ndeep learning approaches such as FNN, ResNet, generalized ResNet, operator\nsemigroup networks (OSG-Net), and Transformers. Additionally, DUE is a\nversatile and accessible toolkit for researchers across various scientific and\nengineering fields. It is applicable not only for learning unknown equations\nfrom data but also for surrogate modeling of known, yet complex, equations that\nare costly to solve using traditional numerical methods. We provide detailed\ndescriptions of DUE and demonstrate its capabilities through diverse examples,\nwhich serve as templates that can be easily adapted for other applications.",

However, since these estimators rely on the\nstatistical distributions of observed quantities, it is crucial to examine the\nrelationships between information-theoretic measures and the system's\nunderlying mechanistic structure. To this end, here we present an\ninformation-theoretic analytical investigation of an elementary system of\ninteractive random walkers subject to Gaussian noise. Focusing on partial\ninformation decomposition, causal emergence, and integrated information, our\nresults help us develop some intuitions on their relationship with the physical\nparameters of the system. For instance, we observe that uncoupled systems can\nexhibit emergent properties, in a way that we suggest may be better described\nas ''statistically autonomous''. Overall, we observe that in this simple\nscenario information measures align more reliably with the system's mechanistic\nproperties when calculated at the level of microscopic components, rather than\ntheir coarse-grained counterparts, and over timescales comparable with the\nsystem's intrinsic dynamics. Moreover, we show that approaches that separate\nthe contributions of the system's dynamics and steady-state distribution (e.g.\nvia causal perturbations) may help strengthen the interpretation of\ninformation-theoretic analyses.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving the\npower, performance, and area (PPA) of digital circuits in the early stages of\nsynthesis. Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield\nhigh-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing\ncompiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints.\nLarge Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising\nalternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often\nface difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the\nprovided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL\noptimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with\nsymbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree\n(AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic\ncorrectness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is\nproposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic,\nallowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond\nthe scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification\npipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation,\nfurther reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter\nbenchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves\npower, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%,\nrespectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

We propose\na novel tradeoff metric to analyze the balance between computation and\ncommunication in semantic transmissions and employ the deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) algorithm to minimize this metric, thereby reducing the cost\nassociated with balancing computation and communication. Through simulations,\nwe analyze the tradeoff between computation and communication and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of optimizing this trade-off metric.",

    "abstract": "We present MultiLoKo, a new benchmark for evaluating multilinguality in LLMs\ncovering 31 languages. MultiLoKo consists of three partitions: a main partition\nconsisting of 500 questions per language, separately sourced to be locally\nrelevant to the specific language, and two translated partitions, containing\nhuman-authored translations from 30 non-English languages to English and vice\nversa. For comparison, we also release corresponding machine-authored\ntranslations. The data is equally distributed over two splits: a dev split and\na blind, out-of-distribution test split. MultiLoKo can be used to study a\nvariety of questions regarding the multilinguality of LLMs as well as\nmeta-questions about multilingual benchmark creation. We compute MultiLoKo\nscores for 11 base and chat models marketed to be multilingual and study their\naverage performance, their performance parity across languages, how much their\nability to answer questions depends on the question language, and which\nlanguages are most difficult. None of the models we studied performs well on\nMultiLoKo, as indicated by low average scores as well as large differences\nbetween the best and worst scoring languages. Furthermore, we find a\nsubstantial effect of the question language, indicating sub-optimal knowledge\ntransfer between languages. Lastly, we find that using local vs\nEnglish-translated data can result in differences more than 20 points for the\nbest performing models, drastically change the estimated difficulty of some\nlanguages. For using machines instead of human translations, we find a weaker\neffect on ordering of language difficulty, a larger difference in model\nrankings, and a substantial drop in estimated performance for all models.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous fabrication systems are transforming construction and\nmanufacturing, yet they remain vulnerable to print errors. Texture\nclassification is a key component of computer vision systems that enable\nreal-time monitoring and adjustment during cementitious fabrication.\nTraditional classification methods often rely on global image features, which\ncan bias the model toward semantic content rather than low-level textures. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel preprocessing technique called \"patch and\nshuffle,\" which segments input images into smaller patches, shuffles them, and\nreconstructs a jumbled image before classification. This transformation removes\nsemantic context, forcing the classifier to rely on local texture features.\n  We evaluate this approach on a dataset of extruded cement images, using a\nResNet-18-based architecture. Our experiments compare the patch and shuffle\nmethod to a standard pipeline, holding all other factors constant. Results show\na significant improvement in accuracy: the patch and shuffle model achieved\n90.64% test accuracy versus 72.46% for the baseline. These findings suggest\nthat disrupting global structure enhances performance in texture-based\nclassification tasks.\n  This method has implications for broader vision tasks where low-level\nfeatures matter more than high-level semantics.

We evaluate nine\nstate-of-the-art 2D-to-3D HPE models, spanning convolutional,\ntransformer-based, graph-based, and diffusion-based architectures, using the\nBlendMimic3D dataset, a synthetic dataset with ground-truth 2D/3D annotations\nand occlusion labels.

Our findings reveal that all models exhibit notable performance\ndegradation under occlusion, with diffusion-based models underperforming\ndespite their stochastic nature.

A rigorous description\nof polycrystalline diffusion must therefore account for crystallographic\ndefects, especially grain boundaries (GBs), whose structure and volume fraction\n- and hence the effective grain size - govern mass transport. Experiments and\natomistic simulations consistently show that GBs can accelerate diffusion by up\nto several orders of magnitude and that fluxes along and across the interface\nare generally anisotropic. Conventional mesoscale models either neglect GBs or\ninvoke idealized analytical corrections. Fully resolved finite-element meshes\nare accurate but computationally infeasible when nanometer-thin GB layers are\ninvolved. We introduce a collapsed-interface finite element that integrates the\nGB thickness analytically and embeds the result in a two-dimensional surface\nelement. The formulation (i) treats in-plane and through-plane diffusivity\nindependently, (ii) couples to the surrounding grain matrix without the need\nfor mesh manipulations, and (iii) parametrizes both grain size and GB volume\nfraction via simple affine scalings, allowing systematic variation without\nremeshing. Effective diffusivity tensors are extracted by linear computational\nhomogenization. The new finite element reproduces three-dimensional GB\ntransport phenomena - channeled fluxes, concentration discontinuities - at a\nfraction of the computational cost of explicit models. Parametric studies\nspanning multiple orders of magnitude in GB diffusivity reveal four distinct\ndiffusion regimes and quantify their impact on the overall response.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in audio language models have underscored the pivotal\nrole of audio tokenization, which converts audio signals into discrete tokens,\nthereby facilitating the application of language model architectures to the\naudio domain. In this study, we introduce ALMTokenizer, a novel low-bitrate and\nsemantically rich audio codec tokenizer for audio language models. Prior\nmethods, such as Encodec, typically encode individual audio frames into\ndiscrete tokens without considering the use of context information across\nframes. Unlike these methods, we introduce a novel query-based compression\nstrategy to capture holistic information with a set of learnable query tokens\nby explicitly modeling the context information across frames. This design not\nonly enables the codec model to capture more semantic information but also\nencodes the audio signal with fewer token sequences. Additionally, to enhance\nthe semantic information in audio codec models, we introduce the following: (1)\nA masked autoencoder (MAE) loss, (2) Vector quantization based on semantic\npriors, and (3) An autoregressive (AR) prediction loss. As a result,\nALMTokenizer achieves competitive reconstruction performance relative to\nstate-of-the-art approaches while operating at a lower bitrate. Within the same\naudio language model framework, ALMTokenizer outperforms previous tokenizers in\naudio understanding and generation tasks.",

Standard SHAP remains\nconfounded by tissue signals due to biases inherent in its computation. The raw\nactivation manifold was dominated by high-magnitude activations, which masked\nsubtle tissue and mortality-related signals. In contrast, the layer-aware SHAP\nmanifold offers improved low-dimensional representations of both tissue and\nmortality signals, independent of activation strength, enabling subpopulation\nstratification and pan-cancer identification of survival-associated genes.",

This disorder has incredible diversity, with a large\nnumber of distinct profiles corresponding to alterations of different regions\nin the genes. Correctly classifying an individual's profile is critical as it\nimpacts treatment, prognosis, and genetic counseling. However, genetic\nclassification is challenging due to the large number of profiles worldwide,\nand often requires a large number of sequential tests. Targeted next generation\nsequencing (NGS), which characterizes segments of an individual's genome, has\nthe potential to dramatically reduce the cost of testing and increase accuracy.\nIn this work, we introduce a probabilistic state space model for profiling\nthalassemia from targeted NGS data, which naturally characterize the spatial\nordering of the genes along the chromosome. We then use decision theory to\nchoose the best profile among the different options. Due to our use of Bayesian\nmethodology, we are also able to detect low-quality samples to be excluded from\nconsideration, an important component of clinical screening. We evaluate our\nmodel on a dataset of 57 individuals, including both controls and cases with a\nvariety of thalassemia profiles. Our model has a sensitivity of 0.99 and\nspecificity of 0.93 for thalassemia detection, and accuracy of 91.5\\% for\ncharacterizing subtypes. Furthermore, the specificity and accuracy rise to\n$0.96$ and 93.9\\% when low-quality samples are excluded using our automated\nquality control method.

In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM\nthat can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement\nlearning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive\nmath problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further\nincreases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive\ngeneralization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging\nmath proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we\npropose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to\nscaling up the problem solving.

To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose the\nInstructEngine framework. Regarding annotation cost, we first construct a\ntaxonomy for text-to-image generation, then develop an automated data\nconstruction pipeline based on it. Leveraging advanced large multimodal models\nand human-defined rules, we generate 25K text-image preference pairs. Finally,\nwe introduce cross-validation alignment method, which refines data efficiency\nby organizing semantically analogous samples into mutually comparable pairs.\nEvaluations on DrawBench demonstrate that InstructEngine improves SD v1.5 and\nSDXL's performance by 10.53% and 5.30%, outperforming state-of-the-art\nbaselines, with ablation study confirming the benefits of InstructEngine's all\ncomponents. A win rate of over 50% in human reviews also proves that\nInstructEngine better aligns with human preferences.",

The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine\nlearning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on\ncross-validation methods on daily power production data.

While semi-supervised\nmethods trained on only normal samples have gained traction, they often suffer\nfrom high false alarm rates and poor interpretability. Recently,\nvision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities, offering new opportunities for explainable anomaly detection.\nHowever, their high computational cost and lack of domain adaptation hinder\nreal-time deployment and reliability. Inspired by dual complementary pathways\nin human visual perception, we propose SlowFastVAD, a hybrid framework that\nintegrates a fast anomaly detector with a slow anomaly detector (namely a\nretrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhanced VLM), to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, the fast detector first provides coarse anomaly\nconfidence scores, and only a small subset of ambiguous segments, rather than\nthe entire video, is further analyzed by the slower yet more interpretable VLM\nfor elaborate detection and reasoning. Furthermore, to adapt VLMs to\ndomain-specific VAD scenarios, we construct a knowledge base including normal\npatterns based on few normal samples and abnormal patterns inferred by VLMs.\nDuring inference, relevant patterns are retrieved and used to augment prompts\nfor anomaly reasoning. Finally, we smoothly fuse the anomaly confidence of fast\nand slow detectors to enhance robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive\nexperiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that SlowFastVAD effectively\ncombines the strengths of both fast and slow detectors, and achieves remarkable\ndetection accuracy and interpretability with significantly reduced\ncomputational overhead, making it well-suited for real-world VAD applications\nwith high reliability requirements.",

To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between\ntwo state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote\ncache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines\n(DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative\ncoherence state change attacks.\n  We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the\nprocessor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect.\nThis creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered\nwithin the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which\nconstitutes a security vulnerability.

The resulting beam intensity subproblem,\nsubject to MMU, either admits a closed-form solution or is efficiently solvable\nvia conjugate gradient. The binary subproblem is cast as a quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, solvable using variational\nquantum computing algorithms. With nearly the same plan quality, the proposed\nmethod noticeable reduces the number of the used energies. For example,\ncompared to conventional IMPT, QC can reduce the number of energy layers from\n61 to 35 in HN case, from 56 to 35 in lung case, and from 59 to 32 to abdomen\ncase. The reduced number of energies also results in fewer delivery time, e.g.,\nthe delivery time is reduced from 100.6, 232.0, 185.3 seconds to 90.7, 215.4,\n154.0 seconds, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract clones serve as an algebraic presentation of the syntax of a simple\ntype theory. From the perspective of universal algebra, they define algebraic\ntheories like those of groups, monoids and rings. This link allows one to study\nthe language of simple type theory from the viewpoint of universal algebra.\n  Programming languages, however, are much more complicated than simple type\ntheory. Many useful features like reading, writing, and exception handling\ninvolve interacting with the environment; these are called side-effects.\nAlgebraic presentations for languages with the appropriate syntax for handling\neffects are given by premulticategories and effectful multicategories. We study\nthese structures with the aim of defining a suitable notion of an algebra.\n  To achieve this goal, we proceed in two steps. First, we define a tensor on\n$[\\to,\\category{Set}]$, and show that this tensor along with the cartesian\nproduct gives the category a duoidal structure. Secondly, we introduce the\nnovel notion of a multicategory enriched in a duoidal category which generalize\nthe traditional notion of a multicategory. Further, we prove that an effectful\nmulticategory is the same as a multicategory enriched in the duoidal category\n$[\\to,\\category{Set}]$. This result places multicategories and effectful\nmulticategories on a similar footing, and provides a mechanism for transporting\nconcepts from the theory of multicategories (which model pure computation) to\nthe theory of effectful multicategories (which model effectful computation). As\nan example of this, we generalize the definition of a 2-morphism for\nmulticategories to the duoidally enriched case. Our equivalence result then\ngives a natural definition of a 2-morphism for effectful multicategories, which\nwe then use to define the notion of an algebra.",

    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) epitomizes an advanced training paradigm wherein\nprior data samples remain inaccessible during the acquisition of new tasks.\nNumerous investigations have delved into leveraging a pre-trained Vision\nTransformer (ViT) to enhance model efficacy in continual learning. Nonetheless,\nthese approaches typically utilize a singular, static backbone, which\ninadequately adapts to novel tasks, particularly when engaging with diverse\ndata domains, due to a substantial number of inactive parameters. This paper\naddresses this limitation by introducing an innovative Self-Controlled Dynamic\nExpansion Model (SCDEM), which orchestrates multiple distinct trainable\npre-trained ViT backbones to furnish diverse and semantically enriched\nrepresentations. Specifically, by employing the multi-backbone architecture as\na shared module, the proposed SCDEM dynamically generates a new expert with\nminimal parameters to accommodate a new task. A novel Collaborative\nOptimization Mechanism (COM) is introduced to synergistically optimize multiple\nbackbones by harnessing prediction signals from historical experts, thereby\nfacilitating new task learning without erasing previously acquired knowledge.\nAdditionally, a novel Feature Distribution Consistency (FDC) approach is\nproposed to align semantic similarity between previously and currently learned\nrepresentations through an optimal transport distance-based mechanism,\neffectively mitigating negative knowledge transfer effects. Furthermore, to\nalleviate over-regularization challenges, this paper presents a novel Dynamic\nLayer-Wise Feature Attention Mechanism (DLWFAM) to autonomously determine the\npenalization intensity on each trainable representation layer. An extensive\nseries of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed\nmethodology's efficacy, with empirical results corroborating that the approach\nattains state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "MATLAB/Simulink is the leading tool for simulating complex Cyber-Physical\nSystems (CPSs). The simulation models of complex CPSs are typically compute\nintensive, and the execution of test cases is long. Furthermore, the execution\nof test cases is typically triggered several times at different ``in-the-Loop''\ntest levels (i.e., Model, Software and Hardware-in-the-Loop). Therefore, test\noptimization techniques, such as test case prioritization, are paramount when\ntesting these systems. In this paper, we present the largest empirical study on\ntest case prioritization techniques for Simulink models by comparing the\nperformance of white-box and black-box test case prioritization techniques. We\nassess traditional test case prioritization techniques, and we also propose new\napproaches for use in the context of Simulink models. We empirically compared\n11 test case prioritization techniques using six Simulink models of different\nsizes and complexities. When comparing white-box against black-box test case\nprioritization techniques, we found that in general, white-box techniques were\nslightly better than black-box ones. In the context of white-box test case\nprioritization, the total greedy approach performed better than the additional\ngreedy techniques in larger models. As for the test case prioritization time,\nblack-box techniques were faster, although total greedy techniques were fast\nenough to be used in practice.",

Since then, two mass-squared differences have\nbeen measured with unprecedented precision, yet the absolute neutrino mass\nscale remains unknown. Additionally, the fundamental symmetry governing the\nneutrino mixing pattern is still undetermined. Among various theoretical\npossibilities, the two-zero texture in the neutrino mass matrix ($m_\\nu$)\nstands out as an attractive framework due to its reduced number of free\nparameters, enabling definite predictions for the unknown parameters of the\nPMNS matrix. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the two-zero\ntexture, focusing on its implications for the Dirac CP phase ($\\delta$), the\nMajorana phases ($\\rho$, $\\sigma$) and the effective Majorana mass\n($m_{\\beta\\beta}$), the latter being crucial for neutrinoless double beta\ndecay. We find that for certain two-zero textures, $m_{\\beta\\beta}$ reaches a\nfew tens of meV, placing it within the sensitivity range of KamLAND-Zen.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate how a two-zero texture can naturally emerge in a\nwell-motivated neutrino mass model, specifically the gauged Type-II seesaw\nmechanism, which requires multiple scalar triplets. Notably, some of the\ntwo-zero patterns cannot be realized in this framework, as more than two\nindependent zeros appear in $m_\\nu$.

    "abstract": "Brownian Information engine (BIE) harnesses the energy from a fluctuating\nenvironment by utilizing the associated information change in the presence of a\nsingle heat bath. The engine operates in a space-dependent confining potential\nand requires an appropriate feedback control mechanism. In general, the\nfeedback controller has three different steps: measurement, feedback, and\nrelaxation. The feedback step is related to a sudden change in the potential\nenergy that is essential for a nonzero work output. BIE utilises the amount of\ninformation (surprise) acquired during the measurement step for the energy\noutput. However, due to the relaxation process, a certain amount of acquired\ninformation is lost or becomes unavailable. So, controlling information loss\nduring relaxation is crucial for the overall efficiency of the engine. The net\n(available) information, therefore, can be monitored by tuning the feedback\ncontroller and the shape of the confining potential. In this paper, we explore\nthe effect of the shape modulation of the confining potential, which may have\nmultiple stable valleys and unstable hills, on the net available information\nand, hence, the performance of a BIE that operates under an asymmetric feedback\nprotocol. We examine the optimal performance requirements of the BIE and the\namount of maximum work output under different potential profiling. For\nmonostable trapping, a concave shape in confining potential results in a higher\nwork output than a convex one. We also find that hills and valleys in the\nconfining potential may lead to multiple good operating conditions. An\nappropriate shape modulation can create a heater-refrigerator transition and\ntheir reentrance due to non-trivial changes in information loss during the\nrelaxation process.",

Their hybrid\ncrystal-liquid nature endows them with novel physical properties with\nadvantages over their crystalline counterparts. Here, we show the existence of\nnonequilibrium hard-sphere glasses within this unusual ground-state manifold as\nthe stealthiness parameter $\\chi$ tends to zero that are remarkably\nconfigurationally extremely close to hyperuniform 3D maximally random jammed\n(MRJ) sphere packings. The latter are prototypical glasses since they are\nmaximally disordered, perfectly rigid, and perfectly nonergodic. Our\noptimization procedure, which leverages the maximum cardinality of the infinite\nground-state set, not only guarantees that our packings are hyperuniform with\nthe same structure-factor scaling exponent as the MRJ state, but they share\nother salient structural attributes, including a packing fraction of $0.638$, a\nmean contact number per particle of 6, gap exponent of $0.44(1)$, and pair\ncorrelation functions $g_2(r)$ and structures factors $S(k)$ that are virtually\nidentical to one another for all $r$ and $k$, respectively.

Here we show how RC can be extracted quantitatively from the\nmeasured junction resistance (RP) by using the extrapolated zero-length\nresistance (RZLR) and short-circuit resistance (RS). We used AC (impedance\nspectroscopy) and DC measurements to examine charge transport in junctions of\nhuman serum albumin (HSA) and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) films with varying\nthicknesses. Three contact configurations, Si-Au, Au-EGaIn, and, in a micropore\ndevice (MpD), Au-Pd, were compared. While Si-Au and Au-EGaIn junctions exhibit\nsubstantial RC that we ascribe to interfacial oxides and electrostatic\nprotein-electrode interactions, MpD effectively eliminates RC, enabling\nmeasuring the intrinsic electron transport across HSA and bR films. The\nexponential length dependence of RP shows a transport decay constant (beta)\nthat varies with interfacial conditions, underscoring the role of contact\nengineering.

In this study we address this challenge by\nintroducing a novel framework to estimate the amount of computation implemented\nby an arbitrary physical system based on empirical time-series of its dynamics.\nThis framework works by forming a statistical reconstruction of that dynamics,\nand then defining the amount of computation in terms of both the complexity and\nfidelity of this reconstruction.

We then apply this framework to neural activity in\n\\textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}, as captured by calcium imaging. By analyzing\ntime-series neural data obtained from the fluorescent intensity of the calcium\nindicator GCaMP, we find that high and low amounts of computation are required,\nrespectively, in the neural dynamics of freely moving and immobile worms.

Results and Conclusions: The first experiment confirmed that the\nHRI sensor captured both voluntary and involuntary torques, providing\ndirectional torque insights. The second experiment showed that the device\nslightly restricted ankle range of motion (RoM) but supported normal gait\npatterns across all assistance modes. The exoskeleton reduced muscle activity,\nparticularly in active mode. HRI torque varied according to gait phases and\nhighlighted reduced synchronization, suggesting a need for improved support.\nThe third experiment revealed that load-carrying increased GM and TA muscle\nactivity, but the device partially mitigated user effort by reducing muscle\nactivity compared to unassisted walking. HRI increased during load-carrying,\nproviding insights into user-device dynamics.

Beyond the traditional 3D\nperovskites, low-dimensional counterparts have more attractive effects such as\nexcitonic emissions and quantum confinements that are enhanced by the reduced\ndimensionality, which involve the Electron-Phonon Coupling (EPC). Such\nphenomenon, which comprehends the interaction between charge carriers and\nlattice vibrations, usually strongly impacts the photoluminescence (PL)\nresponse in low-dimensional frameworks. In this paper, we investigated the\nintrinsic EPC onto low-temperature PL of the zero-dimensional (0D) Rb2SnBr6\nperovskite. Temperature-dependent PL measurements, complemented by various\ncharacterization techniques and theoretical calculations, revealed broadband\nemission with a significant Stokes shift attributed to self-trapped excitons\n(STEs). The Fr\\\"ohlich mechanism, mediated by interactions between excitonic\ncharge carriers and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, primarily accounts for\nthe emission broadening through phonon-assisted radiative recombination. The\nEPC strength was evaluated through the Huang-Rhys factor S=34, confirming\nstrong correlations between electronic and vibrational properties and\nsupporting the STE emission assumption. The possible mechanism of STE formation\nwas evaluated by the Fr\\\"ohlich parameter {\\alpha} of 1.94 for electrons and\n4.73 for holes, which points out a major contribution of the hole-polaron\nquasi-particle on exciton trapping.

    "abstract": "The performance of distributed averaging depends heavily on the underlying\ntopology. In various fields, including compressed sensing, multi-party\ncomputation, and abstract graph theory, graphs may be expected to be free of\nshort cycles, i.e. to have high girth. Though extensive analyses and heuristics\nexist for optimising the performance of distributed averaging in general\nnetworks, these studies do not consider girth. As such, it is not clear what\nhappens to convergence time when a graph is stretched to a higher girth.\n  In this work, we introduce the optimal graph stretching problem, wherein we\nare interested in finding the set of edges for a particular graph that ensures\noptimal convergence time under constraint of a minimal girth. We compare\nvarious methods for choosing which edges to remove, and use various convergence\nheuristics to speed up the searching process. We generate many graphs with\nvarying parameters, stretch and optimise them, and measure the duration of\ndistributed averaging. We find that stretching by itself significantly\nincreases convergence time. This decrease can be counteracted with a subsequent\nrepair phase, guided by a convergence time heuristic. Existing heuristics are\ncapable, but may be suboptimal.",

To flexibly capture high-order inter-object\nand temporal relationships, we propose a point-based MOD in remote sensing.\nInspired by diffusion models, the network optimization is formulated as a\nprogressive denoising process that iteratively recovers moving object centers\nfrom sparse noisy points. Specifically, we sample scattered features from the\nbackbone outputs as atomic units for subsequent processing, while global\nfeature embeddings are aggregated to compensate for the limited coverage of\nsparse point features. By modeling spatial relative positions and semantic\naffinities, Spatial Relation Aggregation Attention is designed to enable\nhigh-order interactions among point-level features for enhanced object\nrepresentation. To enhance temporal consistency, the Temporal Propagation and\nGlobal Fusion module is designed, which leverages an implicit memory reasoning\nmechanism for robust cross-frame feature integration. To align with the\nprogressive denoising process, we propose a progressive MinK optimal transport\nassignment strategy that establishes specialized learning objectives at each\ndenoising level. Additionally, we introduce a missing loss function to\ncounteract the clustering tendency of denoised points around salient objects.\nExperiments on the RsData remote sensing MOD dataset show that our MOD method\nbased on scattered point denoising can more effectively explore potential\nrelationships between sparse moving objects and improve the detection\ncapability and temporal consistency.",

The ability to accurately transmit and receive data is the basis for\nhigh-speed communications and precise sensing, where a fundamental requirement\nis an accurate in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) modulation. For sensing,\nimperfections in IQ modulation lead to two critical issues in the\nrange-Doppler-map (RDM) in form of an increased noise floor and the presence of\nghost objects, degrading the accuracy and reliability of the information in the\nRDM. This paper presents a low-complex estimation and compensation method to\nmitigate the IQ imbalance effects. This is achieved by utilizing, amongst\nothers, the leakage signal, which is the direct signal from the transmitter to\nthe receiver path, and is typically the strongest signal component in the RDM.\nThe parameters of the IQ imbalance suppression structure are estimated based on\na mixed complex-/real-valued bilinear filter approach, that considers IQ\nimbalance in the transmitter and the receiver of the JCAS-capable user\nequipment (UE). The UE uses a 5G New Radio (NR)-compliant orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform with the system configuration\nassumed to be predefined from the communication side.

Previous\nresearch in the eye-tracking community focused on obfuscating iris textures\nwhile keeping utility tasks such as gaze estimation accurate.

We use eye segmentation and gaze estimation\nas utility tasks, and reduction in iris recognition accuracy as a measure of\nprivacy protection, and false acceptance rate to estimate risk of attack. Our\nexperiments show that canonical image processing methods like blurring and\nnoising cause a marginal impact on deep learning-based tasks. While\ndownsampling, rubber sheet model, and iris style transfer are effective in\nhiding user identifiers, iris style transfer, with higher computation cost,\noutperforms others in both utility tasks, and is more resilient against spoof\nattacks.

An interesting feature of the axial charge\noperator is that it acts locally on operators and has quantized eigenvalues in\nmomentum space. Therefore, the eigenstates of this operator can be interpreted\nas fermion states with a well-defined integer chirality, analogous to those in\nthe continuum theory. This allows us to realize a gauge theory where the axial\n$\\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry acts as a gauge symmetry.

The processes\nunder consideration are of the form $X_t = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^\\infty \\mathbf{A}_\\ell\nZ_{t-\\ell}$ with iid innovations $(Z_t)$. The key structural assumption is that\nthe coefficient matrices and the variance of the innovations are simultaneously\ndiagonalizable in a common orthonormal basis. We develop a strategy for\nestimating the joint spectral distribution of the coefficient matrices and the\ninnovation variance by making use of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues\nof appropriately weighted integrals of the sample periodogram. Throughout we\nwork under the asymptotic regime $p,n \\to \\infty$, such that $p/n\\to c \\in\n(0,\\infty)$, where $p$ is the dimension and $n$ is the sample size. Under this\nsetting, we first establish a weak limit for the empirical distribution of\neigenvalues of the aforementioned integrated sample periodograms. This result\nis proved using techniques from random matrix theory, in particular the\ncharacterization of weak convergence by means of the Stieltjes transform of\nrelevant distributions. We utilize this result to develop an estimator of the\njoint spectral distribution of the coefficient matrices, by minimizing an\n$L^\\kappa$ discrepancy measure, for $\\kappa \\geq 1$, between the empirical and\nlimiting Stieltjes transforms of the integrated sample periodograms. This is\naccomplished by assuming that the joint spectral distribution is a discrete\nmixture of point masses.

The proposed\napproach addresses this limitation by offering an adaptive framework for sensor\nplacement within the digital twin paradigm. The sensor placement problem is\nformulated as a Markov decision process, enabling the training and deployment\nof an agent capable of dynamically repositioning sensors in response to the\nevolving conditions of the physical structure as represented by the digital\ntwin. This ensures that the digital twin maintains a highly representative and\nreliable connection to its physical counterpart. The proposed framework is\nvalidated through a series of comprehensive case studies involving a cantilever\nplate structure subjected to diverse conditions, including healthy and damaged\nconditions. The results demonstrate the capability of the deep reinforcement\nlearning agent to adaptively reposition sensors improving the quality of data\nacquisition and hence enhancing the overall accuracy of digital twins.",

Structural annotations of MR images are an\nimportant step for quantitative analysis of the developing human brain, with\nDeep learning providing an automated alternative for this otherwise tedious\nmanual process. However, segmentation performances of Convolutional Neural\nNetworks often suffer from domain shift, where the network fails when applied\nto subjects that deviate from the distribution with which it is trained on. In\nthis work, we aim to train networks capable of automatically segmenting fetal\nbrain MRIs with a wide range of domain shifts pertaining to differences in\nsubject physiology and acquisition environments, in particular shape-based\ndifferences commonly observed in pathological cases. We introduce a novel\ndata-driven train-time sampling strategy that seeks to fully exploit the\ndiversity of a given training dataset to enhance the domain generalizability of\nthe trained networks.

PB\nis ideally suited for checking the validity of our method since, in addition to\nproducing collinear parton densities, it also produces the corresponding\ntransverse-dependent (TMD) ones, and these can then be directly compared to the\ntransverse momentum distribution obtained from the parton shower. We show that\nTMD distributions which we in this way obtain from our modified PYTHIA8 shower\nusing leading order (LO) parton densities and splitting functions are fully\nconsistent with the corresponding leading order TMD densities. At\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) it is not possible to achieve the same consistency\nusing the built-in LO splitting functions in the shower, but we show that by\nintroducing NLO splitting functions using a reweighting procedure, we can\nachieve consistency also at NLO. The method presented here, which we have named\nPDF2ISR, can be easily extended to any collinear parton densities, as long as\nthe exact conditions for the evolution are known.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose an efficient framework that quickly adapts to a specific\ninput instance, completing both training and inference in a short time. Our\nframework splits the input image into multiple patches, selects a subset for\nunsupervised CAT training, and then performs inference on all patches,\nstitching them into the final output. The CAT module, integrated between the\nfeature extraction and channel transformation stages of a pre-trained network,\ntailors the fused features and fixes the parameters for efficient inference,\ngenerating improved results. Our approach offers two key advantages: (1)\n$\\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: by mitigating cross-sensor\ndegradation, our model--although pre-trained on a specific dataset--achieves\nsuperior performance on datasets captured by other sensors; (2)\n$\\textit{Enhanced Computational Efficiency}$: the CAT-enhanced network can\nswiftly adapt to the test sample using the single LRMS-PAN pair input, without\nrequiring extensive large-scale data retraining.

Cosmological analyses based\non galaxy cluster number counts have traditionally relied on explicitly\ncomputed likelihoods, which are often challenging to develop with the required\naccuracy and expensive to evaluate. In this work, we implement an alternative\napproach based on simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that relies solely\non synthetic galaxy cluster catalogues generated under a given model. These\ncatalogues are much easier to produce than it is to develop and validate a\nlikelihood. We validate this approach in the context of the galaxy cluster\nsurvey of the upcoming Simons Observatory for a setup in which we can also\nevaluate an exact explicit likelihood. We find that our SBI-based approach\nyields cosmological parameter posterior means that are within $0.2\\,\\sigma$ of\nthose obtained with the explicit likelihood and with biases smaller than\n$0.1\\,\\sigma$. We also introduce and validate a procedure to assess the\ngoodness of fit using only synthetic catalogues similar to those used for\ntraining. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a galaxy cluster number\ncount cosmological analysis can be performed fully without resorting to a\nlikelihood at any stage. Finally, we apply our SBI-based approach to the real\nPlanck MMF3 cosmology sample, obtaining cosmological parameter constraints that\nare within $0.1\\,\\sigma$ of their likelihood-based counterparts.

This paper highlights the critical\nimportance of processing streaming data for effective fraud detection. To\naddress the inherent challenges of latency, scalability, and concept drift in\nstreaming environments, we propose a robust online streaming fraud detection\n(ROSFD) framework. Our proposed framework comprises two key stages: (i) Stage\nOne: Offline Model Initialization. In this initial stage, a model is built in\noffline settings using incremental learning principles to overcome the\n\"cold-start\" problem. (ii) Stage Two: Real-time Model Adaptation. In this\ndynamic stage, drift detection algorithms (viz.,, DDM, EDDM, and ADWIN) are\nemployed to identify concept drift in the incoming data stream and\nincrementally train the model accordingly. This \"train-only-when-required\"\nstrategy drastically reduces the number of retrains needed without\nsignificantly impacting the area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurve (AUC). Overall, ROSFD utilizing ADWIN as the drift detection method\ndemonstrated the best performance among the employed methods.

While in quasi-circular binaries, the influence of the\nmagnetic field is too weak to affect the general pre-merger dynamics, the close\nencounters in eccentric systems could potentially trigger magneto-hydrodynamic\ninstabilities. Therefore, we investigate possible effects before, during, and\nafter the merger for a total of three different systems with varying initial\neccentricity.\n  We study the f-mode oscillations excited by tidal interaction in close\nencounters and find good agreement with predicted f-mode frequency estimates.\nHowever, our simulations reveal no significant differences compared to results\nneglecting the magnetic field. Although we observe a rearrangement of the\npoloidal structure of the magnetic field inside the stars, there is no relevant\nincrease in the magnetic energy during the encounters. Also, during the merger,\nthe amplification of the magnetic field seems to be largely independent of the\neccentricity in our systems.

We conduct probing experiments on 11\nopen-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs\npredominantly simulate personality for responding in their middle and upper\nlayers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer\nseparation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained\nprobing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we\npropose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by\nLLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly\nspecifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the\nresponse personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting\nbetween certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the\nrepresentational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a\ncomprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis,\ndemonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal\ndegradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and\nacceptable inference latency.

    "abstract": "Distributed learning and Edge AI necessitate efficient data processing,\nlow-latency communication, decentralized model training, and stringent data\nprivacy to facilitate real-time intelligence on edge devices while reducing\ndependency on centralized infrastructure and ensuring high model performance.\nIn the context of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) applications, the\nprimary objective is to accurately monitor and classify interferences that\ndegrade system performance in distributed environments, thereby enhancing\nsituational awareness. To achieve this, machine learning (ML) models can be\ndeployed on low-resource devices, ensuring minimal communication latency and\npreserving data privacy. The key challenge is to compress ML models while\nmaintaining high classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose variational\nautoencoders (VAEs) for disentanglement to extract essential latent features\nthat enable accurate classification of interferences. We demonstrate that the\ndisentanglement approach can be leveraged for both data compression and data\naugmentation by interpolating the lower-dimensional latent representations of\nsignal power. To validate our approach, we evaluate three VAE variants -\nvanilla, factorized, and conditional generative - on four distinct datasets,\nincluding two collected in controlled indoor environments and two real-world\nhighway datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive hyperparameter searches to\noptimize performance. Our proposed VAE achieves a data compression rate ranging\nfrom 512 to 8,192 and achieves an accuracy up to 99.92%.",

    "abstract": "This work continues the analysis of the model for calculating the thermal\nstructure of an axisymmetric protoplanetary disk, initiated in the paper by\nPavlyuchenkov (2024). The model is based on the well-known Flux-Limited\nDiffusion (FLD) approximation with separate calculation of heating by direct\nstellar radiation (hereinafter referred to as the FLD$^{\\rm s}$ method). In\naddition to the previously described FLD$^{\\rm s}$ model with\nwavelength-averaged opacities, we present a multiband model mFLD$^{\\rm s}$,\nwhere the spectrum of thermal radiation is divided into several frequency\nbands. The model is based on an implicit finite-difference scheme for the\nequations of thermal radiation diffusion, which reduces to a system of linear\nalgebraic equations written in hypermatrix form. A modified Gauss method for\ninverting the sparse hypermatrix of the original system of linear equations is\nproposed. The simulation results described in the article show that the\nmidplane radial temperature profile obtained with the mFLD$^{\\rm s}$ method has\na variable slope in accordance with the reference Monte Carlo radiative\ntransfer simulations. The mFLD$^{\\rm s}$ model also qualitatively reproduces\nthe non-isothermality of the temperature distribution along the angular\ncoordinate near the midplane, which is not provided by the FLD$^{\\rm s}$\nmethod. However, quantitative differences remain between the reference\ntemperature values and the results of mFLD$^{\\rm s}$. These differences are\nlikely due to the diffusive nature of the FLD approximation. It is also shown\nthat the characteristic times for the disk to reach thermal equilibrium within\nthe mFLD$^{\\rm s}$ model can be significantly shorter than in FLD$^{\\rm s}$.\nThis property should be taken into account when modeling non-stationary\nprocesses in protoplanetary disks within FLD-based models.",

    "abstract": "In this work, a novel quantum Fourier ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nsolver is proposed to solve both linear and nonlinear partial differential\nequations (PDEs). Traditional quantum ODE solvers transform a PDE into an ODE\nsystem via spatial discretization and then integrate it, thereby converting the\ntask of solving the PDE into computing the integral for the driving function\n$f(x)$. These solvers rely on the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm, which\nrequires the driving function $f(x)$ to be within the range of [0, 1] and\nnecessitates the construction of a quantum circuit for the oracle R that\nencodes $f(x)$. This construction can be highly complex, even for simple\nfunctions like $f(x) = x$. An important exception arises for the specific case\nof $f(x) = sin^2(mx+c)$, which can be encoded more efficiently using a set of\n$Ry$ rotation gates. To address these challenges, we expand the driving\nfunction $f(x)$ as a Fourier series and propose the Quantum Fourier ODE Solver.\nThis approach not only simplifies the construction of the oracle R but also\nremoves the restriction that $f(x)$ must lie within [0,1]. The proposed method\nwas evaluated by solving several representative linear and nonlinear PDEs,\nincluding the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. The results show that the quantum\nFourier ODE solver produces results that closely match both analytical and\nreference solutions.",

    "abstract": "Accretion of pre-main sequence stars (PMS) is a key process in stellar\nformation, governing mass assembly, influencing angular momentum conservation\nand stellar internal structure, and shaping disc evolution, which serves as the\nbirthplace of exoplanets. Classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs), low-mass PMS stars\nactively accreting from a disc, hold a well-described magnetospheric accretion\nmodel. Their strong, inclined dipole magnetic fields truncate the disc at a few\nstellar radii, channelling material along magnetic field lines to fall onto the\nstellar surface near the dipole pole. However, this paradigm assumes the\npresence of a single star, and a complete description of the accretion process\nin multiple systems remains to be achieved. Building on our previous work on DQ\nTau and AK Sco, we aim to describe the accretion processes in cTTS binaries,\naccounting for the influence of stellar magnetic fields. Specifically, we\nsought to explore how the magnetospheric accretion model of cTTSs can be\napplied to V4046 Sgr, a spectroscopic binary composed of equal-mass and coeval\ncTTSs in a circular orbit with synchronous rotation, surrounded by a\ncircumbinary disc. We analysed a time series of ESPaDOnS spectra covering\nseveral orbital cycles. A variability analysis was performed on the radial\nvelocities and on the Balmer, He I D3, and Ca II emission lines, which are\nassociated with the accretion process. We identified the secondary as the\nsystem's main accretor, operating in an unstable regime. Additionally, we\ndetected an accretion funnel flow connecting the dipole pole of the primary\nstar with a nearby bulk of gas. We concluded that the two components exhibit\ndissimilar accretion patterns. The primary operates in an \"ordered chaotic\"\nregime, where accretion funnel flows and accretion tongues coexist. Conversely,\nthe secondary appears to be in a chaotic regime, with accretion tongues\ndominating.",

To address this challenge, we explore the potential of\nDeep Generative Models (DGMs) in producing synthetic data that satisfies the\nGenerative Learning Trilemma: fidelity, diversity, and sampling efficiency.\nHowever, recognizing that these criteria alone are insufficient for practical\napplications, we extend the trilemma to include utility, robustness, and\nprivacy, factors crucial for ensuring the applicability of DGMs in real-world\nscenarios. Evaluating these metrics becomes particularly challenging in\ndata-scarce environments, as DGMs traditionally rely on large datasets to\nperform optimally. This limitation is especially pronounced in domains like\nmedicine and precision agriculture, where ensuring acceptable model performance\nunder data constraints is vital. To address these challenges, we assess the\nGenerative Learning Trilemma in data-scarcity settings using state-of-the-art\nevaluation metrics, comparing three prominent DGMs: Variational Autoencoders\n(VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion Models (DMs).\nFurthermore, we propose a comprehensive framework to assess utility,\nrobustness, and privacy in synthetic data generated by DGMs. Our findings\ndemonstrate varying strengths among DGMs, with each model exhibiting unique\nadvantages based on the application context.

However, meaningful predictions require the estimation\nof the current state of the system, as measurements are usually only at the\nborehole of the ATES.

The discrete Boltzmann method\n(DBM) provides a multiscale kinetic modeling framework and analysis tool to\ncapture complex discrete/nonequilibrium effects. While the numerical scheme\nplays a fundamental role in DBM simulations, a comprehensive stability analysis\nremains lacking. Similar to LBM, complexity mainly lies in the intrinsic\ncoupling between velocity and spatiotemporal discretizations, compared with\nCFD. This study conducts von Neumann stability analysis to investigate key\nfactors influencing DBM simulation stability, including phase-space\ndiscretization, thermodynamic nonequilibrium (TNE) levels, spatiotemporal\nschemes, initial conditions, and model parameters. Key findings include: (i)\nthe moment-matching approach outperforms the expansion- and weighting-based\nmethods in the test simulations; (ii) increased TNE enhances system\nnonlinearity and the intrinsic nonlinearity embedded in the model equations,\namplifying instabilities; (iii) additional viscous dissipation based on\ndistribution functions improves stability but distorts flow fields and alters\nconstitutive relations; (iv) larger CFL numbers and relative time steps degrade\nstability, necessitating appropriate time-stepping strategies. To assess the\nstability regulation capability of DBMs across TNE levels, stability-phase\ndiagrams and probability curves are constructed via morphological analysis\nwithin the moment-matching framework. These diagrams identify common stable\nparameter regions across model orders. This study reveals key factors and\ncoupling mechanisms affecting DBM stability and proposes strategies for\noptimizing equilibrium distribution discretization, velocity design, and\nparameter selection in supersonic regimes.",

    "abstract": "Just as humans display language patterns influenced by their native tongue\nwhen speaking new languages, LLMs often default to English-centric responses\neven when generating in other languages. Nevertheless, we observe that local\ncultural information persists within the models and can be readily activated\nfor cultural customization. We first demonstrate that explicitly providing\ncultural context in prompts significantly improves the models' ability to\ngenerate culturally localized responses. We term the disparity in model\nperformance with versus without explicit cultural context the explicit-implicit\nlocalization gap, indicating that while cultural knowledge exists within LLMs,\nit may not naturally surface in multilingual interactions if cultural context\nis not explicitly provided. Despite the explicit prompting benefit, however,\nthe answers reduce in diversity and tend toward stereotypes. Second, we\nidentify an explicit cultural customization vector, conserved across all\nnon-English languages we explore, which enables LLMs to be steered from the\nsynthetic English cultural world-model toward each non-English cultural world.\nSteered responses retain the diversity of implicit prompting and reduce\nstereotypes to dramatically improve the potential for customization. We discuss\nthe implications of explicit cultural customization for understanding the\nconservation of alternative cultural world models within LLMs, and their\ncontrollable utility for translation, cultural customization, and the\npossibility of making the explicit implicit through soft control for expanded\nLLM function and appeal.",

    "abstract": "Human pose estimation (HPE) has become essential in numerous applications\nincluding healthcare, activity recognition, and human-computer interaction.\nHowever, the privacy implications of processing sensitive visual data present\nsignificant deployment barriers in critical domains. While traditional\nanonymization techniques offer limited protection and often compromise data\nutility for broader motion analysis, Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal\nprivacy guarantees but typically degrades model performance when applied\nnaively. In this work, we present the first differentially private 2D human\npose estimation (2D-HPE) by applying Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient\nDescent (DP-SGD) to this task. To effectively balance privacy with performance,\nwe adopt Projected DP-SGD (PDP-SGD), which projects the noisy gradients to a\nlow-dimensional subspace. Additionally, we adapt TinyViT, a compact and\nefficient vision transformer for coordinate classification in HPE, providing a\nlightweight yet powerful backbone that enhances privacy-preserving deployment\nfeasibility on resource-limited devices. Our approach is particularly valuable\nfor multimedia interpretation tasks, enabling privacy-safe analysis and\nunderstanding of human motion across diverse visual media while preserving the\nsemantic meaning required for downstream applications. Comprehensive\nexperiments on the MPII Human Pose Dataset demonstrate significant performance\nenhancement with PDP-SGD achieving 78.48% PCKh@0.5 at a strict privacy budget\n($\\epsilon=0.2$), compared to 63.85% for standard DP-SGD.

Despite their usefulness, we\nuncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks.\nSpecifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full)\nforget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset\n(functioning as a \"coreset\"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even\nwhen selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks\ncan be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We\ndemonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM\nunlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU\n(Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks.\nThe surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data\nselection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated\nheuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a\nkeyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set\nalone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that\ncurrent unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than\nthe entire dataset.

    "abstract": "We establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions to the vacuum\nfree boundary problem of the 1-D viscous Saint-Venant system with large data.\nSince the depth $\\rho$ of the fluid vanishes on the moving boundary, the\nmomentum equations become degenerate both in the time evolution and spatial\ndissipation, which may lead to singularities for the derivatives of the\nvelocity u of the fluid and then makes it challenging to study classical\nsolutions. By exploiting the intrinsic degenerate-singular structures of this\nsystem, we are able to identify two classes of admissible initial depth profile\nand obtain the global well-posedness theory here: $\\rho_0^\\alpha\\in H^3$\n$(\\frac{1}{3}<\\alpha<1)$ vanishes as the distance to the moving boundary, which\nsatisfies the BD entropy condition; while $\\rho_0\\in H^3$ vanishes as the\ndistance to the moving boundary, which satisfies the physical vacuum boundary\ncondition, but violates the BD entropy condition. Further, it is shown that for\narbitrarily large time, the solutions obtained here are smooth (in Sobolev\nspaces) all the way up to the moving boundary. One of the key ingredients of\nthe analysis here is to establish some degenerate weighted estimates for the\neffective velocity $v=u+ (\\log\\rho)_y$ (y is the Eulerian spatial coordinate)\nvia its transport properties, which enables one to obtain the upper bounds for\nthe first order derivatives of the flow map $\\eta$. Then the global regularity\nuniformly up to the vacuum boundary can be obtained by carrying out a series of\nweighted energy estimates carefully designed for this system. It is worth\npointing out that the result here seems to be the first global existence theory\nof classical solutions with large data that is independent of the BD entropy\nfor such degenerate systems, and the methodology developed here can be applied\nto more general degenerate CNS.",

This study presents the first systematic exploration of axion mass\nmixing in scenarios involving more than two axions. The maximal mixing occurs\nwhen the masses of all ALPs are smaller than the zero-temperature mass of the\nQCD axion, with no two ALP masses being equal, and when the decay constants of\nall ALPs are simultaneously either smaller or larger than the decay constant of\nthe QCD axion.

As a\nmathematical model for the two-phase fluid on the detailed scale we chose a\nnon-local version of the Navier$-$Stokes$-$Korteweg equations in the\none-dimensional and periodic setting. Our justification relies on anticipating\nthe macroscopic description of the two-phase fluid as the limit system for a\nsequence of solutions with highly oscillating initial densities. Interpreting\nthe density as a parametrized measure, we extract a limit system consisting of\na kinetic equation for the parametrized measure and a momentum equation for the\nvelocity. Under the assumption that the initial density distributions converge\nin the limit to a convex combination of Dirac-measures, we show by a uniqueness\nresult that the parametrized measure also has to be a convex combination of\nDirac-measures and, that the limit system reduces to the Baer$-$Nunziato\nsystem.

    "abstract": "Large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) methods have proven highly effective\nin enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs),\nparticularly for tasks with verifiable solutions such as mathematics and\ncoding. However, applying this idea to machine translation (MT), where outputs\nare flexibly formatted and difficult to automatically evaluate with explicit\nrules, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MT-R1-Zero, the first\nopen-source adaptation of the R1-Zero RL framework for MT without supervised\nfine-tuning or cold-start. We propose a rule-metric mixed reward mechanism to\nguide LLMs towards improved translation quality via emergent reasoning. On the\nWMT 24 English-Chinese benchmark, our MT-R1-Zero-3B-Mix achieves competitive\nperformance, surpassing TowerInstruct-7B-v0.2 by an average of 1.26 points.\nMeanwhile, our MT-R1-Zero-7B-Mix attains a high average score of 62.25 across\nall metrics, placing it on par with advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o\nand Claude-3.5-Sonnet, while the MT-R1-Zero-7B-Sem variant achieves\nstate-of-the-art scores on semantic metrics. Moreover, our work exhibits strong\ngeneralization capabilities on out-of-distribution MT tasks, robustly\nsupporting multilingual and low-resource settings. Extensive analysis of model\nbehavior across different initializations and reward metrics offers pioneering\ninsight into the critical role of reward design, LLM adaptability, training\ndynamics, and emergent reasoning patterns within the R1-Zero paradigm for MT.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/fzp0424/MT-R1-Zero.",

Despite this growing interest,\nthere remains a lack of a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and evaluation\nbenchmark with fine-grained annotations tailored to assess the OOD\ngeneralization on more intricate tasks like object detection and grounding. To\naddress this gap, we introduce COUNTS, a large-scale OOD dataset with\nobject-level annotations.

O(OD)2 is designed\nto comprehensively evaluate the OOD generalization capabilities of object\ndetectors by utilizing controlled distribution shifts between training and\ntesting data. OODG, on the other hand, aims to assess the OOD generalization of\ngrounding abilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our findings\nreveal that, while large models and extensive pre-training data substantially\nen hance performance in in-distribution (IID) scenarios, significant\nlimitations and opportunities for improvement persist in OOD contexts for both\nobject detectors and MLLMs. In visual grounding tasks, even the advanced GPT-4o\nand Gemini-1.5 only achieve 56.7% and 28.0% accuracy, respectively.

    "abstract": "Alfven waves propagating in a vertically stratified plasma, such as those\ntravelling from the solar photosphere to the corona, are partially reflected\ndue to the gradient in the Alfven speed. Wave reflection naturally results in\nthe superposition of upward- and downward-propagating waves. A simple analytic\nmodel demonstrates that this superposition leads to the non-equipartition of\nkinetic and magnetic energies in the Alfven wave perturbations and slows down\nthe net energy transport. A numerical model of Alfven wave propagation in the\nlower solar atmosphere reveals significant wave reflection below the transition\nregion, leading to highly variable kinetic and magnetic energy content in the\nlower chromosphere. At higher altitudes, the kinetic energy eventually\ndominates, depending on the wave frequency. The velocity at which net energy\npropagates upward is significantly smaller than the local Alfven speed\nthroughout the chromosphere. Consequently, the commonly used expression for\nunidirectional Alfven waves in a uniform plasma, which relates the energy flux\nto the kinetic energy density, is not generally applicable in the stratified\nlower solar atmosphere and cannot be reliably used to estimate the energy\ncontent of observed waves. A generalized expression is given, incorporating\ncorrection factors that account for wave reflection and energy\nnon-equipartition. The applicability of the expression is discussed.",

Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting models\nduring inference without requiring labeled test data or access to the original\ntraining set. While research has explored TTA from various perspectives like\nalgorithmic complexity, data and class distribution shifts, model\narchitectures, and offline versus continuous learning, constraints specific to\nmobile and edge devices remain underexplored. We propose BoTTA, a benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate TTA methods under practical constraints on mobile and edge\ndevices. Our evaluation targets four key challenges caused by limited resources\nand usage conditions: (i) limited test samples, (ii) limited exposure to\ncategories, (iii) diverse distribution shifts, and (iv) overlapping shifts\nwithin a sample. We assess state-of-the-art TTA methods under these scenarios\nusing benchmark datasets and report system-level metrics on a real testbed.\nFurthermore, unlike prior work, we align with on-device requirements by\nadvocating periodic adaptation instead of continuous inference-time adaptation.\nExperiments reveal key insights: many recent TTA algorithms struggle with small\ndatasets, fail to generalize to unseen categories, and depend on the diversity\nand complexity of distribution shifts. BoTTA also reports device-specific\nresource use. For example, while SHOT improves accuracy by $2.25\\times$ with\n$512$ adaptation samples, it uses $1.08\\times$ peak memory on Raspberry Pi\nversus the base model.

    "abstract": "We propose GeoUni, the first unified geometry expert model capable of\ngenerating problem solutions and diagrams within a single framework in a way\nthat enables the creation of unique and individualized geometry problems.\nTraditionally, solving geometry problems and generating diagrams have been\ntreated as separate tasks in machine learning, with no models successfully\nintegrating both to support problem creation. However, we believe that mastery\nin geometry requires frictionless integration of all of these skills, from\nsolving problems to visualizing geometric relationships, and finally, crafting\ntailored problems. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoUni, with only\n1.5B parameters, achieves performance comparable to larger models such as\nDeepSeek-R1 with 671B parameters in geometric reasoning tasks. GeoUni also\nexcels in generating precise geometric diagrams, surpassing both text-to-image\nmodels and unified models, including the GPT-4o image generation. Most\nimportantly, GeoUni is the only model capable of successfully generating\ntextual problems with matching diagrams based on specific knowledge points,\nthus offering a wider range of capabilities that extend beyond current models.",

    "abstract": "We aim to develop a new method to infer the sub-beam probability density\nfunction (PDF) of H2 column densities and the dense gas mass within molecular\nclouds using spatially unresolved observations of molecular emission lines in\nthe 3 mm band. We model spatially unresolved line integrated intensity\nmeasurements as the average of an emission function weighted by the sub-beam\ncolumn density PDF. The emission function, which expresses the line integrated\nintensity as a function of the gas column density, is an empirical fit to high\nresolution (< 0.05 pc) multi-line observations of the Orion B molecular cloud.\nThe column density PDF is assumed to be parametric, composed of a lognormal\ndistribution at moderate column densities and a power law distribution at\nhigher column densities. To estimate the sub-beam column density PDF, the\nemission model is combined with a Bayesian inversion algorithm (the Beetroots\ncode), which takes account of thermal noise and calibration errors. We validate\nour method by demonstrating that it recovers the true column density PDF of the\nOrion B cloud, reproducing the observed emission line integrated intensities.\nWe apply the method to 12CO(J=1-0), 13CO(J=1-0), C18O(J=1-0), HCN(J=1-0),\nHCO+(J=1-0) and N2H+(J=1-0) observations of a 700 x 700 pc2 field of view (FoV)\nin the nearby galaxy M51. On average, the model reproduces the observed\nintensities within 30%. The column density PDFs obtained for the spiral arm\nregion within our test FoV are dominated by a power-law tail at high column\ndensities, with slopes that are consistent with gravitational collapse. Outside\nthe spiral arm, the column density PDFs are predominantly lognormal, consistent\nwith supersonic isothermal turbulence. We calculate the mass associated with\nthe powerlaw tail of the column density PDFs and observe a strong, linear\ncorrelation between this mass and the 24$\\mu$m surface brightness.",

This approach relies on the core assumption\nthat the exemplar image-text pairs constitute two representations of an\nidentical concept. However, recent research has revealed that real-world\ndatasets often exhibit cross-modal misalignment. There are two distinct\nviewpoints on how to address this issue: one suggests mitigating the\nmisalignment, and the other leveraging it. We seek here to reconcile these\nseemingly opposing perspectives, and to provide a practical guide for\npractitioners. Using latent variable models we thus formalize cross-modal\nmisalignment by introducing two specific mechanisms: Selection bias, where some\nsemantic variables are absent in the text, and perturbation bias, where\nsemantic variables are altered -- both leading to misalignment in data pairs.\nOur theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the\nrepresentations learned by MMCL capture exactly the information related to the\nsubset of the semantic variables invariant to selection and perturbation\nbiases. This provides a unified perspective for understanding misalignment.\nBased on this, we further offer actionable insights into how misalignment\nshould inform the design of real-world ML systems. We validate our theoretical\nfindings via extensive empirical studies on both synthetic data and real\nimage-text datasets, shedding light on the nuanced impact of cross-modal\nmisalignment on multimodal representation learning.",

Two of the most well-developed frameworks,\ntopological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide\nformal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data.\nDespite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly\ndifferent mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel.\nIn this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data\nanalysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order\ninteractions in multivariate data; with the aim of assessing the similarities\nand differences between how the frameworks define ``higher-order structures.\"\nWe begin with toy examples with known topologies, before turning to\nnaturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that\nintrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with\nthree-dimensional cavities in a point cloud: shapes such as spheres are\nsynergy-dominated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between\nsynergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional\ncavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as\nPCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to\npreserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting\nthat common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are\nsystematically failing to identify important features of the data.

However, no existing approach\ndirectly compresses the conditional distribution of labelled data. To address\nthis gap, we first introduce the Average Maximum Conditional Mean Discrepancy\n(AMCMD), a natural metric for comparing conditional distributions. We then\nderive a consistent estimator for the AMCMD and establish its rate of\nconvergence. Next, we make a key observation: in the context of distribution\ncompression, the cost of constructing a compressed set targeting the AMCMD can\nbe reduced from $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. Building on this, we\nextend the idea of KH to develop Average Conditional Kernel Herding (ACKH), a\nlinear-time greedy algorithm that constructs a compressed set targeting the\nAMCMD. To better understand the advantages of directly compressing the\nconditional distribution rather than doing so via the joint distribution, we\nintroduce Joint Kernel Herding (JKH), a straightforward adaptation of KH\ndesigned to compress the joint distribution of labelled data. While herding\nmethods provide a simple and interpretable selection process, they rely on a\ngreedy heuristic. To explore alternative optimisation strategies, we propose\nJoint Kernel Inducing Points (JKIP) and Average Conditional Kernel Inducing\nPoints (ACKIP), which jointly optimise the compressed set while maintaining\nlinear complexity. Experiments show that directly preserving conditional\ndistributions with ACKIP outperforms both joint distribution compression (via\nJKH and JKIP) and the greedy selection used in ACKH. Moreover, we see that JKIP\nconsistently outperforms JKH.",

    "abstract": "The coalescence of binary black holes (BBHs) provides a unique arena to test\ngeneral relativity (GR) in the dynamical, strong-field regime. To this end, we\npresent pSEOBNRv5PHM, a parametrized, multipolar, spin-precessing waveform\nmodel for BBHs in quasicircular orbits, built within the effective-one-body\nformalism. Compared to its predecessor, pSEOBNRv4HM, our model introduces\nparametrized deviations from GR not only in the plunge-merger-ringdown stages,\nbut also in the inspiral phase through modifications to the conservative\ndynamics. Additionally, it incorporates, for the first time, spin-precession\neffects. The free deviation parameters can be used to perform null tests of GR\nusing current and future gravitational-wave observations. We validate\npSEOBNRv5PHM through Bayesian parameter estimation, focusing on the\nquasinormal-mode frequency and damping time of the $(\\ell,m,n) = (2,2,0)$ mode.\nOur analysis of synthetic signals from numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of\nhighly precessing BH mergers shows that, while pSEOBNRv5PHM correctly recovers\nconsistency with GR, neglecting spin precession can lead to false detections of\ndeviations from GR even at current detector sensitivity. Conversely, when\nanalyzing a synthetic signal from a NR simulation of a binary boson-star\nmerger, the model successfully identifies a deviation from a GR BBH signal.\nFinally, we reanalyze 12 events from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient\nCatalog. Using a hierarchical combination of these events, we constrain\nfractional deviations in the frequency and damping time of the $(2,2,0)$\nquasinormal-mode to $\\delta f_{220}=0.00_{-0.06}^{+0.06}$ and $\\delta\n\\tau_{220}=0.15_{-0.24}^{+0.26}$ at 90% credibility. These results are\nconsistent with those from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, which did not\naccount for spin-precession effects.",

    "abstract": "We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near\nfold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass\nlenses - axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave\nmethods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due\nto highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate\ndescription of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of\nGeometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics -\nbased on Airy function approximations - which lack global validity. Central to\nour approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic\nlength scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave\npropagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational\nwavelength as ~ $ \\lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as\n~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $\nd_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key\nrole in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for\nlens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves\nis not negligible compared to the Einstein radius - as it is in electromagnetic\nlensing - making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.",

To address this limitation, we\npropose training Vision Language Models (VLMs) on data-rich,\nreasoning-intensive tasks during a dedicated mid-training stage, and then\nexamine how incorporating these tasks facilitates generalization to GUI\nplanning scenarios. Specifically, we explore a range of tasks with readily\navailable instruction-tuning data, including GUI perception, multimodal\nreasoning, and textual reasoning. Through extensive experiments across 11\nmid-training tasks, we demonstrate that: (1) Task generalization proves highly\neffective, yielding substantial improvements across most settings. For\ninstance, multimodal mathematical reasoning enhances performance on\nAndroidWorld by an absolute 6.3%. Remarkably, text-only mathematical data\nsignificantly boosts GUI web agent performance, achieving a 5.6% improvement on\nWebArena and 5.4% improvement on AndroidWorld, underscoring notable cross-modal\ngeneralization from text-based to visual domains; (2) Contrary to prior\nassumptions, GUI perception data - previously considered closely aligned with\nGUI agent tasks and widely utilized for training - has a comparatively limited\nimpact on final performance; (3) Building on these insights, we identify the\nmost effective mid-training tasks and curate optimized mixture datasets,\nresulting in absolute performance gains of 8.0% on WebArena and 12.2% on\nAndroidWorld.

Using the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative\ntransfer code POLARIS, we calculated flux and polarization phase curves of\nEarth-like exoplanets with a satellite similar to Earth's moon. Of particular\ninterest are mutual events, when one of the two bodies casts a shadow on the\nother or transits in front of it. We find that the signatures of mutual events\nin the polarization phase curve show significant variations depending on the\ninclination of the lunar orbit. If the planet-satellite pair is spatially\nresolved from the star but the satellite is spatially unresolved, the increase\nin the degree of polarization during a transit of the exomoon in front of the\ncenter of the exoplanet reaches $2.7\\%$ in our model system near quadrature.\nHowever, the change is less than $0.5\\%$ if the orbit of the exomoon is\ninclined such that it transits the planet noncentrally at the same phase\nangles. The influence of an exomoon on the polarization phase curve of an\nexoplanet-exomoon system is dependent on the lunar polarization phase curve.\nObservations of full eclipses and occultations of the exomoon allow the\ndetermination of separate polarization phase curves for the two bodies.\nInformation about the lunar orbital inclination can be obtained with\npolarimetric observations of shadows or transits. Measuring the influence of\nlarge satellites not only on the total flux, but also on the polarization of\nthe reflected stellar radiation during mutual events thus facilitates the\nprediction of future mutual events and the verification of exomoon candidates.",

Furthermore, the symmetric design of FFET has unique superiority over\nCFET thanks to the separate N/P logic on two sides of the wafer and their\nconnections using DM and GM. New routing scheme with dual-sided output pins on\nboth wafer frontside (FS) and backside (BS) was proposed for the first time.\nFinally, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation on complex cell design, taking\nAOI22 as an example.

Prior work [ASIACRYPT 2013,\nLNCS, vol. 8270, pp. 100-119] proposed a compiler for constructing UC-secure\ncommitments from ideal extractable commitments, and our task would be to adapt\nthe ideal extractable commitment scheme proposed therein to our new model.\nHowever, we found an attack and identified a few other issues in that\nconstruction, and to address them, we modified the aforementioned ideal\nextractable commitment scheme and introduced new properties and tools that\nallow us to rigorously develop and present security proofs in this context. We\npropose a new UC-secure commitment scheme against adversaries that can only\ncreate stateless malicious PUFs which can receive, but not send, information\nfrom their creators. Our protocol is more efficient compared to previous\nproposals, as we have parallelized the ideal extractable commitments within it.\nThe restriction to stateless malicious PUFs is significant, mainly since the\nprotocol from [ASIACRYPT 2013, LNCS, vol. 8270, pp. 100-119] assumes malicious\nPUFs with unbounded state, thus limiting its applicability.

Since astrophysical processes are typically\nnon-quasi-static, deriving a rigorous expression for entropy within the\nquasi-static framework is not feasible.

    "abstract": "Personalized recommendation is widely used in the web applications, and graph\ncontrastive learning (GCL) has gradually become a dominant approach in\nrecommender systems, primarily due to its ability to extract self-supervised\nsignals from raw interaction data, effectively alleviating the problem of data\nsparsity. A classic GCL-based method typically uses data augmentation during\ngraph convolution to generates more contrastive views, and performs contrast on\nthese new views to obtain rich self-supervised signals. Despite this paradigm\nis effective, the reasons behind the performance gains remain a mystery. In\nthis paper, we first reveal via theoretical derivation that the gradient\ndescent process of the CL objective is formally equivalent to graph\nconvolution, which implies that CL objective inherently supports neighborhood\naggregation on interaction graphs. We further substantiate this capability\nthrough experimental validation and identify common misconceptions in the\nselection of positive samples in previous methods, which limit the potential of\nCL objective. Based on this discovery, we propose the Light Contrastive\nCollaborative Filtering (LightCCF) method, which introduces a novel\nneighborhood aggregation objective to bring users closer to all interacted\nitems while pushing them away from other positive pairs, thus achieving\nhigh-quality neighborhood aggregation with very low time complexity. On three\nhighly sparse public datasets, the proposed method effectively aggregate\nneighborhood information while preventing graph over-smoothing, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements over existing GCL-based counterparts in both training\nefficiency and recommendation accuracy.

Due to their proximity, the extinction towards\nthese objects is very low, ensuring we minimise any obfuscation in the\nreddening correction and final photometry. We present our findings in both\nTycho and Gaia photometry through colour magnitude diagrams and present\nintrinsic colours and absolute magnitudes for each spectral type. We find Be\nstars are on average ~0.5 magnitudes brighter in both Gaia $G$ and Tycho V$_T$\ncompared to non-emission B stars of the same spectral type. Additionally, we\nfind tentative evidence that Be stars are redder in Gaia B$_P$$-$R$_P$,\nparticularly for the earlier types, but have similar Tycho B$_T$$-$V$_T$\ncolours. We test the effects of gravitational darkening due to rapid rotation\nand binarity on the photometry of our sample and find both to be insufficient\nto explain the observed photometric differences between B and Be stars.

However, these\nmethods either have a fixed receptive field for local learning or significant\ncomputational burdens for global learning, limiting the super-resolution\nperformance. To solve this problem, State Space Models, notably Mamba, is\nintroduced to efficiently model long-range dependencies in images with linear\ncomputational complexity. Relying on the Mamba and the fact that low-resolution\nimages rely on global information to compensate for missing details, while\nhigh-resolution reference images need to provide more local details for\naccurate super-resolution, we propose a global and local Mamba network\n(GLMamba) for multi-modality medical image super-resolution. To be specific,\nour GLMamba is a two-branch network equipped with a global Mamba branch and a\nlocal Mamba branch. The global Mamba branch captures long-range relationships\nin low-resolution inputs, and the local Mamba branch focuses more on\nshort-range details in high-resolution reference images. We also use the deform\nblock to adaptively extract features of both branches to enhance the\nrepresentation ability. A modulator is designed to further enhance deformable\nfeatures in both global and local Mamba blocks. To fully integrate the\nreference image for low-resolution image super-resolution, we further develop a\nmulti-modality feature fusion block to adaptively fuse features by considering\nsimilarities, differences, and complementary aspects between modalities.

For the DT protocol, the exponents of the mass-radius\nrelation, structure factor, and power-law distribution coincide even at\nmoderate values of the size ratio.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel design criterion based on the expected Wasserstein-$p$\ndistance between the prior and posterior distributions. Especially, for $p=2$,\nthis criterion shares key parallels with the widely used expected information\ngain (EIG), which relies on the Kullback--Leibler divergence instead.

Our main\ncontribution is a stability analysis of the Wasserstein-1 criterion, where we\nprovide a rigorous error analysis under perturbations of the prior or\nlikelihood.

In strong\nmagnetic fields beyond 100 T, the significant Zeeman energy competes with the\nlattice interactions, where one can expect considerable magnetostriction.\nHowever, directly observing magnetostriction above 100 T is challenging,\nbecause generating magnetic fields beyond 100 T accompanies the destruction of\nthe coil with a single-shot $\\mu$-second pulse. Here, we observed the giant and\nanisotropic magnetostriction of $\\sim$1 % at 110 T in the spin-controlled\ncrystal of $\\beta$-O$_{2}$, by combining the single-shot diffraction of x-ray\nfree-electron laser (XFEL) and the state-of-the-art portable 100 T generator.\nThe magnetostriction of $\\sim$1 % is the largest class as a deformation of the\nunit cell. It is a response of the soft lattice of $\\beta$-O$_{2}$ originating,\nnot only in the competing van der Waals force and exchange interaction, but\nalso the soft state of spin and lattice frustrated on the triangular network.\nMeanwhile, the anisotropy originates from the strong two-dimensionality of the\nspin system.

    "abstract": "Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR) as a multi-modal task, which aims to\nretrieve the target person from a pool of candidate images given a text\ndescription, has recently garnered considerable attention due to the progress\nof contrastive visual-language pre-trained model. Prior works leverage\npre-trained CLIP to extract person visual and textual features and fully\nfine-tune the entire network, which have shown notable performance improvements\ncompared to uni-modal pre-training models. However, full-tuning a large model\nis prone to overfitting and hinders the generalization ability. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) method\nfor Text-based Person Retrieval (UP-Person) to thoroughly transfer the\nmulti-modal knowledge from CLIP. Specifically, UP-Person simultaneously\nintegrates three lightweight PETL components including Prefix, LoRA and\nAdapter, where Prefix and LoRA are devised together to mine local information\nwith task-specific information prompts, and Adapter is designed to adjust\nglobal feature representations. Additionally, two vanilla submodules are\noptimized to adapt to the unified architecture of TPR. For one thing, S-Prefix\nis proposed to boost attention of prefix and enhance the gradient propagation\nof prefix tokens, which improves the flexibility and performance of the vanilla\nprefix. For another thing, L-Adapter is designed in parallel with layer\nnormalization to adjust the overall distribution, which can resolve conflicts\ncaused by overlap and interaction among multiple submodules. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that our UP-Person achieves state-of-the-art\nresults across various person retrieval datasets, including CUHK-PEDES,\nICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid while merely fine-tuning 4.7\\% parameters.

In light of this, we propose HR2G-shot, a Hierarchical\nRelation-augmented Representation Generalization framework for FSAR, which\nunifies three types of relation modeling (inter-frame, inter-video, and\ninter-task) to learn task-specific temporal patterns from a holistic view.\nGoing beyond conducting inter-frame temporal interactions, we further devise\ntwo components to respectively explore inter-video and inter-task\nrelationships: i) Inter-video Semantic Correlation (ISC) performs cross-video\nframe-level interactions in a fine-grained manner, thereby capturing\ntask-specific query features and enhancing both intra-class consistency and\ninter-class separability; ii) Inter-task Knowledge Transfer (IKT) retrieves and\naggregates relevant temporal knowledge from the bank, which stores diverse\ntemporal patterns from historical episode tasks.

However, we\nfind that most social media posts, along with the public sentiment they\nreflect, provide limited value for trading predictions due to their noisy\nnature. To tackle this, we propose a novel dynamic expert tracing algorithm\nthat filters out non-informative posts and identifies both true and inverse\nexperts whose consistent predictions can serve as valuable trading signals. Our\napproach achieves significant improvements over existing expert identification\nmethods in stock trend prediction.

To address this challenge, we propose a dual graph attention\nneural network that effectively propagates expert signals across related\nstocks, enabling accurate prediction of return ratios and significantly\nincreasing signal coverage. Empirical results show that our propagated\nexpert-based signals not only exhibit strong predictive power independently but\nalso work synergistically with traditional financial features.

    "abstract": "Vanadium dioxide, a well-known Mott insulator, is a highly studied electronic\nmaterial with promising applications in information processing and storage.\nWhile fully crystalline layers exhibit exceptional properties, such as a sharp\nand abrupt conductivity change at the metal-insulator transition, fabricating\npoly-crystalline films on silicon substrates often involves trade-offs in\ntransport characteristics and switching performance, especially for ultra-thin\nlayers required in advanced gate applications. In this study, we explore the\ngrowth of vanadium dioxide films on standard wet-oxidized silicon wafers using\ntwo established deposition techniques with pulsed laser deposition and atomic\nlayer deposition. Thin films, ranging in thickness from 200 to 10 nano meters,\nwere systematically characterized through structural and electrical analyses to\noptimize key growth parameters. Temperature and pressure were identified as the\nprimary factors affecting film quality, and the optimal growth conditions\nacross the entire thickness range are discussed in detail. We demonstrate that\nboth pulsed laser deposition and atomic layer deposition methods can\nsuccessfully produce ultra-thin vanadium dioxide layers down to 8 nano meters\nwith functional properties suitable for practical applications. This work\nunderscores the potential of vanadium dioxide for fully industry compatible\nphase-change switching devices and provides valuable insights into optimizing\ngrowth processes for poly-crystalline films.",

Frustration can negatively impact\nengineers' productivity and well-being if they escalate into stress and\nburnout. In this paper, we assess the impact of LLM interactions on software\nengineers' emotional responses, specifically strains, and identify common\ncauses of frustration when interacting with LLMs at work. Based on 62 survey\nresponses from software engineers in industry and academia across various\ncompanies and universities, we found that a majority of our respondents\nexperience frustrations or other related emotions regardless of the nature of\ntheir work. Additionally, our results showed that frustration mainly stemmed\nfrom issues with correctness and less critical issues such as adaptability to\ncontext or specific format. While such issues may not cause frustration in\ngeneral, artefacts that do not follow certain preferences, standards, or best\npractices can make the output unusable without extensive modification, causing\nfrustration over time. In addition to the frustration triggers, our study\noffers guidelines to improve the software engineers' experience, aiming to\nminimise long-term consequences on mental health.",

Different from simple tasks, real-world code generation\nusually depends on specific programming environment (e.g., code repositories).\nIt contains complex dependencies and domain knowledge, which is needed for LLMs\nwhen generating target code snippets. In this paper, we propose CodeRAG, a\nretrieval-augmented code generation (RAG) framework to comprehensively retrieve\nsupportive codes for real-world code generation. Beginning with the\nrequirement, CodeRAG first constructs a requirement graph for the current\nrepository, and retrieves sub- and similar- requirement nodes of the target\nrequirement on the graph. Meanwhile, it models the repository into a DS-code\ngraph. CodeRAG then maps these relevant requirement nodes into their\ncorresponding code nodes, and treats these code nodes as archors for LLM\nreasoning on DS-code graph. Finally, CodeRAG introduces a code-oriented agentic\nreasoning process, seamlessly allowing LLMs to reason and comprehensively\nretrieve for supportive codes which LLMs' need for generating correct programs.\nExperiments show that CodeRAG achieves significant improvements (i.e.,\nincreasing 40.90 and 37.79 Pass@1 on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro on DevEval) compared\nto no RAG scenarios. Further tests on reasoning LLMs (i.e., QwQ-32B) confirm\nCodeRAG's adaptability and efficacy across various types of LLMs. In addition,\nCodeRAG outperforms commercial programming products such as Copilit and Cursor.\nWe further investigate the performance of our framework on different dependency\ntypes, and observe that CodeRAG is superior in generating examples where target\ncodes invoke predefined cross-file code snippets.

The analysis uses a 365 fb$^{-1}$\ndata sample recorded at the center-of-mass energy of the $\\Upsilon(4S)$\nresonance. One of the $B$ mesons produced in the $\\Upsilon(4S)\\to B^0\n\\bar{B}^0$ process is fully reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode, while its\ncompanion $B$ meson is required to decay into a $K^{\\ast 0}$ and two $\\tau$\nleptons of opposite charge. The $\\tau$ leptons are reconstructed in final\nstates with a single electron, muon, charged pion or charged $\\rho$ meson, and\nadditional neutrinos. We set an upper limit on the branching ratio of $BR(B^0\n\\to K^{\\ast 0} \\tau^+ \\tau^-) < 1.8 \\times 10^{-3}$ at the 90% confidence\nlevel, which is the most stringent constraint reported to date.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion-based imitation learning, which show\nimpressive performance in modeling multimodal distributions and training\nstability, have led to substantial progress in various robot learning tasks. In\nvisual navigation, previous diffusion-based policies typically generate action\nsequences by initiating from denoising Gaussian noise. However, the target\naction distribution often diverges significantly from Gaussian noise, leading\nto redundant denoising steps and increased learning complexity. Additionally,\nthe sparsity of effective action distributions makes it challenging for the\npolicy to generate accurate actions without guidance. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel, unified visual navigation framework leveraging the\ndenoising diffusion bridge models named NaviBridger. This approach enables\naction generation by initiating from any informative prior actions, enhancing\nguidance and efficiency in the denoising process. We explore how diffusion\nbridges can enhance imitation learning in visual navigation tasks and further\nexamine three source policies for generating prior actions. Extensive\nexperiments in both simulated and real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios\ndemonstrate that NaviBridger accelerates policy inference and outperforms the\nbaselines in generating target action sequences.

In this future network, the security and\ntrustworthiness requirements are not considered fulfilled with the current\nstate of the quantum computers, as the malicious behaviour on the part of the\nservice provider towards the user may still be present. Therefore, this article\nprovides an initial interdisciplinary work of regulations and solutions in the\nscope of trustworthy quantum computing for future 6G that can be viewed as\ncomplimentary regulations to the existing strategies shared by different actors\nof states and organizations. More precisely, we describe the importance of a\nreliable quantum service provider and its implication on the ethical aspects\nconcerning digital sovereignty. By exploring the critical relationship between\ntrustworthiness and digital sovereignty in the context of future 6G networks,\nwe analyse a trade-off between accessibility to this new technology and\npreservation of digital sovereignty engaging in parallel the United Nation's\n(UN's) sustainable development goals.

A wide\nvariety of methodologies for inpainting MRI have been proposed and demonstrated\non tasks including anomaly detection. In this work we investigate the\nstatistical relationship between inpainted brain structures and the amount of\nsubject-specific conditioning information, i.e. the other areas of the image\nthat are masked. In particular, we analyse the distribution of inpainting\nresults when masking additional regions of the image, specifically the\ncontra-lateral structure. This allows us to elucidate where in the brain the\nmodel is drawing information from, and in particular, what is the importance of\nhemispherical symmetry? Our experiments interrogate a diffusion inpainting\nmodel through analysing the inpainting of subcortical brain structures based on\nintensity and estimated area change. We demonstrate that some structures show a\nstrong influence of symmetry in the conditioning of the inpainting process.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of observational capabilities in astronomy has led to\nan exponential growth in the volume of light curve (LC) data, presenting both\nopportunities and challenges for time-domain astronomy. Traditional analytical\nmethods often struggle to fully extract the scientific value of these vast\ndatasets, especially as their complexity increases. Machine learning (ML)\nalgorithms have become indispensable tools for analyzing light curves, offering\nthe ability to classify, predict, discover patterns, and detect anomalies.\nDespite the growing adoption of ML techniques, challenges remain in LC\nclassification, including class imbalance, noisy data, and interpretability of\nmodels.

Spider often display eclipses around superior conjunction. This eclipse\nphenomenon is currently poorly understood. We analyzed eclipses via pulsar\ntiming. The eclipses were fit with a phenomenological model which gives a\nmeasurement of the duration and asymmetry of the eclipses. These parameters\nwere then compared to other eclipse and system measurements to discuss the\npotential link between the presence of eclipses and orbital inclination,\neclipsing systems being known to have higher mass functions than non-eclipsing\nones. We present here a comprehensive review of the NRT NUPPI backend spider\npulsars dataset. We also present the first review and systematic analysis of a\nlarge sample of eclipsers, monitored with the NRT over several years. The\nphenomenological fit allowed us to compare the eclipsers with each other, which\nled to the categorization of eclipsers depending on the shape of their\neclipses. We present the polarimetric properties of the 19 spiders in the\nsample alongside their profiles, which were previously unpublished in some\ncases. For the eclipsing systems, we found evidence for a positive correlation\nbetween eclipse duration and mass function, as expected if more eclipsing\nmaterial crosses the line-of-sight in higher inclination systems. For the\nentire sample, we found marginal evidence for increasing pulse profile width\nwith decreasing mass function. We finally conducted a comprehensive literature\nreview of the published inclination measurements for the pulsars in the sample\nand compared the inclinations to eclipse parameters. Nevertheless, the small\nnumber of available orbital inclination constraints, contradicting each other\nin some cases, hinders such searches for correlations",

The mass radii\nobtained from the various datasets are found to be consistent within\nstatistical uncertainties, yielding an average value of $2.03 \\pm 0.13$ fm\nunder the dipole form assumption. We also provide a detailed discussion of the\nsensitivity of the extracted radius to different choices of gravitational form\nfactor models. Our result represents a significant improvement in precision\ncompared to earlier estimates based solely on $\\phi$ meson photoproduction,\noffering new constraints for theoretical models of nuclear structure and\ndeepening our understanding of the mass distribution within the deuteron.",

We address this challenge\nthrough self pre-training, where models are pre-trained directly on the target\ndataset, rather than another dataset. We propose a resource-efficient vision\ntransformer (ViT) pre-training framework for defect detection in\nmicroelectronics based on masked autoencoders (MAE). We perform pre-training\nand defect detection using a dataset of less than 10,000 scanning acoustic\nmicroscopy (SAM) images. Our experimental results show that our approach leads\nto substantial performance gains compared to a) supervised ViT, b) ViT\npre-trained on natural image datasets, and c) state-of-the-art CNN-based defect\ndetection models used in microelectronics. Additionally, interpretability\nanalysis reveals that our self pre-trained models attend to defect-relevant\nfeatures such as cracks in the solder material, while baseline models often\nattend to spurious patterns.

In this study, we experimentally\nand numerically investigate a system of six colloidal particles undergoing two\ntypes of stochastic resetting protocols: global resetting, where all particles\nare returned to their origin simultaneously, and local resetting, where\nparticles are reset one at a time. Our particles interact mainly through\nhard-core repulsion and hydrodynamic flows. We find that the most substantial\neffect of interparticle interactions is observed for local resetting,\nspecifically when particles are physically dragged to the origin. In this case,\nhard-core repulsion broadens the steady-state distribution, while hydrodynamic\ninteractions significantly narrow the distribution.

We compare several different choices of\nangular weighting in terms of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for a Stage IV setup\nusing luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI) with galaxy shapes measured by the Legacy Survey of Space and\nTime (LSST). Assuming an overlapping area of $\\sim 4,000$ square degrees\n(yielding $\\sim 1.3$ million LRGs) and including scales up to $k_\\text{max} =\n0.14\\,h$/Mpc, we find that the position-position-E-mode bispectrum $B_{DDE}$\n(which is parity-even) can be strongly detected at SNR $\\sim 30$, while\ndetecting parity-odd bispectra (such as $B_{DDB}$, SNR $\\sim 5$) or bispectra\nwith more than one shape field (such as $B_{DEE}$, SNR $\\sim 5$) may also be\npossible.",

Classical methods leverage\ngeometric solutions to minimize specific costs, offering adaptability to new\nscenarios but are prone to system errors due to their multi-modular design and\nreliance on hand-crafted rules. Learning-based methods, while achieving high\nplanning success rates, face difficulties in generalizing to unseen\nenvironments beyond the training data and often require extensive training.

Experiments show that, without the need for\nlabor-intensive collection of high-quality malicious data, model safety can\nstill be significantly improved, as long as a specific fraction of rejection\ndata exists in the finetuning set, indicating the security alignment is not\nlost but rather obscured during multi-modal pretraining or instruction\nfinetuning.

Nevertheless, recent work indicates that incorporating advection\ninto the ML value chain has improved skill for radar-based precipitation\nnowcasts. However, the generality of this approach and the underlying causes\nremain unexplored. This study investigates the generality by probing the\napproach on satellite-based thunderstorm nowcasts for the first time. Resorting\nto a scale argument, we then put forth an explanation when and why skill\nimprovements can be expected. In essence, advection guarantees that\nthunderstorm patterns relevant for nowcasting are contained in the receptive\nfield at long forecast times. To test our hypotheses, we train ResU-Nets\nsolving segmentation tasks with lightning observations as ground truth. The\ninput of the Baseline Neural Network (BNN) are short time series of\nmultispectral satellite imagery and lightning observations, whereas the\nAdvection-Informed Neural Network (AINN) additionally receives the Lagrangian\npersistence nowcast of all input channels at the desired forecast time.\nOverall, we find only a minor skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN when\nconsidering fully averaged scores. However, assessing skill conditioned on\nforecast time and advection speed, we demonstrate that our scale argument\ncorrectly predicts the onset of skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN\nafter 2h forecast time. We confirm that, generally, advection becomes gradually\nmore important with longer forecast times and higher advection speeds.

Existing TSC methods mainly train on each single domain separately,\nsuffering from a degradation in accuracy when the samples for training are\ninsufficient in certain domains. The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm\nprovides a promising direction for solving this problem. However, time series\nfrom different domains are substantially divergent, which challenges the\neffective pre-training on multi-source data and the generalization ability of\npre-trained models.

We propose a two-level prototype-based\ncontrastive learning method to effectively utilize various augmentations in\nmulti-source pre-training, which learns representations for TSC that can be\ngeneralized to different domains. In addition, considering augmentations within\nthe single time series modality are insufficient to fully address\nclassification problems with distribution shift, we introduce the image\nmodality to supplement structural information and establish a series-image\ncontrastive learning to improve the generalization of the learned\nrepresentations for TSC tasks.

Despite this heavy restriction,\nmany recent works have shown the power of catalytic space, its utility in\ndesigning classical space-bounded algorithms, and surprising connections\nbetween catalytic computation and derandomization.\n  Our main result is that bipartite maximum matching ($MATCH$) can be computed\nin catalytic logspace ($CL$) with a polynomial time bound ($CLP$). Moreover, we\nshow that $MATCH$ can be reduced to the lossy coding problem for $NC$ circuits\n($LOSSY[NC]$). This has consequences for matching, catalytic space, and\nderandomization:\n  - Matching: this is the first well studied subclass of $P$ which is known to\ncompute $MATCH$, as well as the first algorithm simultaneously using sublinear\nfree space and polynomial time with any additional resources.\n  - Catalytic space: this is the first new problem shown to be in $CL$ since\nthe model was defined, and one which is extremely central and well-studied.\n  - Derandomization: we give the first class $\\mathcal{C}$ beyond $L$ for which\nwe exhibit a natural problem in $LOSSY[\\mathcal{C}]$ which is not known to be\nin $\\mathcal{C}$, as well as a full derandomization of the isolation lemma in\n$CL$ in the context of $MATCH$.\n  Our proof combines a number of strengthened ideas from isolation-based\nalgorithms for matching alongside the compress-or-random framework in catalytic\ncomputation.",

To tackle this problem, we advocate for balancing\ncorrelative and discriminative relationships among labels to mitigate the risk\nof overfitting and enhance model performance. To this end, we propose the\nMulti-Label Visual Prompt Tuning framework, a novel and parameter-efficient\nmethod that groups classes into multiple class subsets according to label\nco-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships, and then models them\nrespectively to balance the two relationships. In this work, since each group\ncontains multiple classes, multiple prompt tokens are adopted within Vision\nTransformer (ViT) to capture the correlation or discriminative label\nrelationship within each group, and effectively learn correlation or\ndiscriminative representations for class subsets. On the other hand, each group\ncontains multiple group-aware visual representations that may correspond to\nmultiple classes, and the mixture of experts (MoE) model can cleverly assign\nthem from the group-aware to the label-aware, adaptively obtaining label-aware\nrepresentation, which is more conducive to classification.

    "abstract": "Faults in high-performance systems are expected to be very large in the\ncurrent exascale computing era. To compensate for a higher failure rate, the\nstandard checkpoint/restart technique would need to create checkpoints at a\nmuch higher frequency resulting in an excessive amount of overhead which would\nnot be sustainable for many scientific applications. To improve application\nefficiency in such high failure environments, the mechanism of replication of\nMPI processes was proposed. Replication allows for fast recovery from failures\nby simply dropping the failed processes and using their replicas to continue\nthe regular operation of the application.\n  In this paper, we have implemented FTHP-MPI (Fault Tolerance and High\nPerformance MPI), a novel fault-tolerant MPI library that augments\ncheckpoint/restart with replication to provide resilience from failures. The\nnovelty of our work is that it is designed to provide fault tolerance in a\nnative MPI library that does not provide support for fault tolerance. This lets\napplication developers achieve fault tolerance at high failure rates while also\nusing efficient communication protocols in the native MPI libraries that are\ngenerally fine-tuned for specific HPC platforms. We have also implemented\nefficient parallel communication techniques that involve replicas. Our\nframework deals with the unique challenges of integrating support for\ncheckpointing and partial replication.\n  We conducted experiments emulating the failure rates of exascale computing\nsystems with three applications, HPCG, PIC and CloverLeaf. We show that for\nlarge scale systems where the failure intervals are expected to be within a\nhour, our replication-based library provides higher efficiency and performance\nthan checkpointing-based approaches. We show that under failure-free\nconditions, the additional overheads due to replication are negligible in our\nlibrary.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational optical properties are here investigated under the hypothesis\nof spherically-symmetric spacetimes behaving as media. To do so, we first\nconsider two different definitions of the refractive index, $n_O$, of a\nspacetime medium and show how to pass from one definition to another by means\nof a coordinate transformation. Accordingly, the corresponding physical role of\n$n_O$ is discussed by virtue of the Misner-Sharp mass and the redshift\ndefinition. Afterwards, we discuss the inclusion of the electromagnetic fields\nand the equivalence with nonlinear effects induced by geometry. Accordingly,\nthe infrared and ultraviolet gravity regimes are thus discussed, obtaining\nbounds from the Solar System, neutron stars and white dwarfs, respectively. To\ndo so, we also investigate the Snell's law and propose how to possibly\ndistinguish regular solutions from black holes. As a consequence of our recipe,\nwe speculate on the existence of \\emph{gravitational metamaterials}, whose\nrefractive index may be negative and explore the corresponding physical\nimplications, remarking that $n_O<0$ may lead to invisible optical properties,\nas light is bent in the opposite direction compared to what occurs in ordinary\ncases. Further, we conjecture that gravitational metamaterials exhibit a\nparticle-like behavior, contributing to dark matter and propose three toy\nmodels, highlighting possible advantages and limitations of their use. Finally,\nwe suggest that such particle-like configurations can be ``dressed\" by\ninteraction, giving rise to \\emph{geometric quasiparticles}.

For example, fully sharded approaches like DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 and\nFSDP partition the parameters of each layer across multiple GPUs and gather\nthem through communication when needed. These methods rely on optimizations\nsuch as prefetching, which initiates communication early to overlap it with\ncomputation and reduce communication overhead, and unsharding, which retains as\nmany parameters in their unsharded form as possible to reduce communication\nvolume. Although the timing of prefetching should be adjusted in response to\ndynamic memory usage during execution, these systems lack the flexibility to\ncontrol it, which limits the benefits of prefetching.

Turn-taking was annotated on two\nlayers, Inter-Pausal Units (IPU) and points of potential completion (PCOMP;\nsimilar to transition relevance places). We provide a detailed description of\nthe annotation process and of segmentation and labelling criteria. A detailed\nanalysis of inter-rater agreement and common confusions shows that agreement\nfor IPU annotation is near-perfect, that agreement for PCOMP annotations is\nsubstantial, and that disagreements often are either partial or can be\nexplained by a different analysis of a sequence which also has merit. The\nannotation system can be applied to a variety of conversational data for\nlinguistic studies and technological applications, and we hope that the\nannotations, as well as the annotation system will contribute to a stronger\ncross-fertilization between these disciplines.",

To address the computational challenges of handling\nlong sequences, we incorporate octree-based transformers enhanced with 3D\nrotary positional encodings, scale-specific embeddings, and token-parallel\ngeneration schemes. These innovations reduce training time by 13 folds and\ngeneration time by 69 folds, enabling the efficient training of high-resolution\n3D shapes, e.g.,$1024^3$, on just four NVIDIA 4090 GPUs only within days.\nOctGPT showcases exceptional versatility across various tasks, including text-,\nsketch-, and image-conditioned generation, as well as scene-level synthesis\ninvolving multiple objects.

Conversely,\nexplicit prompts derived from pretrained classifiers enhance discriminability\nbut may discard critical visual information for reconstruction. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPL), a novel\nframework that fundamentally enhances prompt-task alignment through two\ncomplementary innovations: a \\emph{Sparse Prompt Module (SPM)} that efficiently\ncaptures degradation-specific features while minimizing redundancy, and a\n\\emph{Contrastive Prompt Regularization (CPR)} that explicitly strengthens task\nboundaries by incorporating negative prompt samples across different\ndegradation types.

In recent\nyears, deep learning methods have achieved encouraging results, but they still\nrequire predefined cluster numbers K, and typically struggle with imbalanced\ngraphs, especially in identifying minority clusters. The limitations motivate\nus to study a challenging yet practical problem: deep graph clustering without\nK considering the imbalance in reality. We approach this problem from a fresh\nperspective of information theory (i.e., structural information). In the\nliterature, structural information has rarely been touched in deep clustering,\nand the classic definition falls short in its discrete formulation, neglecting\nnode attributes and exhibiting prohibitive complexity. In this paper, we first\nestablish a new Differentiable Structural Information, generalizing the\ndiscrete formalism to continuous realm, so that the optimal partitioning tree,\nrevealing the cluster structure, can be created by the gradient\nbackpropagation. Theoretically, we demonstrate its capability in clustering\nwithout requiring K and identifying the minority clusters in imbalanced graphs,\nwhile reducing the time complexity to O(N) w.r.t. the number of nodes.\nSubsequently, we present a novel IsoSEL framework for deep graph clustering,\nwhere we design a hyperbolic neural network to learn the partitioning tree in\nthe Lorentz model of hyperbolic space, and further conduct Lorentz Tree\nContrastive Learning with isometric augmentation. As a result, the partitioning\ntree incorporates node attributes via mutual information maximization, while\nthe cluster assignment is refined by the proposed tree contrastive learning.\nExtensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show the IsoSEL outperforms 14\nrecent baselines by an average of +1.3% in NMI.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of medical generalist foundation models has revolutionized\nconventional task-specific model development paradigms, aiming to better handle\nmultiple tasks through joint training on large-scale medical datasets. However,\nrecent advances prioritize simple data scaling or architectural component\nenhancement, while neglecting to re-examine multi-task learning from a\ndata-centric perspective. Critically, simply aggregating existing data\nresources leads to decentralized image-task alignment, which fails to cultivate\ncomprehensive image understanding or align with clinical needs for\nmulti-dimensional image interpretation. In this paper, we introduce the\nimage-centric multi-annotation X-ray dataset (IMAX), the first attempt to\nenhance the multi-task learning capabilities of medical multi-modal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) from the data construction level. To be specific, IMAX\nis featured from the following attributes: 1) High-quality data curation. A\ncomprehensive collection of more than 354K entries applicable to seven\ndifferent medical tasks. 2) Image-centric dense annotation. Each X-ray image is\nassociated with an average of 4.10 tasks and 7.46 training entries, ensuring\nmulti-task representation richness per image. Compared to the general\ndecentralized multi-annotation X-ray dataset (DMAX), IMAX consistently\ndemonstrates significant multi-task average performance gains ranging from\n3.20% to 21.05% across seven open-source state-of-the-art medical MLLMs.\nMoreover, we investigate differences in statistical patterns exhibited by IMAX\nand DMAX training processes, exploring potential correlations between\noptimization dynamics and multi-task performance. Finally, leveraging the core\nconcept of IMAX data construction, we propose an optimized DMAX-based training\nstrategy to alleviate the dilemma of obtaining high-quality IMAX data in\npractical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Most previous scene text spotting methods rely on high-quality manual\nannotations to achieve promising performance. To reduce their expensive costs,\nwe study semi-supervised text spotting (SSTS) to exploit useful information\nfrom unlabeled images. However, directly applying existing semi-supervised\nmethods of general scenes to SSTS will face new challenges: 1) inconsistent\npseudo labels between detection and recognition tasks, and 2) sub-optimal\nsupervisions caused by inconsistency between teacher/student. Thus, we propose\na new Semi-supervised framework for End-to-end Text Spotting, namely SemiETS\nthat leverages the complementarity of text detection and recognition.\nSpecifically, it gradually generates reliable hierarchical pseudo labels for\neach task, thereby reducing noisy labels. Meanwhile, it extracts important\ninformation in locations and transcriptions from bidirectional flows to improve\nconsistency. Extensive experiments on three datasets under various settings\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of SemiETS on arbitrary-shaped text. For example,\nit outperforms previous state-of-the-art SSL methods by a large margin on\nend-to-end spotting (+8.7%, +5.6%, and +2.6% H-mean under 0.5%, 1%, and 2%\nlabeled data settings on Total-Text, respectively). More importantly, it still\nimproves upon a strongly supervised text spotter trained with plenty of labeled\ndata by 2.0%. Compelling domain adaptation ability shows practical potential.\nMoreover, our method demonstrates consistent improvement on different text\nspotters.",

By deterministically relating forces and torques acting\non the particle to the instantaneous ambient flow, the effects of flow\nunsteadiness are captured, revealing rich particle dynamics. Laboratory\nexperiments in an oscillatory flow tunnel characterise the initiation and early\nstages of motion, with particle imaging velocimetry measurements yielding the\nflow conditions at the motion threshold. The experiments validate and\ncomplement results from particle-resolved direct numerical simulations,\ncombining an immersed boundary method with a discrete element method that\nincorporates a static friction contact model. Within the parameter range just\nabove the motion threshold, the mobile particle rolls without sliding over the\nsubstrate, indicating that motion initiation is governed by an unbalanced\ntorque rather than a force. Both experimental and numerical results show\nexcellent agreement with an analytical torque balance including hydrodynamic\ntorque derived from the theoretical Stokes velocity profile, and contributions\nof lift, added mass, and externally imposed pressure gradient. In addition to\nstatic and rolling particle states, we identify a wiggling regime where the\nparticle moves but does not leave its original pocket. Our deterministic\napproach enables prediction of the phase within the oscillation cycle at which\nthe particle starts moving, without relying on empirical threshold estimates,\nand can be extended to a wide range of flow and substrate conditions, as long\nas turbulence is absent and interactions with other mobile particles are\nnegligible.",

Among its\napproaches, subgraph-FL has become the dominant paradigm, with most work\nfocused on improving overall node classification accuracy. However, these\nmethods often overlook fairness due to the complexity of node features, labels,\nand graph structures. In particular, they perform poorly on nodes with\ndisadvantaged properties, such as being in the minority class within subgraphs\nor having heterophilous connections (neighbors with dissimilar labels or\nmisleading features). This reveals a critical issue: high accuracy can mask\ndegraded performance on structurally or semantically marginalized nodes. To\naddress this, we advocate for two fairness goals: (1) improving representation\nof minority class nodes for class-wise fairness and (2) mitigating topological\nbias from heterophilous connections for topology-aware fairness. We propose\nFairFGL, a novel framework that enhances fairness through fine-grained graph\nmining and collaborative learning. On the client side, the History-Preserving\nModule prevents overfitting to dominant local classes, while the Majority\nAlignment Module refines representations of heterophilous majority-class nodes.\nThe Gradient Modification Module transfers minority-class knowledge from\nstructurally favorable clients to improve fairness. On the server side, FairFGL\nuploads only the most influenced subset of parameters to reduce communication\ncosts and better reflect local distributions. A cluster-based aggregation\nstrategy reconciles conflicting updates and curbs global majority dominance .\nExtensive evaluations on eight benchmarks show FairFGL significantly improves\nminority-group performance , achieving up to a 22.62 percent Macro-F1 gain\nwhile enhancing convergence over state-of-the-art baselines.",

In the approach, humans and machines\ncollaborate closely by performing semantic annotation tasks (SATs) and refining\nthe results to progressively improve the semantic representation of scientific\nknowledge. We implemented the approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph\n(ORKG), an established platform for improving the findability, accessibility,\ninteroperability, and reusability of scientific knowledge.

To address this, we introduce a novel framework that\ninvestigates the relationship between the semantic hierarchy depth perceived by\na network and its real-data misclassification patterns.

While sedation is commonly used to\nmanage anxiety and motion, it carries clinical risks and logistical burdens.\nTraditional preparatory approaches, such as instructional videos and mock\nscans, often lack engagement for older children and adolescents. In this study,\nwe present a comparative evaluation of four MRI preparation modalities: (1) a\ngamified virtual reality (VR) simulation that trains stillness through\nreal-time feedback; (2) a passive VR experience replicating the MRI environment\nwithout interactivity; (3) a 360{\\deg} first-person video of a real MRI\nprocedure; and (4) a standard 2D educational video. Using a within-subjects\ndesign (N = 11, ages 10-16), we assess each method's impact on head motion\ndata, anxiety reduction, procedural preparedness, usability, cognitive\nworkload, and subjective preference. Results show that the gamified VR\ncondition has significantly lower head motion (p < 0.001) and yielded the\nhighest preparedness scores (p < 0.05). Head motion data were significantly\ncorrelated with learning outcomes (p < 0.01), suggesting that behavioral\nperformance in VR strongly indicates procedural readiness. While all modalities\nreduced anxiety and were rated usable, interactive VR was preferred by most\nparticipants and demonstrated unique advantages in promoting engagement and\nbehavioral rehearsal. We conclude with design recommendations for designing\nimmersive simulations and integrating VR training into pediatric imaging\nworkflows.",

    "abstract": "Subseasonal forecasting serves as an important support for Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), such as climate challenges, agricultural yield and\nsustainable energy production. However, subseasonal forecasting is a complex\ntask in meteorology due to dissipating initial conditions and delayed external\nforces. Although AI models are increasingly pushing the boundaries of this\nforecasting limit, they face two major challenges: error accumulation and\nSmoothness. To address these two challenges, we propose Climate Furnace\nSubseasonal-to-Seasonal (TianQuan-Climate), a novel machine learning model\ndesigned to provide global daily mean forecasts up to 45 days, covering five\nupper-air atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels and two surface\nvariables. Our proposed TianQuan-Climate has two advantages: 1) it utilizes a\nmulti-model prediction strategy to reduce system error impacts in long-term\nsubseasonal forecasts; 2) it incorporates a Content Fusion Module for\nclimatological integration and extends ViT with uncertainty blocks (UD-ViT) to\nimprove generalization by learning from uncertainty. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of TianQuan-Climate on benchmarks for weather forecasting and\nclimate projections within the 15 to 45-day range, where TianQuan-Climate\noutperforms existing numerical and AI methods.",

Despite extensive historical observations, disentangling\nthe contributions of internal and forced variability remains debated, largely\ndue to the uncertain magnitude of anthropogenic aerosols.\n  Here, we show that, after removing CO$_{2}$-congruent variability,\nmultidecadal temperature variability in instrumental data is largely\nattributable to internal processes of oceanic origin. This follows from an\nemergent relationship, identified in historical climate model simulations,\nbetween the driver of variability in oceanic regions and the land-ocean\nvariance ratio in the mid-latitudes. Thus, climate models with higher residual\n(non-CO$_{2}$) forced variability, largely linked to volcanic and anthropogenic\naerosols, exhibit more spatially coherent and amplified temperature patterns\nover land compared to observations. In contrast, models with higher internal\nvariability agree better with the instrumental data. Our results underscore\nthat internal modes of ocean-driven variability may be too weak in many climate\nmodels, and that current projections may be underestimating the range of\ninternal variability in regions with high oceanic influence.",

Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV\ncache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to\ninformation loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have\nbeen explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be\ndiscarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce\ninconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing\noutput perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed\nto eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict\nmemory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that\nrecords merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it\nfurther leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping\nattention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache\nmerging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a\nsignificantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and\nLLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage,\nenhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation\nquality even with 10% KV cache budgets.",

As an end-to-end paradigm, generative retrieval adopts a learned\ndifferentiable search index to conduct retrieval by directly generating\ndocument identifiers through corpus-specific constrained decoding. The\ngeneralization capabilities of generative retrieval on out-of-distribution\ncorpora have gathered significant attention.\n  In this paper, we examine the inherent limitations of constrained\nauto-regressive generation from two essential perspectives: constraints and\nbeam search. We begin with the Bayes-optimal setting where the generative\nretrieval model exactly captures the underlying relevance distribution of all\npossible documents. Then we apply the model to specific corpora by simply\nadding corpus-specific constraints. Our main findings are two-fold: (i) For the\neffect of constraints, we derive a lower bound of the error, in terms of the KL\ndivergence between the ground-truth and the model-predicted step-wise marginal\ndistributions. (ii) For the beam search algorithm used during generation, we\nreveal that the usage of marginal distributions may not be an ideal approach.\nThis paper aims to improve our theoretical understanding of the generalization\ncapabilities of the auto-regressive decoding retrieval paradigm, laying a\nfoundation for its limitations and inspiring future advancements toward more\nrobust and generalizable generative retrieval.",

    "abstract": "We introduce FUSION, a family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)\nwith a fully vision-language alignment and integration paradigm. Unlike\nexisting methods that primarily rely on late-stage modality interaction during\nLLM decoding, our approach achieves deep, dynamic integration throughout the\nentire processing pipeline. To this end, we propose Text-Guided Unified Vision\nEncoding, incorporating textual information in vision encoding to achieve\npixel-level integration. We further design Context-Aware Recursive Alignment\nDecoding that recursively aggregates visual features conditioned on textual\ncontext during decoding, enabling fine-grained, question-level semantic\nintegration. To guide feature mapping and mitigate modality discrepancies, we\ndevelop Dual-Supervised Semantic Mapping Loss. Additionally, we construct a\nSynthesized Language-Driven Question-Answer (QA) dataset through a new data\nsynthesis method, prioritizing high-quality QA pairs to optimize text-guided\nfeature integration. Building on these foundations, we train FUSION at two\nscales-3B, 8B-and demonstrate that our full-modality integration approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods with only 630 vision tokens.\nNotably, FUSION 3B surpasses Cambrian-1 8B and Florence-VL 8B on most\nbenchmarks. FUSION 3B continues to outperform Cambrian-1 8B even when limited\nto 300 vision tokens. Our ablation studies show that FUSION outperforms\nLLaVA-NeXT on over half of the benchmarks under same configuration without\ndynamic resolution, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Compressed sensing (CS) algorithms, such as the VAMP algorithm, are\nused for sparse signal processing in the sub-Nyquist radar framework. By\ncombining deep unfolding techniques with VAMP, faster convergence and higher\naccuracy than traditional CS algorithms are achieved. However, deep unfolding\ndisrupts the parameter constrains in traditional VAMP algorithm, leading to the\ndistribution of non-sparse noisy estimation in VAMP deep unfolding unknown, and\nits distribution parameter unable to be obtained directly using method of\ntraditional VAMP, which prevents the application of VAMP deep unfolding in\nradar constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection. To address this problem, we\nexplore the distribution of the non-sparse noisy estimation and propose a\nparameter convergence detector (PCD) to achieve CFAR detection based on VAMP\ndeep unfolding. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PCD leverages not\nonly the sparse solution, but also the non-sparse noisy estimation, which is\nused to iteratively estimate the distribution parameter and served as the test\nstatistic in detection process. In this way, the proposed algorithm takes\nadvantage of both the enhanced sparse recovery accuracy from deep unfolding and\nthe distribution property of VAMP, thereby achieving superior CFAR detection\nperformance. Additionally, the PCD requires no information about the power of\nAWGN in the environment, which is more suitable for practical application.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising technique for applying\nLLMs to proprietary domains. However, retrieved documents may contain sensitive\nknowledge, posing risks of privacy leakage in generative results. Thus,\neffectively erasing private information from retrieved documents is a key\nchallenge for RAG. Unlike traditional text anonymization, RAG should consider:\n(1) the inherent multi-document reasoning may face de-anonymization attacks;\n(2) private knowledge varies by scenarios, so users should be allowed to\ncustomize which information to erase; (3) preserving sufficient publicly\navailable knowledge for generation tasks. This paper introduces the privacy\nerasure task for RAG and proposes Eraser4RAG, a private knowledge eraser which\neffectively removes user-defined private knowledge from documents while\npreserving sufficient public knowledge for generation. Specifically, we first\nconstruct a global knowledge graph to identify potential knowledge across\ndocuments, aiming to defend against de-anonymization attacks. Then we randomly\nsplit it into private and public sub-graphs, and fine-tune Flan-T5 to rewrite\nthe retrieved documents excluding private triples. Finally, PPO algorithm\noptimizes the rewriting model to minimize private triples and maximize public\ntriples retention. Experiments on four QA datasets demonstrate that Eraser4RAG\nachieves superior erase performance than GPT-4o.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive video streaming systems are designed to optimize Quality of\nExperience (QoE) and, in turn, enhance user satisfaction. However, differences\nin user profiles and video content lead to different weights for QoE factors,\nresulting in user-specific QoE functions and, thus, varying optimization\nobjectives. This variability poses significant challenges for neural networks,\nas they often struggle to generalize under evolving targets - a phenomenon\nknown as plasticity loss that prevents conventional models from adapting\neffectively to changing optimization objectives. To address this limitation, we\npropose the Plasticity-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE), a novel learning\nframework that dynamically modulates network plasticity by balancing memory\nretention with selective forgetting. In particular, PA-MoE leverages noise\ninjection to promote the selective forgetting of outdated knowledge, thereby\nendowing neural networks with enhanced adaptive capabilities. In addition, we\npresent a rigorous theoretical analysis of PA-MoE by deriving a regret bound\nthat quantifies its learning performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\nthat PA-MoE achieves a 45.5% improvement in QoE over competitive baselines in\ndynamic streaming environments. Further analysis reveals that the model\neffectively mitigates plasticity loss by optimizing neuron utilization.\nFinally, a parameter sensitivity study is performed by injecting varying levels\nof noise, and the results align closely with our theoretical predictions.",

However, existing research typically\nfaces challenges in efficiently leveraging floor plan information and applying\nit to complex indoor layouts. To fully exploit information from floor plans for\npositioning, we propose a floor plan-assisted fusion positioning algorithm\n(FP-BP) using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR).\nIn the considered system, a user holding a smartphone walks through a\npositioning area with BLE beacons installed on the ceiling, and can locate\nhimself in real time. In particular, FP-BP consists of two phases. In the\noffline phase, FP-BP programmatically extracts map features from a stylized\nfloor plan based on their binary masks, and constructs a mapping function to\nidentify the corresponding map feature of any given position on the map. In the\nonline phase, FP-BP continuously computes BLE positions and PDR results from\nBLE signals and smartphone sensors, where a novel grid-based maximum likelihood\nestimation (GML) algorithm is introduced to enhance BLE positioning. Then, a\nparticle filter is used to fuse them and obtain an initial estimate. Finally,\nFP-BP performs post-position correction to obtain the final position based on\nits specific map feature.

To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose\nSIO-Mapper, a novel lane-level HD map construction framework that constructs\ncity-scale maps without physical site visits by utilizing satellite images and\nOpenStreetmap data. One of the key contributions of SIO-Mapper is its ability\nto extract lane information more accurately by introducing SIO-Net, a novel\ndeep learning network that integrates features from satellite image and\nOpenStreetmap using both Transformer-based and convolution-based encoders.\nFurthermore, to overcome challenges in merging lanes over large areas, we\nintroduce a novel lane integration methodology that combines cluster-based and\ngraph-based approaches. This algorithm ensures the seamless aggregation of lane\nsegments with high accuracy and coverage, even in complex road environments. We\nvalidated SIO-Mapper on the Naver Labs Open Dataset and NuScenes dataset,\ndemonstrating better performance in various environments including Korea, the\nUnited States, and Singapore compared to the state-of-the-art lane-level HD\nmapconstruction methods.",

    "abstract": "Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is aimed at predicting the location of a query\nimage by referencing a database of geotagged images. For VPR task, often fewer\ndiscriminative local regions in an image produce important effects while\nmundane background regions do not contribute or even cause perceptual aliasing\nbecause of easy overlap. However, existing methods lack precisely modeling and\nfull exploitation of these discriminative regions. In this paper, we propose\nthe Focus on Local (FoL) approach to stimulate the performance of image\nretrieval and re-ranking in VPR simultaneously by mining and exploiting\nreliable discriminative local regions in images and introducing\npseudo-correlation supervision. First, we design two losses,\nExtraction-Aggregation Spatial Alignment Loss (SAL) and Foreground-Background\nContrast Enhancement Loss (CEL), to explicitly model reliable discriminative\nlocal regions and use them to guide the generation of global representations\nand efficient re-ranking. Second, we introduce a weakly-supervised local\nfeature training strategy based on pseudo-correspondences obtained from\naggregating global features to alleviate the lack of local correspondences\nground truth for the VPR task. Third, we suggest an efficient re-ranking\npipeline that is efficiently and precisely based on discriminative region\nguidance. Finally, experimental results show that our FoL achieves the\nstate-of-the-art on multiple VPR benchmarks in both image retrieval and\nre-ranking stages and also significantly outperforms existing two-stage VPR\nmethods in terms of computational efficiency.

Recent attacks assumed an attacker's knowledge containing data\n``similar'' to the indexed data. However, this vague assumption is barely\ndiscussed in literature: how likely is it for an attacker to obtain a \"similar\nenough\" data?\n  Our paper provides novel statistical tools usable on any attack in this\nsetting to analyze its sensitivity to data similarity. First, we introduce a\nmathematical model based on statistical estimators to analytically understand\nthe attackers' knowledge and the notion of similarity. Second, we conceive\nstatistical tools to model the influence of the similarity on the attack\naccuracy. We apply our tools on three existing attacks to answer questions such\nas: is similarity the only factor influencing accuracy of a given attack?\nThird, we show that the enforcement of a maximum index size can make the\n``similar-data'' assumption harder to satisfy. In particular, we propose a\nstatistical method to estimate an appropriate maximum size for a given attack\nand dataset. For the best known attack on the Enron dataset, a maximum index\nsize of 200 guarantees (with high probability) the attack accuracy to be below\n5%.",

In this model,\nfermions couple as a composite boson and condense to occupy a single bound\nstate as the temperature drops. We derive a concise formula for $T_\\mathrm{c}$\nin terms of $\\Delta$ and $\\Delta^\\ast$, namely: $$\\frac{\\Delta}{k_\\mathrm{B}\nT_\\mathrm{c}} = 1.4+4\\log(\\Delta^\\ast/\\Delta).$$ This expression reproduces the\nstandard BCS gap-to-$T_\\mathrm{c}$ ratio in the absence of a pseudogap, while\nnaturally explaining its enhancement in unconventional superconductors. The\nmodel is supported by comparisons with experimental data from several cuprates\nand iron-based superconductors, which highlight its generality.

However, even the state-of-the-art NeRF model, Gaussian Splatting,\nrequires minutes for training, far from the real-time performance required by\nmultimedia scenarios like telemedicine. One of the obstacles is its inefficient\nsampling, which is only partially addressed by existing works. Existing\npoint-sampling algorithms uniformly sample simple-texture regions (easy to fit)\nand complex-texture regions (hard to fit), while existing ray-sampling\nalgorithms sample these regions all in the finest granularity (i.e. the pixel\nlevel), both wasting GPU training resources. Actually, regions with different\ntexture intensities require different sampling granularities. To this end, we\npropose a novel dynamic-resolution ray-sampling algorithm, MCBlock, which\nemploys Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to partition each training image into\npixel blocks with different sizes for active block-wise training. Specifically,\nthe trees are initialized according to the texture of training images to boost\nthe initialization speed, and an expansion/pruning module dynamically optimizes\nthe block partition. MCBlock is implemented in Nerfstudio, an open-source\ntoolset, and achieves a training acceleration of up to 2.33x, surpassing other\nray-sampling algorithms.

    "abstract": "Short technical support pages such as IBM Technotes are quite common in\ntechnical support domain. These pages can be very useful as the knowledge\nsources for technical support applications such as chatbots, search engines and\nquestion-answering (QA) systems. Information extracted from documents to drive\ntechnical support applications is often stored in the form of Knowledge Graph\n(KG). Building KGs from a large corpus of documents poses a challenge of\ngranularity because a large number of entities and actions are present in each\npage. The KG becomes virtually unusable if all entities and actions from these\npages are stored in the KG. Therefore, only key entities and actions from each\npage are extracted and stored in the KG. This approach however leads to loss of\nknowledge represented by entities and actions left out of the KG as they are no\nlonger available to graph search and reasoning functions. We propose a set of\ntechniques to create micro knowledge graph (micrograph) for each of such web\npages. The micrograph stores all the entities and actions in a page and also\ntakes advantage of the structure of the page to represent exactly in which part\nof that page these entities and actions appeared, and also how they relate to\neach other. These micrographs can be used as additional knowledge sources by\ntechnical support applications. We define schemas for representing\nsemi-structured and plain text knowledge present in the technical support web\npages. Solutions in technical support domain include procedures made of steps.\nWe also propose a technique to extract procedures from these webpages and the\nschemas to represent them in the micrographs.

    "abstract": "Automated fact-checking (AFC) still falters on claims that are\ntime-sensitive, entity-ambiguous, or buried beneath noisy search-engine\nresults. We present PASS-FC, a Progressive and Adaptive Search Scheme for Fact\nChecking. Each atomic claim is first grounded with a precise time span and\ndisambiguated entity descriptors. An adaptive search loop then issues\nstructured queries, filters domains through credible-source selection, and\nexpands queries cross-lingually; when necessary, a lightweight reflection\nroutine restarts the loop. Experiments on six benchmark--covering general\nknowledge, scientific literature, real-world events, and ten languages--show\nthat PASS-FC consistently outperforms prior systems, even those powered by\nlarger backbone LLMs. On the multilingual X-FACT set, performance of different\nlanguages partially correlates with typological closeness to English, and\nforcing the model to reason in low-resource languages degrades accuracy.\nAblations highlight the importance of temporal grounding and the adaptive\nsearch scheme, while detailed analysis shows that cross-lingual retrieval\ncontributes genuinely new evidence.

To address this gap, we\nconducted a survey experiment (N=1601) on a diverse sample of Americans,\npresenting participants with an AI-generated message about several public\npolicies (e.g., allowing colleges to pay student-athletes), randomly assigning\nwhether participants were told the message was generated by (a) an expert AI\nmodel, (b) a human policy expert, or (c) no label.

    "abstract": "It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is\nknown that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the\nvapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the liquid-vapor\ninterface. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on a\nquasi-continuum approach. Experimental evidence for this effect has been scarce\nso far. Here, we examine evaporation and condensation between two parallel\nplates, including the liquid films on both sides, by coupling the solution of\nthe Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum\ntreatments in both liquid films. Our solution shows that the vapor phase\ntemperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall\ntemperature at the condensing surface, i.e., the evaporative refrigeration\neffect. Our work not only re-affirms the refrigeration effect, but clarifies\nthat this effect is caused by two mechanisms. At the interface, the asymmetry\nin the distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules creates a\ncooling effect, which is the dominant mechanism. Additional cooling occurs\nwithin the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion similar to the\nJoule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial\nexpansion is not an isenthalpic process. Our work will motivate future\nexperiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential\napplications in air-conditioning and refrigeration.",

These traditions underscore the vital role\nof value diversity in fostering social trust, institutional legitimacy, and\nlong-term prosperity. EthosGPT addresses the challenge of value homogenization\nby introducing an open-source framework for mapping and evaluating LLMs within\na global scale of human values.

It offers actionable insights for developing inclusive LLMs, such as\ndiversifying training data and preserving endangered cultural heritage to\nensure representation in AI systems. These contributions align with the United\nNations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 10 (Reduced\nInequalities), SDG 11.4 (Cultural Heritage Preservation), and SDG 16 (Peace,\nJustice and Strong Institutions).

During\nthe training data collection, when a speaker makes a verbose statement, SUMART\nemploys a large language model on-site to compress the volume of subtitles.\nThis compressed data is then stored in a database for fine-tuning purposes.\nLater, SUMART uses data pairs from those non-compressed ASR results and\ncompressed translated results for fine-tuning the translation model to generate\nmore concise translations for practical uses. In practical applications, SUMART\nutilizes this trained model to produce concise translation results.\nFurthermore, as a practical application, we developed an application that\nallows conversations using subtitle translation in augmented reality spaces.

However, existing\nLLM-based pest management approaches often rely on a single-agent paradigm,\nwhich can limit their capacity to incorporate diverse external information,\nengage in systematic validation, and address complex, threshold-driven\ndecisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PestMA, an LLM-based\nmulti-agent system (MAS) designed to generate reliable and evidence-based pest\nmanagement advice. Building on an editorial paradigm, PestMA features three\nspecialized agents, an Editor for synthesizing pest management recommendations,\na Retriever for gathering relevant external data, and a Validator for ensuring\ncorrectness. Evaluations on real-world pest scenarios demonstrate that PestMA\nachieves an initial accuracy of 86.8% for pest management decisions, which\nincreases to 92.6% after validation. These results underscore the value of\ncollaborative agent-based workflows in refining and validating decisions,\nhighlighting the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems to automate and\nenhance pest management processes.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is considered critical to achieving\nclimate goals, yet it hinges on consumer interest. This study explores how\npublic intent to purchase EVs relates to four unexamined factors: exposure to\nEV information, perceptions of EVs' environmental benefits, views on government\nclimate policy, and confidence in future EV infrastructure; while controlling\nfor prior EV ownership, political affiliation, and demographic characteristics\n(e.g., age, gender, education, and geographic location). We utilize data from\nthree nationally representative opinion polls conducted by the Pew Research\nCenter between 2021 and 2023, and employ Bayesian techniques to estimate the\nordinal probit and ordinal quantile models. Results from ordinal probit show\nthat respondents who are well-informed about EVs, perceive them as\nenvironmentally beneficial, or are confident in development of charging\nstations are more likely to express strong interest in buying an EV, with\ncovariate effects--a metric rarely reported in EV research--of 10.2, 15.5, and\n19.1 percentage points, respectively. In contrast, those skeptical of\ngovernment climate initiatives are more likely to express no interest, by more\nthan 10 percentage points. Prior EV ownership exhibits the highest covariate\neffect (ranging from 19.0 to 23.1 percentage points), and the impact of most\ndemographic variables is consistent with existing studies. The ordinal quantile\nmodels demonstrate significant variation in covariate effects across the\ndistribution of EV purchase intent, offering insights beyond the ordinal probit\nmodel. This article is the first to use quantile modeling to reveal how\ncovariate effects differ significantly throughout the spectrum of EV purchase\nintent.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the longstanding electromagnetic mass problem from a modern\nquantum field theory perspective. Focusing on a system of two widely separated\nhydrogen atoms, one in an excited $nS$ state and the other in the ground $1S$\nstate, we isolate the electromagnetic contribution to the electron's total\nlinear momentum by comparing the full energy-momentum tensor with the\npredictions of a point-like bound state model. Our analysis reveals that the\nleading perturbative correction introduces a factor $4/3$, which, along with\nsubsequent corrections, indicates that the effective electromagnetic mass\ndeviates from the conventional relation $E/c^2$. This discrepancy is attributed\nto the intrinsic nonlocality of the electromagnetic field, rather than to\nadditional compensating mechanisms such as Poincar\\'e stresses. We further\ncontrast our quantum field theory results with the highly accurate predictions\nof the Schr\\\"odinger equation, which, despite neglecting higher-order terms,\nachieves an average error on the order of $10^{-5}\\%$. Attempts to improve this\naccuracy via perturbative inclusion of the self-interaction of the electron's\nwave function instead increase the error, prompting a re-examination of the\nunderlying perturbative assumptions. Our findings suggest that a\nnon-perturbative treatment of the tree-level action may be required to fully\ncapture the dynamics of bound states in quantum field theory.",

Our goal is to\nleverage the offline dataset, consisting of past prices, ordering quantities,\ninventory levels, covariates, and censored sales levels, to estimate the\noptimal pricing and inventory control policy that maximizes long-term profit.\nWhile the underlying dynamic without censoring can be modeled by Markov\ndecision process (MDP), the primary obstacle arises from the observed process\nwhere demand censoring is present, resulting in missing profit information, the\nfailure of the Markov property, and a non-stationary optimal policy. To\novercome these challenges, we first approximate the optimal policy by solving a\nhigh-order MDP characterized by the number of consecutive censoring instances,\nwhich ultimately boils down to solving a specialized Bellman equation tailored\nfor this problem.

Starting from the Ising spin-1/2 chain, we\nintroduce different forms of external fields and spin coupling interactions,\nand construct three distinct anisotropic spin-1/2 chain models. The influence\nof these interactions on the MBL phase transition is systematically explored.\nWe first analyze the eigenstate properties by computing the excited-state\nfidelity. The results show that MBL phase transitions occur in all three\nmodels, and that both the anisotropy parameter and the finite system size\nsignificantly affect the critical disorder strength of the transition.\nMoreover, we calculated the bipartite entanglement entropy of the system, and\nthe critical points determined by the intersection of curves for different\nsystem sizes are basically consistent with those obtained from the\nexcited-state fidelity. Then, the dynamical characteristics of the systems are\nstudied through the time evolution of diagonal entropy (DE), local\nmagnetization, and fidelity. These observations further confirm the occurrence\nof the MBL phase transition and allow for a clear distinction between the\nergodic (thermal) phase and the many-body localized phase. Finally, to examine\nthe effect of additional interactions on the transition, we incorporate\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions into the three models. The results\ndemonstrate that the MBL phase transition still occurs in the presence of DM\ninteractions. However, the anisotropy parameter and finite system size\nsignificantly affect the critical disorder strength. Moreover, the critical\nbehavior is somewhat suppressed, indicating that DM interactions tend to\ninhibit the onset of localization.",

At the advent of QCD, an alternative hypothesis\nemerged suggesting, at high energies, the transport of a nucleon's baryon\nnumber could be traced by a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields\nconnecting its three valence quarks, forming a $Y$-shaped topology known as the\ngluon junction.

However, traditional Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC)\nmethods face challenges like complex entity disambiguation, rigid schema\ndefinition, and insufficient cross-document knowledge integration. This paper\nfocuses on the task of automatic document-level knowledge graph construction.\nIt proposes the Document-level Retrieval Augmented Knowledge Graph Construction\n(RAKG) framework. RAKG extracts pre-entities from text chunks and utilizes\nthese pre-entities as queries for RAG, effectively addressing the issue of\nlong-context forgetting in LLMs and reducing the complexity of Coreference\nResolution. In contrast to conventional KGC methods, RAKG more effectively\ncaptures global information and the interconnections among disparate nodes,\nthereby enhancing the overall performance of the model. Additionally, we\ntransfer the RAG evaluation framework to the KGC field and filter and evaluate\nthe generated knowledge graphs, thereby avoiding incorrectly generated entities\nand relationships caused by hallucinations in LLMs. We further developed the\nMINE dataset by constructing standard knowledge graphs for each article and\nexperimentally validated the performance of RAKG.

Concretely, based on an unbalanced\noptimal transport (UOT) problem, the density owned by each ground-truth object\nis transported to each anchor position at a minimal transport cost.

To address this, we propose\nDistilled Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DUDA), a novel framework that\ncombines EMA-based self-training with knowledge distillation (KD). Our method\nemploys an auxiliary student network to bridge the architectural gap between\nheavyweight and lightweight models for EMA-based updates, resulting in improved\npseudo-label quality. DUDA employs a strategic fusion of UDA and KD,\nincorporating innovative elements such as gradual distillation from large to\nsmall networks, inconsistency loss prioritizing poorly adapted classes, and\nlearning with multiple teachers. Extensive experiments across four UDA\nbenchmarks demonstrate DUDA's superiority in achieving SOTA performance with\nlightweight models, often surpassing the performance of heavyweight models from\nother approaches.",

This permits MLLMs\nto both perceive and answer questions about data visualization across a variety\nof designs and tasks. Applying MLLMs to a broad range of visualization tasks\nrequires us to properly evaluate their capabilities, and the most common way to\nconduct evaluation is through measuring a model's visualization reasoning\ncapability, analogous to how we would evaluate human understanding of\nvisualizations (e.g., visualization literacy). However, we found that in the\ncontext of visualization question answering (VisQA), how an MLLM perceives and\nreasons about visualizations can be fundamentally different from how humans\napproach the same problem. During the evaluation, even without visualization,\nthe model could correctly answer a substantial portion of the visualization\ntest questions, regardless of whether any selection options were provided. We\nhypothesize that the vast amount of knowledge encoded in the language model\npermits factual recall that supersedes the need to seek information from the\nvisual signal. It raises concerns that the current VisQA evaluation may not\nfully capture the models' visualization reasoning capabilities. To address\nthis, we propose a comprehensive sanity check framework that integrates a\nrule-based decision tree and a sanity check table to disentangle the effects of\n\"seeing\" (visual processing) and \"recall\" (reliance on prior knowledge). This\nvalidates VisQA datasets for evaluation, highlighting where models are truly\n\"seeing\", positively or negatively affected by the factual recall, or relying\non inductive biases for question answering.

In this paper, we pro- pose a general\nmulti-stage framework, i.e. BO-SA-PINNs to alleviate this issue. In the first\nstage, Bayesian optimization (BO) is used to select hyperparameters for the\ntraining process, and based on the results of the pre-training, the network\narchitecture, learning rate, sampling points distribution and loss function\nweights suitable for the PDEs are automatically determined. The proposed\nhyperparameters search space based on experimental results can enhance the\nefficiency of BO in identifying optimal hyperparameters.

Using the pre-trained model and loss information in\nthe second-stage training, the exponential moving average (EMA) method is\nemployed to optimize the loss function weights, and residual-based adaptive\nrefinement with distribution (RAR-D) is used to optimize the sampling points\ndistribution.

In this framework, the\nsensing channel is divided into target and background channels. For the target\nchannel, the model introduces a concatenated modeling approach, while for the\nbackground channel, a parameter called the power control factor is introduced\nto assess impact of the target on the background channel, making the modeling\nframework applicable to both mono-static and bi-static sensing modes. To\nvalidate the proposed model's effectiveness, measurements of target and\nbackground channels are conducted in both indoor and outdoor scenarios,\ncovering various sensing targets such as metal plates, reconfigurable\nintelligent surfaces, human bodies, UAVs, and vehicles. The experimental\nresults provide important theoretical support and empirical data for the\nstandardization of ISAC channel modeling.",

Contemporary\napproaches to detecting RFI treat the task as a semantic segmentation problem\non radio telescope spectrograms. Typically, complex heuristic algorithms handle\nthis task of `flagging' in combination with manual labeling (in the most\ndifficult cases). While recent machine-learning approaches have demonstrated\nhigh accuracy, they often fail to meet the stringent operational requirements\nof modern radio observatories. Owing to their inherently time-varying nature,\nspiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising alternative method to\nRFI-detection by utilizing the time-varying nature of the spectrographic source\ndata. In this work, we apply Liquid State Machines (LSMs), a class of spiking\nneural networks, to RFI-detection. We employ second-order Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire (LiF) neurons, marking the first use of this architecture\nand neuron type for RFI-detection. We test three encoding methods and three\nincreasingly complex readout layers, including a transformer decoder head,\nproviding a hybrid of SNN and ANN techniques. Our methods extend LSMs beyond\nconventional classification tasks to fine-grained spatio-temporal segmentation.\nWe train LSMs on simulated data derived from the Hyrogen Epoch of Reionization\nArray (HERA), a known benchmark for RFI-detection.

Each aging/crashed\nnodes become standby nodes after completing its repairing in the repair\nsubsystem. The nodes migrate between the active-node and standby-node\nsubsystems in order to support the continuity of the PBFT consensus service\nwhile reducing maintenance cost.

    "abstract": "The prompt online detection of abrupt changes in image data is essential for\ntimely decision-making in broad applications, from video surveillance to\nmanufacturing quality control. Existing methods, however, face three key\nchallenges. First, the high-dimensional nature of image data introduces\ncomputational bottlenecks for efficient real-time monitoring. Second, changes\noften involve structural image features, e.g., edges, blurs and/or shapes, and\nignoring such structure can lead to delayed change detection. Third, existing\nmethods are largely non-Bayesian and thus do not provide a quantification of\nmonitoring uncertainty for confident detection. We address this via a novel\nBayesian onLine Structure-Aware change deTection (BLAST) method. BLAST first\nleverages a deep Gaussian Markov random field prior to elicit desirable image\nstructure from offline reference data. With this prior elicited, BLAST employs\na new Bayesian online change-point procedure for image monitoring via its\nso-called posterior run length distribution. This posterior run length\ndistribution can be computed in an online fashion using $\\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ work\nat each time-step, where $p$ is the number of image pixels; this facilitates\nscalable Bayesian online monitoring of large images. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of BLAST over existing methods in a suite of numerical\nexperiments and in two applications, the first on street scene monitoring and\nthe second on real-time process monitoring for metal additive manufacturing.",

In this perspective,\nNewman and Girvan proposed a modularity score (Q) for quantifying the power of\ncommunity structure and measuring the appropriateness of a division. The Q\nfunction has newly become a significant standard. In this paper, the strengths\nof the Q score and another technique known as the divisive algorithm are\ncombined to enhance the efficiently of the identification of communities from a\nnetwork. To achieve that goal, we have developed a new algorithm. The\nsimulation results indicated that our algorithm achieved a division with a\nslightly higher Q score against some conventional methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel method for robust output-feedback model\npredictive control (MPC) for a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems. We\npropose a novel interval-valued predictor which, given an initial estimate of\nthe state, produces intervals which are guaranteed to contain the future\ntrajectory of the system. By parameterizing the control input with an initial\nstabilizing feedback term, we are able to reduce the width of the predicted\nstate intervals compared to existing methods. We demonstrate this through a\nnumerical comparison where we show that our controller performs better in the\npresence of large amounts of noise. Finally, we present a simulation study of a\nrobot navigation scenario, where we incorporate a time-varying entropy term\ninto the cost function in order to autonomously explore an uncertain area.",

    "abstract": "We use Space Curve Quantum Control (SCQC) to design, experimentally\ndemonstrate, and benchmark dynamically corrected single-qubit gates on IBM\nhardware, comparing their performance to that of the standard gates provided by\nIBM. Our gates are designed to dynamically suppress both detuning and\npulse-amplitude noise, with gate times as short as 88 ns. We compare our gates\nagainst those of IBM on two separate IBM devices and across sets of up to 18\nqubits. Randomized benchmarking is done utilizing our detuning- and\namplitude-robust gates in randomized Clifford circuits containing up to 4000\ngates. Our gates achieve error-per-Clifford rates that reach as low as\n7$\\times10^{-5}$ ($\\pm10^{-6}$) and which remain nearly constant as the\ncompound noise is increased up to 4% amplitude noise and up to a detuning noise\nof 342 kHz; this is in contrast to the IBM gates, which exhibit rates that drop\nto order $10^{-3}$ across this range. This range is consistent with the\ncommonly reported frequency fluctuations and with the upper bound of the\nstatistical uncertainty in gate calibration. In addition, we investigate the\nperformance across larger noise ranges of up to 20% amplitude and 3.5 MHz\ndetuning noise using quantum process tomography. Finally, we experimentally\ndemonstrate how SCQC can be tailored to different practical use cases by\ntrading off amplitude-robustness for ultrafast 60 ns dephasing-only robust\npulses. Our work establishes experimental guidelines for implementing\nSCQC-designed dynamically corrected gates on a broad range of qubit hardware to\nlimit the effect of noise-induced errors and decoherence.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the class of grey-scale image stack operators as those\nthat (a) map binary-images into binary-images and (b) commute on average with\ncross-sectioning. Equivalently, stack operators are 1-Lipchitz extensions of\nset operators which can be represented by applying a characteristic set\noperator to the cross-sections of the image and adding. In particular, they are\na generalisation of stack filters, for which the characteristic set operators\nare increasing. Our main result is that stack operators inherit lattice\nproperties of the characteristic set operators. We focus on the case of\ntranslation-invariant and locally defined stack operators and show the main\nresult by deducing the characteristic function, kernel, and basis\nrepresentation of stack operators. The results of this paper have implications\non the design of image operators, since imply that to solve some grey-scale\nimage processing problems it is enough to design an operator for performing the\ndesired transformation on binary images, and then considering its extension\ngiven by a stack operator. We leave many topics for future research regarding\nthe machine learning of stack operators and the characterisation of the image\nprocessing problems that can be solved by them.",

In this paper, by directly solving the stabilization\nequations for the solution of frozen moduli without using the matrix equation,\nwe find linear relations between any two of the three complex moduli at the\nblack hole horizon. So far, no one discusses the linear relations. Via the\nlinear relations, we derive the unique solution of frozen moduli and reduce the\nstabilization equations in three different ways. For example, the eight\nstabilization equations in [Phys. Rev.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable versatility\nbut face challenges in demonstrating true visual understanding, particularly in\nchart reasoning tasks. Existing benchmarks like ChartQA reveal significant\nreliance on text-based shortcuts and probabilistic pattern-matching rather than\ngenuine visual reasoning. To rigorously evaluate visual reasoning, we introduce\na more challenging test scenario by removing textual labels and introducing\nchart perturbations in the ChartQA dataset. Under these conditions, models like\nGPT-4o and Gemini-2.0 Pro experience up to a 30% performance drop, underscoring\ntheir limitations. To address these challenges, we propose Socratic Chart, a\nnew framework that transforms chart images into Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)\nrepresentations, enabling MLLMs to integrate textual and visual modalities for\nenhanced chart understanding. Socratic Chart employs a multi-agent pipeline\nwith specialized agent-generators to extract primitive chart attributes (e.g.,\nbar heights, line coordinates) and an agent-critic to validate results,\nensuring high-fidelity symbolic representations. Our framework surpasses\nstate-of-the-art models in accurately capturing chart primitives and improving\nreasoning performance, establishing a robust pathway for advancing MLLM visual\nunderstanding.",

For\nexample, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have\nbeen useful in fields ranging from reinforcement learning (procedural\nenvironments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as\nfunctions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations\n(e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce\nthe term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for\nmath problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for\nmathematical reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models.\nHowever, prior work has been limited to automatically constructing abstractions\nfor grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs),\nwhile generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human\nengineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced\nmathematics problems by developing EFAGen, which operationalizes the task of\nautomatically inferring an EFA for a given seed problem and solution as a\nprogram synthesis task. We first formalize the properties of any valid EFA as\nexecutable unit tests. Using execution feedback from the unit tests, we search\nover candidate programs sampled from a LLM to find EFA programs that are\nfaithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed\nproblem. We then apply the tests as a reward signal, training LLMs to become\nbetter writers of EFAs. We show that EFAs inferred by EFAGen are faithful to\nthe seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can\ninfer EFAs across diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally,\nwe show uses of model-written EFAs e.g., finding harder/easier problem\nvariants, as well as data generation.",
