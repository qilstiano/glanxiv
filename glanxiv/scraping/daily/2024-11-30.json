This gauge field results in Chern\nnumbers in all spatial dimensions, collectively forming the Chern vector.

Common approaches will first split data into training and\ntest sets and then learn data representations purely on the training set.\nHowever, recent theoretical studies have shown that, as long as the sample\nindexes are not used during the learning process, the whole data can be used to\nlearn data representations, meanwhile ensuring control of Type-I errors. The\nabove fact motivates us to use the test set (but without sample indexes) to\nfacilitate the data representation learning in the testing. To this end, we\npropose a representation-learning two-sample testing (RL-TST) framework. RL-TST\nfirst performs purely self-supervised representation learning on the entire\ndataset to capture inherent representations (IRs) that reflect the underlying\ndata manifold. A discriminative model is then trained on these IRs to learn\ndiscriminative representations (DRs), enabling the framework to leverage both\nthe rich structural information from IRs and the discriminative power of DRs.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that RL-TST outperforms representative\napproaches by simultaneously using data manifold information in the test set\nand enhancing test power via finding the DRs with the training set.",

Recent\nadvances in quantum magnonics also highlight the need for employing magnon\nphase as quantum state variables, which is to be detected and mapped out with\nhigh precision in on-chip micro- and nano-scale magnonic devices. Here, we\ndemonstrate a facile optical technique that can directly perform concurrent\nspectroscopic and imaging functionalities with spatial- and phase-resolutions,\nusing infrared strobe light operating at 1550-nm wavelength. To showcase the\nmethodology, we spectroscopically studied the phase-resolved spin dynamics in a\nbilayer of Permalloy and Y3Fe5O12 (YIG), and spatially imaged the backward\nvolume spin wave modes of YIG in the dipolar spin wave regime. Using the strobe\nlight probe, the detected precessional phase contrast can be directly used to\nconstruct the map of the spin wave wavefront, in the continuous-wave regime of\nspin-wave propagation and in the stationary state, without needing any optical\nreference path. By selecting the applied field, frequency, and detection phase,\nthe spin wave images can be made sensitive to the precession amplitude and\nphase.

In this paper, we study the joint\ndistribution of monochromatic hyperedges for hypergraphs with multiple layers\n(multiplex hypergraphs). Specifically, we consider the joint distribution of\n${\\bf T} _n:= (T(H_n^{(1)}), T(H_n^{(2)}))$, for two sequences of hypergraphs\n$H_n^{(1)}$ and $H_n^{(2)}$ on the same set of vertices.

In other words, the joint Poisson approximation of ${\\bf T}_n$ is\ndetermined only by the convergence of its first two moments. This generalizes\nrecent results on the second moment phenomenon for Poisson approximation from\ngraph coloring to hypergraph coloring and from marginal convergence to joint\nconvergence.

The utility of the proposed approach is\nparticularly evident in mobile robotics, where agents benefit from being\norganized and navigated in formation for a variety of real-world applications\nrequiring frequent alterations in formation shape for efficient navigation or\ntask completion. Given the constrained operational time inherent to\nbattery-powered mobile robots, the time needed to complete the formation\nreshaping process is crucial for their efficient operation, especially in case\nof multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed Collision-Aware\nTime-Optimal formation Reshaping Algorithm (CAT-ORA) builds upon the Hungarian\nalgorithm for the solution of the robot-to-goal assignment implementing the\ninter-agent collision avoidance through direct constraints on mutually\nexclusive robot-goal pairs combined with a trajectory generation approach\nminimizing the duration of the reshaping process. Theoretical validations\nconfirm the optimality of CAT-ORA, with its efficacy further showcased through\nsimulations, and a real-world outdoor experiment involving 19 UAVs. Thorough\nnumerical analysis shows the potential of CAT-ORA to decrease the time required\nto perform complex formation reshaping tasks by up to 49%, and 12% on average\ncompared to commonly used methods in randomly generated scenarios.",

In these systems, spin-splitting\nphenomena emerge due to inversion symmetry breaking and the presence of\nextended electronic states, yet the connection to chiroptical phenomena is\nlacking. Here, we develop an analytical effective mass model of chiral\nexcitons, parameterized by density functional theory. The model accounts for\nparity mixing of the band edge Bloch functions resulting from polar\ndistortions, resulting in magnetic dipole allowed transitions.

Thus, the AI-automated attacks performed on par with human\nexperts and 350% better than the control group. The results are a significant\nimprovement from similar studies conducted last year, highlighting the\nincreased deceptive capabilities of AI models. Our AI-automated emails were\nsent using a custom-built tool that automates the entire spear phishing\nprocess, including information gathering and creating personalized\nvulnerability profiles for each target. The AI-gathered information was\naccurate and useful in 88% of cases and only produced inaccurate profiles for\n4% of the participants. We also use language models to detect the intention of\nemails. Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored well above 90% with low false-positive rates\nand detected several seemingly benign emails that passed human detection.\nLastly, we analyze the economics of phishing, highlighting how AI enables\nattackers to target more individuals at lower cost and increase profitability\nby up to 50 times for larger audiences.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous collapse models use non-linear stochastic modifications of the\nSchroedinger equation to suppress superpositions of eigenstates of the measured\nobservable and drive the state to an eigenstate. It was recently demonstrated\nthat the Born rule for transition probabilities can be modeled using the linear\nSchroedinger equation with a Hamiltonian represented by a random matrix from\nthe Gaussian unitary ensemble. The matrices representing the Hamiltonian at\ndifferent time points throughout the observation period are assumed to be\nindependent. Instead of suppressing superpositions, such Schroedinger evolution\nmakes the state perform an isotropic random walk on the projective space of\nstates. The relative frequency of reaching different eigenstates of an\narbitrary observable in the random walk is shown to satisfy the Born rule.\nHere, we apply this methodology to investigate the behavior of a particle in\nthe context of the double-slit experiment with measurement. Our analysis shows\nthat, in this basic case, the evolution of the particle's state can be\neffectively captured through a random walk on a two-dimensional submanifold of\nthe state space. This random walk reproduces the Born rule for the probability\nof finding the particle near the slits, conditioned on its arrival at one of\nthem. To ensure that this condition is satisfied, we introduce a drift term\nrepresenting a change in the variance of the position observable for the state.\nA drift-free model, based on equivalence classes of states indistinguishable by\nthe detector, is also considered. The resulting random walk, with or without\ndrift, serves as a suitable model for describing the transition from the\ninitial state to an eigenstate of the measured observable in the experiment,\noffering new insights into its potential underlying mechanisms.",

To construct our solutions, we adopt a linear functional form, $f(R,T)\n= R + \\beta T$. In the limit $\\beta = 0$, the theory reduces to General\nRelativity (GR), recovering $f(R,T) \\approx R$. We propose a power-law\nLagrangian of the form $\\mathcal{L} = f_0 + F + \\alpha F^p$, where $\\alpha\n=f_0= 0$ corresponds to the linear electrodynamics case. Using this setup, we\nderive the metric functions and determine an effective cosmological constant.\nOur analysis focuses on specific cases with $p = 2$, $p = 4$, and $p = 6$,\nwhere we formulate analytic expressions for the matter fields supporting these\nsolutions in terms of the Lagrangian as a function of $F$. Additionally, we\nverify the regularity of the solutions and study the structure of the event\nhorizons. Furthermore, we examine a more specific scenario by determining the\nfree forms of the first and second derivatives $\\mathcal{L}_F(r)$ and\n$\\mathcal{L}_{FF}(r)$ of the Lagrangean of the nonlinear electromagnetic field.\nFrom these relations, we derive the general form of\n$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{NLED}}(r)$ using consistency relations.

Specifically, $\\alpha$ originates from the power-law term\nin the proposed Lagrangian, while $\\beta$ arises from the assumed linear\nfunction $f(R,T)$. The interplay of these constants ensures that the\nnonlinearity of the Lagrangian is governed by both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, rather\nthan $\\alpha$ alone.",

For the first time in FL, our framework\ncombines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE,\nincorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific\nlearning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and\ncombined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented\ncategories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach\nmitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves\nclassification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of\nquantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.",

Conversely, non-uniform exploration offers better immediate\nperformance but lacks support for off-policy learning. Recent research suggests\nthat regression oracles can bridge this gap by combining non-uniform\nexploration with supervised learning. In this paper, we analyze these\napproaches within a real-world industrial context at Adyen, a large global\npayments processor characterized by batch logged delayed feedback, short-term\nmemory, and dynamic action spaces under the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)\nframework. Our analysis reveals that while regression oracles significantly\nimprove performance, they introduce challenges due to rigid algorithmic\nassumptions. Specifically, we observe that as a policy improves, subsequent\ngenerations may perform worse due to shifts in the reward distribution and\nincreased class imbalance in the training data. This degradation occurs de\nspite improvements in other aspects of the training data, leading to decreased\nperformance in successive policy iterations. We further explore the long-term\nimpact of regression oracles, identifying a potential \"oscillation effect.\"\nThis effect arises when regression oracles influence probability estimates and\nthe realizability of subsequent policy models, leading to fluctuations in\nperformance across iterations. Our findings highlight the need for more\nadaptable algorithms that can leverage the benefits of regression oracles\nwithout introducing instability in policy performance over time.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the Facility Location Problem with Scarce Resources\n(FLPSR) under the assumption that agents' type follow a probability\ndistribution. In the FLPSR, the objective is to identify the optimal locations\nfor one or more capacitated facilities to maximize Social Welfare (SW), defined\nas the sum of the utilities of all agents. The total capacity of the\nfacilities, however, is not enough to accommodate all the agents, who thus\ncompete in a First-Come-First-Served game to determine whether they get\naccommodated and what their utility is. The main contribution of this paper\nties Optimal Transport theory to the problem of determining the best truthful\nmechanism for the FLPSR tailored to the agents' type distributions. Owing to\nthis connection, we identify the mechanism that maximizes the expected SW as\nthe number of agents goes to infinity. For the case of a single facility, we\nshow that an optimal mechanism always exists. We examine three classes of\nprobability distributions and characterize the optimal mechanism either\nanalytically represent the optimal mechanism or provide a routine to\nnumerically compute it. We then extend our results to the case in which we have\ntwo capacitated facilities to place. While we initially assume that agents are\nindependent and identically distributed, we show that our techniques are\napplicable to scenarios where agents are not identically distributed. Finally,\nwe validate our findings through several numerical experiments, including: (i)\nderiving optimal mechanisms for the class of beta distributions, (ii) assessing\nthe Bayesian approximation ratio of these mechanisms for small numbers of\nagents, and (iii) assessing how quickly the expected SW attained by the\nmechanism converges to its limit.",

We propose the Aberrance Retention Quotient (ARQ), a novel metric\nthat systematically quantifies the extent of overfitting, enabling the\nidentification of an optimal golden overfitting interval wherein model\nsensitivity to anomalies is maximized without sacrificing generalization. To\ncomprehensively capture how overfitting affects detection performance, we\nfurther propose the Relative Anomaly Distribution Index (RADI), a metric\nsuperior to traditional AUROC by explicitly modeling the separation between\nnormal and anomalous score distributions. Theoretically, RADI leverages ARQ to\ntrack and evaluate how overfitting impacts anomaly detection, offering an\nintegrated approach to understanding the relationship between overfitting\ndynamics and model efficacy. We also rigorously validate the statistical\nefficacy of Gaussian noise as pseudo-anomaly generators, reinforcing the\nmethod's broad applicability.

    "abstract": "Prevailing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encode the input image(s)\nas vision tokens and feed them into the language backbone, similar to how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) process the text tokens. However, the number of vision\ntokens increases quadratically as the image resolutions, leading to huge\ncomputational costs. In this paper, we consider improving MLLM's efficiency\nfrom two scenarios, (I) Reducing computational cost without degrading the\nperformance. (II) Improving the performance with given budgets. We start with\nour main finding that the ranking of each vision token sorted by attention\nscores is similar in each layer except the first layer. Based on it, we assume\nthat the number of essential top vision tokens does not increase along layers.\nAccordingly, for Scenario I, we propose a greedy search algorithm (G-Search) to\nfind the least number of vision tokens to keep at each layer from the shallow\nto the deep. Interestingly, G-Search is able to reach the optimal reduction\nstrategy based on our assumption. For Scenario II, based on the reduction\nstrategy from G-Search, we design a parametric sigmoid function (P-Sigmoid) to\nguide the reduction at each layer of the MLLM, whose parameters are optimized\nby Bayesian Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\ncan significantly accelerate those popular MLLMs, e.g. LLaVA, and InternVL2\nmodels, by more than $2 \\times$ without performance drops. Our approach also\nfar outperforms other token reduction methods when budgets are limited,\nachieving a better trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness.",

In this paper, we\nconsider the application of LLMs on symmetric tasks where a query is asked on\nan (unordered) bag of elements. Examples of such tasks include answering\naggregate queries on a database table. In general, when the bag contains a\nlarge number of elements, LLMs tend to overlook some elements, leading to\nchallenges in generating accurate responses to the query. LLMs receive their\ninputs as ordered sequences. However, in this problem, we leverage the fact\nthat the symmetric input is not ordered, and reordering should not affect the\nLLM's response.\n  Observing that LLMs are less likely to miss elements at certain positions of\nthe input, we introduce the problem of LLM input reranking: to find a ranking\nof the input that maximizes the LLM's accuracy for the given query without\nmaking explicit assumptions about the query. Finding the optimal ranking\nrequires identifying (i) the relevance of each input element for answering the\nquery and (ii) the importance of each rank position for the LLM's attention. We\ndevelop algorithms for estimating these values efficiently utilizing a helper\nLLM.

State-of-the-art self-supervised methods tend to\nenhance either generalizability or discriminability but not both\nsimultaneously. Thus, learning representations jointly possessing strong\ngeneralizability and discriminability presents a specific challenge for\nself-supervised learning. To this end, we revisit the learning paradigm of\nself-supervised learning from the perspective of evolutionary game theory (EGT)\nand outline the theoretical roadmap to achieve a desired trade-off between\nthese representation properties. EGT performs well in analyzing the trade-off\npoint in a two-player game by utilizing dynamic system modeling. However, the\nEGT analysis requires sufficient annotated data, which contradicts the\nprinciple of self-supervised learning, i.e., the EGT analysis cannot be\nconducted without the annotations of the specific target domain for\nself-supervised learning. Thus, to enhance the methodological generalization,\nwe propose a novel self-supervised learning method that leverages advancements\nin reinforcement learning to jointly benefit from the general guidance of EGT\nand sequentially optimize the model to chase the consistent improvement of\ngeneralizability and discriminability for specific target domains during\npre-training. Theoretically, we establish that the proposed method tightens the\ngeneralization error upper bound of self-supervised learning.

CESN+ can generate\nmovement trajectories that may go beyond the initial LfD training based on a\ndesired set of conditions while providing confidence on its generated output.\nTo assess the abilities of CESN+, we first evaluate its performance against\nConditional Neural Movement Primitives (CNMP), a comparable framework that uses\na conditional neural process to generate movement primitives. Our findings\nindicate that CESN+ not only outperforms CNMP but is also faster to train and\ndemonstrates impressive performance in generating trajectories for\nextrapolation cases. In human-robot shared control applications, the confidence\nof the machine generated trajectory is a key indicator of how to arbitrate\ncontrol sharing. To show the usability of the CESN+ for human-robot adaptive\nshared control, we have designed a proof-of-concept human-robot shared control\ntask and tested its efficacy in adapting the sharing weight between the human\nand the robot by comparing it to a fixed-weight control scheme. The simulation\nexperiments show that with CESN+ based adaptive sharing the total human load in\nshared control can be significantly reduced.

Thus, deriving robustness certificates is important to guarantee\nthat test predictions remain unaffected and to understand worst-case robustness\nbehavior. However, for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the problem of certifying\nlabel flipping has so far been unsolved. We change this by introducing an exact\ncertification method, deriving both sample-wise and collective certificates.\nOur method leverages the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to capture the training\ndynamics of wide networks enabling us to reformulate the bilevel optimization\nproblem representing label flipping into a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP).\nWe apply our method to certify a broad range of GNN architectures in node\nclassification tasks.

    "abstract": "We explore static noise in a discrete quantum random walk over a homogeneous\ncyclic graph, focusing on spectral and dynamical properties. Using a\nthree-parameter unitary coin, we control the spectral structure of the\nnoiseless step operator on the unit circle. One parameter induces two spectral\nbands separated by a gap proportional to its value, while the half-sum of the\ntwo phase parameters rotates the spectrum and enables twofold degeneracy under\nspecific conditions. Degenerate spectra yield sinusoidal probability\ndistributions; non-degenerate ones produce flat profiles. We introduce static\nphase noise on the sites and analyze its effects in two propagation regimes. In\nthe walk-on-the-line regime, preceding a full graph traversal, we extract the\nspreading exponent $\\beta$ from the step-resolved mean squared displacement.\nLow participation ratios correlate with sub-diffusive spread; high ratios\nindicate ballistic or super-diffusive evolution. Once the walker completes a\ncycle, finite-size effects dominate. In this walk-on-the-cycle regime, $\\beta$\nno longer characterizes the dynamics. Instead, we quantify localization using\nthe coefficient of variation of the mean squared displacement. In both regimes,\nwe observe a sharp crossover near static site noise $\\phi_s = \\pi/3$, marked by\na drop in participation ratio, a transition from diffusive to sub-diffusive\nspread in the walk-on-the-line regime, and a reduced saturation level in the\nwalk-on-the-cycle regime. Our results show that the eigenstate participation\nratio is an efficient spectral diagnostic that anticipates localization across\nboth regimes, offering an alternative to full dynamical simulations.",

We use textual forma\nmentis networks (TFMN) to extract network (semantic/syntactic associations) and\nemotional features from approximately one thousand human- and GPT3.5-generated\nstories. Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), we test whether\nfeatures relative to Mednick's associative theory of creativity can explain\ncreativity ratings assigned by humans and GPT-3.5. Using XGBoost, we examine\nthree scenarios: (i) human ratings of human stories, (ii) GPT-3.5 ratings of\nhuman stories, and (iii) GPT-3.5 ratings of GPT-generated stories. Our findings\nreveal that GPT-3.5 ratings differ significantly from human ratings not only in\nterms of correlations but also because of feature patterns identified with XAI\nmethods. GPT-3.5 favours 'its own' stories and rates human stories differently\nfrom humans. Feature importance analysis with SHAP scores shows that: (i)\nnetwork features are more predictive for human creativity ratings but also for\nGPT-3.5's ratings of human stories; (ii) emotional features played a greater\nrole than semantic/syntactic network structure in GPT-3.5 rating its own\nstories. These quantitative results underscore key limitations in GPT-3.5's\nability to align with human assessments of creativity. We emphasise the need\nfor caution when using GPT-3.5 to assess and generate creative content, as it\ndoes not yet capture the nuanced complexity that characterises human\ncreativity.",

    "abstract": "The length polyhedron of an interval order $P$ is the convex hull of integer\nvectors representing the interval lengths in possible interval representations\nof $P$ in which all intervals have integer endpoints. This polyhedron is an\nintegral translation of a polyhedral cone, with its apex corresponding to the\ncanonical interval representation of $P$ (also known as the minimal endpoint\nrepresentation).\n  In earlier work, we introduced an arc-weighted directed graph model, termed\nthe key graph, inspired by this canonical representation. We showed that cycles\nin the key graph correspond, via Fourier-Motzkin elimination, to inequalities\nthat describe supporting hyperplanes of the length polyhedron. These cycle\ninequalities derived from the key graph form a complete system of linear\ninequalities defining the length polyhedron. By applying a theorem due to Cook,\nwe establish here that this system of inequalities is totally dual integral\n(TDI).\n  Leveraging circulations, total dual integrality, and the special structure of\nthe key graph, our main theorem demonstrates that a cycle inequality is a\npositive linear combination of other cycle inequalities if and only if it is a\npositive integral linear combination of smaller cycle inequalities (where\n`smaller' here refers a natural weak ordering among these cycle inequalities).\nThis yields an efficient method to remove redundant cycle inequalities and\nultimately construct the unique minimal TDI-system, also known as the Schrijver\nsystem, for the length polyhedron. Notably, if the key graph contains a\npolynomial number of cycles, this gives a polynomial-time algorithm to compute\nthe Schrijver system for the length polyhedron.\n  Lastly, we provide examples of interval orders where the Schrijver system has\nan exponential size.",

It is convenient to work in the Higgs basis\n$\\{{H}_1, {H}_2\\}$ where only the first Higgs doublet field ${H}_1$ acquires a\nvacuum expectation value. In light of the LHC Higgs data, which agree well with\nStandard Model (SM) predictions, it follows that the parameters of the 2HDM are\nconsistent with the Higgs alignment limit. In this parameter regime, the\nobserved SM-like Higgs boson resides almost entirely in ${H}_1$, and the other\ntwo physical neutral scalars, which reside almost entirely in ${H}_2$, are\napproximate eigenstates of CP (denoted by the CP-even $H$ and the CP-odd $A$).\nIn the Higgs basis, the scalar potential term $\\bar{Z}_7 {H}_1^\\dagger {H}_2\n{H}_2^\\dagger {H}_2+{\\rm h.c.}$ governs the charged-Higgs loop contributions to\nthe decay of $H$ and $A$ to photons. If $ \\text{Re } \\bar{Z}_7 \\, \\text{Im }\n\\bar{Z}_7 \\neq 0$, then CP-violating effects are present and allow for an $H^+\nH^- A$ coupling, which can yield a sizable branching ratio for\n$A\\to\\gamma\\gamma$. These CP-violating effects also generate non-zero EDMs for\nthe electron, the neutron and the proton. We examine these correlations for the\ncases of $m_{A}=95$ GeV and $m_{A}=152$ GeV where interesting excesses in the\ndiphoton spectrum have been observed at the LHC. These excesses can be\nexplained via the decay of $A$ while being consistent with the experimental\nbound for the electron EDM in regions of parameter space that can be tested\nwith future neutron and proton EDM measurements. This allows for the\ninteresting possibility where the 95 GeV diphoton excess can be identified with\n$A$, while $m_H\\simeq 98$ GeV can account for the best fit to the LEP excess in\n$e^+e^-\\to ZH$ with $H\\to b\\bar b$.",

To examine this hypothesis, we took the star forming region, NGC 2264,\nas a test bed. We have studied its high-mass pre-main-sequence and zero-age\nmain-sequence stars. We found that on average, disk-less pre-main-sequence\nstars rotate faster than their disk-bearing counterparts. The stellar rotation\ndistribution of its zero-age main-sequence stars is similar to evolved young\nclusters.

In fact, all the subspaces\nrepresenting danger in the logical scenario space, rather than only the most\ncritical concrete scenario, play a more significant role for the safety\nevaluation. Covering as many of the critical concrete scenarios in a logical\nscenario space through a limited number of tests is defined as the Black-Box\nCoverage (BBC) problem in this paper. We formalized this problem in a\nsample-based search paradigm and constructed a coverage criterion with\nConfusion Matrix Analysis. Furthermore, we propose LAMBDA (Latent-Action\nMonte-Carlo Beam Search with Density Adaption) to solve BBC problems. LAMBDA\ncan quickly focus on critical subspaces by recursively partitioning the logical\nscenario space into accepted and rejected parts. Compared with its predecessor\nLaMCTS, LAMBDA introduces sampling density to overcome the sampling bias from\noptimization and Beam Search to obtain more parallelizability. Experimental\nresults show that LAMBDA achieves state-of-the-art performance among all\nbaselines and can reach at most 33 and 6000 times faster than Random Search to\nget 95% coverage of the critical areas in 2- and 5-dimensional synthetic\nfunctions, respectively. Experiments also demonstrate that LAMBDA has a\npromising future in the safety evaluation of ADSs in virtual tests.",

The problem will be identified as\nthe dual of a specific optimal transport formulation that involves three-point\nplans.

First, it introduces a\nmethod to identify frequency ranges where SIDF analysis becomes inaccurate.\nSecond, these identified ranges correlate with high-magnitude, high-order\nharmonics that can degrade system performance. To address this, a shaped reset\ncontrol strategy is proposed, which incorporates a shaping filter to tune reset\nactions and reduce high-order harmonics. Then, a frequency-domain design\nprocedure of a PID shaping filter in a reset control system is outlined as a\ncase study. The PID filter effectively reduces high-order harmonics and\nresolves limit-cycle issues under step inputs.

By leveraging state-of-the-art AD,\nobjective functions such as soft dynamic time warping and Wasserstein distance,\nwhich are difficult to apply in traditional FWI are also easily integrated into\nADFWI. In addition, ADFWI is integrated with deep learning for implicit model\nreparameterization via neural networks, which not only introduces learned\nregularization but also allows rapid estimation of uncertainty through dropout.\nTo manage high memory demands in large-scale inversion associated with AD, the\nproposed framework adopts strategies such as mini-batch and checkpointing.\nThrough comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the novelty, practicality and\nrobustness of ADFWI, which can be used to address challenges in FWI and as a\nworkbench for prompt experiments and the development of new inversion\nstrategies.",

The system comprises three key components: a\nsignal-to-text model, a pure text model, and a multimodal model. Firstly, the\nsignal-to-text model was designed to convert raw signal data into textual\ndescriptions, bridging the gap between signal data and text-based analysis.\nSecondly, the pure text model was fine-tuned using the GLM4 model with\nspecialized knowledge to enhance its understanding of domain-specific texts.\nFinally, these two models were integrated to develop a comprehensive multimodal\nmodel that effectively processes and analyzes both signal and textual data.The\ndataset used for training and evaluation was sourced from academic papers,\ntextbooks, international standards, and vibration analyst training materials,\nundergoing meticulous preprocessing to ensure high-quality data. As a result,\nthe model has demonstrated outstanding performance across multiple intelligent\noperations and maintenance tasks, providing a low-cost, high-quality method for\nconstructing large-scale monitoring signal-text description-fault pattern\ndatasets. Experimental results indicate that the model holds significant\nadvantages in condition monitoring, signal processing, and fault diagnosis.In\nthe constructed general test set, MaintAGT achieved an accuracy of 70%,\nsurpassing all existing general large language models and reaching the level of\nan ISO Level III human vibration analyst.This advancement signifies a crucial\nstep forward from traditional maintenance practices toward intelligent and\nAI-driven maintenance solutions.",

Recent research has investigated to exploit various\ninformation from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to estimate node importance scores.\nHowever, the semantic information in KGs could be insufficient, missing, and\ninaccurate, which would limit the performance of existing NIE models. To\naddress these issues, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic\naugmentation thanks to the LLMs' extra knowledge and ability of integrating\nknowledge from both LLMs and KGs. To this end, we propose the LLMs Empowered\nNode Importance Estimation (LENIE) method to enhance the semantic information\nin KGs for better supporting NIE tasks. To our best knowledge, this is the\nfirst work incorporating LLMs into NIE. Specifically, LENIE employs a novel\nclustering-based triplet sampling strategy to extract diverse knowledge of a\nnode sampled from the given KG. After that, LENIE adopts the node-specific\nadaptive prompts to integrate the sampled triplets and the original node\ndescriptions, which are then fed into LLMs for generating richer and more\nprecise augmented node descriptions. These augmented descriptions finally\ninitialize node embeddings for boosting the downstream NIE model performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate LENIE's effectiveness in addressing semantic\ndeficiencies in KGs, enabling more informative semantic augmentation and\nenhancing existing NIE models to achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

Among these\nrepresentations, line segments are widely used because of their ability to\nsuccinctly capture the structural features of a scene. However, existing 3D\nreconstruction methods often face significant challenges. Methods relying on 2D\nprojections suffer from instability caused by errors in multi-view matching and\nocclusions, while direct 3D approaches are hampered by noise and sparsity in 3D\npoint cloud data. This paper introduces LineGS, a novel method that combines\ngeometry-guided 3D line reconstruction with a 3D Gaussian splatting model to\naddress these challenges and improve representation ability. The method\nleverages the high-density Gaussian point distributions along the edge of the\nscene to refine and optimize initial line segments generated from traditional\ngeometric approaches. By aligning these segments with the underlying geometric\nfeatures of the scene, LineGS achieves a more precise and reliable\nrepresentation of 3D structures.

    "abstract": "Skin cancer (SC) stands out as one of the most life-threatening forms of\ncancer, with its danger amplified if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Early\nintervention is critical, as it allows for more effective treatment approaches.\nIn recent years, Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool in the early\ndetection and skin cancer diagnosis (SCD). Although the DL seems promising for\nthe diagnosis of skin cancer, still ample scope exists for improving model\nefficiency and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach to skin cancer\ndetection, utilizing optimization techniques in conjunction with pre-trained\nnetworks and wavelet transformations. First, normalized images will undergo\npre-trained networks such as Densenet-121, Inception, Xception, and MobileNet\nto extract hierarchical features from input images. After feature extraction,\nthe feature maps are passed through a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) layer to\ncapture low and high-frequency components. Then the self-attention module is\nintegrated to learn global dependencies between features and focus on the most\nrelevant parts of the feature maps. The number of neurons and optimization of\nthe weight vectors are performed using three new swarm-based optimization\ntechniques, such as Modified Gorilla Troops Optimizer (MGTO), Improved Gray\nWolf Optimization (IGWO), and Fox optimization algorithm. Evaluation results\ndemonstrate that optimizing weight vectors using optimization algorithms can\nenhance diagnostic accuracy and make it a highly effective approach for SCD.\nThe proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in accuracy,\nachieving top rates of 98.11% with the MobileNet + Wavelet + FOX and DenseNet +\nWavelet + Fox combination on the ISIC-2016 dataset and 97.95% with the\nInception + Wavelet + MGTO combination on the ISIC-2017 dataset, which improves\naccuracy by at least 1% compared to other methods.",

    "abstract": "Building a general-purpose task model similar to ChatGPT has been an\nimportant research direction for gene large language models. Instruction\nfine-tuning is a key component in building ChatGPT, but existing instructions\nare primarily based on natural language. Natural language and gene sequences\nhave significant differences in tokenization and encoding. Therefore,\nconstructing a multilingual model that can handle both natural language and\ngene sequences is crucial for solving this problem.In this paper, we expand the\ncapabilities of the LLaMA large language model to include gene language. This\ninvolves expanding the vocabulary using the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) method,\nspecifically tailored for DNA and protein sequences, and conducting further\npre-training on these sequences. We then convert various downstream gene task\ndata into a unified format for instruction fine-tuning and further fine-tune\nthe model on this data.Our study demonstrates that a mixed model of gene and\nnatural language, fine-tuned with instructions, achieves results comparable to\nthe current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in tasks such as gene classification and\ngene sequence interaction. This provides a promising direction for building a\nunified large language model for gene tasks.",

This motivates us to study the impact of sub-MeV\ninterstellar dark matter on the cooling processes of white dwarfs. In this\nwork, we consider the collisions between dark matter and relativistic\ndegenerate electrons inside white dwarfs, numerically calculating the energy\ninput and output results from scattering, capture, evaporation, and\nannihilation processes.

    "abstract": "As irregularly structured data representations, graphs have received a large\namount of attention in recent years and have been widely applied to various\nreal-world scenarios such as social, traffic, and energy settings. Compared to\nnon-graph algorithms, numerous graph-based methodologies benefited from the\nstrong power of graphs for representing high-dimensional and non-Euclidean\ndata. In the field of Graph Signal Processing (GSP), analogies of classical\nsignal processing concepts, such as shifting, convolution, filtering, and\ntransformations are developed. However, many GSP techniques usually postulate\nthe graph is static in both signal and typology. This assumption hinders the\neffectiveness of GSP methodologies as the assumption ignores the time-varying\nproperties in numerous real-world systems. For example, in the traffic network,\nthe signal on each node varies over time and contains underlying temporal\ncorrelation and patterns worthy of analysis. To tackle this challenge, more and\nmore work are being done recently to investigate the processing of time-varying\ngraph signals. They cope with time-varying challenges from three main\ndirections: 1) graph time-spectral filtering, 2) multi-variate time-series\nforecasting, and 3) spatiotemporal graph data mining by neural networks, where\nnon-negligible progress has been achieved. Despite the success of signal\nprocessing and learning over time-varying graphs, there is no survey to compare\nand conclude the current methodology for GSP and graph learning. To compensate\nfor this, in this paper, we aim to review the development and recent progress\non signal processing and learning over time-varying graphs, and compare their\nadvantages and disadvantages from both the methodological and experimental\nside, to outline the challenges and potential research directions for future\nresearch.",

Moreover, prior X-ray\naugmentation methods have predominantly focused on foreground prohibited items,\noverlooking informative background cues. In this paper, we propose Background\nMixup (BGM), a background-based augmentation technique tailored for X-ray\nsecurity imaging domain. Unlike conventional methods, BGM is founded on an\nin-depth analysis of physical properties including: 1) X-ray Transmission\nImagery: Transmitted X-ray pixels represent composite information from multiple\nmaterials along the imaging path. 2) Material-based Pseudo-coloring:\nPseudo-coloring in X-ray images correlates directly with material properties,\naiding in material distinction. Building upon the above insights, BGM mixes\nbackground patches across regions on both 1) texture structure and 2) material\nvariation, to benefit models from complicated background cues. This enhances\nthe model's capability to handle domain-specific challenges such as\nocclusion-induced discriminative imbalance. Importantly, BGM is orthogonal and\nfully compatible with existing foreground-focused augmentation techniques,\nenabling joint use to further enhance detection performance. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple X-ray security benchmarks show that BGM consistently\nsurpasses strong baselines, without additional annotations or significant\ntraining overhead.

The formation\ntimes for the initial state of dense matter in such collisions can be up to\nthree orders of magnitude longer than those in ultra-relativistic collisions.\nThis reflects a fundamentally different nature and formation process,\nparticularly concerning the possible stages of initial state evolution,\nincluding thermalization (which may be only partial at very low collision\nenergies), subsequent hydrodynamic expansion, and the final transition of\nmatter evolution into a hadronic cascade. These stages, which are fully\nrealized in ultra-relativistic reactions, can also occur within the energy\nrange of BES RHIC, albeit with distinct time scales.

Our strategy is based on the authors'\nprevious works establishing the possibility and stability of controlling\nacoustic fields using an array of almost non-radiating coupling sources and\npresents a detailed Fourier synthesis approach towards a time-domain effect. We\nrequire that the array of acoustic sources creates the desired fields on the\ncontrol regions while maintaining a zero field beyond a larger circumscribed\nsphere.

To maximize the\nutilization of local knowledge, we leverage the global model to revise the\nlocal exponential moving average (EMA) model of each client and distill it into\nthe clients' models. Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local\nrepresentation regularization to mitigate the overfitting of noisy labels.\nExtensive experiments on three F-LNL benchmarks against seven baseline methods\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedGR.",

However, the computational cost of processing long visual\ntokens can be prohibitively expensive on resource-limited devices. Previous\nmethods have identified redundancy in visual tokens within the Large Language\nModel (LLM) decoder layers and have mitigated this by pruning tokens using a\npre-defined or fixed ratio, thereby reducing computational overhead.\nNonetheless, we observe that the impact of pruning ratio varies across\ndifferent LLM layers and instances (image-prompt pairs). Therefore, it is\nessential to develop a layer-wise and instance-wise vision token pruning\nstrategy to balance computational cost and model performance effectively. We\npropose ATP-LLaVA, a novel approach that adaptively determines\ninstance-specific token pruning ratios for each LLM layer. Specifically, we\nintroduce an Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP) module, which computes the importance\nscore and pruning threshold based on input instance adaptively. The ATP module\ncan be seamlessly integrated between any two LLM layers with negligible\ncomputational overhead. Additionally, we develop a Spatial Augmented Pruning\n(SAP) strategy that prunes visual tokens with both token redundancy and spatial\nmodeling perspectives. Our approach reduces the average token count by 75%\nwhile maintaining performance, with only a minimal 1.9% degradation across\nseven widely used benchmarks.

    "abstract": "In rapidly evolving field of vision-language models (VLMs), contrastive\nlanguage-image pre-training (CLIP) has made significant strides, becoming\nfoundation for various downstream tasks. However, relying on one-to-one (image,\ntext) contrastive paradigm to learn alignment from large-scale messy web data,\nCLIP faces a serious myopic dilemma, resulting in biases towards monotonous\nshort texts and shallow visual expressivity. To overcome these issues, this\npaper advances CLIP into one novel holistic paradigm, by updating both diverse\ndata and alignment optimization. To obtain colorful data with low cost, we use\nimage-to-text captioning to generate multi-texts for each image, from multiple\nperspectives, granularities, and hierarchies. Two gadgets are proposed to\nencourage textual diversity. To match such (image, multi-texts) pairs, we\nmodify the CLIP image encoder into multi-branch, and propose multi-to-multi\ncontrastive optimization for image-text part-to-part matching. As a result,\ndiverse visual embeddings are learned for each image, bringing good\ninterpretability and generalization. Extensive experiments and ablations across\nover ten benchmarks indicate that our holistic CLIP significantly outperforms\nexisting myopic CLIP, including image-text retrieval, open-vocabulary\nclassification, and dense visual tasks.",

    "abstract": "The physics of membranes, a classic subject, acquires new momentum from\ntwo-dimensional (2D) materials multilayers. This work reports the surprising\nresults emerged during a theoretical study of equilibrium geometry of bilayers\nas freestanding membranes. While ordinary membranes are prone to buckle around\ncompressive impurities, we predict that all 2D material freestanding bilayers\nuniversally undergo, even if impurity-free, a spontaneous out-of-plane\nbuckling. The moir\\'e network nodes here play the role of internal impurities,\nthe dislocations that join them giving rise to a stress pattern, purely shear\nin homo-bilayers and mixed compressive/shear in hetero-bilayers. That intrinsic\nstress is, theory and simulations show, generally capable to cause all\nfreestanding 2D bilayers to undergo distortive bucklings with large amplitudes\nand a rich predicted phase transition scenario. Realistic simulations predict\nquantitative parameters expected for these phenomena as expected in\nhetero-bilayers such as graphene/hBN, $\\rm{WS_2/WSe_2}$ hetero-bilayers, and\nfor twisted homo-bilayers such as graphene, hBN, $\\rm{MoS_2}$. Buckling then\nentails a variety of predicted consequences. Mechanically, a critical drop of\nbending stiffness is expected at all buckling transitions. Thermally, the\naverage buckling corrugation decreases with temperature, with\nbuckling-unbuckling phase transitions expected in some cases, and the buckled\nstate often persisting even above room temperature. Buckling will be suppressed\nby deposition on hard attractive substrates, and survive in reduced form on\nsoft ones. Frictional, electronic and other associated phenomena are also\nhighlighted. The universality and richness of these predicted phenomena\nstrongly encourages an experimental search, which is possible but still\nmissing.",

    "abstract": "Renewable energies and their operation are becoming increasingly vital for\nthe stability of electrical power grids since conventional power plants are\nprogressively being displaced, and their contribution to redispatch\ninterventions is thereby diminishing. In order to consider renewable energies\nlike Wind Power (WP) for such interventions as a substitute, day-ahead\nforecasts are necessary to communicate their availability for redispatch\nplanning. In this context, automated and scalable forecasting models are\nrequired for the deployment to thousands of locally-distributed onshore WP\nturbines. Furthermore, the irregular interventions into the WP generation\ncapabilities due to redispatch shutdowns pose challenges in the design and\noperation of WP forecasting models. Since state-of-the-art forecasting methods\nconsider past WP generation values alongside day-ahead weather forecasts,\nredispatch shutdowns may impact the forecast. Therefore, the present paper\nhighlights these challenges and analyzes state-of-the-art forecasting methods\non data sets with both regular and irregular shutdowns. Specifically, we\ncompare the forecasting accuracy of three autoregressive Deep Learning (DL)\nmethods to methods based on WP curve modeling. Interestingly, the latter\nachieve lower forecasting errors, have fewer requirements for data cleaning\nduring modeling and operation while being computationally more efficient,\nsuggesting their advantages in practical applications.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided\nwireless federated learning (FL) system, where an access point (AP) coordinates\nmultiple edge devices to train a machine leaning model without sharing their\nown raw data. During the training process, we exploit the joint channel\nreconfiguration via IRS and resource allocation design to reduce the latency of\na FL task. Particularly, we propose three transmission protocols for assisting\nthe local model uploading from multiple devices to an AP, namely IRS aided time\ndivision multiple access (I-TDMA), IRS aided frequency division multiple access\n(I-FDMA), and IRS aided non-orthogonal multiple access (INOMA), to investigate\nthe impact of IRS on the multiple access for FL. Under the three protocols, we\nminimize the per-round latency subject to a given training loss by jointly\noptimizing the device scheduling, IRS phase-shifts, and\ncommunicationcomputation resource allocation. For the associated problem under\nI-TDMA, an efficient algorithm is proposed to solve it optimally by exploiting\nits intrinsic structure, whereas the highquality solutions of the problems\nunder I-FDMA and I-NOMA are obtained by invoking a successive convex\napproximation (SCA) based approach. Then, we further develop a theoretical\nframework for the performance comparison of the proposed three transmission\nprotocols. Sufficient conditions for ensuring that I-TDMA outperforms I-NOMA\nand those of its opposite are unveiled, which is fundamentally different from\nthat NOMA always outperforms TDMA in the system without IRS.

Previous targeted data selection methods primarily rely on\ninfluence-based greedy heuristics to enhance domain-specific performance. While\neffective on limited, unimodal data (i.e., data following a single pattern),\nthese methods struggle as target data complexity increases. Specifically, in\nmultimodal distributions, these heuristics fail to account for multiple\ninherent patterns, leading to suboptimal data selection. This work identifies\ntwo primary factors contributing to this limitation: (i) the disproportionate\nimpact of dominant feature components in high-dimensional influence estimation,\nand (ii) the restrictive linear additive assumptions inherent in greedy\nselection strategies. To address these challenges, TAROT incorporates whitened\nfeature distance to mitigate dominant feature bias, providing a more reliable\nmeasure of data influence. Building on this, TAROT uses whitened feature\ndistance to quantify and minimize the optimal transport distance between the\nselected data and target domains. Notably, this minimization also facilitates\nthe estimation of optimal selection ratios. We evaluate TAROT across multiple\ntasks, including semantic segmentation, motion prediction, and instruction\ntuning.

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is a widely adopted technique utilized to improve the\nrobustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Employing a fixed data\naugmentation strategy for all training data is a common practice. However, it\nis important to note that there can be variations in factors such as background\nnoise, speech rate, etc. among different samples within a single training\nbatch. By using a fixed augmentation strategy, there is a risk that the model\nmay reach a suboptimal state. In addition to the risks of employing a fixed\naugmentation strategy, the model's capabilities may differ across various\ntraining stages. To address these issues, this paper proposes the method of\nsample-adaptive data augmentation with progressive scheduling(PS-SapAug). The\nproposed method applies dynamic data augmentation in a two-stage training\napproach. It employs hybrid normalization to compute sample-specific\naugmentation parameters based on each sample's loss.

Our analysis suggests that it is possible to set constraints on\nthe parameters of the above-mentioned models from the simple requirement of the\nexistence of a smooth transition from the initial singularity to a realistic\nlow-energy regime. Initially, anisotropic space naturally evolves into a\nconfiguration with two isotropic subspaces, and if one of these subspaces is\nthree-dimensional and is expanding while another is contracting, we call it\nrealistic compactification. Of course, the process is not devoid of obstacles,\nand in our paper, we review the results of the compactification occurrence\ninvestigation for the above-mentioned models.

In the classical\nnon-functional realm, structural equations are based on a transfer matrix $B$.\nIn section~\\ref{sec:sfr}, we generalize this to consider a linear operator\n$\\mathcal{T}$ on square integrable processes that plays the the part of $B$. By\nrequiring that $(I-\\mathcal{T})^{-1}$ is bounded -- as opposed to $\\mathcal{T}$\n-- this will allow for a large class of unbounded operators to be considered.\nSection~\\ref{sec:worstrisk} considers two separate cases that both lead to the\nsame worst-risk decomposition.

However,\nthe premises on which the argument is based are falsifiable by Bell\nexperiments. In this paper, we examine the EPR paradox from the perspective of\nSchrodinger's reply to EPR. Schrodinger pointed out that the correlated states\nof the paradox enable the simultaneous measurement of $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{p}$,\none by direct, the other by indirect measurement. Schrodinger's analysis takes\non a timely importance because a recent experiment realizes these correlations\nfor macroscopic atomic systems. Different to the original argument,\nSchrodinger's analysis applies to the experiment at the time when the\nmeasurement settings have been fixed. In this context, a subset of local\nrealistic assumptions (not negated by Bell's theorem) implies that $x$ and $p$\nare simultaneously precisely defined. Hence, an alternative EPR argument can be\npresented that quantum mechanics is incomplete, based on a set of (arguably)\nnonfalsifiable premises. As systems are amplified, macroscopic realism can be\ninvoked, and the premises are referred to as weak macroscopic realism (wMR). In\nthis paper, we propose a realization of Schrodinger's gedanken experiment where\nfield quadrature phase amplitudes $\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}$ replace position and\nmomentum. Assuming wMR, we derive a criterion for the incompleteness of quantum\nmechanics, showing that the criterion is feasible for current experiments.\nQuestions raised by Schrodinger are resolved. By performing simulations based\non an objective-field ($Q$-based) model for quantum mechanics, we illustrate\nthe emergence on amplification of simultaneous predetermined values for\n$\\hat{X}$ and $\\hat{P}$. The values can be regarded as weak elements of\nreality, along the lines of Bell's macroscopic beables.",

Almost all existing 3D attackers simply follow the\nwhite-box or black-box setting to iteratively update coordinate perturbations\nbased on back-propagated or estimated gradients. However, these methods are\nhard to deploy in real-world scenarios (no model details are provided) as they\nseverely rely on parameters or output logits of victim models. To this end, we\npropose point cloud attacks from a more practical setting, i.e., hard-label\nblack-box attack, in which attackers can only access the prediction label of 3D\ninput. We introduce a novel 3D attack method based on a new spectrum-aware\ndecision boundary algorithm to generate high-quality adversarial samples. In\nparticular, we first construct a class-aware model decision boundary, by\ndeveloping a learnable spectrum-fusion strategy to adaptively fuse point clouds\nof different classes in the spectral domain, aiming to craft their intermediate\nsamples without distorting the original geometry. Then, we devise an iterative\ncoordinate-spectrum optimization method with curvature-aware boundary search to\nmove the intermediate sample along the decision boundary for generating\nadversarial point clouds with trivial perturbations. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our attack competitively outperforms existing white/black-box attackers in\nterms of attack performance and adversary quality.",

To address these\nlimitations, DreamDance enriches 3D geometry cues from 2D poses by introducing\nan efficient diffusion model, enabling high-quality human image animation with\nvarious guidance. Our key insight is that human images naturally exhibit\nmultiple levels of correlation, progressing from coarse skeleton poses to\nfine-grained geometry cues, and further from these geometry cues to explicit\nappearance details. Capturing such correlations could enrich the guidance\nsignals, facilitating intra-frame coherency and inter-frame consistency.\nSpecifically, we construct the TikTok-Dance5K dataset, comprising 5K\nhigh-quality dance videos with detailed frame annotations, including human\npose, depth, and normal maps. Next, we introduce a Mutually Aligned Geometry\nDiffusion Model to generate fine-grained depth and normal maps for enriched\nguidance.

Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned effectively to new systems to\nincrease performance even further. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of\nfoundation models for dynamical systems that outperform specialist models in\nterms of generalization, data efficiency, and robustness.",

Object-Centric\nEvent Data (OCED) enhances process mining by capturing interactions among\nmultiple objects within events, leading to the discovery of more detailed and\nrealistic yet complex process models. The lack of methods to adjust the\ngranularity of the analysis limits users to leverage the full potential of\nObject-Centric Process Mining (OCPM). To address this gap, we propose four\noperations: drill-down, roll-up, unfold, and fold, which enable changing the\ngranularity of analysis when working with Object-Centric Event Logs (OCEL).\nThese operations allow analysts to seamlessly transition between detailed and\naggregated process models, facilitating the discovery of insights that require\nvarying levels of abstraction. We formally define these operations and\nimplement them in an open-source Python library. To validate their utility, we\napplied the approach to real-world OCEL data extracted from a learning\nmanagement system that covered a four-year period and approximately 400\nstudents. Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in precision and\nfitness metrics for models discovered before and after applying these\noperations.

    "abstract": "Identifying Galactic PeVatrons (PeV particle accelerators) from the\nultra-high-energy (UHE, >100 TeV) $\\gamma$-ray sources plays a crucial role in\nrevealing the origin of Galactic cosmic rays. The UHE source 1LHAASO\nJ1857+0203u is suggested to be associated with HESS J1858+020, which may be\nattributed to the possible PeVatron candidate supernova remnant (SNR)\nG35.6$-$0.4 or HII region G35.6$-$0.5. We perform detailed analysis on the\nvery-high-energy and UHE $\\gamma$-ray emissions towards this region with data\nfrom the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). 1LHAASO\nJ1857+0203u is detected with a significance of 11.6$\\sigma$ above 100 TeV,\nindicating the presence of a PeVatron. It has an extension of $\\sim 0.18^\\circ$\nwith a power-law (PL) spectral index of $\\sim$2.5 in 1-25 TeV and a point-like\nemission with a PL spectral index of $\\sim$3.2 above 25 TeV. Using the archival\nCO and HI data, we identify some molecular and atomic clouds that may be\nassociated with the TeV $\\gamma$-ray emissions. Our modelling indicates that\nthe TeV $\\gamma$-ray emissions are unlikely to arise from the clouds\nilluminated by the protons that escaped from SNR G35.6$-$0.4. In the scenario\nthat HII region G35.6$-$0.5 could accelerate particles to the UHE band, the\nobserved GeV-TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission could be well explained by a hadronic\nmodel with a PL spectral index of $\\sim$2.0 and cutoff energy of $\\sim$450 TeV.\nHowever, an evolved pulsar wind nebula origin cannot be ruled out.",

    "abstract": "In the application of brain-computer interface (BCI), being able to\naccurately decode brain signals is a critical task. For the multi-class\nclassification task of brain signal ECoG, how to improve the classification\naccuracy is one of the current research hotspots. ECoG acquisition uses a\nhigh-density electrode array and a high sampling frequency, which makes ECoG\ndata have a certain high similarity and data redundancy in the temporal domain,\nand also unique spatial pattern in spatial domain. How to effectively extract\nfeatures is both exciting and challenging. Previous work found that\nvisual-related ECoG can carry visual information via frequency and spatial\ndomain. Based on this finding, we focused on using deep learning to design\nfrequency and spatial feature extraction modules, and proposed a Bi-Band\nECoGNet model based on deep learning. The main contributions of this paper are:\n1) The Bi-BCWT (Bi-Band Channel-Wise Transform) neural network module is\ndesigned to replace the time-consume method MST, this module greatly improves\nthe model calculation and data storage efficiency, and effectively increases\nthe training speed; 2) The Bi-BCWT module can effectively take into account the\ninformation both in low-frequency and high-frequency domain, which is more\nconducive to ECoG multi-classification tasks; 3) ECoG is acquired using 2D\nelectrode array, the newly designed 2D Spatial-Temporal feature encoder can\nextract the 2D spatial feature better. Experiments have shown that the unique\n2D spatial data structure can effectively improve classification accuracy; 3)\nCompared with previous work, the Bi-Band ECoGNet model is smaller and has\nhigher performance, with an accuracy increase of 1.24%, and the model training\nspeed is increased by 6 times, which is more suitable for BCI applications.",

Based on the\nO-C analysis for 26 EBs with sufficient eclipsing times, we found a long-term\ndecrease in the orbital period of 11 EBs and a continuous increase of 5 EBs,\nwhich are due to the material transfer between the two components.

The problem presents unique challenges to modern Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN) techniques due to low image quality arising from noise, textures,\nand viewpoint variations. Tackling such challenges would necessitate precise\nlocalization performance by the DNN to identify the discerning features for the\ndownstream malignancy prediction. While several techniques have been proposed\nin the recent years for the problem, all of these methods employ complex custom\narchitectures. Inspired by the success of foundational models for natural image\ntasks, along with the use of adapters to fine-tune such models for the custom\ntasks, we investigate the merit of one such design, ViT-Adapter, for the GBC\ndetection problem. We observe that ViT-Adapter relies predominantly on a\nprimitive CNN-based spatial prior module to inject the localization information\nvia cross-attention, which is inefficient for our problem due to the small\npathology sizes, and variability in their appearances due to non-regular\nstructure of the malignancy. In response, we propose, LQ-Adapter, a modified\nAdapter design for ViT, which improves localization information by leveraging\nlearnable content queries over the basic spatial prior module. Our method\nsurpasses existing approaches, enhancing the mean IoU (mIoU) scores by 5.4%,\n5.8%, and 2.7% over ViT-Adapters, DINO, and FocalNet-DINO, respectively on the\nUS image-based GBC detection dataset, and establishing a new state-of-the-art\n(SOTA). Additionally, we validate the applicability and effectiveness of\nLQ-Adapter on the Kvasir-Seg dataset for polyp detection from colonoscopy\nimages. Superior performance of our design on this problem as well showcases\nits capability to handle diverse medical imaging tasks across different\ndatasets.

From 28 years of Wind observations at\n1 AU, we derive the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\\mathrm{He}$),\nAlfv\\'enicity ($\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$), and solar wind speed\n($v_\\mathrm{sw}$). Characterizing vsw as a function of $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$\nand $A_\\mathrm{He}$, we show that the maximum solar wind speed for plasma\naccelerated in source regions that are intermittently open is faster than the\nminimum solar wind speed for plasma accelerated in continuously open regions.\nWe infer that the Alfv\\'enic slow wind is likely solar wind originating from\nopen-field regions with speeds below the maximum solar wind speed for plasma\nfrom intermittently open regions. We then discuss possible implications for\nsolar wind acceleration. Finally, we utilize the combination of helium\nabundance and normalized cross helicity to present a novel solar wind\ncategorization scheme that illustrates the transition in observations of solar\nwind at 1 AU from magnetically closed to magnetically open sources.",

    "abstract": "It is widely agreed that open-vocabulary-based approaches outperform\nclassical closed-set training solutions for recognizing unseen objects in\nimages for semantic segmentation. Existing open-vocabulary approaches leverage\nvision-language models, such as CLIP, to align visual features with rich\nsemantic features acquired through pre-training on large-scale vision-language\ndatasets. However, the text prompts employed in these methods are short phrases\nbased on fixed templates, failing to capture comprehensive object attributes.\nMoreover, while the CLIP model excels at exploiting image-level features, it is\nless effective at pixel-level representation, which is crucial for semantic\nsegmentation tasks. In this work, we propose to alleviate the above-mentioned\nissues by leveraging multiple large-scale models to enhance the alignment\nbetween fine-grained visual features and enriched linguistic features.\nSpecifically, our method employs large language models (LLMs) to generate\nenriched language prompts with diverse visual attributes for each category,\nincluding color, shape/size, and texture/material. Additionally, for enhanced\nvisual feature extraction, the SAM model is adopted as a supplement to the CLIP\nvisual encoder through a proposed learnable weighted fusion strategy. Built\nupon these techniques, our method, termed LMSeg, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across all major open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. The code\nwill be made available soon.",

Non-parametric system identification (SI) methods, which do not\nrequire prior knowledge of the target ship, have the potential to produce\naccurate maneuvering models using observed data. However, the modeling accuracy\nsignificantly depends on the distribution of the available data. To address\nthese issues, we propose a probabilistic prediction method of maneuvering\nmotion that incorporates ensemble learning into a non-parametric SI using\nfeedforward neural networks. This approach captures the epistemic uncertainty\ncaused by insufficient or unevenly distributed data. In this paper, we show the\nprediction accuracy and uncertainty prediction results for various unknown\nscenarios, including port navigation, zigzag, turning, and random control\nmaneuvers, assuming that only port navigation data is available. Furthermore,\nthis paper demonstrates the utility of the proposed method as a maneuvering\nsimulator for assessing heading-keeping PD control. As a result, it was\nconfirmed that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy if training data\nwith similar state distributions is provided, and that it can also predict high\nuncertainty for states that deviate from the training data distribution. In the\nperformance evaluation of PD control, it was confirmed that considering\nworst-case scenarios reduces the possibility of overestimating performance\ncompared to the true system.

In this paper, we investigate the relation between\nthe internal structure of massive elliptical galaxies and their environment\nusing a sample of 15 strong lensing systems. We performed lens modeling for\nthem using Lenstronomy and constrained the mass and light distributions of the\ndeflector galaxies. We adopt the local galaxy density as a metric for the\nenvironment and test our results against several alternative definitions of it.\nWe robustly find that the centroid offset between the mass and light is not\ncorrelated with the local galaxy density. This result supports using centroid\noffsets as a probe of dark matter theories since the environment's impact on it\ncan be treated as negligible. Although we find a moderate to strong correlation\nbetween the position angle offset and the standard definition of the local\ngalaxy density, consistent with previous studies, the correlation becomes\nweaker for alternative definitions of the local galaxy density. This result\nweakens the support for interpreting the position angle misalignment as having\noriginated from interaction with the environment. Furthermore, we find the\n'residual shear' magnitude in the lens model to be uncorrelated with the local\ngalaxy density, supporting the interpretation of the residual shear\noriginating, in part, from the inadequacy in modeling the angular structure of\nthe lensing galaxy and not solely from the structures present in the\nenvironment or along the line of sight.",

If there are n agents competing for the\navailable resources, then proportionality requires that each agent receives at\nleast a 1/n fraction of their total value for the set of resources. On the\nother hand, envy-freeness requires that each agent weakly prefers the resources\nallocated to them over those allocated to any other agent. Each of these\nnotions has its own benefits, but it is well known that neither one of the two\nis always achievable when the resources being allocated are indivisible. As a\nresult, a lot of work has focused on satisfying fairness notions that relax\neither proportionality or envy-freeness. In this paper, we focus on MXS (a\nrelaxation of proportionality) and EFL (a relaxation of envy-freeness). Each of\nthese notions was previously shown to be achievable on its own [Barman et\nal.,2018, Caragiannis et al., 2023], and our main result is an algorithm that\ncomputes allocations that simultaneously satisfy both, combining the benefits\nof approximate proportionality and approximate envy-freeness. In fact, we prove\nthis for any instance involving agents with valuation functions that are\nrestricted MMS-feasible, which are more general than additive valuations. Also,\nsince every EFL allocation directly satisfies other well-studied fairness\nnotions like EF1, 1/2-EFX, 1/2-GMMS, and 2/3-PMMS, and every MXS allocation\nsatisfies 4/7-MMS, the allocations returned by our algorithm simultaneously\nsatisfy a wide variety of fairness notions and are, therefore, universally fair\n[Amanatidis et al., 2020].",

In this paper, we propose a simple yet\neffective UNet-based MTL model, where features extracted by the encoder are\nused to predict classification labels, while the decoder produces the\nsegmentation mask.

This design\ncaptures broader contextual relationships and fine-grained details, improving\nclassification and segmentation accuracy. To enhance classification\nperformance, multi-scale features from different encoder levels are combined to\nleverage the hierarchical representation of the input image. For segmentation,\nthe features passed to the decoder via skip connections are refined using a\nnovel dilated feature enhancement (DFE) module, which captures information at\ndifferent scales through three parallel convolution branches with varying\ndilation rates.

    "abstract": "Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) are significant Combinatorial Optimization\n(CO) problems holding substantial practical importance. Recently, Neural\nCombinatorial Optimization (NCO), which involves training deep learning models\non extensive data to learn vehicle routing heuristics, has emerged as a\npromising approach due to its efficiency and the reduced need for manual\nalgorithm design. However, applying NCO across diverse real-world scenarios\nwith various constraints necessitates cross-problem capabilities. Current NCO\nmethods typically employ a unified model lacking a constraint-specific\nstructure, thereby restricting their cross-problem performance. Current\nmulti-task methods for VRPs typically employ a constraint-unaware model,\nlimiting their cross-problem performance. Furthermore, they rely solely on\nglobal connectivity, which fails to focus on key nodes and leads to inefficient\nrepresentation learning. This paper introduces a Constraint-Aware\nDual-Attention Model (CaDA), designed to address these limitations. CaDA\nincorporates a constraint prompt that efficiently represents different problem\nvariants. Additionally, it features a dual-attention mechanism with a global\nbranch for capturing broader graph-wide information and a sparse branch that\nselectively focuses on the most relevant nodes. We comprehensively evaluate our\nmodel on 16 different VRPs and compare its performance against existing\ncross-problem VRP solvers. CaDA achieves state-of-the-art results across all\nthe VRPs. Our ablation study further confirms that each component of CaDA\ncontributes positively to its cross-problem learning performance.",

Notably, the reported Fermi level of 0.9 eV above the valence\nband maximum (VBM) actually suggests that the material is an insulator,\ncontradicting the high hole density obtained by Hall effect measurement.\nFurthermore, the detected residual Se and the possible reduced elemental Te in\nthe 2D beta-TeO2 samples introduces complexity, considering that elemental Se,\nTe, and Te1-xSex themselves are high-mobility p-type semiconductor.

In general, we patchify images and randomly mask a\nportion of the patches, observing that excluding them from training has minimal\nimpact on performance while substantially reducing computation costs and\nenhancing data content privacy protection. Specifically, EFTViT comprises a\nseries of lightweight local modules and a larger global module, updated\nindependently on clients and the central server, respectively. The local\nmodules are trained on masked image patches, while the global module is trained\non intermediate patch features uploaded from the local client, balanced through\na proposed median sampling strategy to erase client data distribution privacy.\nWe analyze the computational complexity and privacy protection of EFTViT.\nExtensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that EFTViT achieves up to\n28.17% accuracy improvement, reduces local training computational cost by up to\n2.8$\\times$, and cuts local training time by up to 4.4$\\times$ compared to\nexisting methods.",

When there exist\nmultiple marked items, Grover's algorithm has the property of finding one of\nthem uniformly at random. To further broaden the application range, it was\ngeneralized so that it finds marked items with probabilities according to their\npriority by encoding the priority into amplitudes applied by Grover's oracle\noperator. In this paper, to achieve a similar generalization, we examine a\ndifferent encoding that incorporates the priority into phases applied by the\noracle operator. We compare the previous and our oracle operators and observe\nthat which one performs better depends on priority parameters. Since the\npriority parameters can be considered as the magnitude of the correlated phase\nerror on Grover's oracle operator, the analysis of our oracle operator also\nreveals the robustness of the original Grover's algorithm against correlated\nnoises.

The\namplitudes of three systems' light curves are more than 0.7 magnitude. We\nanalyzed the light curves using Wilson-Devinney code to yield physical\nparameters. The photometric solutions suggested that NSVS 7377875 belongs to an\nA-subtype contact binary, while the others are classified as W-subtype ones.\nFurthermore, the mass ratio of NSVS 7377875 is higher than 0.72, so it belongs\nto H-subtype contact binaries. Since their light curves have unequal height at\ntwo maxima which is called O'Connell effect, a dark spot on the primary\ncomponent for each target was required to get a better fit of light curves. The\norbital period investigation shows that the period of NSVS 2418361 is\nincreasing, indicating a mass transfer from the less massive component to the\nmore massive one, while the other targets exhibit no long-term variation. Our\nspectral subtraction analysis of LAMOST spectra revealed excess emissions in\nthe $H_\\alpha$ line, indicating chromospheric activity in all the three\ntargets. The Gaia distance was applied to estimate the absolute parameters of\nthe three targets, and we obtained their evolutionary state.

    "abstract": "In full-scale forced vibration tests, the demand often arises to capture\nhigh-spatial-resolution mode shapes with limited number of sensors and shakers.\nMulti-setup experimental modal analysis (EMA) addresses this challenge by\nroving sensors and shakers across multiple setups. To enable fast and accurate\nmulti-setup EMA, this paper develops a Bayesian modal identification strategy\nby extending an existing single-setup algorithm. Specifically, a\nfrequency-domain probabilistic model is first formulated using multiple sets of\nstructural multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) vibration data. A constrained\nLaplace method is then employed for Bayesian posterior approximation, providing\nthe maximum a posteriori estimates of modal parameters along with a posterior\ncovariance matrix (PCM) for uncertainty quantification. Utilizing complex\nmatrix calculus, analytical expressions are derived for parameter updates in\nthe coordinate descent optimization, as well as for PCM computation, enhancing\nboth coding simplicity and computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm is\nintensively validated by investigating empirical examples with synthetic and\nfield data. It demonstrates that the proposed method yields highly consistent\nresults compared to scenarios with adequate test equipment. The resulting\nhigh-fidelity MIMO model enables structural response prediction under future\nloading conditions and supports condition assessment.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have shown the potential to\nimprove signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) related coverage,\nespecially at high-frequency communications. However, assessing electromagnetic\nfiled exposure (EMFE) and establishing EMFE regulations in RIS-assisted\nlarge-scale networks are still open issues. This paper proposes a framework to\ncharacterize SINR and EMFE in such networks for downlink and uplink scenarios.\nParticularly, we carefully consider the association rule with the presence of\nRISs, accurate antenna pattern at base stations (BSs), fading model, and power\ncontrol mechanism at mobile devices in the system model. Under the proposed\nframework, we derive the marginal and joint distributions of SINR and EMFE in\ndownlink and uplink, respectively. The first moment of EMFE is also provided.\nAdditionally, we design the compliance distance (CD) between a BS/RIS and a\nuser to comply with the EMFE regulations. To facilitate efficient\nidentification, we further provide approximate closed-form expressions for CDs.\nFrom numerical results of the marginal distributions, we find that in the\ndownlink scenario, deploying RISs may not always be beneficial, as the improved\nSINR comes at the cost of increased EMFE. However, in the uplink scenario, RIS\ndeployment is promising to enhance coverage while still maintaining EMFE\ncompliance. By simultaneously evaluating coverage and compliance metrics\nthrough joint distributions, we demonstrate the feasibility of RISs in\nimproving uplink and downlink performance. Insights from this framework can\ncontribute to establishing EMFE guidelines and achieving a balance between\ncoverage and compliance when deploying RISs.",

Can we provide an\nobjective account of why experience, confined to the short window of the\nconscious present, encompasses a succession of moments that slip away from now\nto then--an account of why time feels flowing? Integrated Information Theory\n(IIT) aims to account for both the presence and quality of consciousness in\nobjective, physical terms. Given a substrate's architecture and current state,\nthe formalism of IIT allows one to unfold the cause-effect power of the\nsubstrate, yielding a cause-effect structure. According to IIT, this accounts\nin full for the presence and quality of experience, without any additional\ningredients. In previous work, we showed how unfolding the cause-effect\nstructure of non-directed grids, like those found in many posterior cortical\nareas, can account for the way space feels--namely, extended. Here we show that\nunfolding the cause-effect structure of directed grids can account for how time\nfeels--namely, flowing. First, we argue that the conscious present is\nexperienced as flowing because it is composed of phenomenal distinctions\n(moments) that are directed, and these distinctions are related in a way that\nsatisfies directed inclusion, connection, and fusion. We then show that\ndirected grids, which we conjecture constitute the substrate of temporal\nexperience, yield a cause-effect structure that accounts for these and other\nproperties of temporal experience. In this account, the experienced present\ndoes not correspond to a process unrolling in \"clock time,\" but to a\ncause-effect structure specified by a system in its current state: time is a\nstructure, not a process.

Currently, there are two main\nforms of evaluating code quality: match-based evaluation and execution-based\nevaluation. The former requires the collection of a large number of test cases,\nmaking a huge cost. The latter relies on superficial code matching as an\nevaluation metric, which fails to accurately capture code semantics. Moreover,\nextensive research has demonstrated that match-based evaluations do not truly\nreflect code quality. With the development of large language models (LLMs) in\nrecent years, studies have proven the feasibility of using LLMs as evaluators\nfor generative tasks. However, due to issues like hallucinations and\nuncertainty in LLMs, their correlation with human judgment remains at a lower\nlevel, making the direct use of LLMs for code quality evaluation challenging.\nTo address these issues, we propose Human-Like Code Quality Evaluation through\nLLM-based Recursive Semantic Comprehension (HuCoSC). We employ a recursive\napproach to enable LLMs to comprehend portions of code semantics independently\neach time, obtaining the code semantics through multiple interactions with\nLLMs. We designed a Semantic Dependency Decoupling Storage to make independent\nanalysis feasible, allowing LLMs to achieve more accurate semantics by breaking\ndown complex problems.

For the VLA bands, we only include the Band Q\ndata in our modeling to avoid free-free emission contamination. The obtained\nopacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\\beta$ (with a value of $\\sim$\n1.2) suggest that the upper limit of maximum grain size in the disk be $\\sim$\n130 $\\mu$m, consistent with that implied in the previous polarization\nobservations in Band 7, supporting the grain growth in this disk. The values of\nthe absorption opacities further highlight the need for a new dust composition\nmodel for Class 0/I disks.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian factor models are widely used for dimensionality reduction and\npattern discovery in high-dimensional datasets across diverse fields. These\nmodels typically focus on imposing priors on factor loading to induce sparsity\nand improve interpretability. However, factor scores, which play a critical\nrole in individual-level associations with factors, have received less\nattention and are assumed to follow a standard normal distribution. This\nassumption oversimplifies the heterogeneity often observed in real-world\napplications. We propose the sparse Bayesian Factor model with MAss-Nonlocal\nfactor scores (BFMAN), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by\nintroducing a mass-nonlocal prior on factor scores. This prior allows for both\nexact zeros and flexible, nonlocal behavior, capturing individual-level\nsparsity and heterogeneity. The sparsity in the score matrix enables a robust\nand novel approach to determine the optimal number of factors. Model parameters\nare estimated via a fast and efficient Gibbs sampler. Extensive simulations\ndemonstrate that BFMAN outperforms standard Bayesian factor models in factor\nrecovery, sparsity detection, score estimation, and selection of the optimal\nnumber of factors. We apply BFMAN to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study\nof Latinos, identifying meaningful dietary patterns and their associations with\ncardiovascular disease, showcasing the model's ability to uncover insights into\ncomplex nutritional data.",

The former incorporates spacetime curvature effects to explore black\nhole dynamics under quantum gravitational corrections, while the latter is a\nview that black holes are Bose-Einstein condensates of weakly interacting\ngravitons. In a particular case, the phenomenological union between the AGEUP\nwith cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ to the corpuscular framework enabled a\nblack hole metric that has a scaled mass, which depends on $\\Lambda$ and the\nPlanck length $l_{\\rm Pl}$. Interesting implications occur, such as the maximum\nlimit for mass $M$ where $\\Lambda$ ceases to influence the black hole. Another\nis the derived value of the modulation factor of the EUP term, $\\alpha$, if the\nlarge-scale fundamental length is defined solely as the cosmological horizon.\nAdditional analyses were done through the shadow and deflection angle\nphenomena, deriving constraints on the quantum gravity modulation parameter\n$\\beta$. Constraints from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry (VLBI) are discussed as avenues for verifying\nAGEUP-related deviations in black hole shadow radius and deflection angles,\noffering potential observational evidence of quantum gravitational effects at\nastrophysical scales. The findings suggest that AGEUP could be instrumental in\nproviding hints on the quantum gravity nature of black holes, particularly in\nhigh-energy astrophysical contexts.

To alleviate this, some recent work has focused on\ndeveloping a collaborative planning system to assist humans in complex domains,\nwith bridging the gap between the system's problem representation and the real\nworld being a key consideration. Transferring the speed and correctness formal\nplanners provide to real-world planning problems is greatly complicated by the\ndynamic and online nature of such tasks. Formal specifications of task and\nenvironment dynamics frequently lack constraints on some behaviors or goal\nconditions relevant to the way a human operator prefers a plan to be carried\nout. While adding constraints to the representation with the objective of\nincreasing its realism risks slowing down the planner, we posit that the same\nbenefits can be realized without sacrificing speed by modeling this problem as\nan online preference learning task. As part of a broader cooperative planning\nsystem, we present a feedback-driven plan critic. This method makes use of\nreinforcement learning with human feedback in conjunction with a genetic\nalgorithm to directly optimize a plan with respect to natural-language user\npreferences despite the non-differentiability of traditional planners. Directly\noptimizing the plan bridges the gap between research into more efficient\nplanners and research into planning with language models by utilizing the\nconvenience of natural language to guide the output of formal planners.

PLCK G073.4-57.5 (G073) is\none of these Planck-selected peaks. ALMA observations of G073 suggest the\npresence of two structures between z=1.5 and 2 aligned along the line of sight,\nbut without spectroscopic confirmation. Characterizing the full redshift\ndistribution of the galaxies within G073 is needed in order to better\nunderstand this representative example of Planck-selected objects, and connect\nthem to the emergence of galaxy clusters. We used ALMA Band 4 spectral scans to\nsearch for CO(3-2), CO(4-3), and CI(1-0) line emission, targeting eight red\nHerschel-SPIRE sources in the field, as well as four bright SCUBA-2 sources. We\nfind 15 emission lines in 13 galaxies, and using existing photometry, we\ndetermined the spectroscopic redshift of all 13 galaxies. Eleven of these\ngalaxies are SPIRE-selected and lie in two structures at <z>=1.53 and <z>=2.31,\nwhile the two SCUBA-2-selected galaxies are at z=2.61. Using multi-wavelength\nphotometry we constrained stellar masses and star formation rates, and using\nthe CO and CI emission lines we constrained gas masses. Our protocluster\ngalaxies exhibit typical gas depletion timescales for field galaxies at the\nsame redshifts but higher gas-to-stellar mass ratios, potentially driven by\nemission line selection effects. The two structures are reproduced in\ncosmological simulations of star-forming halos at high redshifts; the simulated\nhalos have a 60-70% probability of collapsing into galaxy clusters, implying\nthat the two structures in G073 are genuinely protoclusters.",

Such problems are difficult to solve due to: a) sparse\nrewards, meaning a reward signal is available only once all the tasks in a\nmission have been satisfied, and b) the agent having to perform tasks at\nrun-time that are not covered in the training data, e.g., demonstrations only\nfrom an environment where all doors were unlocked. Consequently,\nstate-of-the-art decision-making methods in such settings are limited to\nmissions where the required tasks are well-represented in the training\ndemonstrations and can be solved within a short planning horizon. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose Adaptformer, a stochastic and adaptive planner\nthat utilizes sequence models for sample-efficient exploration and\nexploitation. This framework relies on learning an energy-based heuristic,\nwhich needs to be minimized over a sequence of high-level decisions. To\ngenerate successful action sequences for long-horizon missions, Adaptformer\naims to achieve shorter sub-goals, which are proposed through an intrinsic\nsub-goal curriculum. Through these two key components, Adaptformer allows for\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution tasks and environments, i.e., missions\nthat were not a part of the training data. Empirical results in multiple\nsimulation environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably,\nAdaptformer not only outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to 25% in\nmulti-goal maze reachability tasks but also successfully adapts to multi-task\nmissions that the state-of-the-art method could not complete, leveraging\ndemonstrations from single-goal-reaching tasks.",

Through\nextensive experiments conducted on both publicly available and self-collected\ndatasets comprising 24 sequences, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmapping and navigation methodologies.

    "abstract": "In both 2016 and 2018, a census of the highly-endangered Grevy's zebra\npopulation was enabled by the Great Grevy's Rally (GGR), a citizen science\nevent that produces population estimates via expert and algorithmic curation of\nvolunteer-captured images. A complementary, scalable, and long-term Grevy's\npopulation monitoring approach involves deploying camera trap networks.\nHowever, in both scenarios, a substantial majority of zebra images are not\nusable for individual identification due to poor in-the-wild imaging\nconditions; camera trap images in particular present high rates of occlusion\nand high spatio-temporal similarity within image bursts. Our proposed filtering\npipeline incorporates animal detection, species identification, viewpoint\nestimation, quality evaluation, and temporal subsampling to obtain individual\ncrops suitable for re-ID, which are subsequently curated by the LCA decision\nmanagement algorithm. Our method processed images taken during GGR-16 and\nGGR-18 in Meru County, Kenya, into 4,142 highly-comparable annotations,\nrequiring only 120 contrastive human decisions to produce a population estimate\nwithin 4.6% of the ground-truth count. Our method also efficiently processed\n8.9M unlabeled camera trap images from 70 cameras at the Mpala Research Centre\nin Laikipia County, Kenya over two years into 685 encounters of 173\nindividuals, requiring only 331 contrastive human decisions.",
