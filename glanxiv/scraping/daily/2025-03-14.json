    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of tubular and curvilinear structures, such as blood\nvessels, neurons, and road networks, is crucial in various applications. A key\nchallenge is ensuring topological correctness while maintaining computational\nefficiency. Existing approaches often employ topological loss functions based\non persistent homology, such as Betti error, to enforce structural consistency.\nHowever, these methods suffer from high computational costs and are insensitive\nto pixel-level accuracy, often requiring additional loss terms like Dice or MSE\nto compensate. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{SDF-TopoNet},\nan improved topology-aware segmentation framework that enhances both\nsegmentation accuracy and training efficiency. Our approach introduces a novel\ntwo-stage training strategy. In the pre-training phase, we utilize the signed\ndistance function (SDF) as an auxiliary learning target, allowing the model to\nencode topological information without directly relying on computationally\nexpensive topological loss functions. In the fine-tuning phase, we incorporate\na dynamic adapter alongside a refined topological loss to ensure topological\ncorrectness while mitigating overfitting and computational overhead. We\nevaluate our method on five benchmark datasets. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SDF-TopoNet outperforms existing methods in both topological\naccuracy and quantitative segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing\ntraining complexity.",

    "abstract": "Mitigating reward hacking--where AI systems misbehave due to flaws or\nmisspecifications in their learning objectives--remains a key challenge in\nconstructing capable and aligned models. We show that we can monitor a frontier\nreasoning model, such as OpenAI o3-mini, for reward hacking in agentic coding\nenvironments by using another LLM that observes the model's chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning. CoT monitoring can be far more effective than monitoring agent\nactions and outputs alone, and we further found that a LLM weaker than o3-mini,\nnamely GPT-4o, can effectively monitor a stronger model. Because CoT monitors\ncan be effective at detecting exploits, it is natural to ask whether those\nexploits can be suppressed by incorporating a CoT monitor directly into the\nagent's training objective. While we show that integrating CoT monitors into\nthe reinforcement learning reward can indeed produce more capable and more\naligned agents in the low optimization regime, we find that with too much\noptimization, agents learn obfuscated reward hacking, hiding their intent\nwithin the CoT while still exhibiting a significant rate of reward hacking.\nBecause it is difficult to tell when CoTs have become obfuscated, it may be\nnecessary to pay a monitorability tax by not applying strong optimization\npressures directly to the chain-of-thought, ensuring that CoTs remain\nmonitorable and useful for detecting misaligned behavior.",

The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations,\nand summaries of user preferences.\n  Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of\nconversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both\nrecommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items\nand critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN\n(LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and\nNarratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and\ngeneration.

However, downstream developers - actors who fine-tune or otherwise\nmodify foundational models - can create or amplify risks by improving a model's\ncapabilities or compromising its safety features. This can make rules on\nupstream developers ineffective. One way to address this issue could be to\nimpose direct obligations on downstream developers. However, since downstream\ndevelopers are numerous, diverse, and rapidly growing in number, such direct\nregulation may be both practically challenging and stifling to innovation. A\ndifferent approach would be to require upstream developers to mitigate\ndownstream modification risks (e.g. by restricting what modifications can be\nmade).

The physical process is described\nby an uncertain discrete-time state-space system, where the dependence of the\nstate-space matrix-valued functions defining the system on the uncertainties\ncan be rational. The proposed approaches make use of pointwise integral\nquadratic constraints (IQCs) to characterize the uncertainties affecting the\nbehavior of the system. Various uncertainties can be characterized by pointwise\nIQCs, including static linear time-varying perturbations and sector-bounded\nnonlinearities. Using the IQC framework, a sound overapproximation of the\nuncertain system, which is expressible at the code level, is constructed. Tools\nsuch as Frama-C, ACSL, WP, and an Alt-Ergo plugin are employed to ensure the\nvalidity of the state and output invariant properties across both real and\nfloat models. The first proposed approach can be used to formally verify\n(local) invariant properties of the control code. This capability is\ndemonstrated in a couple of examples involving gain-scheduled path-following\ncontrollers designed for an uncrewed aircraft system and an autonomous\nunderwater vehicle. The second approach enables the verification of closed-loop\ninvariant properties, i.e., invariant properties of the controlled system as a\nwhole, in both real and float models, while preserving the integrity of the\nexecutable controller code. This is achieved by using ghost code attached to\nthe control code for all elements related to the plant model with\nuncertainties, as the ghost code does not interfere with the executable code.\nThe effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in two examples on the\ncontrol of a four-thruster hovercraft and the control of a two-mass rotational\nsystem.",

This paper adds an additional perspective.\nThrough a case study, we demonstrate that the impact of genAI on students' idea\ndevelopment depends not only on the AI but also on the students and, crucially,\ntheir interactions in between. Students who proactively explored ideas gained\nnew ideas from writing, regardless of whether they used auto-complete or\nSocratic AI assistants. Those who engaged in prolonged, mindless copyediting\ndeveloped few ideas even with a Socratic AI. These findings suggest\nopportunities in designing AI writing assistants, not merely by creating more\nthought-provoking AI, but also by fostering more thought-provoking writer-AI\ninteractions.",

However, this does not reflect the complexities of real-world\ntasks where curvatures can vary arbitrarily, limiting its applications. This\nstudy aims to address this gap by introducing the total curvature parameter K\ninto the equation to account for the overall curviness characteristic of a\npath. To validate this extension, we conducted a mouse-steering experiment on\nfixed-width paths with varying lengths and curviness levels.

In this architecture, it becomes very\ncrucial that a classical/semi-classical client is able to keep the delegated\ndata/ computation secure against eavesdroppers as well as the server itself,\nknown as the blindness feature. In 2009, A. Broadbent et. al proposed a\nuniversal blind quantum computation (UBQC) protocol based on measurement-based\nquantum computation (MBQC) that enables a semi-classical client to delegate\nuniversal quantum computation to a quantum server, interactively and fetch the\nresults while the computation itself remains blind to the server. In this work,\nwe propose an implementation (with examples) of UBQC in the current quantum\ncomputing architecture, a fully classical client, a quantum server (IBM\nQuantum) and the computation does not proceed interactively (projective\nmeasurement basis is not decided by previous measurement outcome). We combined\nUBQC with the 8-state remote state preparation (RSP) protocol, to blindly\nprepare the initial cluster state, which is an initial resource state in UBQC\nprotocol, to allow a completely classical client to perform delegated blind\nquantum computation. Such an implementation has already been shown to be secure\nin a game-based security setting, which is the weakest security model.",

This paper demonstrates how LLMs, when augmented with\npredefined functions and specialized tools, can serve as dynamic agents capable\nof streamlining tasks such as data collection, preprocessing, and analysis.\nCentral to this approach is agentic retrieval-augmented generation (Agentic\nRAG), which equips LLMs with action-calling capabilities for interaction with\nexternal knowledge bases. Beyond information retrieval, LLM agents may\nincorporate modular tools for tasks like document summarization, transcript\ncoding, qualitative variable classification, and statistical modeling. To\ndemonstrate the potential of this approach, we introduce CongressRA, an LLM\nagent designed to support scholars studying the U.S. Congress.

    "abstract": "Simulating the long-term dynamics of multi-scale and multi-physics systems\nposes a significant challenge in understanding complex phenomena across science\nand engineering. The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between\nscales and the interplay of diverse physical processes. Neural operators have\nemerged as promising models for predicting such dynamics due to their\nflexibility and computational efficiency. However, they often fail to\neffectively capture multi-scale interactions or quantify the uncertainties\ninherent in the predictions. These limitations lead to rapid error\naccumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by\ncomplex and coupled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a\nspatio-temporal Fourier transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is\ndesigned to learn dynamics at a specific scale. By leveraging a structured\nhierarchy of StFT blocks, the model explicitly captures dynamics across both\nmacro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction\nmechanism is integrated to estimate and mitigate predictive uncertainties,\nenhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term forecasts. Evaluations\nconducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics)\ndemonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.",

Traditional image style transfer\n(STx) methods primarily focus on artistic and photorealistic blending, often\nfailing to preserve object and scene geometry in images captured in\nhigh-scattering mediums such as underwater. The wavelength-dependent nonlinear\nattenuation and depth-dependent backscattering artifacts further complicate\nlearning underwater image STx from unpaired data. This paper introduces UStyle,\nthe first data-driven learning framework for transferring waterbody styles\nacross underwater images without requiring prior reference images or scene\ninformation. We propose a novel depth-aware whitening and coloring transform\n(DA-WCT) mechanism that integrates physics-based waterbody synthesis to ensure\nperceptually consistent stylization while preserving scene structure.

Extending the shell model's applicability,\nparticularly toward dripline nuclei, requires efficient fitting methods and\ncredible uncertainty quantification. Traditional approaches face computational\nchallenges and may underestimate uncertainties.\n  Purpose: We develop and test a framework combining eigenvector continuation\nand Markov chain Monte Carlo to efficiently fit shell model interaction matrix\nelements and quantify their uncertainties.\n  Methods: Eigenvector continuation is used to emulate shell model\ncalculations, reducing computational costs. The emulator enables Markov chain\nMonte Carlo sampling to optimize interaction matrix elements and rigorously\nassess parametric uncertainties. The framework is benchmarked using the USDB\ninteraction in the sd shell.\n  Results: The emulator reproduces the USDB interaction with negligible error,\nvalidating its use in shell model fitting applications.

We\nalso report a modified variant of auxiliary structured grid method to locate\nhosting cells, which in conjunction with a boundary condition scheme enables\nthe capture of interactions between particle and solid objects. As a\nproof-of-concept, we numerically and experimentally study the motion of\nparticles within a microfluidic deterministic lateral displacement device.

Additionally, modern cameras can capture images in an HDR\nformat but convert them to SDR to ensure maximum compatibility with existing\nworkflows and legacy displays. To support both SDR and HDR, new encoding\nformats are emerging that store additional metadata in SDR images in the form\nof a gain map. When applied to the SDR image, the gain map recovers the HDR\nversion of the image as needed. These gain maps, however, are typically\ndown-sampled and encoded using standard image compression, such as JPEG and\nHEIC, which can result in unwanted artifacts. In this paper, we propose to use\na lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to encode the gain map. The\nMLP is optimized using the SDR image information as input and provides superior\nperformance in terms of HDR reconstruction. Moreover, the MLP-based approach\nuses a fixed memory footprint (10 KB) and requires no additional adjustments to\naccommodate different image sizes or encoding parameters.

In particular, the classical gravity field must\nreceive input regarding matter distribution. Previously, such input has been\nconstructed by taking expectation values of the matter density operator or by\nusing the outcomes of all measurements being performed on the quantum system.\nWe propose a framework that unifies these models, and argue that the Causal\nConditional Formulation of Schroedinger-Newton (CCSN) theory, which takes\nclassical inputs only from experimental and environmental channels, is a\nminimum model within this framework. Since CCSN can be viewed as a quantum\nfeedback control scheme, it can be made causal and free from pathologies that\npreviously plagued SN theories. Since classical information from measurement\nresults are used to generate classical gravity, CCSN can mimic quantum gravity\nbetter than one would naively expect for a classical theory. We predict\nexperimental signatures of CCSN in two concrete scenarios: (i) a single test\nmass and (ii) two objects interacting via mutual gravity. In case (i), we show\nthat the mass-concentration effect of self classical gravity still makes CCSN\nmuch easier to test than testing the mutual entanglement, yet the signatures\nare more subtle than previously thought for classical gravity theories. Using\ntime-delayed and non-stationary measurements, which delay or suspend the flow\nof classical information into classical gravity, one can make CCSN more\ndetectable. In case (ii), we show that mutual gravity generated by CCSN can\nlead to correlations that largely mimic signatures of quantum entanglement.\nRigorous protocols that rule out LOCC channels, which are experimentally more\nchallenging than simply testing entanglement, must be applied to completely\nrule out CCSN.",

On the other hand, the effective temperature (Teff) is a fundamental\nstellar parameter, critical for determining stellar properties such as mass,\nage, composition and evolutionary status.

In the core accretion model, planetesimals serve as the building blocks\nof planets, meaning that planetesimal formation is a prerequisite for planet\nformation. In a non-structured disk, planetesimal formation typically requires\nnear-solar metallicities according to our current understanding. However,\nmechanisms that concentrate solid material can significantly lower this\nmetallicity threshold. Here, we explore whether vortices can facilitate the\nformation of the first planets and planetesimals at cosmic dawn. Vortices are\nprime sites for planetesimal formation due to their ability to efficiently trap\nand concentrate dust. We conduct simulations spanning a range of metallicities,\nand identify a metallicity threshold at Z >=~ 0.04 Zsun for planetesimal\nformation. If these planetesimals remain inside the vortex long enough to\naccrete the remaining trapped solids, Mercury-mass planets can form.

We also find a mean\nmagnetic field at birth ($\\mu_b$ is in T) $\\log\\left(\\mu_b\\right) =\n10.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$, a magnetic field decay slope $\\alpha_d = 1.9\n^{+0.9}_{-1.3}$, and timescale $\\tau_d = 17.9^{+24.1}_{-14.5}$ kyr, in broad\nagreement with previous estimates. We conclude this study by exploring\ndetection prospects: an all-sky survey with XMM-Newton would potentially allow\nto get around 7 periodic detections of magnetars, with approximately 150\nmagnetars exceeding XMM-Newton's flux threshold, and the upcoming AXIS\nexperiment should allow to double these detections.",

They\nhave found widespread application in the modeling of the uniaxial orientational\nordering of liquid crystals. However, only very limited progress has been made\nin applying them to the more complex cases of biaxial phases and biaxial\nparticles. Here, we discuss the microscopic derivation of PFC models for\nbiaxial liquid crystals. We illustrate it by presenting two models, one\ninvolving four scalar orientational order parameters relevant for the dynamics\nof biaxial particles, and one involving two scalar order parameters and a\ndirector field to describe biaxial phases in a three-dimensional uniaxial\nnematic liquid crystal. These models allow for an efficient simulation of\nspatially inhomogeneous biaxial orientational ordering dynamics. We also\ncombine a microscopic and macroscopic approach to extract model coefficients\nfor a full biaxial model from the microscopic derivation for a simple special\ncase. This universal method also enables to perform derivations for other\nlow-symmetry particles where, due to the complexity of the general case, this\nhas not been previously attempted.",

Besides the\noriginal parameter sets, some specifically reparametrized SQC methods (denoted\nas AM1-W, PM6-fm, and DFTB2-iBi) targeting various smaller water systems\nranging from molecular clusters to bulk are considered as well. The quality of\nthese different SQC methods for describing liquid water properties at ambient\nconditions are assessed by comparison to well-established experimental data and\nalso to BLYP-D3 density functional theory-based ab initio MD simulations. Our\nanalyses reveal that static and dynamics properties of bulk water are poorly\ndescribed by all considered SQC methods with the original parameters,\nregardless of the underlying theoretical models, with most of the methods\nsuffering from too weak hydrogen bonds and hence predicting a far too fluid\nwater with highly distorted hydrogen bond kinetics.

While deep learning methods show promising results,\nthey typically process WSIs by dividing them into artificial patches, which\ninherently prevents a network from learning from the entire image context,\ndisregards natural tissue structures and compromises interpretability. Our\nmethod overcomes this limitation through a novel graph-based framework that\nconstructs WSI graph representations.

    "abstract": "Long COVID continues to challenge public health by affecting a considerable\nnumber of individuals who have recovered from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection yet\nendure prolonged and often debilitating symptoms. Social media has emerged as a\nvital resource for those seeking real-time information, peer support, and\nvalidating their health concerns related to Long COVID. This paper examines\nrecent works focusing on mining, analyzing, and interpreting user-generated\ncontent on social media platforms to capture the broader discourse on\npersistent post-COVID conditions. A novel transformer-based zero-shot learning\napproach serves as the foundation for classifying research papers in this area\ninto four primary categories: Clinical or Symptom Characterization, Advanced\nNLP or Computational Methods, Policy Advocacy or Public Health Communication,\nand Online Communities and Social Support. This methodology achieved an average\nconfidence of 0.7788, with the minimum and maximum confidence being 0.1566 and\n0.9928, respectively. This model showcases the ability of advanced language\nmodels to categorize research papers without any training data or predefined\nclassification labels, thus enabling a more rapid and scalable assessment of\nexisting literature. This paper also highlights the multifaceted nature of Long\nCOVID research by demonstrating how advanced computational techniques applied\nto social media conversations can reveal deeper insights into the experiences,\nsymptoms, and narratives of individuals affected by Long COVID.",

The shear strain induced by these waves at a\nfrequency of approximately 160 MHz, coupled with magnetoelastic effects, leads\nto domain magnetization oscillation, resulting in unique responses that are\nparticularly pronounced near the coercive field. Experimental results reveal\nthat the response of the sensor is highly sensitive to the angle between the\napplied magnetic field and the wave propagation direction, with profiles that\ncan vary significantly depending on this angle, with some configurations\nresulting in practically opposite responses. A particularly relevant case\narises when the magnetic field is aligned with the Love wave propagation\ndirection. In this case, the sensor response shows mainly a monotonic increase\nwith the magnetic field, except near the coercive field, where a sharp peak\nemerges and then abruptly collapses, resulting in a magnetic sensitivity of\n4.92 Hz/nT. This high sensitivity near the coercive field opens the door to the\ndevelopment of high-performance sensors, simplifying electronics while\nleveraging the key advantages of SAW technology, including low power\nconsumption, compact size, real-time response, and portability. A theoretical\nmodel is also discussed to further understand the underlying phenomena and\noptimize the design of next-generation devices, which hold significant\npotential for sensor applications across various fields.",

    "abstract": "Tableau switching is a well studied bijection on pairs of skew Young tableaux\nwhich swaps their relative positions. This is achieved by successively sliding\nthe entries of the inner tableaux through the outer one via jeu de taquin (JDT)\nslides. Tableau coswitching is a similar but coplactic operation, meaning it\ncommutes with any sequence of JDT slides. Coswitching is defined by first\nperforming JDT rectification on the union of the tableaux, switching the\nresulting pair, then unrectifying the union. This definition requires us to\nperform large scale modifications to the skew shapes during the rectification\nand unrectification steps, which is both computationally taxing and obscures\nthe effect of coswitching on the pair of skew tableaux. In previous work,\nGillespie and Levinson define an algorithm which computes coswitching as a\nsequence of local moves, which do not alter the skew shapes of the tableaux,\nwhen one of the tableaux is a single box.\n  In this paper, we extend the results of Gillespie and Levinson (and\nGillespie, Levinson, and Purbhoo for type B) to the case the two skew tableaux\nare of arbitrary size. We also describe multiple bijections on tableaux, each\ndescending to the evacuation shuffling (esh) operation on pairs of dual\nequivalence classes. We show how special cases of our local algorithm compute\nthe Sch\\\"utzenberger involution on skew tableaux, as well as the wall-crossing\nand monodromy of certain covering spaces of the moduli space $\\overline{M}_{0,\nr}(\\mathbb{R})$.",

    "abstract": "Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is a popular technique for\nsize-based separation of particles. One of the challenges in design of DLD\nchips is to eliminate the disturbance of fluid flow patterns caused by channel\nsidewalls intersecting with the pillars matrix. While there are numerous\nreports in the literature attempting to mitigate this issue by adjusting the\ngaps between pillars on the sidewalls and the closest ones residing on the bulk\ngrid of DLD array, there are only few works that also configure the axial gap\nof pillars adjacent to accumulation sidewall to maintain a desired local\npressure field. In this work, we study various designs numerically to\ninvestigate the effects of geometrical configurations of sidewalls on critical\ndiameter and first stream flux fraction variations across channel. Our results\nshow that regardless of the model used for boundary gap profile, applying a\npressure balance scheme can improve the separation performance by reducing the\ncritical diameter variations. In particular, we found that for a given boundary\ngap distribution, there can be two desired parameter sets with relatively low\ncritical diameter variations. One is related to sufficiently low lateral\nresistance of interface unit cells next to accumulation sidewall, while the\nother one emerges by reducing the axial resistance of the interface unit cells\nto an appropriate extent. We believe that this work can pave the way for\ndesigning DLD systems with improved performance, which can be critically\nimportant for applications such as separation of rare cells, among others,\nwherein target species need to be concentrated into as narrow a stream as\npossible downstream of device to enhance purity and recovery rate\nsimultaneously.",

    "abstract": "A neutron star (NS) in a binary system deforms due to the companion's tidal\ngravitational field. As the binary inspirals due to gravitational wave (GW)\nemission, the NS's deformation evolves; this evolution is typically modeled as\nthe star's linear response to the companion's time-evolving tidal potential. In\nprinciple, the fluid elements' displacements can be excited and evolve\nnonlinearly since the equations of hydrodynamics and the tidal forcing have\nnonlinear terms. Recently, Kwon, Yu, and Venumadhav (KYV I [arXiv:2410.03831])\nshowed that nonlinear terms in the hydrodynamic equations of motion make the\nlow-frequency response of NSs, characterized by gravity ($g$-) modes, behave in\nan anharmonic manner. The anharmonicity is dominantly generated by the mutual\ncoupling of the four lowest-order ($n=1$, $l=|m|=2$) $g$-modes, and allows them\nto stay locked in a resonant state that oscillates phase-coherently with the\norbit throughout the inspiral. As a result, the $g$-modes grow to larger\namplitudes than the linear response suggests, leading to an extra phase\ncorrection to the frequency-domain GW signal $|\\Delta \\Psi|\\approx 3\\,{\\rm\nrad}$ at a GW frequency of $1.05\\,{\\rm kHz}$. This effect is part of the truly\ndynamical tide, in the sense that the amplitude depends not just on the\nbinary's instantaneous frequency but the entire history of the inspiral. In\nthis paper, we explain the phenomenology of resonance locking in detail and\nanalytically validate the numerical dephasing calculations in KYV I. We also\ndemonstrate that the effect is only significant for the lowest-order $g$-modes.",

We show that these spurious\ncorrelations leave fine-tuned VLMs vulnerable even to a simple one-word\nmodification-based attack, where substituting a single word in text queries\nwith a spurious correlation-inducing alternative can effectively bypass\nsafeguards. Additionally, these correlations contribute to the over prudence,\ncausing fine-tuned VLMs to refuse benign queries unnecessarily.

    "abstract": "Background: Social determinants of health (SDoH) play a crucial role in\ninfluencing health outcomes, accounting for nearly 50% of modifiable health\nfactors and bringing to light critical disparities among disadvantaged groups.\nDespite the significant impact of SDoH, existing data resources often fall\nshort in terms of comprehensiveness, integration, and usability. Methods: To\naddress these gaps, we developed an extensive Exposome database and a\ncorresponding web application, aimed at enhancing data usability and\nintegration with electronic health record (EHR) to foster personalized and\ninformed healthcare. We created a robust database consisting of a wide array of\nSDoH indicators and an automated linkage tool designed to facilitate effortless\nintegration with EHR. We emphasized a user-friendly interface to cater to\nresearchers, clinicians, and public health professionals. Results: The\nresultant Exposome database and web application offer an extensive data catalog\nwith enhanced usability features. The automated linkage tool has demonstrated\nefficiency in integrating SDoH data with EHRs, significantly improving data\naccessibility. Initial deployment has confirmed scalability and robust spatial\ndata relationships, facilitating precise and contextually relevant healthcare\ninsights. Conclusion: The development of an advanced Exposome database and\nlinkage tool marks a significant step toward enhancing the accessibility and\nusability of SDoH data. By centralizing and integrating comprehensive SDoH\nindicators with EHRs, this tool empowers a wide range of users to access\nhigh-quality, standardized data. This resource will have a lasting impact on\npersonalized healthcare and equitable health landscape.",

To address\nthis limitation, we introduce GPDFlow, an innovative mGPD model that leverages\nnormalizing flows to flexibly represent the dependence structure. Unlike\ntraditional parametric mGPD approaches, GPDFlow does not impose explicit\nparametric assumptions on dependence, resulting in greater flexibility and\nenhanced performance. Additionally, GPDFlow allows direct inference of marginal\nparameters, providing insights into marginal tail behavior. We derive tail\ndependence coefficients for GPDFlow, including a bivariate formulation, a\n$d$-dimensional extension, and an alternative measure for partial exceedance\ndependence. A general relationship between the bivariate tail dependence\ncoefficient and the generative samples from normalizing flows is discussed.\nThrough simulations and a practical application analyzing the risk among five\nmajor US banks, we demonstrate that GPDFlow significantly improves modeling\naccuracy and flexibility compared to traditional parametric methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents two new techniques relating to inexact solution of\nsubproblems in augmented Lagrangian methods for convex programming. The first\ninvolves combining a relative error criterion for solution of the subproblems\nwith over- or under-relaxation of the multiplier update step. In one\ninterpretation of our proposed iterative scheme, a predetermined amount of\nrelaxation effects the criterion for an acceptably accurate solution value.\nAlternatively, the amount of multiplier step relaxation can be adapted to the\naccuracy of the subproblem subject to a viability test employing the\ndiscriminant of a certain quadratic function. The second innovation involves\nsolution of augmented Lagrangian subproblems for problems posed in standard\nFenchel-Rockafellar form. We show that applying alternating minimization to\nthis subproblem, as in the first two steps of the ADMM, is equivalent to\nexecuting the classical proximal gradient method on a dual formulation of the\nsubproblem. By substituting more sophisticated variants of the proximal\ngradient method for the classical one, it is possible to construct new\nADMM-like methods with better empirical performance than using ordinary\nalternating minimization within an inexact augmented Lagrangian framework. The\npaper concludes by describing some computational experiments exploring using\nthese two innovations, both separately and jointly, to solve LASSO problems.",

Despite some promising theoretical results on the true\nposterior predictive distribution of Bayesian neural networks, the properties\nof even the most commonly used posterior approximations are often questioned.\nComputational burdens and intractable posteriors expose miscalibrated Bayesian\nneural networks to poor accuracy and unreliable uncertainty estimates.\nApproximate Bayesian inference aims to replace unknown and intractable\nposterior distributions with some simpler but feasible distributions. The\ndimensions of modern deep models, coupled with the lack of identifiability,\nmake Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) tremendously expensive and unable to fully\nexplore the multimodal posterior. On the other hand, variational inference\nbenefits from improved computational complexity but lacks the asymptotical\nguarantees of sampling-based inference and tends to concentrate around a single\nmode. The performance of both approaches heavily depends on architectural\nchoices; this paper aims to shed some light on this by considering the\ncomputational costs, accuracy and uncertainty quantification in different\nscenarios including large width and out-of-sample data. To improve posterior\nexploration, different model averaging and ensembling techniques are studied,\nalong with their benefits on predictive performance.

The purpose of this work is twofold. First, within\nthe evolutionary framework of the constraint equations, we show that the\nexistence of a well-defined Bondi mass brings the asymptotically hyperboloidal\ninitial data sets into a subclass whose Cauchy development guaranteed to admit\na smooth boundary, by virtue of the results of Andersson and Chru\\'sciel.\nSecond, by generalizing a recent result of Beyer and Ritchie, we show that the\nexistence of well-defined Bondi mass and angular momentum, together with some\nmild restrictions on the free data, implies that the generic solutions of the\nparabolic-hyperbolic form of the constraint equations are completely free of\nlogarithmic singularities. We also provide numerical evidence to show that in\nthe vicinity of Kerr, asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data without\nlogarithmic singularities can indeed be constructed.",

We\nevaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the\npotential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow\nthrough cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies\nare applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters\ncan achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e\nannually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal\npotential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001\nGtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve\natmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \\$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when\nsorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets,\noutperforming the \\$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are\napplied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for\nthese technologies' costs per square meter.

In contrast, recent\ndiffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating physically\nrealizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction limits their\nsteerability. Diffuse-CLoC addresses these challenges through a key insight:\nmodeling the joint distribution of states and actions within a single diffusion\nmodel makes action generation steerable by conditioning it on the predicted\nstates. This approach allows us to leverage established conditioning techniques\nfrom kinematic motion generation while producing physically realistic motions.\nAs a result, we achieve planning capabilities without the need for a high-level\nplanner.

The control parameters, namely, the Chandrasekhar number\n($\\mathrm{Q}$) and the reduced Rayleigh number $r$ (ratio of Rayleigh number to\ncritical Rayleigh number), are varied in the ranges $0 \\leq \\mathrm{Q} \\leq\n1000$ and $1 \\leq r \\leq 20$ for the Prandtl numbers $\\mathrm{Pr} = 0.1$ and\n$0.2$ by considering three horizontal aspect ratios ($\\Gamma$): $\\frac{1}{2}$,\n$1$ and $2$. In the absence of the magnetic field, the convection starts in the\nform of steady rolls including the one parallel to the $x$-axis. As the oblique\nhorizontal magnetic field is switched on at an angle $\\phi \\in (0^\\circ,\n~90^\\circ]$ with the $x$-axis, it is observed that the Lorentz force generated\nby the component of the magnetic field transverse to the axis of the convection\nrolls inhibits convection in the form of steady rolls. Thus, with the\napplication of the magnetic field, the convection is suppressed and restarts\nfor a higher Rayleigh number in the form of steady convection rolls. The rolls\ncan either be oriented along the $x$-axis (steady parallel rolls, SPR) or\noriented at an angle $45^\\circ$ (steady oblique rolls, SOR$^+$) with the\n$x$-axis depending on the choices of the parameters. A rich bifurcation\nstructure with standing and traveling patterns emerges at higher $r$.

These safety\nfilters are compatible with many nominal controllers and ensure safety without\nsignificantly restricting the robots' workspace. A key challenge in\nimplementing these filters is the computational overhead caused by the large\nnumber of safety constraints and the computation of a Hessian matrix per\nconstraint. We address this challenge by employing numerical differentiation\nmethods to approximate computationally intensive terms. The effectiveness of\nour method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and real-world\nexperiments with Franka Research 3 robotic arms. The project video is available\nat this link.",

    "abstract": "Human reasoning relies on constructing and manipulating mental models --\nsimplified internal representations of situations that we use to understand and\nsolve problems. Conceptual diagrams (e.g., a sketch drawn by a human to aid\nreasoning) externalize these mental models, abstracting irrelevant details to\nefficiently capture how entities interact with each other. In contrast, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and Large MultiModal Models (LMMs) predominantly reason\nthrough text, limiting their effectiveness in complex multi-step tasks. In this\npaper, we propose Visual Thinking, a zero-shot framework that enables LMMs to\nreason through multiple chains of (self-generated) conceptual diagrams,\nsignificantly enhancing their combinatorial planning capabilities. Our approach\ndoes not require any human initialization beyond the natural language\ndescription of the task. It integrates both textual and diagrammatic reasoning\nwithin an optimized Graph-of-Thought inference framework, enhanced by beam\nsearch and depth-wise backtracking. Evaluated on multiple challenging PDDL\nplanning domains, our method substantially improves LMMs' performance (e.g.,\nGPT-4o: 35.5% -> 90.2% in Blocksworld) and consistently outperforms other\ntext-only search-based inference methods. On more difficult planning domains\nwith solution depths up to 40, our approach outperforms even the o1-preview\nreasoning model (e.g., 16 percentage points improvement in Floor Tiles).

While this is\nsufficient for clinical evaluation, automated algorithms designed for 3D\nanalysis perform poorly on multi-slice 2D MR volumes, especially those with\nthick slices and gaps between slices. Super-resolution (SR) methods aim to\naddress this problem, but previous methods do not address all of the following:\nslice profile shape estimation, slice gap, domain shift, and non-integer or\narbitrary upsampling factors. In this paper, we propose ECLARE (Efficient\nCross-planar Learning for Anisotropic Resolution Enhancement), a self-SR method\nthat addresses each of these factors.

We compared ECLARE to cubic B-spline\ninterpolation, SMORE, and other contemporary SR methods. We used realistic and\nrepresentative simulations so that quantitative performance against ground\ntruth can be computed, and ECLARE outperformed all other methods in both signal\nrecovery and downstream tasks.

These transitions\ndepend on the internal geometry: ribbons whose incompatibility arises from\nfailure of the Gauss equation always exhibit a transition, whereas some, but\nnot all, of those whose incompatibility arises from failure of the Codazzi\nequations do. We give the first rigorous analysis of this behavior, mainly for\nribbons whose first fundamental form is flat: for Gauss-incompatible ribbons we\nidentify the natural energy scaling of the problem and prove the existence of a\nshape transition, and for Codazzi-incompatible ribbons we give a necessary\ncondition for a transition to occur. The results are obtained by calculating\nthe $\\Gamma$-limits, as $t,w\\to 0$, for narrow ribbons ($w^2 \\ll t$), and wide\nribbons (taking $t$ to zero and then $w$), in the natural energy scalings\ndictated by the internal geometry.",

    "abstract": "HD93129A is an O+O stellar system whose CWR has been mapped by high angular\nresolution observations at cm wavelengths. The synchrotron nature of the radio\nemission confirms its particle accelerator status. According to astrometric\nmeasurements since 1996, the system has an orbital period of ~120 yr and\nrecently went through its periastron passage. We characterize the radio\nemission during the epoch of periastron passage, when the particle density and\nthe local magnetic energy density in the CWR increase. We monitored HD93129A\nand surroundings at 2.1, 5.5 and 9 GHz with the ATCA over 17 months, with a\n~2-month cadence. Previous ATCA data and data collected using other radio\nobservatories were also included. We obtained radio light curves in subbands\nper band per epoch. The flux densities show an average rise of a factor four\nfrom 2003 to 2018, with the caveat that the 2009-2018 time lapse is devoid of\ndata, and a similar decay between 2018 to 2020. We fit the spectral energy\ndistribution of quasi-simultaneous data at three epochs and find that the\nmagnetic-to-thermal pressure ratio does not remain constant along the orbit,\npossible suggesting magnetic field amplification close to periastron. In the\n2019 epoch, we estimate a magnetic field strength of ~1.1G in the apex of the\nCWR. The evolution of the SED and spectral index is also presented. By\ncombining ATCA and ASKAP images a spectral index map was obtained in an area of\n30' size. The radio emission in the direction of other massive binary systems\nin the field (WR22, WR25 and HD93250) was measured and briefly discussed.\nIntensive radio monitoring allows us to track the evolution of physical\nconditions in the shocks. The general trend of decreasing emission of HD93129A\nin the high-frequency bands in 2019-2020 suggests that the system is at\npost-periastron, consistent with model predictions. (Abridged)",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer\nWSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and\ntopology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the\nHartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer.\nOur analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic\ninstability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength,\nout-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting\nand commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios,\nthe instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove\nline where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the\nband in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\\kappa$ points. Increasing\ninteraction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered\nphase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets\npinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The\nantiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization,\nwhich makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling\nlimit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase\ndiagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed\nFermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle\ntransport signatures observed in these studies.",

The code can generate a large set of\nsignals, ideal for building emulators and performing astrophysical or\ncosmological inference from a given 21-cm dataset. The code is MPI parallel\nwith reasonable scalability and thus, can be run on high-performance computers.\nWe offer six astrophysical parameters that control the Lyman-$\\alpha$\nemissivity, X-ray emissivity, emissivity of ionizing photons, and star\nformation rate. A critical component of 21-cm modelling, but ignored by\nmajority of public codes, that we include is the Ly$\\alpha$ heating. For a\ncertain range of astrophysical parameters, the Ly$\\alpha$ heating could even\ndominate the X-ray heating. In addition to astrophysical parameters, in ECHO21\nit is just as easy to vary the standard cosmological parameters which makes it\npossible to combine constraints from 21-cm observations and other cosmological\nprobes. Further, we offer two models of star formation rate; a\nphysically-motivated and an empirically-motivated. Since the latter is directly\ninferred by HST/JWST observations, it makes ECHO21 an appropriate tool to build\nsynergies between 21-cm observations and galaxy surveys. With a number of 21-cm\nexperiments soon to provide cosmic dawn 21-cm data, ECHO21 is a handy package\nfor making quick but sufficiently realistic astrophysical inferences.",

In this work, we present a linear\nperturbation analysis of the minimal implementation of pNG Higgs inflation\nusing the symmetry coset SU($5$)/SO($5$). Similar to Chromo-natural inflation,\nthis model exhibits a period of instability in the tensor modes that\nexponentially enhance left-handed gravitational waves.

The absorber is at rest with respect\nto broad H$\\alpha$, suggesting that the gas cannot be interpreted as an inflow\nor outflow, forming instead a long-lived structure. Its velocity dispersion is\n$\\sigma_{abs} = 100\\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with the value inferred from\nthe analysis of the Balmer break.

While frontal placement is\nthe optimal and the only option for some tasks, such as hand tracking, it\nremains unclear if the same holds for full-body tracking due to self-occlusion\nand limited field-of-view coverage. Notably, even the state-of-the-art methods\noften fail to estimate accurate 3D poses in many scenarios, such as when HMD\nusers tilt their heads upward -- a common motion in human activities. A key\nlimitation of existing HMD designs is their neglect of the back of the body,\ndespite its potential to provide crucial 3D reconstruction cues. Hence, this\npaper investigates the usefulness of rear cameras for full-body tracking. We\nalso show that simply adding rear views to the frontal inputs is not optimal\nfor existing methods due to their dependence on individual 2D joint detectors\nwithout effective multi-view integration. To address this issue, we propose a\nnew transformer-based method that refines 2D joint heatmap estimation with\nmulti-view information and heatmap uncertainty, thereby improving 3D pose\ntracking. Also, we introduce two new large-scale datasets, Ego4View-Syn and\nEgo4View-RW, for a rear-view evaluation. Our experiments show that the new\ncamera configurations with back views provide superior support for 3D pose\ntracking compared to only frontal placements.

    "abstract": "How can we rely on an end-to-end autonomous vehicle's complex decision-making\nsystem during deployment? One common solution is to have a ``fallback layer''\nthat checks the planned trajectory for rule violations and replaces it with a\npre-defined safe action if necessary. Another approach involves adjusting the\nplanner's decisions to minimize a pre-defined ``cost function'' using\nadditional system predictions such as road layouts and detected obstacles.\nHowever, these pre-programmed rules or cost functions cannot learn and improve\nwith new training data, often resulting in overly conservative behaviors. In\nthis work, we propose Centaur (Cluster Entropy for Test-time trAining using\nUncertainty) which updates a planner's behavior via test-time training, without\nrelying on hand-engineered rules or cost functions. Instead, we measure and\nminimize the uncertainty in the planner's decisions. For this, we develop a\nnovel uncertainty measure, called Cluster Entropy, which is simple,\ninterpretable, and compatible with state-of-the-art planning algorithms. Using\ndata collected at prior test-time time-steps, we perform an update to the\nmodel's parameters using a gradient that minimizes the Cluster Entropy. With\nonly this sole gradient update prior to inference, Centaur exhibits significant\nimprovements, ranking first on the navtest leaderboard with notable gains in\nsafety-critical metrics such as time to collision. To provide detailed insights\non a per-scenario basis, we also introduce navsafe, a challenging new\nbenchmark, which highlights previously undiscovered failure modes of driving\nmodels.",

However, while recent reward models\nincrease performance on standard benchmarks, this may partly be due to\noverfitting effects, which would confound an understanding of their true\ncapability. In this work, we scrutinize the robustness of reward models and the\nextent of such overfitting. We build **reWordBench**, which systematically\ntransforms reward model inputs in meaning- or ranking-preserving ways. We show\nthat state-of-the-art reward models suffer from substantial performance\ndegradation even with minor input transformations, sometimes dropping to\nsignificantly below-random accuracy, suggesting brittleness. To improve reward\nmodel robustness, we propose to explicitly train them to assign similar scores\nto paraphrases, and find that this approach also improves robustness to other\ndistinct kinds of transformations. For example, our robust reward model reduces\nsuch degradation by roughly half for the Chat Hard subset in RewardBench.\nFurthermore, when used in alignment, our robust reward models demonstrate\nbetter utility and lead to higher-quality outputs, winning in up to 59% of\ninstances against a standardly trained RM.",

The up-and-coming\nREDSoX sounding rocket mission will be the first experiment equipped with a\ndetector able to explore polarized X-rays below 1 keV, observing in the 0.2-0.4\nkeV range. Although REDSoX will only be capable of short, one-off observations,\nit will crucially test the instrument performance. In this paper we investigate\nhow a fully-fledged orbital mission with longer lifetime, based on an\ninstrument design similar to REDSoX, will allow us to study thermal emission\nfrom the X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs) and magnetars, probing their\nmagnetic field and the physics of their outer surface layers, including vacuum\neffects and QED mode conversion at the vacuum resonance. We discuss the\npotentially observable features for promising values of the star's surface\ntemperature, magnetic field, and viewing geometry. Assuming emission from the\nwhole surface, we find that, for a source with a magnetic field B=5x10^{13} G\nand surface temperature T~10^7 K, the instrument can resolve a proton-cyclotron\nabsorption feature in the spectrum with high significance when collecting\n~25,000 counts across a single observation. Similarly, for a source with\nB=10^{14} G and T~10^7 K, a switch in the dominant polarization mode, caused by\nmode conversion at the vacuum resonance, can be detected by collecting ~25,000\ncounts, allowing for a long-sought observational test of the presence of QED\neffects. We then present two case studies for XDINS targets: RX J1856.5-3754\nand RX J0720.4-3125.",

We propose that maximizing the\ninformational density of individual demonstrations can dramatically reduce\nreliance on large-scale datasets while improving task performance. To this end,\nwe introduce Adversarial Data Collection, a Human-in-the-Loop (HiL) framework\nthat redefines robotic data acquisition through real-time, bidirectional\nhuman-environment interactions. Unlike conventional pipelines that passively\nrecord static demonstrations, ADC adopts a collaborative perturbation paradigm:\nduring a single episode, an adversarial operator dynamically alters object\nstates, environmental conditions, and linguistic commands, while the\ntele-operator adaptively adjusts actions to overcome these evolving challenges.\nThis process compresses diverse failure-recovery behaviors, compositional task\nvariations, and environmental perturbations into minimal demonstrations. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ADC-trained models achieve superior compositional\ngeneralization to unseen task instructions, enhanced robustness to perceptual\nperturbations, and emergent error recovery capabilities. Strikingly, models\ntrained with merely 20% of the demonstration volume collected through ADC\nsignificantly outperform traditional approaches using full datasets. These\nadvances bridge the gap between data-centric learning paradigms and practical\nrobotic deployment, demonstrating that strategic data acquisition, not merely\npost-hoc processing, is critical for scalable, real-world robot learning.\nAdditionally, we are curating a large-scale ADC-Robotics dataset comprising\nreal-world manipulation tasks with adversarial perturbations.

In\nsuperconducting circuits this leads to the requirement to both strongly couple\nqubits, such as transmons, to readout modes while also protecting them from\nassociated Purcell decay through the readout port. So-called Purcell filters\ncan provide this protection, at the cost of significant increases in circuit\ncomponents and complexity. However, as we demonstrate in this work, visualizing\nthe qubit fields in space reveals locations where the qubit fields are strong\nand cavity fields weak; simply placing ports at these locations provides\nintrinsic Purcell protection. For a $\\lambda/2$ readout mode in the\n`chip-in-tube' geometry, we show both millisecond level Purcell protection and,\nconversely, greatly enhanced Purcell decay (qubit lifetime of 1~$\\mu$s) simply\nby relocating the readout port. This method of integrating the Purcell\nprotection into the qubit-cavity geometry can be generalized to other 3D\nimplementations, such as post-cavities, as well as planar geometries. For qubit\nfrequencies below the readout mode this effect is quite distinct from the\nmulti-mode Purcell effect, which we demonstrate in a 3D-post geometry where we\nshow both Purcell protection of the qubit while spoiling the quality factor of\nhigher cavity harmonics to protect against dephasing due to stray photons in\nthese modes.",

Unlike conventional neural network-based algorithms,\nthis generative model requires only a minimal number of training samples,\nmaking it highly compatible with the computational constraints of typical CMB\nsimulation campaigns. We validate the method using realistic simulations of CMB\nsystematics, which are particularly challenging to emulate, and perform\nextensive statistical tests to confirm its ability to produce new statistically\nindependent approximate realizations.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has established itself as a powerful tool for\ndesigning quantum circuits, which are essential for processing quantum\ninformation. RL applications have typically focused on circuits of small to\nintermediate complexity, as computation times tend to increase exponentially\nwith growing circuit complexity. This computational explosion severely limits\nthe scalability of RL and casts significant doubt on its broader applicability.\nIn this paper, we propose a principled approach based on the systematic\ndiscovery and introduction of composite gates -- {\\it gadgets}, that enables RL\nscalability, thereby expanding its potential applications. As a case study, we\nexplore the discovery of Clifford encoders for Quantum Error Correction. We\ndemonstrate that incorporating gadgets in the form of composite Clifford gates,\nin addition to standard CNOT and Hadamard gates, significantly enhances the\nefficiency of RL agents. Specifically, the computation speed increases (by one\nor even two orders of magnitude), enabling RL to discover highly complex\nquantum codes without previous knowledge. We illustrate this advancement with\nexamples of QEC code discovery with parameters $ [[n,1,d]] $ for $ d \\leq 7 $\nand $ [[n,k,6]] $ for $ k \\leq 7 $. We note that the most complicated circuits\nof these classes were not previously found. We highlight the advantages and\nlimitations of the gadget-based approach.

The convergence rate of these histograms towards a stationary\ndistribution provides a local quantification of the duration of memory, which\nreflects how distinct microscopic paths projecting onto the same observed\ntransition decorrelate in path space. This motivates the notion of \"weak Markov\norder\" and provides insight about the hidden topology of microscopic paths in a\nholography-like fashion.

The effects of sublimation and conjugate heat transfer are included both\non the baseflow and the linear fluctuations. This framework identifies one mode\nthat fully characterizes the stability of the surface, which becomes unstable\nwhen the wall temperature exceeds that of an adiabatic wall, $T_{ad}$. These\nfindings are consistent with experimental observations, where laminar flow\nconditions at adiabatic wall temperatures are found to be stable. The analysis\nalso reveals that the nature of this surface mode varies as a function of the\noblique angle $\\psi = \\tan^{-1}{\\beta/\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are\nthe streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers. Specifically, for baseflow\ntemperatures below $\\approx 1.15~T_{ad}$, the surface mode is most unstable at\n$\\psi = 0$.

We directly observe rotational phonon-phonon Umklapp\nscattering dictated by pseudo angular momentum conservation and the threefold\nrotational symmetry of the topological insulator bismuth selenide. We identify\nnonlinear phonon-phonon coupling as an angular momentum transfer channel,\nconfirmed by our ab-initio calculations. Besides bearing universal implications\nfor angular momentum dissipation abundant in nature, our work actively reverses\nthe natural flow, leading to the nonlinear upconversion of lattice angular\nmomentum. We thus open the field of helical and chiral nonlinear phononics,\nrepresenting a selective handle for ultrafast control of spins, topology and\nchiral quasi-particles.",

    "abstract": "The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), a star-forming region rich in molecular\nclouds located within hundreds of parsecs from the centre of our Galaxy,\nconverts gas into stars less efficient than anticipated. A key challenge in\nrefining star-formation models is the lack of precise mapping of these dense\nmolecular hydrogen clouds, where traditional tracers often yield inconsistent\nresults due to environmental limitations. We demonstrate how, in the not-so-far\nfuture, neutrinos will emerge as a robust mass tracer thanks to advancements in\nneutrino telescopes. Since neutrinos are produced alongside gamma-rays when\ncosmic-rays interact with molecular clouds, they offer a complementary,\nsystematics-independent measurement of the gas density. In an optimistic case\nwhere most gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Centre region originates from\npion decays, we expect several tens of muon neutrinos to be detected in about\ntwo decades by KM3NeT, Baikal-GVD, and P-ONE combined, which will enable a\nbetter determination of the baryonic content in the Galactic Centre region. The\nCMZ will serve as a testbed to calibrate conventional tracers against\nneutrinos, ultimately improving gas measurements in distant galaxies, where\nneutrinos are undetectable, but traditional tracers remain available.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a Schr\\\"odinger chiral cat qubit, a novel bosonic quantum code\ngeneralizing Kerr cat qubits that exploits higher-order nonlinearities.\nCompared to a standard Kerr cat, the chiral cat qubit allows additional\ncorrection of bit-flip errors within the Hilbert space of a single bosonic\noscillator. Indeed, this code displays optical bistability, i.e., the\nsimultaneous presence of multiple long-lived states. Two of them define the\ncode space and two define an error space. Thanks to the chiral structure of the\nphase space of this system, the error space can be engineered to ``capture''\nbit flip events in the code space (a bit-flip trap), without affecting the\nquantum information stored in the system. Therefore, it is possible to perform\ndetection and correction of errors. We demonstrate how this topological effect\ncan be particularly efficient in the presence of large dephasing. We provide\nconcrete examples of the performance of the code and show the possibility of\napplying quantum operations rapidly and efficiently. Beyond the interest in\nthis single technological application, our work demonstrates how the topology\nof phase space can enhance the performance of bosonic codes.",

    "abstract": "We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet\ncandidate hematite ($\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase\nbelow and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key\nquestion is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting\n(also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections,\nwhich contribute to hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed\nsymmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that\ncapturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange\ninteractions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic\nband splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band\nwidth of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this\nsplitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both\nmagnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)\n- does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that\ninelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting\nin hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly\nmagnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit\ncoupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a\nthird-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that\nthe $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin\nconversion without requiring an external magnetic field.",

The model was trained on an extensive\ndatabase of Volcano-Tectonic (VT) events derived from the co-eruptive\nseismicity of the 2021 La Palma eruption, recorded by a High-fidelity submarine\nDistributed Acoustic Sensing array (HDAS) near the eruption site. The features\nused for supervised model training, based on signal energy average in frequency\nbands, effectively enable the model to leverage spatial contextual information\nand the temporal evolution of volcano-seismic signals provided by the DAS\ntechnique. The proposed model not only detects the presence of VT events but\nalso analyzes their temporal evolution, selecting and classifying their\ncomplete waveforms with an accuracy of approximately 97% for correctly detected\nand classified VT events. Furthermore, the model has demonstrated robust\nperformance in generalizing to other time intervals and volcanoes, enabling\ncontinuous real-time monitoring of seismicity. Such results highlight the\npotential of using RNN-based approaches with LSTM cells for application to\nother active volcanoes, enabling fast, automatic analysis with low\ncomputational requirements and the need of minimal retraining, for the creation\nof labeled seismic catalogs directly from DAS measurements. This represents a\nsignificant advancement in the use of DAS technology as a viable tool to study\nactive volcanoes and their seismic activity.",

    "abstract": "With about 1.5 billion galaxies expected to be observed, the very large\nnumber of objects in the Euclid photometric survey will allow for precise\nstudies of galaxy clustering from a single survey, over a large range of\nredshifts $0.2 < z < 2.5$. In this work, we use photometric redshifts to\nextract the baryon acoustic oscillation signal (BAO) from the Flagship galaxy\nmock catalogue with a tomographic approach to constrain the evolution of the\nUniverse and infer its cosmological parameters. We measure the two-point\nangular correlation function in 13 redshift bins. A template-fitting approach\nis applied to the measurement to extract the shift of the BAO peak through the\ntransverse Alcock--Paczynski parameter $\\alpha$. A joint analysis of all\nredshift bins is performed to constrain $\\alpha$ at the effective redshift\n$z_\\mathrm{eff}=0.77$ with MCMC and profile likelihood techniques. We also\nextract one $\\alpha_i$ parameter per redshift bin to quantify its evolution as\na function of time.

Moreover, it is well known that\nnonlinear systems tend to develop noise due to their sensitivity to initial\nconditions, thus motivating the development of general principles which can be\nused to control and mitigate noise in such systems. In this work, we show that\nnon-reciprocity can enable the unidirectional flow of noise from the\nnon-equilibrium steady states of nonlinear driven-dissipative systems. We\ndemonstrate that this unidirectional flow results from the non-Hermitian skin\neffect (NHSE) for quantum noise. This effect provides a robust mechanism for\nisolating parts of the system from degradation due to excess injected noise.\nOur findings may lead to novel design principles for multimode amplifiers or\noscillators that support high power handling while mitigating the buildup of\nnoise.

The\nresulting distribution's correctness can be impacted by four major factors: the\ngeneralization and optimization errors in score matching, and the\ndiscretization and minimal noise amplitude in the diffusion. In this paper, we\nmake the sampling error explicit when using a diffusion sampler in the Gaussian\nsetting.

This is especially true with large pre-trained Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs), which motivated successful research at the intersection of\nParameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) and FSA. In this work, we start by\nanalyzing the learning dynamics of PEFT techniques when trained on few-shot\ndata from only a subset of categories, referred to as the ``base'' classes. We\nshow that such dynamics naturally splits into two distinct phases: (i)\ntask-level feature extraction and (ii) specialization to the available\nconcepts. To accommodate this dynamic, we then depart from prompt- or\nadapter-based methods and tackle FSA differently. Specifically, given a fixed\ncomputational budget, we split it to (i) learn a task-specific feature\nextractor via PEFT and (ii) train a linear classifier on top. We call this\nscheme Two-Stage Few-Shot Adaptation (2SFS). Differently from established\nmethods, our scheme enables a novel form of selective inference at a category\nlevel, i.e., at test time, only novel categories are embedded by the adapted\ntext encoder, while embeddings of base categories are available within the\nclassifier.

In this framework, there are different roles: a supervisor, a\nsource, a target, and a collection of workers. Initially, the source stores\nsome instance $I$ of a computational problem, and at the end, the target is\nsupposed to store a correct solution $S(I)$ for that instance. We assume that\nthe computation required for $S(I)$ can be modeled as a directed acyclic graph\n$G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is a set of tasks and $(v,w) \\in E$ if and only if task\n$w$ needs information from task $v$ in order to be executed. Given $G$, the\nrole of the supervisor is to schedule the execution of the tasks in $G$ by\nassigning them to the workers. If all workers are honest, information can be\nexchanged between the workers, and the workers have access to the source and\ntarget, the supervisor only needs to know $G$ to successfully schedule the\ncomputations. I.e., the supervisor does not have to handle any data itself like\nin standard master-worker approaches, which has the tremendous benefit that\ntasks can be run massively in parallel in large distributed environments\nwithout the supervisor becoming a bottleneck. But what if a constant fraction\nof the workers is adversarial? Interestingly, we show that under certain\nassumptions a data-agnostic scheduling approach would even work in an\nadversarial setting without (asymptotically) increasing the work required for\ncommunication and computations. We demonstrate the validity of these\nassumptions by presenting concrete solutions for supervised matrix\nmultiplication and sorting.",

A key feature of the system is the\nseparation of energy scales for charge and spin excitations, which is reflected\nin the temperature dependence of thermodynamic quantities and the disparity\nbetween spin and charge gaps extracted from their respective susceptibilities.\nAt the critical point, both spin and charge susceptibilities exhibit\nsingularities, suggesting that charge excitations are not fully decoupled from\ntheir spin counterparts.

    "abstract": "The main goal of this thesis is to study the gravitational action for the\nSchwarzschild black hole and its subsequent regularisation from the perspective\nof general relativity and teleparallel gravity. The standard approach of\ngeneral relativity requires the Einstein-Hilbert action to be supplemented with\nthe Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) boundary term whenever the underlying spacetime\ncontains a boundary. However, the total action is typically divergent, and thus\nit needs to be regularised by the so-called background subtraction. Next, we\nconsider the teleparallel geometry characterised by the curvature-free\nteleparallel spin connection, all the while adopting the tetrad formalism. In\ncontrast to general relativity, teleparallel spin connection is however left\nundetermined by the field equations. We argue that the correct choice of such a\nconnection in principle regularizes the action as equally as the background\nsubtraction, without the need of introducing any additional regulating terms.\nIn the interior region of a black hole, the teleparallel approach agrees\ncompletely with the Gibbons-Hawking (GH) method, but in the exterior region,\nthere appears to be a discrepancy in the overall factor of two. We investigate\nthe origin of this problem by testing various frames, including the so-called\nproper and canonical frames. Finally, we explore the role of singular points in\nthe action and their contributions to the surface terms structure as a possible\nremedy to this problem.",

A notable exception is the\nUnited States (U.S.), where the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 mandates\nthat all federal lobbying activities be disclosed in detailed quarterly\nreports. Here, we introduce our recently completed relational LobbyView\ndatabase that accounts for every reported lobbying instance since the\nimplementation of the LDA. We demonstrate how LobbyView can be used as a\nresource to quantify the salient aspects of the U.S.~lobbying, such as\ndynamical evolution, economic impacts, or political polarization. By analyzing\nthe dynamic evolution of the lobbying network, we identify fundamental\nself-organization principles, such as the self-accelerating accumulation of\ninfluence within a small group of powerful lobbying firms. We further show how\nLobbyView data can be used to accurately measure the synchronization of\nlobbying activities with election cycles. Finally, as a guide to future\nresearch, we illustrate how this data resource can enable quantitative\ntime-resolved analysis to investigate a wide range of critical issues,\nincluding concentration of resources, demographic representation, and\npolarization dynamics in the U.S.~lobbying system.

In such applications, the quality (e.g., user\nengagement, safety) of a conversation is important and can only be exactly\nknown at the end of the conversation. To maximize its expected quality,\nconversation planning reasons about the stochastic transitions within a\nconversation to select the optimal LLM response at each turn. Existing\nsimulation-based conversation planning algorithms typically select the optimal\nresponse by simulating future conversations with a large number of LLM queries\nat every turn. However, this process is extremely time-consuming and hence\nimpractical for real-time conversations. This paper presents a novel approach\ncalled Semantic space COnversation Planning with improved Efficiency (SCOPE)\nthat exploits the dense semantic representation of conversations to perform\nconversation planning efficiently. In particular, SCOPE models the stochastic\ntransitions in conversation semantics and their associated rewards to plan\nentirely within the semantic space. This allows us to select the optimal LLM\nresponse at every conversation turn without needing additional LLM queries for\nsimulation. As a result, SCOPE can perform conversation planning 70 times\nfaster than conventional simulation-based planning algorithms when applied to a\nwide variety of conversation starters and two reward functions seen in the real\nworld, yet achieving a higher reward within a practical planning budget.

Commun. 15,\n1084 (2024)]. A coherent picture of the atomic ensemble dynamics in this\nexperiment requires complementary representations of the external driving\ndynamics and the superradiant dynamics. To complement previous analyses, we\nintroduce these representations by considering in-phase and out-of-phase\nsuperpositions of transverse collective spin components of two atomic\nsub-ensembles, and analyze the dynamics with the corresponding collective Dicke\nstates and Bloch vectors. This approach also explains Ramsey spectroscopy\nexperiments with the ensemble, and it may be employed to explore other\nphenomena, such as weak-to-strong coupling phase transitions and triggered\nsuperradiance.",

Existing token compression-based methods reduce the number of\nvideo tokens but often incur information loss and remain inefficient for\nextremely long sequences. In this paper, we explore an orthogonal direction to\nbuild a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model (VAMBA) that employs Mamba-2 blocks to\nencode video tokens with linear complexity. Without any token reduction, VAMBA\ncan encode more than 1024 frames (640$\\times$360) on a single GPU, while\ntransformer-based models can only encode 256 frames. On long video input, VAMBA\nachieves at least 50% reduction in GPU memory usage during training and\ninference, and nearly doubles the speed per training step compared to\ntransformer-based LMMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that VAMBA\nimproves accuracy by 4.3% on the challenging hour-long video understanding\nbenchmark LVBench over prior efficient video LMMs, and maintains strong\nperformance on a broad spectrum of long and short video understanding tasks.",

Furthermore, the\nincorporation of niobium oxide in the zirconium hafnium oxide/aluminum oxide\ncapacitor stack in between the ferroelectric and insulating layer leads to a\npeak splitting free device without imprint, which could be explained by the\nincreased influence of charge trapping near the zirconium hafnium\noxide-/niobium oxide and niobium oxide-/aluminum oxide interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Selecting a subset of the $k$ \"best\" items from a dataset of $n$ items, based\non a scoring function, is a key task in decision-making. Given the rise of\nautomated decision-making software, it is important that the outcome of this\nprocess, called top-$k$ selection, is fair. Here we consider the problem of\nidentifying a fair linear scoring function for top-$k$ selection. The function\ncomputes a score for each item as a weighted sum of its (numerical) attribute\nvalues, and must ensure that the selected subset includes adequate\nrepresentation of a minority or historically disadvantaged group. Existing\nalgorithms do not scale efficiently, particularly in higher dimensions. Our\nhardness analysis shows that in more than two dimensions, no algorithm is\nlikely to achieve good scalability with respect to dataset size, and the\ncomputational complexity is likely to increase rapidly with dimensionality.\nHowever, the hardness results also provide key insights guiding algorithm\ndesign, leading to our dual-algorithm solution: (1) For small values of $k$,\nour hardness analysis reveals a gap in the hardness barrier. By addressing\nvarious engineering challenges, including achieving efficient parallelism, we\nturn this potential of efficiency into an optimized algorithm delivering\nsubstantial practical performance gains. (2) For large values of $k$, where the\nhardness is robust, we employ a practically efficient algorithm which, despite\nbeing theoretically worse, achieves superior real-world performance.\nExperimental evaluations on real-world datasets then explore scenarios where\nworst-case behavior does not manifest, identifying areas critical to practical\nperformance. Our solution achieves speed-ups of up to several orders of\nmagnitude compared to SOTA, an efficiency made possible through a tight\nintegration of hardness analysis, algorithm design, practical engineering, and\nempirical evaluation.",

The structure of binary-gas foams, whose bubbles consist of a\nmixture of two gases having different affinities with the liquid, thus offers\nreal potential for the dynamic separation of these gases at low cost. In\nsingle-gas foams, the foam structure evolves under the effect of gas flow\ninduced by Laplace pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble\nsize. This leads to the well-documented Ostwald ripening. In addition to these\ncapillary effects, the structure of binary-gas foams can evolve under the\neffect of gas flow induced by partial (or osmotic) pressure differences,\narising from heterogeneities in bubble composition. We experimentally\ninvestigate the shrinking of CO$_2$-laden 2D foams exposed to air, observing a\ncrust of tiny bubbles at the front. We derive a non-linear diffusion model for\nthe gas in the foam and propose a description of the whole foam as an\neffective, homogeneous medium, the key parameter being the gas permeability\nratio across the foam's soap films ($\\neq 1$ for CO$_2/$air). The effective\ndiffusivity of the gas in the foam emerges from the coupling between foam\nstructure and gas transport across soap films. We extrapolate it for various\npermeability ratios and show that it can vary continuously between the\ndiffusivity of the gas in the liquid and that of the gas in the atmosphere,\nenabling tunable gas retention and release by controlling the composition of\nthe atmosphere.",

We\nbrute-force over half a million ordered crystalline structures, encompassing an\nextensive coverage of local energy minima in binary compounds with up to four\natoms per primitive cell. We confirm diamond sets the upper bound of thermal\nconductivity within our search space, very likely also among all stable\ncrystalline solids at ambient conditions. We also identify over 20 novel\ncrystals surpassing silicon in thermal conductivity, validated by density\nfunctional theory. These include a semiconductor TaN with ultrahigh thermal\nconductivity (~900 $\\mathrm{W\\cdot m^{-1}\\cdot K^{-1}}$), and metallic\ncompounds such as MnV that exhibit high lattice and electronic thermal\nconductivity simultaneously, a distinctive feature not observed before. These\nresults as well as the deep learning-driven screening method, redefine the\nlandscape of thermal transport and establish a large open-access database for\nfuture materials discovery.",

The challenge ran for 8 months, from March to October 2023.\nParticipants were provided with realistic simulations of SKA-Low data between\n106 MHz and 196 MHz, including foreground contamination from extragalactic as\nwell as Galactic emission, instrumental and systematic effects. They were asked\nto deliver cylindrical power spectra of the EoR signal, cleaned from all\ncorruptions, and the corresponding confidence levels. Here we describe the\napproaches taken by the 17 teams that completed the challenge, and we assess\ntheir performance using different metrics.\n  The challenge results provide a positive outlook on the capabilities of\ncurrent foreground-mitigation approaches to recover the faint EoR signal from\nSKA-Low observations. The median error committed in the EoR power spectrum\nrecovery is below the true signal for seven teams, although in some cases there\nare some significant outliers. The smallest residual overall is\n$4.2_{-4.2}^{+20} \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\rm{K}^2h^{-3}$cMpc$^{3}$ across all\nconsidered scales and frequencies.\n  The estimation of confidence levels provided by the teams is overall less\naccurate, with the true error being typically under-estimated, sometimes very\nsignificantly. The most accurate error bars account for $60 \\pm 20$\\% of the\ntrue errors committed. The challenge results provide a means for all teams to\nunderstand and improve their performance. This challenge indicates that the\ncomparison between independent pipelines could be a powerful tool to assess\nresidual biases and improve error estimation.",

For the former, data quality and\nrepresentation is no longer optimized based on classical communication key\nperformance indicators, but rather configured on the fly to achieve the goal of\ncommunication with the least resource overhead. This paradigm can be followed\nto flexibly adapt wireless and in-network artificial intelligence operations\nacross different nodes (e.g., access points, users, sensors or actuators) to\ndata traffic, channel conditions, energy availability and distributed computing\ncapabilities. In this paper, we argue and demonstrate that computing and\nlearning/inference operation performance strongly affect lower layers, calling\nfor a real cross-layer optimization that encompasses physical and computation\nresource orchestration, up to the application level. Focusing on a\ncommunication channel shared among a GO and a DO user, we define a\ngoal-effective achievable rate region (GEARR), to assess the maximum data rate\nattainable by the latter, subject to goal achievement guarantees for the\nformer. Finally, we propose a cross-layer dynamic resource orchestration able\nto reach the boundaries of the GEARR, under different goal-effectiveness and\ncompute resource consumption constraints.",

Second, a vectorable thrust control method derived from the basic\ncontrol framework for aerial locomotion is presented. A key feature of this\nextended flight control is its ability to avoid interrotor aerodynamics\ninterference under specific joint configuration. Third, another extended thrust\ncontrol method and a fundamental gait strategy is proposed for special\nterrestrial locomotion called crawling that requires all legs to be lifted at\nthe same time.

In this work, we study a one-dimensional\nreaction-diffusion-aggregation system in which a population's spatiotemporal\ndynamics are tightly linked to a separate, dynamically updating map. Depending\non the local population density, the map amplifies and suppresses certain\nlandscape regions and contributes to directed movement through a nonlocal\nspatial kernel. After establishing the well-posedness of the coupled PDE-ODE\nsystem, we perform a linear stability analysis to identify critical aggregation\nstrengths. We then perform a rigorous bifurcation analysis to determine the\nprecise solution behavior at a steady state near these critical thresholds,\ndeciding whether the bifurcation is sub- or supercritical and the stability of\nthe emergent branch. Based on our analytical findings, we highlight several\ninteresting biological consequences. First, we observe that whether the spatial\nmap functions as attractive or repulsive depends precisely on the map's\nrelative excitation rate versus adaptory rate: when the excitatory effect is\nlarger (smaller) than the adaptatory effect, the map is attractive (repulsive).\nSecond, in the absence of growth dynamics, populations can only form a single\naggregate. Therefore, the presence of intraspecific competition is necessary to\ndrive multi-peaked aggregations, reflecting higher-frequency spatial patterns.\nFinally, we show how subcritical bifurcations can trigger abrupt shifts in\naverage population abundance, suggesting a tipping-point phenomenon in which\nmoderate changes in movement parameters can cause a sudden population decline.",

We present SAINT, a training-free token pruning framework that\nleverages token similarity and a graph-based formulation to dynamically\noptimize pruning rates and redundancy thresholds. Through systematic analysis,\nwe identify a universal three-stage token evolution process\n(aligner-explorer-aggregator) in transformers, enabling aggressive pruning in\nearly stages without sacrificing critical information. For ViTs, SAINT doubles\nthe throughput of ViT-H/14 at 224px with only 0.6% accuracy loss on\nImageNet-1K, surpassing the closest competitor by 0.8%. For VLMs, we apply\nSAINT in three modes: ViT-only, LLM-only, and hybrid.

In this\npaper, we introduce AugGen, a self-contained synthetic augmentation technique.\nAugGen strategically samples from a class-conditional generative model trained\nexclusively on the target FR dataset, eliminating the need for external\nresources. Evaluated across 8 FR benchmarks, including IJB-C and IJB-B, our\nmethod achieves 1-12% performance improvements, outperforming models trained\nsolely on real data and surpassing state-of-the-art synthetic data generation\napproaches, while using less real data.

    "abstract": "In this paper we consider two-opinion voter models on dynamic random graphs,\nin which the joint dynamics of opinions and graphs acts as one-way feedback,\ni.e., edges appear and disappear over time depending on the opinions of the two\nconnected vertices, while the opinion dynamics does not depend on the edge\nprocess. Our goal is to investigate the joint evolution of the entries of a\nvoter subgraph count vector, i.e., vector of subgraphs where each vertex has a\nspecific opinion, in the regime that the number of vertices grows large. The\nmain result of this paper is a functional central limit theorem. In particular,\nwe prove that, under a proper centering and scaling, the joint functional of\nthe vector of subgraph counts converges to a specific multidimensional Gaussian\nprocess.",

We have measured temperature-dependent magnetization of a sample for\n$x$ = 0.028 down to 0.1 K at various constant magnetic fields to extract the\ncharacteristic behaviors due to the quadrupolar Kondo effect. The Curie--Weiss\nfit to the magnetic susceptibility between 50 and 300 K yields a negative\nparamagnetic Curie temperature of $-$7.0 K, indicative of on-site\nantiferromagnetic interaction. The magnetization divided by magnetic field,\n$M(T)/B$, at $B = 0.5$ T is saturated to a constant value below 3 K. On the\ncontrary, in higher magnetic fields of $B$ = 1 and 2 T, $M(T)/B$ exhibits\n$-$ln$T$ dependence from 1 to 0.1 K, which temperature dependence is consistent\nwith that of the quadrupolar susceptibility detected from ultrasonic\nmeasurements. The $-$ln$T$ form of $M(T)/B$ appears to reflect the behavior of\nquadrupolar susceptibility, through the magnetic-field-induced magnetic moment\ndue to the mixing of the non-Kramers doublet and crystalline-electric-field\nexcited states of Pr$^{3+}$. In $B$ = 4 T, $M(T)/B$ approaches a constant on\ncooling below 0.3 K, because of the quenching of the quadrupoles in the\nfield-induced singlet ground state.",

    "abstract": "For Maxwell's equations with nonlinear polarization we prove the existence of\ntime-periodic breather solutions travelling along slab or cylindrical\nwaveguides. The solutions are TE-modes which are localized in space directions\northogonal to the direction of propagation. We assume a magnetically inactive\nand electrically nonlinear material law with a linear $\\chi^{(1)}$- and a cubic\n$\\chi^{(3)}$-contribution to the polarization. The $\\chi^{(1)}$-contribution\nmay be retarded in time or instantaneous whereas the $\\chi^{(3)}$-contribution\nis always assumed to be retarded in time. We consider two different cubic\nnonlinearities which provide a variational structure under suitable assumptions\non the retardation kernels. By choosing a sufficiently small propagation speed\nalong the waveguide the second order formulation of the Maxwell system becomes\nessentially elliptic for the $\\mathbf{E}$-field so that solutions can be\nconstructed by the mountain pass theorem. The compactness issues arising in the\nvariational method are overcome by either the cylindrical geometry itself or by\nextra assumptions on the linear and nonlinear parts of the polarization in case\nof the slab geometry. Our approach to breather solutions in the presence of\ntime-retardation is systematic in the sense that we look for general conditions\non the Fourier-coefficients in time of the retardation kernels.

To assess the reliability of neural network potentials, a series of\ntests is conducted during model training, in the gas phase, and in the\ncondensed phase. The testing procedure is performed for eight in-house neural\nnetwork potentials based on the ANI-2x dataset, using both the ANI-2x and MACE\narchitectures. This allows an evaluation of the effect of the model\narchitecture on its performance. We also perform stability tests of the\npublicly available neural network potentials ANI-2x, ANI-1ccx, MACE-OFF23, and\nAIMNet2. A normal mode analysis of 14 simple benchmark molecules revealed that\nthe small MACE-OFF23 model shows large deviations from the reference\nquantum-mechanical energy surface. Also, some MACE models with a reduced number\nof parameters failed to produce stable molecular dynamics simulations in the\ngas phase, and all MACE models exhibit unfavorable behavior during steric\nclashes. The published ANI-2x and one of the in-house MACE models are not able\nto reproduce the structure of liquid water at ambient conditions, forming an\namorphous solid phase instead. The ANI-1ccx model shows nonphysical additional\nenergy minima in bond length and bond angle space, which caused a phase\ntransition to an amorphous solid. Out of all 13 considered public and in-house\nmodels, only one in-house model based on the ANI-2x B97-3c dataset shows better\nagreement with the experimental radial distribution function of water than the\nsimple molecular mechanics TIP3P model.

The model allows for general\ncurvature and width variation in two-dimensional ducts, and general curvature\nand torsion with radial width variation in three-dimensional ducts. The\nequations of gas dynamics are perturbed and expanded to second order, allowing\nfor wave steepening and the formation of weak shocks.

A linear matrix\nadmittance and its weakly-nonlinear generalization to a tensor convolution are\nfirst solved throughout the duct, and then used to solve for the acoustic\npressures and velocities. The admittance is useful in its own right, as it\nencodes the acoustic and weakly-nonlinear properties of the duct independently\nfrom the specific wave source used. After validation, a number of numerical\nexamples are presented that compare two- and three-dimensional results, the\neffects of torsion, curvature and width variation, acoustic leakage due to\ncurvature and nonlinearity, and the variation in effective duct length of a\ncurved duct due to varying the acoustic amplitude.

Although previous studies have demonstrated bubble\nmanipulation using photo-responsive surfactants, a comprehensive understanding\nof how fluid behavior is affected by critical parameters, such as bubble size,\nillumination, photo-switching kinetics, concentration, and adsorption\ndesorption kinetics, remains elusive.

The results of statistical analyses and causal forest modeling\nreveal that nudging led to an increase in conservation intentions among\n86.9%-98.0% of the participants. LLM-powered nudging achieved a maximum\nincrease of 18.0% in conservation intentions, surpassing traditional nudging by\n88.6%. Furthermore, structural equation modeling results reveal that exposure\nto LLM-powered nudges enhances self-efficacy and outcome expectations while\ndiminishing dependence on social norms, thereby increasing intrinsic motivation\nto conserve.

The matter in the core is modeled as a system of\ntwo fluids, namely neutrons and charged particles, with slightly different\nvelocity fields, controlled by their mutual collisional friction. This problem\nwas addressed in our previous work through the so-called ``fictitious\nfriction'' approach. We study the validity of our previous work and improve it\nby comparing the fictitious friction approach to alternatives, making\napproximations that allow it to be applied to arbitrary magnetic field\nstrengths and using realistic equations of state. We assume the neutron star\ncrust to be perfectly resistive, so its magnetic field reacts instantaneously\nto changes in the core, in which we neglect the effects of Cooper pairing. We\nexplore different approaches to solve the equations to obtain the velocities\nand chemical potential perturbations induced by a given, fixed magnetic field\nconfiguration in the core. We also present a new version of our code to perform\ntime-evolving simulations and discuss the results obtained with it. Our\ncalculations without fictitious friction further confirm that bulk velocity is\ngenerally much greater than ambipolar velocity, leading to faster evolution.\nThese findings align with those with fictitious friction, validating this\napproach. We also find that, in the long term, the star evolves towards a\nbarotropic ``Grad-Shafranov equilibrium,'' where the magnetic force is fully\nbalanced by charged particle fluid forces. Qualitatively, the evolution and the\nfinal equilibrium are independent of the magnetic field strength $B$ and the\nequation of state considered. The timescale to reach this equilibrium is\nproportional to $B^{-2}$ and becomes shorter for equations of state with a\nsmaller gradient of the ratio between the densities of protons and neutrons.",

The\ndynamical core has recently been developed by the Met Office and uses an\niterated-semi-implicit time discretisation and mixed finite-element spatial\ndiscretisation.\n  The essential part of the adaptation is the addition of the LBCs to the\nright-hand-side of the linear system which solves for pressure and momentum\nsimultaneously. The impacts on the associated Helmholtz preconditioner and\nmultigrid techniques are also described.\n  The regional version of the dynamical core is validated through big-brother\nexperiments based on idealised dynamical core tests. These experiments\ndemonstrate that the subdomain results are consistent with those from the full\ndomain, confirming the correct application of LBCs. Inconsistencies arise in\ncases where the LBCs are not perfect, but it is shown that the application of\nblending can be used to overcome these problems.",

    "abstract": "Capturing the structure of a population and characterising contacts within\nthe population are key to reliable projections of infectious disease. Two main\nelements of population structure -- contact heterogeneity and age -- have been\nrepeatedly demonstrated to be key in infection dynamics, yet are rarely\ncombined. Regarding individuals as nodes and contacts as edges within a network\nprovides a powerful and intuitive method to fully realise this population\nstructure. While there are a few key examples of contact networks being\nmeasured explicitly, in general we need to construct the appropriate networks\nfrom individual-level data. Here, using data from social contact surveys, we\ndevelop a generic and robust algorithm to generate an extrapolated network that\npreserves both age-structured mixing and heterogeneity in the number of\ncontacts. We then use these networks to simulate the spread of infection\nthrough the population, constrained to have a given basic reproduction number\n($R_0$) and hence a given early growth rate. Given the over-dominant role that\nhighly connected nodes (`superspreaders') would otherwise play in early\ndynamics, we scale transmission by the average duration of contacts, providing\na better match to surveillance data for numbers of secondary cases. This\nnetwork-based model shows that, for COVID-like parameters, including both\nheterogeneity and age-structure reduces both peak height and epidemic size\ncompared to models that ignore heterogeneity. Our robust methodology therefore\nallows for the inclusion of the full wealth of data commonly collected by\nsurveys but frequently overlooked to be incorporated into more realistic\ntransmission models of infectious diseases.",

Even smaller regions with\nbipolar and multipolar magnetic fields can generate coronal bright points\n(CBPs). Aims. We performed a statistical analysis of 346 CBPs.

The longest such\ninterval contains 12 consecutive days of full-disk images from the EUV channels\nof the SDO-AIA instrument. To analyze the properties of CBPs, we employed an\nautomated tracking algorithm to follow the evolution of the CBPs.

We provide statistics on the magnetic polarity,\nemergence, and merging of CBPs. We established a relationship between the CBP's\nmerging behavior and both its shape and magnetic polarities.

    "abstract": "Text-to-video generation poses significant challenges due to the inherent\ncomplexity of video data, which spans both temporal and spatial dimensions. It\nintroduces additional redundancy, abrupt variations, and a domain gap between\nlanguage and vision tokens while generation. Addressing these challenges\nrequires an effective video tokenizer that can efficiently encode video data\nwhile preserving essential semantic and spatiotemporal information, serving as\na critical bridge between text and vision. Inspired by the observation in\nVQ-VAE-2 and workflows of traditional animation, we propose HiTVideo for\ntext-to-video generation with hierarchical tokenizers. It utilizes a 3D causal\nVAE with a multi-layer discrete token framework, encoding video content into\nhierarchically structured codebooks. Higher layers capture semantic information\nwith higher compression, while lower layers focus on fine-grained\nspatiotemporal details, striking a balance between compression efficiency and\nreconstruction quality. Our approach efficiently encodes longer video sequences\n(e.g., 8 seconds, 64 frames), reducing bits per pixel (bpp) by approximately\n70\\% compared to baseline tokenizers, while maintaining competitive\nreconstruction quality. We explore the trade-offs between compression and\nreconstruction, while emphasizing the advantages of high-compressed semantic\ntokens in text-to-video tasks. HiTVideo aims to address the potential\nlimitations of existing video tokenizers in text-to-video generation tasks,\nstriving for higher compression ratios and simplify LLMs modeling under\nlanguage guidance, offering a scalable and promising framework for advancing\ntext to video generation.

For\nsufficiently strong coupling, an instability arises and unbounded system growth\nensues in the absence of mechanical load. Unexpectedly, the same type of\ninstability can lead to perfect stability under mechanical load, whereby\nadhesion clusters adjust their size to withstand arbitrarily large forces\nwithout breaking, a phenomenon we term perfect stabilization. We derive state\ndiagrams that characterize adhesion stability under stationary loads and show\nthat perfect stabilization also occurs under dynamic loading on physiologically\nrelevant timescales.

This\nprotection emerges from time-reversal symmetry, which pairs Kramers partners of\nhelical edge modes with opposite spin and momentum, thereby strictly forbidding\nelastic single-particle backscattering within the pair. Yet, contrary to the\nidealized notion of linear edge bands, the non-monotonic dispersions of\nrealistic materials can host multiple Kramers pairs, reintroducing\nbackscattering channels between them without violating time-reversal symmetry.\nHere, we investigate inter-Kramers pair backscattering in the non-linear edge\nbands of the QSHI indenene, highlighting a critical aspect of edge-state\nstability. Using quasiparticle interference in scanning tunneling spectroscopy\n-- a direct probe of backscattering -- we observe pairwise coupling between\nenergy-degenerate Kramers pairs, while energy regions with only a single\nKramers pair remain strictly protected. Supported by theoretical analysis, our\nfindings provide an unprecedented experimental demonstration of edge state\nbackscattering fully consistent with their underlying topological protection.\nThis insight has profound implications for numerous QSHI candidates,\nemphasizing that the mere presence of gap-traversing edge modes does not\ninherently guarantee their protection against backscattering.",

    "abstract": "As a significant application of multi-source information fusion in\nintelligent transportation perception systems, Referring Multi-Object Tracking\n(RMOT) involves localizing and tracking specific objects in video sequences\nbased on language references. However, existing RMOT approaches often treat\nlanguage descriptions as holistic embeddings and struggle to effectively\nintegrate the rich semantic information contained in language expressions with\nvisual features. This limitation is especially apparent in complex scenes\nrequiring comprehensive understanding of both static object attributes and\nspatial motion information. In this paper, we propose a Cognitive\nDisentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CDRMT) framework that\naddresses these challenges. It adapts the \"what\" and \"where\" pathways from the\nhuman visual processing system to RMOT tasks. Specifically, our framework first\nestablishes cross-modal connections while preserving modality-specific\ncharacteristics. It then disentangles language descriptions and hierarchically\ninjects them into object queries, refining object understanding from coarse to\nfine-grained semantic levels. Finally, we reconstruct language representations\nbased on visual features, ensuring that tracked objects faithfully reflect the\nreferring expression. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that CDRMT achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art\nmethods, with average gains of 6.0% in HOTA score on Refer-KITTI and 3.2% on\nRefer-KITTI-V2.

Consequently, it is difficult to\nmeasure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events)\nin videos or merely relies on pre-trained \"memory\" of co-occurrences as biases\nin generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal\nReasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings.

    "abstract": "Quantum circuit cutting refers to a series of techniques that allow one to\npartition a quantum computation on a large quantum computer into several\nquantum computations on smaller devices. This usually comes at the price of a\nsampling overhead, that is quantified by the $1$-norm of the associated\ndecomposition. The applicability of these techniques relies on the possibility\nof finding decompositions of the ideal, global unitaries into quantum\noperations that can be simulated onto each sub-register, which should ideally\nminimize the $1$-norm. In this work, we show how these decompositions can be\nobtained diagrammatically using ZX-calculus expanding on the work of Ufrecht et\nal. [arXiv:2302.00387]. The central idea of our work is that since in\nZX-calculus only connectivity matters, it should be possible to cut wires in\nZX-diagrams by inserting known decompositions of the identity in standard\nquantum circuits. We show how, using this basic idea, many of the gate\ndecompositions known in the literature can be re-interpreted as an instance of\nwire cuts in ZX-diagrams. Furthermore, we obtain improved decompositions for\nmulti-qubit controlled-Z (MCZ) gates with $1$-norm equal to $3$ for any number\nof qubits and any partition, which we argue to be optimal. Our work gives new\nways of thinking about circuit cutting that can be particularly valuable for\nfinding decompositions of large unitary gates. Besides, it sheds light on the\nquestion of why exploiting classical communication decreases the 1-norm of a\nwire cut but does not do so for certain gate decompositions. In particular,\nusing wire cuts with classical communication, we obtain gate decompositions\nthat do not require classical communication.",

Symmetric\nstress approximations of lower polynomial order are only possible when their\ndiv-conformity is weakened to the continuity of normal-normal components. In\ntwo dimensions, this condition is meant pointwise along edges for piecewise\npolynomials, but a corresponding characterization for general piecewise H(div)\ntensors has been elusive. We introduce such a space and establish a continuous\nmixed formulation of linear planar elasticity with pointwise symmetric stresses\nthat have, in a distributional sense, continuous normal-normal components\nacross the edges of a shape-regular triangulation. The displacement is split\ninto an $L_2$ field and a tangential trace on the skeleton of the mesh. The\nwell-posedness of the new mixed formulation follows with a duality lemma\nrelating the normal-normal continuous stresses with the tangential traces of\ndisplacements. For this new formulation we present a lowest-order conforming\ndiscretization. Stresses are approximated by piecewise quadratic symmetric\ntensors, whereas displacements are discretized by piecewise linear polynomials.\nThe tangential displacement trace acts as a Lagrange multiplier and guarantees\nglobal div-conformity in the limit as the mesh-size tends to zero.

    "abstract": "The noisy nature of quantum hardware necessitates the implementation of\nhigh-fidelity quantum gates in a noise-insensitive manner. While there exist\nmany powerful methods for designing dynamically corrected gates, they typically\ninvolve an exploration across a large-dimensional landscape filled with\nsolutions that are only locally optimal, making it challenging to find globally\noptimal ones. Moreover, these methods often use a single cost function to try\nto accomplish the two disparate goals of achieving a target gate and\nsuppressing noise, and this can lead to unnecessary tradeoffs between the two\nand, consequently, lower fidelities. Here, we present a method for designing\ndynamically corrected gates called B\\'ezier Ansatz for Robust Quantum (BARQ)\ncontrol to address these challenges. Rather than numerically optimizing the\ncontrols directly, BARQ instead makes use of the Space Curve Quantum Control\nformalism in which the quantum evolution is mapped to a geometric space curve.\nIn the formulation used by BARQ, the boundary conditions of the space curve\ndetermine the target gate, while its shape determines the noise robustness of\nthe corresponding gate. This allows the target gate to be fixed upfront, so\nthat numerical optimization is only needed to achieve noise-robustness, and\nthis is performed efficiently using a control-point parameterization of the\nspace curve. In this way, BARQ eliminates the gate-fixing and noise-robustness\ntradeoff while also providing a global perspective into the control landscape,\nand allows for ample freedom to design experimentally friendly and robust\ncontrol pulses.

We introduce\na general scenario reduction method for distributionally robust optimization\n(DRO), which includes stochastic and robust optimization as special cases. Our\napproach constructs the reduced DRO problem by projecting the original\nambiguity set onto a reduced set of scenarios. Under mild conditions, we\nestablish bounds on the relative quality of the reduction. The methodology is\napplicable to random variables following either discrete or continuous\nprobability distributions, with representative scenarios appropriately selected\nin both cases. Given the relevance of optimization problems with linear and\nquadratic objectives, we further refine our approach for these settings.\nFinally, we demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on\nmixed-integer benchmark instances from MIPLIB and portfolio optimization\nproblems.

Causal discovery offers an alternative to\nconventional approaches by generating cause-and-effect hypotheses from\nobservational data. However, it often relies on strong or untestable\nassumptions, which can limit its practical application. This work aims to make\ncausal discovery more practical by considering multiple assumptions and\nidentifying heterogeneous effects. We formulate the problem of discovering\ncauses and effect modifiers of an outcome, where effect modifiers are contexts\n(e.g., age groups) with heterogeneous causal effects. Then, we present a novel,\nend-to-end framework that incorporates an ensemble of causal discovery\nalgorithms and estimation of heterogeneous effects to discover causes and\neffect modifiers that trigger or inhibit the outcome. We demonstrate that the\nensemble approach improves robustness by enhancing recall of causal factors\nwhile maintaining precision.

However, recent research has shown that this assumption can\nlead to severely misleading results if treatment effects vary with exposure\ntime, i.e. time since the intervention started. Models that account for\ntime-varying treatment effects, such as the exposure time indicator (ETI)\nmodel, allow researchers to target estimands such as the time-averaged\ntreatment effect (TATE) over an interval of exposure time, or the point\ntreatment effect (PTE) representing a treatment contrast at one time point.\nHowever, this increased flexibility results in reduced power. In this paper, we\nuse public power calculation software and simulation to characterize factors\naffecting SW-CRT power. Key elements include choice of estimand, study design\nconsiderations, and analysis model selection. For common SW-CRT designs, the\nsample size (individuals per cluster-period) must be increased by a factor of\nroughly 2.5 to 3 to maintain 90\\% power when switching from an IT model to an\nETI model (targeting the TATE over the entire study). However, the inflation\nfactor is lower when considering TATE estimands over shorter periods that\nexclude longer exposure times for which there is limited information. In\ngeneral, SW-CRT designs (including the ``staircase'' variant) have much greater\npower for estimating ``short-term effects'' relative to ``long-term effects''.\nFor an ETI model targeting a TATE estimand, substantial power can be gained by\nadding time points to the start of the study or increasing baseline sample\nsize, but surprisingly little power is gained from adding time points to the\nend of the study. More restrictive choices for modeling the exposure time...\n[truncated]",

However, the\nchemical forms of these NH-rich compounds, whether associated with N-rich\norganics, ammonium (NH4+) salts, NH4 or NH-organics-bearing phyllosilicates, or\nother forms, remain to be better understood. In this study, we report the\ncharacterization of two Ryugu particles (C0050 and C0052) using multi-scale\ninfrared (mm-reflectance, micro-FTIR, and nano-AFM-IR) and NanoSIMS techniques\nto constrain the nature and origin of NH-bearing components in the Ryugu\nasteroid. Our findings show that Ryugu's C0052 particle contains rare,\nmicrometer-sized NH-rich organic compounds with peaks at 1660 cm-1 (mainly due\nto C=O stretching of the amide I band) and 1550 cm-1 (mainly due to N-H bending\nvibration mode of the amide II band), indicative of amide-related compounds. In\ncontrast, these compounds are absent in C0050. Notably, nitrogen isotopic\nanalysis reveals that these amides in C0052 are depleted in 15N (d15N = -215\n+/- 92 permil), confirming their indigenous origin, while carbon and hydrogen\nisotopic compositions are indistinguishable from terrestrial values within\nerrors (d13C = -22 +/- 52 and dD = 194 +/- 368 permil). The amides detected in\nC0052 could have formed through hydrothermal alteration from carboxylic acids\nand amines precursors on the Ryugu's parent planetesimal. Alternatively, they\ncould have originated from the irradiation of 15N-depleted N-bearing ice by UV\nlight or galactic cosmic rays, either at the surface of the asteroid in the\nouter Solar System or on mantle of interstellar dust grains in the interstellar\nmedium. Amides delivered to early Earth by primitive small bodies, such as\nasteroid Ryugu, may have played a crucial role in prebiotic chemistry.",

This paper demonstrates that\nglobal solutions of economic models with substantial heterogeneity and\nfrictions can be computed accurately and swiftly by augmenting Dynare with\nadaptive sparse grids (SGs) and high-dimensional model representation (HDMR).\nSGs mitigate the curse of dimensionality, as the number of grid points grows\nsignificantly slower than in traditional tensor-product Cartesian grids.\nAdditionally, adaptivity focuses grid refinement on regions with steep\ngradients or non-differentiabilities, enhancing computational efficiency.\nComplementing SGs, HDMR tackles large state spaces by approximating policy\nfunctions with a hierarchical expansion of low-dimensional terms.

Our study is novel in that we consider pile\nshuffle in three variations: (1) using queue-like piles, (2) using stack-like\npiles, and (3) using a heterogeneous mixture of those two pile types, either\ngiven or decided during the shuffle by the dealer herself. We first\ncharacterize the sortable permutations of one or more sequential rounds of pile\nshuffle, under constraints on the number and types of piles to be used, and\nthen derive formulas to obtain a sorting shuffle of a given permutation on the\nminimum number of piles, efficiently, whenever feasible. In the process, we\npresent an interesting mathematical interpretation of any multi-round shuffle\non fixed-type piles, as a single-round shuffle on a generally larger number of\nfixed-type ``virtual piles''; we confirm that repetition augments the power of\npile shuffle exponentially, in that $m$ piles over $T$ rounds enjoys the\ncapacity of $m^T$ piles in a single round. Finally, we motivate a forthcoming\ncompanion paper in which we prove that dealer choice -- where the dealer is\nallowed to choose the types of the piles during the shuffle -- makes deciding\nfeasibility of sort NP-Hard for some variants of multi-round pile shuffle;\nproof is by a novel reduction from Boolean satisfiability (SAT).",

Traditional discrete systems struggle with rough\nterrain due to limited individual mobility, while modular systems--where rigid,\ncontrollable constraints link robot units--improve traversal but suffer from\nhigh control complexity and reduced flexibility. To address these limitations,\nwe propose the Multi-Robot System with Controllable Weak Constraints (MRS-CWC),\nwhere robot units are connected by constraints with dynamically adjustable\nstiffness. This adaptive mechanism softens or stiffens in real-time during\nenvironmental interactions, ensuring a balance between flexibility and\nmobility.

These tiny ejections propagate roughly perpendicular\nto the flaring loops. They often originate as dot-like structures with a length\nscale of approximately $10^{3}$ km. While these initial dot-like shapes are\nobservable in EUI images, they remain undetectable in the images captured by\nthe Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. As\nthey propagate, these dot-like structures consistently evolve into loop-like\nformations, possibly due to the heating of the surrounding magnetic field.\nRather than being generated by a series of flux rope eruptions, the tiny\nejections appear to result from small-angle magnetic reconnections within a\nbipolar field.

To fix this problem, we propose a\nMulti-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework\nand reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs\nfor different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by\nrandomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each\nnode in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by\nconsidering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated\nwith any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on\nmultiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and\nshow that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling\nmethod, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the\nencoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the\nkey to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less\nimportant according to domain knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the factors that impact how a communicable disease like\nCOVID-19 spreads is of central importance to mitigate future outbreaks.\nTraditionally, epidemic surveillance and forecasting analyses have focused on\nepidemiological data but recent advancements have demonstrated that monitoring\nbehavioural changes may be equally important. Prior studies have shown that\nhigh-frequency survey data on social contact behaviour were able to improve\npredictions of epidemiological observables during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet,\nthe full potential of such highly granular survey data remains debated. Here,\nwe utilise daily nationally representative survey data from Denmark collected\nduring 23 months of the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate two central use-cases\nfor such high-frequency survey data. First, we show that complex behavioural\npatterns across demographics collapse to a small number of universal key\nfeatures, greatly simplifying the monitoring and analysis of adherence to\noutbreak-mitigation measures. Notably, the temporal evolution of the\nself-reported median number of face-to-face contacts follows a universal\nbehavioural pattern across age groups, with potential to simplify analysis\nefforts for future outbreaks. Second, we show that these key features can be\nleveraged to improve deep-learning-based predictions of daily reported new\ninfections. In particular, our models detect a strong link between aggregated\nself-reported social distancing and hygiene behaviours and the number of new\ncases in the subsequent days. Taken together, our results highlight the value\nof high-frequency surveys to improve our understanding of population behaviour\nin an ongoing public health crisis and its potential use for prediction of\ncentral epidemiological observables.",

We performed Hamiltonian\nray tracing simulations of magneto-gravity waves to investigate the suppression\nof the multipole modes in the presence of an internal dipole-like magnetic\nfield. We took into account different stellar masses, metallicities, and ages,\nas well as various oscillation frequencies and spherical degrees. In\nparticular, we estimated the trapped fraction, a measure of multipole mode\nsuppression, which quantifies the fraction of mode energy in the core that is\ndissipated by the interaction with the magnetic field. Our results indicate\nthat the trapped fraction can be described by a simple expression, which\nsmoothly connects the regime without multipole mode suppression with the regime\nwith complete suppression of the multipole modes. Crucially, the trapped\nfraction depends only on the ratio between the strength of the internal\nmagnetic field and the critical field strength.

However, the challenge lies in automatically\nidentifying valuable subsets from large datasets to boost both the\neffectiveness and efficiency of instruction tuning. In this paper, we first\nestablish data selection criteria based on three distinct aspects of data\nvalue: diversity, difficulty, and dependability, and then propose the D3 method\ncomprising two key steps of scoring and selection. Specifically, in the scoring\nstep, we define the diversity function to measure sample distinctiveness and\nintroduce the uncertainty-based prediction difficulty to evaluate sample\ndifficulty by mitigating the interference of context-oriented generation\ndiversity. Additionally, we integrate an external LLM for dependability\nassessment. In the selection step, we formulate the D3 weighted coreset\nobjective, which jointly optimizes three aspects of data value to solve for the\nmost valuable subset. The two steps of D3 can iterate multiple rounds,\nincorporating feedback to refine the selection focus adaptively. Experiments on\nboth public datasets and the real-world Taobao Live application demonstrate the\neffectiveness of D3 in endowing LLMs with competitive or even superior\ninstruction-following capabilities using less than 10\\% of the entire dataset.",

In this study, the FFM\nbehavior of a diamond tip is compared with that of the silicon tip. The diamond\ntip exhibited a similar abrupt increase in friction, but the threshold normal\nforce was approximately twice as high for comparable tip radii. Simulations of\ngraphene on SiC(0001) sliding against hydroxylated amorphous carbon (a-C) and\nsilicon oxide (SiO2) slabs show that both systems exhibit low shear stress at\nlow pressures, which increases at higher pressures due to bond formation\nbetween the graphene and counter slabs. The pressure dependence differs\nslightly: SiO2 reaches a shear stress plateau around 6 GPa, while a-C continues\nto increase gradually. For a-C, the transition threshold shifts to higher\npressures, consistent with FFM results. Temperature lowers the transition\nthreshold significantly, while sliding velocity has minimal impact on shear\nstress. These findings provide insights into the stability of low-friction\ninterfaces between epitaxial graphene and the key materials which come into\ncontact with graphene in current micro-electro-mechanical systems.",

In real-world\nsituaiton, we observe that the tail class samples are more likely to be\nmislabeled as head, exacerbating the original degree of imbalance. We call this\nphenomenon as ``tail-to-head (T2H)'' noise. T2H noise severely degrades model\nperformance by polluting the head classes and forcing the model to learn the\ntail samples as head. To address this challenge, we investigate the dynamic\nmisleading process of the nosiy labels and propose a novel method called\nDisentangling and Unlearning for Long-tailed and Label-noisy data (DULL). It\nfirst employs the Inner-Feature Disentangling (IFD) to disentangle feature\ninternally. Based on this, the Inner-Feature Partial Unlearning (IFPU) is then\napplied to weaken and unlearn incorrect feature regions correlated to wrong\nclasses. This method prevents the model from being misled by noisy labels,\nenhancing the model's robustness against noise. To provide a controlled\nexperimental environment, we further propose a new noise addition algorithm to\nsimulate T2H noise. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Video inpainting involves modifying local regions within a video, ensuring\nspatial and temporal consistency. Most existing methods focus primarily on\nscene completion (i.e., filling missing regions) and lack the capability to\ninsert new objects into a scene in a controllable manner. Fortunately, recent\nadvancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models pave the way for\ntext-guided video inpainting. However, directly adapting T2V models for\ninpainting remains limited in unifying completion and insertion tasks, lacks\ninput controllability, and struggles with long videos, thereby restricting\ntheir applicability and flexibility. To address these challenges, we propose\nMTV-Inpaint, a unified multi-task video inpainting framework capable of\nhandling both traditional scene completion and novel object insertion tasks. To\nunify these distinct tasks, we design a dual-branch spatial attention mechanism\nin the T2V diffusion U-Net, enabling seamless integration of scene completion\nand object insertion within a single framework. In addition to textual\nguidance, MTV-Inpaint supports multimodal control by integrating various image\ninpainting models through our proposed image-to-video (I2V) inpainting mode.\nAdditionally, we propose a two-stage pipeline that combines keyframe inpainting\nwith in-between frame propagation, enabling MTV-Inpaint to effectively handle\nlong videos with hundreds of frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMTV-Inpaint achieves state-of-the-art performance in both scene completion and\nobject insertion tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates versatility in derived\napplications such as multi-modal inpainting, object editing, removal, image\nobject brush, and the ability to handle long videos.

    "abstract": "The United States has long pursued regulations that aim to reduce fossil fuel\nuse. However, while potential emission reduction motivates the introduction and\nenforcement of these regulations, realization of this potential does not\nobfuscate the need for prudent economic policy. Scrutinizing nearly two decades\nof climate regulations in the transportation, industrial, and electric power\nsector, we enumerate their associated cost effectiveness. Our findings are\ntwofold. Firstly, we find that whereas there are instances where climate\nregulations carry net economic benefits, there are also cases where compliance\ncosts substantially exceed the social cost of carbon (SCC). Aggregated across\nsectors and subject to the precise SCC leveraged, up to 65 percent of climate\nregulations have abatement costs that exceed the SCC. This exceedance is\nparticularly profound in the transportation sector where up to 82 percent of\nregulations reviewed have abatement costs that exceed the SCC. Secondly, we\nfind that whereas the economic benefits of climate regulations generally exceed\nthe economic costs, this exceedance is largely contingent on the presence of\nnon-climate benefits. Aggregated across sectors, climate benefits account for\n33 percent of overall benefits associated with a regulation, compared to 18,\n46, and 2 percent for public health, private, and other benefits respectively.\nFurthermore, we document instances where climate benefits account for as little\nas 1.6 percent of overall regulatory benefits. This finding hints at a\nregulatory inefficiency and raises the prospect that alternative, non-climate\nspecific regulation may be a more appropriate mechanism for realizing the\nnon-climate benefits associated with these regulations.

Indeed, most of previous work look at the frequency with which\ncommercial code generators recommend low-quality code without the possibility\nof relating this to their training set. We investigate the extent to which\nlow-quality code instances seen during training affect the quality of the code\ngenerated at inference time. We start by fine-tuning a pre-trained DL model on\na large-scale dataset being representative of those usually adopted in the\ntraining of code generators.

The framework structures scenario\nunderstanding along the four core capability dimensions semantic, spatial,\ntemporal, and physical. They are derived from the general requirements of\nautonomous driving systems, human driver cognition, and language-based\nreasoning. It further organises the domain into context layers, processing\nmodalities, and downstream tasks such as language-based interaction and\ndecision-making. To illustrate the framework's applicability, two exemplary\ntraffic scenarios are analysed, grounding the proposed dimensions in realistic\ndriving situations. The framework provides a foundation for the structured\nevaluation of MLLMs' potential for scenario understanding in autonomous\ndriving.",

    "abstract": "Quantum nonreciprocity-a fundamental phenomenon enabling directional control\nof quantum states and photon correlations-has long been recognized as pivotal\nfor quantum technologies. However, the experimental realization of\nnonreciprocal quantum photon-pair generation, as a critical prerequisite for\nadvancing quantum systems, continues to be an outstanding challenge that\nremains unaddressed in practice. Here, we experimentally implement a\nhighly-efficient nonreciprocal quantum photon source in a micro/nano-scale\nhelical structured nonlinear optical fluid. Intriguing helical quasi-phase\nmatching is achieved by deliberately engineering the pitch of the chiral\nferroelectric structure, thus enabling spontaneous parametric down-conversion\nwith record-high brightness (5,801.6 Hz*mW-1, 10,071% enhancement over\nphase-mismatched systems) and high coincidence-to-accidental ratio, rivaling\nstate-of-the-art centimeter-scale nonlinear crystals. In particular, by\ntailoring the ferroelectric helix structure with orthogonally aligned head and\ntail polarization vectors, we demonstrate up to 22.6 dB isolation in biphoton\ngeneration coupled with nonreciprocal quantum polarization states, while\nmaintaining classical optical reciprocity. This quantum liquid-crystal-based\nplatform, combining flexible tunability and superior performance of purely\nquantum nonreciprocity at micro/nano scales, builds a bridge between a wide\nrange of soft-matter systems, nonreciprocal physics, and emerging quantum\nphotonic technologies.",

Such high amplitudes\nshorten the life expectancy of a transformer and cause power quality issues in\npower grids. Various techniques have been proposed to minimize the inrush\ncurrent; however, the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for this\nchallenge has not been investigated. RL incorporates the ability to learn\ninrush minimization strategies adjusted to the dynamic transformer operation\nenvironment. This study proposes an inrush current minimization framework by\ncombining controlled switching with RL. Depending on the opening angle of the\ncircuit breaker and the remanent fluxes at disconnection, the proposed method\nlearns the optimal closing instant of the circuit breaker. Two RL algorithms\nhave been trained and tested through an equivalent duality-based model of a\nreal 7.4 MVA power transformer.

This study evaluated the performance of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in detecting these symptoms from secure patient\nmessages. We applied multiple approaches, including engineered prompts,\nsystemic persona, temperature adjustments, and zero-shot and few-shot learning,\nto identify the best-performing model and enhance performance. Three out of\nfive LLMs demonstrated excellent performance (over 90% of F-1 and accuracy),\nwith Llama 3.1 405B achieving 93% in both F-1 and accuracy using a zero-shot\napproach. While LLMs showed promise in binary classification and handling\ncomplex metrics like Patient Health Questionnaire-4, inconsistencies in\nchallenging cases warrant further real-life assessment. The findings highlight\nthe potential of LLMs to assist in timely screening and referrals, providing\nvaluable empirical knowledge for real-world triage systems that could improve\nmental health care for patients with chronic diseases.",

Specifically, we focus on two\nRBSOs -- the block Anderson and Wegner orbital models -- defined on the\n$d$-dimensional torus $(\\mathbb Z/L\\mathbb Z)^d$. They take the form $H=V +\n\\lambda \\Psi$, where $V$ is a block potential with i.i.d. $W^d\\times W^d$\nGaussian diagonal blocks, $\\Psi$ describes interactions between neighboring\nblocks, and $\\lambda>0$ is a coupling parameter. We normalize the blocks of\n$\\Psi$ so that each block has a Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the same order as the\nblocks of $V$. Assuming $W\\ge L^\\delta$ for a small constant $\\delta>0$ and\n$\\lambda\\gg W^{-d/2}$, we establish the following results. In dimension $d=2$,\nwe prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for bulk eigenvectors.\nCombined with the localization result from arXiv:1608.02922, which holds under\nthe condition $\\lambda\\ll W^{-d/2}$, this provides a rigorous proof of the\nAnderson localization-delocalization transition as $\\lambda$ crosses the\ncritical threshold $W^{-d/2}$.

Our results highlight\nthe critical role of the fan-spine configuration in forming the spiral jet and\nconfirm the collapse of the pre-existing magnetic null to a curved 3D current\nsheet where external reconnection takes places. It is further disclosed that\nthe flux rope quickly moves upward, reconnecting with the field lines near the\nouter spine, thereby enabling the transfer of twist and cool material from the\nflux rope to the open field, giving rise to the tiny spiral jet we observed.\nThe notable similarities between these characteristics and those for\nlarger-scale jets suggest that spiral jets, regardless of their scale,\nessentially share the same eruption mechanism.",

In\nparticular, they are valuable in investigations of high-mass star-forming\nregions that are difficult to observe at optical frequencies. We used\nmulti-transition data to derive physical conditions in the immediate\nenvironment of forming high-mass stars. Simultaneous observations of two maser\ntransitions, excited OH at 6.035 GHz and methanol at 6.668 GHz, were made using\ne-Merlin. Both transitions are radiatively pumped but prefer diverse physical\nconditions. We imaged ten high-mass star-forming sites with milliarcsecond\nangular resolution, identifying regions where excited OH and methanol masers\ncoexist and where they avoid each other. Moreover, we identified circularly\npolarized Zeeman splitting pairs of the OH transition, estimating magnetic\nfield strengths in the range from 0.2 to 10.6~mG. The detection of linearly\npolarized components enabled us to compare the directions of magnetic field\nvectors with the outflows coming from the young star-forming objects. We found\nthat the two maser lines appeared to coexist in six high-mass star-forming\nregions, in cloudlets separated by up to 205~au. Where the lines show\navoidance, this can be related to changes in dust and gas temperatures; we also\nfound a few examples suggestive of a high gas density. In seven sources,\nKolmogorov-Smirnov tests show the nonrandom relationship between the position\nangles of distribution of the two maser transitions. We did not obtain\nconsistent results regarding the direction of the magnetic field and outflow.",

    "abstract": "The stress tensor is calculated for dilute active suspensions composed of\ncolloidal Janus particles propelled by self-diffusiophoresis and powered by a\nchemical reaction. The Janus particles are assumed to be spherical and made of\ncatalytic and non-catalytic hemispheres. The chemical reaction taking place on\nthe catalytic part of each Janus particle generates local molecular\nconcentration gradients at the surface of the particle and, thus, an\ninterfacial velocity slippage between the fluid and the solid particle, which\nis the propulsion mechanism of self-diffusiophoresis. In the dilute-system\nlimit, the contributions of the suspended particles to the stress tensor are\ncalculated by solving the chemohydrodynamic equations for the fluid velocity\nand the molecular concentrations around every Janus particle considered as\nisolated and far apart from each other. The results are the following. First,\nthe well-known Einstein formula for the effective shear viscosity of colloidal\nsuspensions is recovered, including the effect of a possible Navier slip\nlength. Next, two further contributions are obtained, which depend on the\nmolecular concentrations of the fuel and product species of the chemical\nreaction and on the orientation of the Janus particles. The second contribution\nis caused by simple diffusiophoresis, which already exists in passive\nsuspensions with global concentration gradients and no reaction. The third\ncontribution is due to the self-diffusiophoresis generated by the chemical\nreaction, which arises in active suspensions. The calculation gives\nquantitative predictions, which depend on the constitutive properties of the\nfluid and the fluid-solid interfaces, as well as on the geometry of the Janus\nparticles.",

Our integrated approach provides a\ndoubly robust identification strategy for causal effects in panel data with a\ngroup structure, identifying the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT)\nunder either the parallel trends assumption or the group-level SC assumption.\nBuilding on this identification result, we develop a unified semiparametric\nframework for estimating the ATT. Notably, while the identification-robust\nmoment function satisfies Neyman orthogonality under the parallel trends\nassumption, it does not under the SC assumption, leading to different\nasymptotic variances under these two identification strategies. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a multiplier bootstrap method that consistently\napproximates the asymptotic distribution, regardless of which identification\nassumption holds. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to accommodate\nrepeated cross-sectional data and staggered treatment designs. As an empirical\napplication, we apply our method to evaluate the impact of the 2003 minimum\nwage increase in Alaska on family income.",

As such, excitation of the\n$^{229}$Th nuclear state has so far only been demonstrated in metal fluorides,\nspecifically CaF$_2$, LiSrAlF$_6$, and ThF$_4$, where the large\nelectronegativity of the halogen leads to sufficient band gaps. However, it is\nexpected that the nuclear magnetic moment of the fluorine gives rise to a\nleading order broadening mechanism that limits the clock stability. Here, we\nuse concepts of molecular design to identify a polyatomic anion, SO$_4^{2-}$,\nthat is both nuclear spin free and of sufficient electron affinity to result in\na high band gap metal sulfate system. Using state-of-the-art calculations, we\nfind that the band gap of Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ is approximately 9 eV, large enough\nfor direct laser excitation of $^{229}$Th. Low concentrations of $^{229}$Th in\nthe otherwise spinless $^{232}$Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ crystal mitigate\n$^{229}$Th-$^{229}$Th interactions. Furthermore, the introduction of $^{229}$Th\ndoes not modify the material band gap nor introduce electronic states\nassociated with nuclear quenching. By removing one of the primary sources of\nnuclear line broadening in the crystal, the nuclear magnetic dipole-dipole\ninteraction, a nuclear clock with instability as low as $\\sigma =\n4.6\\times10^{-23}/\\sqrt{\\tau}$, where ${\\tau}$ is the averaging time, may be\nrealized.

We\nfind that low-complexity convolutional models previously proposed for audio\ntagging can be effectively adapted for event detection (which requires\nframe-wise prediction) by adjusting convolutional strides, removing the global\npooling, and, importantly, adding a sequence model before the (now frame-wise)\nclassification heads.

We also investigate the impact of enhanced training\nstrategies such as knowledge distillation.

    "abstract": "Localization is one of the core parts of modern robotics. Classic\nlocalization methods typically follow the retrieve-then-register paradigm,\nachieving remarkable success. Recently, the emergence of end-to-end\nlocalization approaches has offered distinct advantages, including a\nstreamlined system architecture and the elimination of the need to store\nextensive map data. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results,\ncurrent end-to-end localization approaches still face limitations in robustness\nand accuracy. Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) image is one of the most widely adopted\ndata representations in autonomous driving. It significantly reduces data\ncomplexity while preserving spatial structure and scale consistency, making it\nan ideal representation for localization tasks. However, research on BEV-based\nend-to-end localization remains notably insufficient. To fill this gap, we\npropose BEVDiffLoc, a novel framework that formulates LiDAR localization as a\nconditional generation of poses. Leveraging the properties of BEV, we first\nintroduce a specific data augmentation method to significantly enhance the\ndiversity of input data. Then, the Maximum Feature Aggregation Module and\nVision Transformer are employed to learn robust features while maintaining\nrobustness against significant rotational view variations. Finally, we\nincorporate a diffusion model that iteratively refines the learned features to\nrecover the absolute pose. Extensive experiments on the Oxford Radar RobotCar\nand NCLT datasets demonstrate that BEVDiffLoc outperforms the baseline methods.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/BEVDiffLoc.",

The key challenge arises from depth variation induced\nspatio-temporal motion inconsistencies, disrupting the assumptions of local\nspatial or temporal motion smoothness in previous motion estimation frameworks.\nIn contrast, event cameras offer new possibilities for 3D motion estimation\nthrough continuous adaptive pixel-level responses to scene changes. This paper\npresents EMoTive, a novel event-based framework that models spatio-temporal\ntrajectories via event-guided non-uniform parametric curves, effectively\ncharacterizing locally heterogeneous spatio-temporal motion. Specifically, we\nfirst introduce Event Kymograph - an event projection method that leverages a\ncontinuous temporal projection kernel and decouples spatial observations to\nencode fine-grained temporal evolution explicitly. For motion representation,\nwe introduce a density-aware adaptation mechanism to fuse spatial and temporal\nfeatures under event guidance, coupled with a non-uniform rational curve\nparameterization framework to adaptively model heterogeneous trajectories. The\nfinal 3D motion estimation is achieved through multi-temporal sampling of\nparametric trajectories, yielding optical flow and depth motion fields.

First, we identify\naxial asymmetry in the heat flux distribution. The plasma-wetted areas extend\nalong the direction of the plasma current and deviate diagonally in the\ndirection of the NB ion's poloidal turn. Additionally, on the PFC surfaces,\nlocal heat flux peaks are observed along both poloidal and toroidal directions.\nThese local peaks emerge on the surfaces of the PFCs that protrude toward the\nregions swept by the NB ions. Second, through a case study of NB1-C (beam\nsource C of neutral beam 1) that results in the most loss, we analyze several\nchanges in the heat flux patterns observed on the divertor and the poloidal\nlimiter. Such analysis allows us to examine how variations in the parameters\naffect the movement of the peak heat flux position and the extent of the\nplasma-wetted area, if formed. We observe that the ion loss increases under\nseveral conditions: shallower beam deposition, higher beam energy, larger\npoloidal beta, and lower plasma current. Ions born near the plasma edge due to\nshallow beam injection follow orbits with a larger minor radius. Flux surface\nshifts and ion drifts from changes in beam energy, poloidal beta, and plasma\ncurrent move these orbits closer to the wall. These factors increase the chance\nof ion loss through wall collisions. This study is believed to help optimize\ndesign and operation of NBI systems.",

This paper\ninvestigated the use of invariant trajectory descriptors for robust hand palm\nmotion gesture recognition under reference frame changes. First, a novel\ndataset of recorded Hand Palm Motion (HPM) gestures is introduced. The motion\ngestures in this dataset were specifically designed to be distinguishable\nwithout dependence on specific reference frames or directional cues.\nAfterwards, multiple invariant trajectory descriptor approaches were\nbenchmarked to assess how their performances generalize to this novel HPM\ndataset. After this offline benchmarking, the best scoring approach is\nvalidated for online recognition by developing a real-time Proof of Concept\n(PoC). In this PoC, hand palm motion gestures were used to control the\nreal-time movement of a manipulator arm. The PoC demonstrated a high\nrecognition reliability in real-time operation, achieving an $F_1$-score of\n92.3%.

    "abstract": "The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galactic Center (GC) region of the\nMilky Way contains a substantial fraction of the molecular mass of the Galaxy\n>10e7 solar masses yet exhibits an order of magnitude lower star formation\nefficiency (SFE) than expected given the high densities found in this region.\nThere are multiple possible explanations for the depressed SFE in the CMZ, like\nfeedback, strong turbulence, longer free-fall timescales, and high magnetic\nfield strengths. It is currently unclear which of these mechanisms is the\ndominant inhibitor of star formation in the CMZ. It is important to understand\nthe star formation process in the extreme environment of the CMZ because it is\nthe only Galactic nuclear region we are able to study at high spatial\nresolutions with current observatories. One way to determine the relative\nimportance of the different SFE inhibiting mechanisms is through multi-spatial\nand multi-frequency polarimetric observations of the CMZ. Such observations\nwill provide insight into the behavior of the magnetic field in this unique\nenvironment. These observations will complement radio observations of\nnon-thermal structures revealing the magnetic field morphology and\npolarization. The PRobe far--Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will be\nuniquely capable of contributing to such explorations by providing unique\nresolutions and frequencies for polarimetric observations. The PRIMAger\ninstrument will yield polarimetric observations covering the wavelength range\n80 -- 261 um with beam sizes ranging from 11 -- 28'', capabilities that\ncomplement existing and upcoming observatories.",

Load sharing\nbetween the networks results in a delocalisation of stress such that the double\nnetwork inherits both the stiffness of its stiff-and-brittle sacrificial\nnetwork and the ductility of its soft-and-ductile matrix network. The\nunderlying mechanism is a reduction in the Eshelby stress propagator between\nsacrificial bonds, inhibiting the tendency for the plastic failure of one\nsacrificial bond to propagate stress to neighbouring sacrificial bonds and\ncause a follow-on cascade of breakages.

The scale of modern neural networks, however, complicates the use\nof many theoretically well-motivated approaches such as full Bayesian\ninference. Approximate methods like deep ensembles can provide reliable\nuncertainty estimates but still remain computationally expensive. In this work,\nwe propose contextual similarity distillation, a novel approach that explicitly\nestimates the variance of an ensemble of deep neural networks with a single\nmodel, without ever learning or evaluating such an ensemble in the first place.\nOur method builds on the predictable learning dynamics of wide neural networks,\ngoverned by the neural tangent kernel, to derive an efficient approximation of\nthe predictive variance of an infinite ensemble. Specifically, we reinterpret\nthe computation of ensemble variance as a supervised regression problem with\nkernel similarities as regression targets. The resulting model can estimate\npredictive variance at inference time with a single forward pass, and can make\nuse of unlabeled target-domain data or data augmentations to refine its\nuncertainty estimates. We empirically validate our method across a variety of\nout-of-distribution detection benchmarks and sparse-reward reinforcement\nlearning environments. We find that our single-model method performs\ncompetitively and sometimes superior to ensemble-based baselines and serves as\na reliable signal for efficient exploration.

    "abstract": "Mathematical morphology, a field within image processing, includes various\nfilters that either highlight, modify, or eliminate certain information in\nimages based on an application's needs. Key operations in these filters are\ndilation and erosion, which determine the supremum or infimum for each pixel\nwith respect to an order of the tonal values over a subset of the image\nsurrounding the pixel. This subset is formed by a structuring element at the\nspecified pixel, which weighs the tonal values. Unlike grey-scale morphology,\nwhere tonal order is clearly defined, colour morphology lacks a definitive\ntotal order. As no method fully meets all desired properties for colour,\nbecause of this difficulty, some limitations are always present.\n  This paper shows how to combine the theory of the log-exp-supremum of colour\nmatrices that employs the Loewner semi-order with a well-known colour distance\napproach in the form of a pre-ordering. The log-exp-supremum will therefore\nserve as the reference colour for determining the colour distance. To the\nresulting pre-ordering with respect to these distance values, we add a\nlexicographic cascade to ensure a total order and a unique result. The\nobjective of this approach is to identify the original colour within the\nstructuring element that most closely resembles a supremum, which fulfils a\nnumber of desired properties. Consequently, this approach avoids the\nfalse-colour problem. The behaviour of the introduced operators is illustrated\nby application examples of dilation and closing for synthetic and natural\nimages.",

However, invisible watermarking for visual\nautoregressive (VAR) models remains underexplored, despite its importance in\nmisuse prevention. Existing watermarking methods, designed for diffusion\nmodels, often struggle to adapt to the sequential nature of VAR models. To\nbridge this gap, we propose Safe-VAR, the first watermarking framework\nspecifically designed for autoregressive text-to-image generation. Our study\nreveals that the timing of watermark injection significantly impacts generation\nquality, and watermarks of different complexities exhibit varying optimal\ninjection times. Motivated by this observation, we propose an Adaptive Scale\nInteraction Module, which dynamically determines the optimal watermark\nembedding strategy based on the watermark information and the visual\ncharacteristics of the generated image. This ensures watermark robustness while\nminimizing its impact on image quality. Furthermore, we introduce a Cross-Scale\nFusion mechanism, which integrates mixture of both heads and experts to\neffectively fuse multi-resolution features and handle complex interactions\nbetween image content and watermark patterns. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat Safe-VAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing\nexisting counterparts regarding image quality, watermarking fidelity, and\nrobustness against perturbations.

Efforts are made from three\nperspectives to navigate the rate-distortion-realism trade-off in the\ngenerative image compression task.

This network\nintegrates commonly used fractal band feature operations within a neural\nnon-linear mapping design, enhancing its ability to retain essential given\ninformation and filter out unnecessary details. Then, to improve the visual\nquality of image reconstruction under limited bandwidth, we integrate diffusion\nknowledge into the encoder and implement diffusion iterations into the decoder\nprocess, thus effectively recovering lost texture details. Finally, to fully\nleverage the spatial and frequency intensity information, we incorporate\nfrequency- and content-aware regularization terms to regularize the training of\nthe generative image compression network.

Two\nindependent fits are performed targeting the production of same-sign $W$ bosons\nwith at least one, or two longitudinally polarized $W$ bosons. The observed\n(expected) significance of the production with at least one longitudinally\npolarized $W$ boson is 3.3 (4.0) standard deviations.

The GDAs can be experimentally accessed\nthrough the study of amplitudes in $\\gamma^{\\ast} \\gamma \\to M_1 M_2$ and\n$\\gamma^{\\ast} \\to M_1 M_2 \\gamma$, where $M_1M_2$ is a pseudoscalar meson pair\nsuch as $\\pi \\eta $ and $\\eta \\eta^{\\prime}$. In this work, we calculate these\namplitudes in the perturbative limit and express the extracted $M_1M_2$ GDAs in\nterms of meson distribution amplitudes that have been constrained by the\nprevious experiments. Our explicit calculation verifies the existence of a new\nEMT FF that violates the conservation law of EMT when the hadronic matrix\nelement of the EMT operator is considered separately for each quark flavor. In\naddition, our result shows that the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are identical in\n$\\gamma^{\\ast} \\gamma \\to M_1 M_2$ and $\\gamma^{\\ast} \\to M_1 M_2 \\gamma$,\nwhich confirms the universality of GDAs in the perturbative limit.

In this paper, the NTE anomaly is observed in\n1D fluids of classical particles interacting pairwisely with two competing\nlength scales: the hard-core diameter $a$ and the finite range $a'>a$ of a soft\nrepulsive potential component. If $a'\\le 2a$, the pair interactions reduce\nthemselves to nearest neighbours which permits a closed-form solution of\nthermodynamics in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble characterized by temperature\n$T$ and pressure $p$. We focus on the equation of state (EoS) which relates the\naverage distance between particles (reciprocal density) $l$ to $T$ and $p\\ge\n0$. The EoS is expressible explicitly in terms of elementary or special\nfunctions for specific, already known and new, cases like the square shoulder,\nthe linear and quadratic ramps as well as certain types of logarithmic\ninteraction potentials. The emphasis is put on low-$T$ anomalies of the EoS.\nFirstly, the equidistant ground state as the function of the pressure can\nexhibit, at some ``compressibility'' pressures, a jump in chain spacing from\n$a'$ to $a$. Secondly, the analytical structure of the low-$T$ expansion of\n$l(T,p)$ depends on ranges of $p$-values.

Inspired by\nneuroscience, recent work suggests that to succeed on both formal and\nfunctional linguistic tasks, LLMs should use different mechanisms for each;\nsuch localization could either be built-in or emerge spontaneously through\ntraining. In this paper, we ask: do current models, with fast-improving\nfunctional linguistic abilities, exhibit distinct localization of formal and\nfunctional linguistic mechanisms? We answer this by finding and comparing the\n\"circuits\", or minimal computational subgraphs, responsible for various formal\nand functional tasks. Comparing 5 LLMs across 10 distinct tasks, we find that\nwhile there is indeed little overlap between circuits for formal and functional\ntasks, there is also little overlap between formal linguistic tasks, as exists\nin the human brain. Thus, a single formal linguistic network, unified and\ndistinct from functional task circuits, remains elusive. However, in terms of\ncross-task faithfulness - the ability of one circuit to solve another's task -\nwe observe a separation between formal and functional mechanisms, suggesting\nthat shared mechanisms between formal tasks may exist.",

    "abstract": "JSON Schema is a logical language used to define the structure of JSON\nvalues. JSON Schema syntax is based on nested schema objects. In all versions\nof JSON Schema until Draft-07, collectively known as Classical JSON Schema, the\nsemantics of a schema was entirely described by the set of JSON values that it\nvalidates. This semantics was the basis for a thorough theoretical study and\nfor the development of tools to decide satisfiability and equivalence of\nschemas. Unfortunately, Classical JSON Schema suffered a severe limitation in\nits ability to express extensions of object schemas, which caused the\nintroduction, with Draft 2019-09, of two disruptive features: annotation\ndependency and dynamic references.\n  These new features undermine the previously developed semantic theory, and\nthe algorithms used to decide satisfiability for Classical JSON Schema are not\neasy to extend. One possible solution is rewriting a schema written in Modern\nJSON Schema into an equivalent schema in Classical JSON Schema.\n  In this paper we prove that the elimination of annotation dependent keywords\ncannot, in general, avoid an exponential increase of the schema dimension. We\nprovide an algorithm to eliminate these keywords that, despite the theoretical\nlower bound, behaves quite well in practice, as we verify with an extensive set\nof experiments.",

Vibrational patterns and electron-phonon interactions were\ncalculated at several q-points of the Brillouin zone, allowing for a detailed\nmapping of the phonon landscape and the associated coupling mechanisms relevant\nto charge transport. Using a pool of post-processing tools, we analyze the\ndifferent phonon dispersions. Thus, we shed light on how low-frequency phonons\nmodulate the transport differently in the polymorphs via their distinct\nelectron-phonon coupling (EPC) signatures in reciprocal space. In fact, we show\nthat distinct phonons dominate in high-temperature and thin-film polymorphs\nwith respect to the high mobility low-temperature polymorph, and that these\nlead to different decoherence/localization trends. We describe the microscopic\norigin of the mobility in bulk polymorph, demonstrating that polymorphism not\nonly modulates the transfer integral but also the phonon pattern. For the first\ntime we show that different EPC patterns lead to very different mobility values\neven in similar structures. Also, we explain how phonon confinement is\nresponsible for the increased mobility observed in 2D phase. Finally, we\naddress the problem of possible coexistence of multiple polymorphs within a\nsingle specimen, frequently encountered in organic crystals due to their subtle\nenergy landscape and processing conditions. In this context, we consider the\nimplications of polymorph intergrowth, structural defects and disorder.",

However, current spatiotemporal attention modules handle temporal\nand spatial attention separately, extracting temporal and spatial features\neither sequentially or in parallel. These approaches overlook the inherent\nspatiotemporal correlations present in real world fMRI data. Additionally, the\npresence of noise in fMRI data further limits the performance of existing\nmethods. In this paper, we propose a novel brain effective connectivity\nestimation method based on Fourier spatiotemporal attention (FSTA-EC), which\ncombines Fourier attention and spatiotemporal attention to simultaneously\ncapture inter-series (spatial) dynamics and intra-series (temporal)\ndependencies from high-noise fMRI data. Specifically, Fourier attention is\ndesigned to convert the high-noise fMRI data to frequency domain, and map the\ndenoised fMRI data back to physical domain, and spatiotemporal attention is\ncrafted to simultaneously learn spatiotemporal dynamics. Furthermore, through a\nseries of proofs, we demonstrate that incorporating learnable filter into fast\nFourier transform and inverse fast Fourier transform processes is\nmathematically equivalent to performing cyclic convolution. The experimental\nresults on simulated and real-resting-state fMRI datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed method exhibits superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

Multimodal data encode\nbroader disease information than a single modality and may, therefore, improve\ndisease prediction; but they often contain missing values. Recent \"deeper\"\nmachine learning approaches show promise in improving prediction accuracy, yet\nthe biological relevance of these models needs to be further charted.\nIntegrating missing data analysis, predictive modeling, multimodal data\nanalysis, and explainable AI, we propose OPTIMUS, a predictive, modular, and\nexplainable machine learning framework, to unveil the many-to-many predictive\npathways between multimodal input data and multivariate disease outcomes amidst\nmissing values.

    "abstract": "NA64 is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS designed to search for\nLight particle Dark Matter (LDM) candidates with masses in the sub-GeV range.\nDuring the 2016-2022 runs, the experiment obtained the world-leading\nconstraints, leaving however part of the well-motivated region of parameter\nspace suggested by benchmark LDM models still unexplored. To further improve\nsensitivity, as part of the upgrades to the setup of NA64 at the CERN SPS H4\nbeamline, a prototype veto hadron calorimeter (VHCAL) was installed in the\ndownstream region of the experiment during the 2023 run. The VHCAL, made of\nCu-Sc layers, was expected to be an efficient veto against upstream\nelectroproduction of large-angle hadrons or photon-nuclear interactions,\nreducing the background from secondary particles escaping the detector\nacceptance. With the collected statistics of $4.4\\times10^{11}$ electrons on\ntarget (EOT), we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by rejecting\nthis background by more than an order of magnitude. This result provides an\nessential input for designing a full-scale optimized VHCAL to continue running\nbackground-free during LHC Run 4, when we expect to collect $10^{13}$ EOT.\nFurthermore, this technique combined with improvements in the analysis enables\nus to decrease our missing energy threshold from 50 GeV to 40 GeV thereby\nenhancing the signal sensitivity of NA64.",

Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed\nto address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical\nshortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral\nstatistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to\nreproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems\nwith non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov\ncomplexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic\nfrom integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with\ncomplex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for\nprobing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more\nrobust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this\ndirection.",

We prove that a single-layer Transformer can\nlearn this model if and only if its number of attention heads is at least $q$,\nin which case it achieves a sample complexity almost independent of $N$, while\nrecurrent networks require $N^{\\Omega(1)}$ samples on the same problem.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, a significant share of the business-to-consumer sector is based on\nonline platforms like Amazon and Alibaba and uses AI for pricing strategies.\nThis has sparked debate on whether pricing algorithms may tacitly collude to\nset supra-competitive prices without being explicitly designed to do so. Our\nstudy addresses these concerns by examining the risk of collusion when\nReinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are used to decide on pricing strategies\nin competitive markets. Prior research in this field focused on Tabular\nQ-learning (TQL) and led to opposing views on whether learning-based algorithms\ncan result in supra-competitive prices. Building on this, our work contributes\nto this ongoing discussion by providing a more nuanced numerical study that\ngoes beyond TQL, additionally capturing off- and on- policy Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) algorithms, two distinct families of DRL algorithms that\nrecently gained attention for algorithmic pricing. We study multiple Bertrand\noligopoly variants and show that algorithmic collusion depends on the algorithm\nused. In our experiments, we observed that TQL tends to exhibit higher\ncollusion and price dispersion. Moreover, it suffers from instability and\ndisparity, as agents with higher learning rates consistently achieve higher\nprofits, and it lacks robustness in state representation, with pricing dynamics\nvarying significantly based on information access. In contrast, DRL algorithms,\nsuch as PPO and DQN, generally converge to lower prices closer to the Nash\nequilibrium. Additionally, we show that when pre-trained TQL agents interact\nwith DRL agents, the latter quickly outperforms the former, highlighting the\nadvantages of DRL in pricing competition. Lastly, we find that competition\nbetween heterogeneous DRL algorithms, such as PPO and DQN, tends to reduce the\nlikelihood of supra-competitive pricing.",

Simulation results demonstrate that the\nintensification of atmospheric turbulence adversely affects the aforementioned\ncrucial parameters, leading to a significant reduction in the key rate.\nHowever, our protocol shows its capability to securely share secrets over a\ndistance of exceeding $60$ km among five participants in the presence of\nturbulence with $C^2_n=1\\times 10^{-15}m^{-2/3}$, while maintaining a high key\nrate of approximately $0.55$ bit/pulse over a distance of $10$ km across twenty\nparticipants. These findings suggest that efficient CV-QSS in free space is\nindeed achievable. This research may serve as a reference for the design and\noptimization of the practical CV-QSS system.",

    "abstract": "Low-light photography produces images with low signal-to-noise ratios due to\nlimited photons. In such conditions, common approximations like the Gaussian\nnoise model fall short, and many denoising techniques fail to remove noise\neffectively. Although deep-learning methods perform well, they require large\ndatasets of paired images that are impractical to acquire. As a remedy,\nsynthesizing realistic low-light noise has gained significant attention. In\nthis paper, we investigate the ability of diffusion models to capture the\ncomplex distribution of low-light noise. We show that a naive application of\nconventional diffusion models is inadequate for this task and propose three key\nadaptations that enable high-precision noise generation: a two-branch\narchitecture to better model signal-dependent and signal-independent noise, the\nincorporation of positional information to capture fixed-pattern noise, and a\ntailored diffusion noise schedule. Consequently, our model enables the\ngeneration of large datasets for training low-light denoising networks, leading\nto state-of-the-art performance. Through comprehensive analysis, including\nstatistical evaluation and noise decomposition, we provide deeper insights into\nthe characteristics of the generated data.",

SgrA* is a complex source comprising two\ncomponents: the compact core (which exhibits high variability) and the extended\nminispiral (which is relatively stable over short timescales). The novel\napproach consists in a self-calibration method that employs the extended\nstructure of the source (the minispiral) to calibrate the flux variability of\nthe compact core. The algorithm involves several steps: (1) an initial CLEAN\nimage is generated for the entire source; (2) the core is subtracted, leaving\nonly the minispiral; (3) a two-component visibility model is constructed,\ncomprising the minispiral and the core; (4) the model is fitted to the data,\nretrieving flux density parameters for each integration time; and (5) the data\nare scaled and calibrated, resulting in nearly constant brightness for the\nminispiral and variable flux for the core. The implementation of this algorithm\nthrough a script in the CASA package is described, detailing the configuration\nparameters and the steps involved. The success of the method is demonstrated\nthrough light curves of SgrA* observed on day 21 April 2018 in Band 6, as part\nof the 2018 EHT campaign.

Our\nanalysis of confidence balance in LLMs indicates that models swing between\noverconfidence and conservatism in feasibility boundaries depending on task\ncategories and that the most significant self-knowledge weaknesses lie in\ntemporal awareness and contextual understanding. These difficulties in\ncontextual comprehension additionally lead models to question their operational\nboundaries, resulting in considerable confusion within the self-knowledge of\nLLMs. We make our code and results available publicly at\nhttps://github.com/knowledge-verse-ai/LLM-Self_Knowledge_Eval",

It is often\nargued that these features are related to surface-induced bulk anisotropy\n(SIBA) because they coincide with critical energies of the bulk dielectric\nfunction. In general, any quantitative RAS theory must include excitonic\neffects as they significantly influence the spectra and are believed to be the\nkey to determining the origin of SIBA features. Here, we introduce a\nlayer-resolved exciton localization (LREL) measure within the framework of\nmany-body perturbation theory, which enables a quantitative analysis of the\norigins of 'bulk-related' RAS features. Applying LREL to arsenic-modified\nsilicon reconstructions reveals that, depending on the surface reconstruction,\nthe 'apparent' SIBA features arise primarily from states localized at the\nsurface, with only a small contribution from the underlying layers. Our\nfindings, further supported by the fact that the calculated spectra agree well\nwith low-temperature RAS measurements, challenge the conventional explanation\nof 'bulk-related' RAS features. They indicate that in many instances\nbulk-enhanced surface anisotropies (BESA)-the opposite of SIBA-contribute to,\nor are even responsible for, 'bulk-related' RAS features. Therefore, we suggest\nthat previously studied semiconductor surfaces, which exhibit 'bulk-related'\nfeatures in their spectra, should be reanalyzed using the presented method.",

In this work, we focus on acquisition strategies for a GP model that\nneeds to be accurate within a predefined range of the response of interest.\nSuch an approach is useful in various fields including synthetic chemistry,\nwhere finding molecules with particular properties is essential for developing\nuseful materials and effective medications. GP modeling and sequential design\nof experiments have been successfully applied to a plethora of domains,\nincluding molecule research. Our main contribution here is to use the\nthreshold-weighted Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) as a basic\nbuilding block for acquisition functions employed within sequential design. We\nstudy pointwise and integral criteria relying on two different weighting\nmeasures and benchmark them against competitors, demonstrating improved\nperformance with respect to considered goals. The resulting acquisition\nstrategies are applicable to a wide range of fields and pave the way to further\ndeveloping sequential design relying on scoring rules.",

Recently, the Tree-Sliced method has been\nintroduced to replace these lines with more intricate structures, known as tree\nsystems. This approach enhances the ability to capture topological information\nof integration domains in Sliced OT while maintaining low computational cost.\nInspired by this approach, in this paper, we present an adaptation of tree\nsystems on OT problems for measures supported on a sphere.

To enhance the\nfusion capabilities of the PFA, our task-driven progressive learning framework\nfirst utilizes adaptive multi-expert distillation to inherits fusion knowledge\nfrom state-of-the-art image fusion models, establishing robust initialization,\nand then employs a decoupled representation learning scheme to achieve\ntask-relevant information fusion. Moreover, to overcome appearance variations\nbetween the initial template and search frames, we presents a nearest-neighbor\ndynamic template updating scheme, which selects the most reliable frame closest\nto the current search frame as the dynamic template.

The binary mixture\nof 'hot' and 'cold' particles phase separate when the relative temperature\ndifference between hot and cold particles defined as activity $\\chi$ exceeds a\ndensity dependent critical value. The study of kinetics in 2-TIPS, a\nnon-equilibrium phase separation, is of fundamental importance in statistical\nphysics. In this paper, we investigate 2-TIPS kinetics using molecular dynamics\n(MD) and coarse-grained (CG) modeling in 3D and 2D. The coarse-grained model\ncouples two passive Model B equations for hot and cold particles, with coupling\nterms emulating the energy transfer between them by raising the temperature of\ncold particles and lowering that of hot particles, a key observation from the\nMD simulations. MD simulations reveal that at high densities, phase separation\nbegins immediately after the quench, forming bi-continuous domains rich in hot\nor cold particles, similar to spinodal decomposition in passive systems. These\ninterconnected domains are also observed in the coarse-grained model for the\nmixture's critical composition. Both MD and CG models show dynamic scaling of\nthe correlation function, indicating self-similar domain growth. Regardless of\ndimensionality, both methods report algebraic growth in domain length with a\ngrowth exponent of $1/3$, known as the Lifshitz-Slyozov exponent, widely\nobserved in passive systems. Our results demonstrate that the universality of\nphase separation kinetics observed in passive systems also extends to the\nnon-equilibrium binary mixture undergoing 2-TIPS.",

However, their practical applications are hindered by the\nmisalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. To tackle\nthis issue, reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered for diffusion model\nfine-tuning. Yet, RL's effectiveness is limited by the challenge of sparse\nreward, where feedback is only available at the end of the generation process.\nThis makes it difficult to identify which actions during the denoising process\ncontribute positively to the final generated image, potentially leading to\nineffective or unnecessary denoising policies. To this end, this paper presents\na novel RL-based framework that addresses the sparse reward problem when\ntraining diffusion models. Our framework, named $\\text{B}^2\\text{-DiffuRL}$,\nemploys two strategies: \\textbf{B}ackward progressive training and\n\\textbf{B}ranch-based sampling. For one thing, backward progressive training\nfocuses initially on the final timesteps of denoising process and gradually\nextends the training interval to earlier timesteps, easing the learning\ndifficulty from sparse rewards. For another, we perform branch-based sampling\nfor each training interval. By comparing the samples within the same branch, we\ncan identify how much the policies of the current training interval contribute\nto the final image, which helps to learn effective policies instead of\nunnecessary ones. $\\text{B}^2\\text{-DiffuRL}$ is compatible with existing\noptimization algorithms.

This is accomplished through a dynamical system that\nintegrates two partial differential equations: one governing the dynamics and\nuncertainty of the probability distribution, and the other regulating the\npotential field for ergodic multi-agent search. The target probability field\nevolves in response to the target dynamics imposed by the environment and\naccomplished sensing efforts, while being explored by multiple robot agents\nguided by the potential field gradient. The proposed methodology was tested on\ntwo simulated search scenarios, one of which features a synthetically generated\ndomain and showcases better performance when compared to the baseline method\nwith static target probability over a range of agent to flow field velocity\nratios. The second search scenario represents a realistic sea search and rescue\nmission where the search start is delayed, the search is performed in multiple\nrobot flight missions, and the procedure for target drift uncertainty\ncompensation is demonstrated. Furthermore, the proposed method provides an\naccurate survey completion metric, based on the known detection/sensing\nparameters, that correlates with the actual number of targets found\nindependently.",

This work uniquely explores the influence of oxygen vacancies (OVs)\nat distinct sites -- Osub-top and bridge sites -- on both the hydrogen\nevolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our findings\nreveal that the Osub-top vacancy (OOV-MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100)) significantly\nenhances HER activity, achieving a hydrogen Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G_{\\rm\nH}$) of $-0.015$ eV, which surpasses the performance of noble metals such as\nPt/C ($-0.082$ eV) and Ir ($-0.08$ eV). Additionally, the cathodic exchange\ncurrent density $(J_{0,c})$ of OOV-MnO$_2$(110)/Ni(100) reaches $10^{-0.774}$\nAcm$^{-2}$, outperforming Pt/C ($10^{-0.92}$ Acm$^{-2}$) and Ir ($10^{-1.44}$\nAcm$^{-2}$).

However, it also presents potential challenges in handling feature\ninteractions. Firstly, Transformers may encounter information loss when\ncapturing feature interactions. By relying on inner products to represent\npairwise relationships, they compress raw interaction information, which can\nresult in a degradation of fidelity. Secondly, due to the long-tail features\ndistribution, feature fields with low information-abundance embeddings\nconstrain the information abundance of other fields, leading to collapsed\nembedding matrices. To tackle these issues, we propose a Dual Attention\nFramework for Enhanced Feature Interaction, known as Dual Enhanced Attention.\nThis framework integrates two attention mechanisms: the Combo-ID attention\nmechanism and the collapse-avoiding attention mechanism. The Combo-ID attention\nmechanism directly retains feature interaction pairs to mitigate information\nloss, while the collapse-avoiding attention mechanism adaptively filters out\nlow information-abundance interaction pairs to prevent interaction collapse.\nExtensive experiments conducted on industrial datasets have shown the\neffectiveness of Dual Enhanced Attention.",

Existing\nmitigation strategies, such as differential privacy and neuron-level\ninterventions, often degrade model utility or fail to effectively prevent\nleakage. To address this challenge, we introduce PrivacyScalpel, a novel\nprivacy-preserving framework that leverages LLM interpretability techniques to\nidentify and mitigate PII leakage while maintaining performance. PrivacyScalpel\ncomprises three key steps: (1) Feature Probing, which identifies layers in the\nmodel that encode PII-rich representations, (2) Sparse Autoencoding, where a\nk-Sparse Autoencoder (k-SAE) disentangles and isolates privacy-sensitive\nfeatures,\n  and (3) Feature-Level Interventions, which employ targeted ablation and\nvector steering to suppress PII leakage.\n  Our empirical evaluation on Gemma2-2b and Llama2-7b, fine-tuned on the Enron\ndataset, shows that PrivacyScalpel significantly reduces email leakage from\n5.15\\% to as low as 0.0\\%, while maintaining over 99.4\\% of the original\nmodel's utility. Notably, our method outperforms neuron-level interventions in\nprivacy-utility trade-offs, demonstrating that acting on sparse, monosemantic\nfeatures is more effective than manipulating polysemantic neurons. Beyond\nimproving LLM privacy, our approach offers insights into the mechanisms\nunderlying PII memorization, contributing to the broader field of model\ninterpretability and secure AI deployment.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we establish Betti number estimates for graphs with\nnon-negative Ollivier curvature, and for graphs with non-negative Bakry-\\'Emery\ncurvature, providing a discrete analogue of a classical result by Bochner for\nmanifolds. Specifically, we show that for graphs with non-negative Ollivier\ncurvature, the first Betti number is bounded above by half of the minimum\ncombinatorial vertex degree. In contrast, for graphs with non-negative\nBakry-\\'Emery curvature, we prove that the first Betti number of the path\nhomology is bounded above by the minimum combinatorial vertex degree minus one.\nWe further present various rigidity results, characterizing graphs that attain\nthe upper bound on the first Betti number under non-negative Ollivier\ncurvature. Remarkably, these graphs are precisely the discrete tori, similar to\nthe Riemannian setting. Furthermore, we show that the results obtained using\nthe Ollivier curvature extend to the setting of potentially non-reversible\nMarkov chains. Additionally, we explore rigidity cases depending on the\nidleness parameter of the Ollivier curvature, i.e., we characterize rigidity\nfor bone-idle graphs with non-negative Ollivier curvature that attain the upper\nBetti number bound. We further establish an upper bound on the first Betti\nnumber under a more general assumption, where non-negative Ollivier curvature\nis required only outside a finite subset. Finally, we provide several examples,\ne.g., we prove that for a potentially non-reversible Markov chain on a cycle of\nlength at least five, there always exists a unique path metric with constant\nOllivier curvature. Moreover, this metric has non-negative Ollivier curvature,\nand the upper Betti number bound is attained if and only if the curvature is\nzero.",

    "abstract": "Full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) generally assumes that\nreference images are of perfect quality. However, this assumption is flawed due\nto the sensor and optical limitations of modern imaging systems. Moreover,\nrecent generative enhancement methods are capable of producing images of higher\nquality than their original. All of these challenge the effectiveness and\napplicability of current FR-IQA models. To relax the assumption of perfect\nreference image quality, we build a large-scale IQA database, namely DiffIQA,\ncontaining approximately 180,000 images generated by a diffusion-based image\nenhancer with adjustable hyper-parameters. Each image is annotated by human\nsubjects as either worse, similar, or better quality compared to its reference.\nBuilding on this, we present a generalized FR-IQA model, namely Adaptive\nFidelity-Naturalness Evaluator (A-FINE), to accurately assess and adaptively\ncombine the fidelity and naturalness of a test image. A-FINE aligns well with\nstandard FR-IQA when the reference image is much more natural than the test\nimage. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that A-FINE surpasses standard\nFR-IQA models on well-established IQA datasets and our newly created DiffIQA.\nTo further validate A-FINE, we additionally construct a super-resolution IQA\nbenchmark (SRIQA-Bench), encompassing test images derived from ten\nstate-of-the-art SR methods with reliable human quality annotations. Tests on\nSRIQA-Bench re-affirm the advantages of A-FINE. The code and dataset are\navailable at https://tianhewu.github.io/A-FINE-page.github.io/.",

Local entropy increases with temperature\nand squeezing, though their underlying physical mechanisms differ. EPR\ncorrelations degrade due to environmental interactions, with squeezing\ninitially enhancing them but failing to prevent their eventual loss.\nEntanglement exhibits distinct behaviors: in separate environments, it\nundergoes sudden death, whereas in common environments, it experiences a dark\nperiod whose duration shortens with stronger squeezing.

    "abstract": "Accurate fine-grained geospatial scene classification using remote sensing\nimagery is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing\napproaches often rely on manually zooming remote sensing images at different\nscales to create typical scene samples. This approach fails to adequately\nsupport the fixed-resolution image interpretation requirements in real-world\nscenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce the Million-scale\nfinE-grained geospatial scEne classification dataseT (MEET), which contains\nover 1.03 million zoom-free remote sensing scene samples, manually annotated\ninto 80 fine-grained categories. In MEET, each scene sample follows a\nscene-inscene layout, where the central scene serves as the reference, and\nauxiliary scenes provide crucial spatial context for finegrained\nclassification. Moreover, to tackle the emerging challenge of scene-in-scene\nclassification, we present the Context-Aware Transformer (CAT), a model\nspecifically designed for this task, which adaptively fuses spatial context to\naccurately classify the scene samples. CAT adaptively fuses spatial context to\naccurately classify the scene samples by learning attentional features that\ncapture the relationships between the center and auxiliary scenes. Based on\nMEET, we establish a comprehensive benchmark for fine-grained geospatial scene\nclassification, evaluating CAT against 11 competitive baselines. The results\ndemonstrate that CAT significantly outperforms these baselines, achieving a\n1.88% higher balanced accuracy (BA) with the Swin-Large backbone, and a notable\n7.87% improvement with the Swin-Huge backbone. Further experiments validate the\neffectiveness of each module in CAT and show the practical applicability of CAT\nin the urban functional zone mapping.

Although promising tracking\nperformance is achieved through leveraging complementary cues from different\nsources, it remains challenging in complex scenes due to the limitations of\nbi-modal scenarios. In this work, we introduce a general multimodal visual\ntracking task that fully exploits the advantages of four modalities, including\nRGB, thermal infrared, event, and language, for robust tracking under\nchallenging conditions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation platform for\ngeneral multimodal visual tracking, we construct QuadTrack600, a large-scale,\nhigh-quality benchmark comprising 600 video sequences (totaling 384.7K\nhigh-resolution (640x480) frame groups). In each frame group, all four\nmodalities are spatially aligned and meticulously annotated with bounding\nboxes, while 21 sequence-level challenge attributes are provided for detailed\nperformance analysis. Despite quad-modal data provides richer information, the\ndifferences in information quantity among modalities and the computational\nburden from four modalities are two challenging issues in fusing four\nmodalities. To handle these issues, we propose a novel approach called\nQuadFusion, which incorporates an efficient Multiscale Fusion Mamba with four\ndifferent scanning scales to achieve sufficient interactions of the four\nmodalities while overcoming the exponential computational burden, for general\nmultimodal visual tracking. Extensive experiments on the QuadTrack600 dataset\nand three bi-modal tracking datasets, including LasHeR, VisEvent, and TNL2K,\nvalidate the effectiveness of our QuadFusion.",

Few dedicated UniDA methods exist for Time Series (TS), which\nremains a challenging case. In general, UniDA approaches align common class\nsamples and detect unknown target samples from emerging classes. Such detection\noften results from thresholding a discriminability metric. The threshold value\nis typically either a fine-tuned hyperparameter or a fixed value, which limits\nthe ability of the model to adapt to new data. Furthermore, discriminability\nmetrics exhibit overconfidence for unknown samples, leading to\nmisclassifications. This paper introduces UniJDOT, an optimal-transport-based\nmethod that accounts for the unknown target samples in the transport cost. Our\nmethod also proposes a joint decision space to improve the discriminability of\nthe detection module. In addition, we use an auto-thresholding algorithm to\nreduce the dependence on fixed or fine-tuned thresholds.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of clustering a set of items based on bandit feedback.\nEach of the $n$ items is characterized by a feature vector, with a possibly\nlarge dimension $d$. The items are partitioned into two unknown groups such\nthat items within the same group share the same feature vector. We consider a\nsequential and adaptive setting in which, at each round, the learner selects\none item and one feature, then observes a noisy evaluation of the item's\nfeature. The learner's objective is to recover the correct partition of the\nitems, while keeping the number of observations as small as possible. We\nprovide an algorithm which relies on finding a relevant feature for the\nclustering task, leveraging the Sequential Halving algorithm. With probability\nat least $1-\\delta$, we obtain an accurate recovery of the partition and derive\nan upper bound on the budget required. Furthermore, we derive an\ninstance-dependent lower bound, which is tight in some relevant cases.",

This solution\nrepresents a technological advancement based on methodologies developed for the\nALICE ITS1 and the STAR tracker two decades ago. The core of this approach\ninvolves the use of flexible cables composed of aluminum and polyimide, with\nthicknesses on the order of tens of micrometers. These cables are connected to\nthe sensors using single-point Tape Automated Bonding (spTAB), which replaces\nthe traditional wire bonding technique that is suboptimal for curved\nintegrations. The spTAB bonding is achieved by creating openings in the\npolyimide layer, allowing aluminum wires to remain free-standing, which are\nthen connected to the sensor using pressure and ultrasonic energy. Extending\nthis concept, we have applied this approach to entire printed circuit boards\n(PCBs), resulting in a fully flexible packaging solution maintaining an\nultra-low material budget. This work introduces a prototype utilizing this\nmethod to bond an ALPIDE chip, proposing it as a viable option for future\ndesigns necessitating flexible packaging for both the chip and associated\nelectronics. The overall workflow, comprising microfabrication and assembly, is\ncarried out at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler and INFN TIFPA laboratories and\nwill be detailed to elucidate our procedures and demonstrate the applicability\nof our solution in future experimental setups.

We benchmark with the I-RAVEN dataset and its extension,\nI-RAVEN-X, which tests the ability to generalize to longer reasoning rules and\nranges of the attribute values. To assess the influence of visual uncertainties\non these symbolic analogical reasoning tests, we extend the I-RAVEN-X dataset,\nwhich otherwise assumes an oracle perception. We adopt a two-fold strategy to\nsimulate this imperfect visual perception: 1) we introduce confounding\nattributes which, being sampled at random, do not contribute to the prediction\nof the correct answer of the puzzles, and 2) we smoothen the distributions of\nthe input attributes' values. We observe a sharp decline in OpenAI's o3-mini\ntask accuracy, dropping from 86.6% on the original I-RAVEN to just 17.0% --\napproaching random chance -- on the more challenging I-RAVEN-X, which increases\ninput length and range and emulates perceptual uncertainty. This drop occurred\ndespite spending 3.4x more reasoning tokens. A similar trend is also observed\nfor DeepSeek R1: from 80.6% to 23.2%. On the other hand, a neuro-symbolic\nprobabilistic abductive model, ARLC, that achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances on I-RAVEN, can robustly reason under all these\nout-of-distribution tests, maintaining strong accuracy with only a modest\naccuracy reduction from 98.6% to 88.0%.

Additionally, we\nintegrate a Multi-Party Fully Homomorphic Encryption~(MP-FHE) scheme into our\nproposed framework to ensure the protection of both user queries and registry\nprivacy. Furthermore, we improve previous work on AI-generated media detection.\nThis approach is useful in cases where the content is absent from our registry.\nDinoHash significantly improves average bit accuracy by 12% over\nstate-of-the-art watermarking and perceptual hashing methods while maintaining\nsuperior true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) tradeoffs\nacross various transformations. Our AI-generated media detection results show a\n25% improvement in classification accuracy on commonly used real-world AI image\ngenerators over existing algorithms. By combining perceptual hashing, MP-FHE,\nand an AI content detection model, our proposed framework provides better\nrobustness and privacy compared to previous work.",

This method has been\nadapted for single-attribute control scenario and is termed the Palette of\nLanguage Models due to its theoretical linkage between attribute strength and\ngeneration style, akin to blending colors on an artist's palette. Moreover,\npositive correlation and attribute enhancement are advanced as theoretical\nproperties to guide a rational combination strategy design. We conduct\nexperiments on both single control and multiple control settings, and achieve\nsurpassing results.",

Rice\n(Oryza sativa), one of the most important staple crops, faces challenges in\nimproving yield and resilience due to the complex genetic architecture of\nagronomic traits and the limited sample size in breeding datasets. Current G2P\nprediction methods, such as GWAS and linear models, often fail to capture\ncomplex non-linear relationships between genotypes and phenotypes, leading to\nsuboptimal prediction accuracy. Additionally, population stratification and\noverfitting are significant obstacles when models are applied to small datasets\nwith diverse genetic backgrounds. This study introduces the Learnable Group\nTransform (LGT) method, which aims to overcome these challenges by combining\nthe advantages of traditional linear models with advanced machine learning\ntechniques. LGT utilizes a group-based transformation of genotype data to\ncapture spatial relationships and genetic structures across diverse rice\npopulations, offering flexibility to generalize even with limited data. Through\nextensive experiments on the Rice529 dataset, a panel of 529 rice accessions,\nLGT demonstrated substantial improvements in prediction accuracy for multiple\nagronomic traits, including yield and plant height, compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines such as linear models and recent deep learning\napproaches.

    "abstract": "We present a novel space-time isogeometric discretization of the acoustic\nwave equation in second-order formulation that is intrinsically unconditionally\nstable. The method relies on a variational framework inspired by [Walkington\n2014], with an exponential weight introduced in the time integrals. Conformity\nrequires at least $C^1$ regularity in time and $C^0$ in space. The\napproximation in time is carried out using spline functions. The unconditional\nstability of the space-time method for conforming discrete spaces arises\nnaturally from the variational structure itself, rather than from any\nartificial stabilization mechanisms. The analysis of an associated ordinary\ndifferential equation problem in time yields error estimates with respect to\nthe mesh size that are suboptimal by one order in standard Sobolev norms.\nHowever, for certain choices of approximation spaces, it achieves quasi-optimal\nestimates. In particular, we prove this for $C^1$-regular splines of even\npolynomial degree, and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the same\nbehavior holds for splines with maximal regularity, irrespective of the degree.\nThe error analysis is extended to the full space-time problem with\ntensor-product approximation spaces. Numerical results are provided to support\nthe theoretical findings and demonstrate the sharpness of the estimates.",

Existing pruning methods mainly focus on designing\nmetrics to measure the importance of network components to guide pruning. Apart\nfrom the impact of these metrics, we observe that different layers have\ndifferent sensitivities over the network performance. Thus, we propose an\nefficient method based on the trace of Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to\nquantitatively measure and verify the different sensitivities across layers.\nBased on this, we propose Mixed Sparsity Pruning (MSP) which uses a\npruning-oriented evolutionary algorithm (EA) to determine the optimal sparsity\nlevels for different layers. To guarantee fast convergence and achieve\npromising performance, we utilize efficient FIM-inspired layer-wise sensitivity\nto initialize the population of EA. In addition, our MSP can work as a\nplug-and-play module, ready to be integrated into existing pruning methods.\nExtensive experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 on language modeling and zero-shot\ntasks demonstrate our superior performance. In particular, in extreme pruning\nratio (e.g. 75%), our method significantly outperforms existing methods in\nterms of perplexity (PPL) by orders of magnitude (Figure 1).",

We select Kepler RGB stars\nwith high-precision asteroseismic radii (uncertainties < 1%) and cross-match\nthem with 2MASS, APASS, and Gaia to obtain Johnson-B, Johnson-V, G, J, H, and\nKs-band photometric data. After applying selection criteria, we obtain 626 RGB\nstars to build the SBCR. Among these, 100 RGBs are used as independent\nvalidation for the distance, and the remaining samples are used to fit the\nSBCR. Results. First, using 526 targets with asteroseismic radii and Gaia\ndistances, nine SBCRs are proposed based on 2MASS (J, H, Ks), APASS (Johnson-B,\nJohnson-V), and Gaia (G) photometry. The average rms scatter in these relations\nis 0.075 mag, which corresponds to an uncertainty of approximately 3.5% in\ndistance. These relations are further validated using 100 independent samples\nwith Gaia distances, showing no bias, with a dispersion of approximately 3%.\nCompared to interferometric measurements, a systematic underestimation of 2.3%\nwas observed, and the discrepancy decreases as the angular diameter increases.\nAdditionally, the distances of eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud\nand Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using our SBCRs are generally consistent\nwith those measured in the literature, with a dispersion of 1% and a slight\noverestimation of 1% to 2.5%. Conclusions. The ARD method capitalizes on two\nkey advantages for precise stellar distance determination: a statistically\nrobust sample of homogeneous RGB stars with low observational costs, and\nindependent distance verification through Gaia data.

Then we develop an algorithm\nconcerned with iterative resolving nonlinear programming problems for\noptimization of maximal relative weights in general smooth families of metrics\nwhich may involve interpolation or neural networks models. We describe\napplications of the algorithm to compute the largest uniform Lyapunov exponent\nand uniform Lyapunov dimension for the H\\'{e}non and Rabinovich systems\njustifying the Eden conjecture at stationary and periodic points respectively.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-training of deep models, followed by fine-tuning them, has\nbecome the cornerstone of natural language processing (NLP). The prevalence of\ndata coupled with computational resources has led to large models with a\nconsiderable number of parameters. While the massive size of these models has\nled to remarkable success in many NLP tasks, a detriment is the expense\nrequired to retrain all the base model's parameters for the adaptation to each\ntask or domain. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) provides an effective\nsolution for this challenge by minimizing the number of parameters required to\nbe fine-tuned while maintaining the quality of the model. While existing\nmethods have achieved impressive results, they mainly focus on adapting a\nsubset of parameters, weight reparameterization, and prompt engineering. In\nthis paper, we study layers as extractors of different types of linguistic\ninformation that are valuable when used in conjunction. We then propose the\nMixture of Layer Experts (MoLEx), a novel sparse mixture of experts (SMoE)\nwhose experts are layers in the pre-trained model. It performs a conditional\ncomputation of a mixture of layers during fine-tuning to provide the model with\nmore structural knowledge about the data. By providing an avenue for\ninformation exchange between layers, MoLEx enables the model to make a more\nwell-informed prediction for the downstream task, leading to better fine-tuning\nresults with the same number of effective parameters. As experts can be\nprocessed in parallel, MoLEx introduces minimal additional computational\noverhead. We empirically corroborate the advantages of MoLEx when combined with\npopular PEFT baseline methods on a variety of downstream fine-tuning tasks,\nincluding the popular GLUE benchmark as well as the End-to-End Challenge (E2E).\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/rachtsy/molex.",

However, current methods suffer from prolonged training times\nand often produce results that lack fine facial and garment details. In this\npaper, we propose GaussianIP, an effective two-stage framework for generating\nidentity-preserving realistic 3D humans from text and image prompts. Our core\ninsight is to leverage human-centric knowledge to facilitate the generation\nprocess. In stage 1, we propose a novel Adaptive Human Distillation Sampling\n(AHDS) method to rapidly generate a 3D human that maintains high identity\nconsistency with the image prompt and achieves a realistic appearance. Compared\nto traditional SDS methods, AHDS better aligns with the human-centric\ngeneration process, enhancing visual quality with notably fewer training steps.\nTo further improve the visual quality of the face and clothes regions, we\ndesign a View-Consistent Refinement (VCR) strategy in stage 2. Specifically, it\nproduces detail-enhanced results of the multi-view images from stage 1\niteratively, ensuring the 3D texture consistency across views via mutual\nattention and distance-guided attention fusion. Then a polished version of the\n3D human can be achieved by directly perform reconstruction with the refined\nimages.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image\nsegmentation, but existing models still face challenges in accurately\nsegmenting lesion regions. The main reason is that some lesion regions in\nmedical images have unclear boundaries, irregular shapes, and small tissue\ndensity differences, leading to label ambiguity. However, the existing model\ntreats all data equally without taking quality differences into account in the\ntraining process, resulting in noisy labels negatively impacting model training\nand unstable feature representations. In this paper, a data-driven alternating\nlearning (DALE) paradigm is proposed to optimize the model's training process,\nachieving stable and high-precision segmentation. The paradigm focuses on two\nkey points: (1) reducing the impact of noisy labels, and (2) calibrating\nunstable representations. To mitigate the negative impact of noisy labels, a\nloss consistency-based collaborative optimization method is proposed, and its\neffectiveness is theoretically demonstrated. Specifically, the label confidence\nparameters are introduced to dynamically adjust the influence of labels of\ndifferent confidence levels during model training, thus reducing the influence\nof noise labels. To calibrate the learning bias of unstable representations, a\ndistribution alignment method is proposed. This method restores the underlying\ndistribution of unstable representations, thereby enhancing the discriminative\ncapability of fuzzy region representations. Extensive experiments on various\nbenchmarks and model backbones demonstrate the superiority of the DALE\nparadigm, achieving an average performance improvement of up to 7.16%.",

To\nsupport algorithm validation, we construct the first multi-scale on-orbit\nmulti-spacecraft semantic segmentation dataset SpaceES, which covers four types\nof spatial backgrounds and 17 typical spacecraft targets.

Rather than caching keys and\nvalues separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing\nmemory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory\nefficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation\nlies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be\ntrained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits\nfully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different\nattention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post\ntraining distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention\ninto an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training\nadaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that\nleveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training\naccuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising\nmodel performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method can\neffectively compress the KV cache while preserving the performance on the\nbenchmarks; specifically, for Llama3.2-1B-Instruct baseline, a 6.4x compression\nachieves the same average score by using only 3.6B training tokens and 70 GPU\nhours on AMD MI300, whereas a 10.6x compression have less than 0.1% average\nscore drop with 7B training tokens and 140 GPU hours.

    "abstract": "Radiative transfer effects need to be taken into account when analysing\nspectral line observations. When the data are not sufficient for detailed\nmodelling, simpler methods are needed. The escape probability formalism (EPF)\nis one such tool. We wish to quantify the model errors in the EPF analysis of\ninterstellar clouds and cores. We introduce PEP, a parallel program for\ncalculating fast EPF parameters quickly. We model full radiative transfer to\ngenerate synthetic observations for various cloud models. These are examined\nwith the PEP program, and their results are compared to the actual\nbeam-averaged kinetic temperatures, column densities, and volume densities. PEP\nenables the calculations of even millions of parameter combinations in a matter\nof seconds. However, the simple assumptions of EPF can lead to significant\nerrors. In the tests the errors were typically within a factor of two, but\ncould in some cases reach an order of magnitude. The model errors are thus\nsimilar or even larger than the statistical errors caused by the typical\nobservational noise. Due to degeneracies, parameter combinations are better\nconstrained than the individual parameters. The model errors could be reduced\nby using full radiative transfer modelling. However, in the absence of full\nknowledge of the source structure, the errors are difficult to quantify. We\nalso present a method for approximate handling of hyperfine structure lines in\nEPF calculations. Both the observational statistical errors and the model\nerrors need to be considered when estimating the reliability of EPF results.\nFull radiative transfer modelling is needed to better understand the true\nuncertainties.",

In particular, based on the single-input\nsingle-output (SISO) system setup, we first compare three modes of FIM, namely,\nEM-only, PBF-only, and EM-PBF, in terms of received signal power under\ndifferent FIM and channel setups. The PBF-only mode, which only adjusts the\nreflect phase, is shown to be less effective than the EM-only mode in enhancing\nreceived signal strength. In a multi-element, multi-path scenario, the EM-only\nmode improves the received signal power by 125% compared to the PBF-only mode.\nThe EM-PBF mode, which optimizes both element positions and phases, further\nenhances performance. Additionally, we investigate the channel estimation\nproblem for FIM systems by designing a protocol that gathers EM and PBF\nmeasurements, enabling the formulation of a compressive sensing problem for\njoint cascaded and direct channel estimation.

While recent work has proposed decomposition-based interpretability\nmethods for identifying textual descriptions of attention heads in CLIP, the\nimplications of conceptual consistency in these text labels on interpretability\nand model performance has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we study the\nconceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like\nmodels. We conduct extensive experiments on six different models from OpenAI\nand OpenCLIP which vary by size, type of pre-training data and patch size. We\npropose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that\nmeasures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with\nspecific concepts. To assign concept labels to heads, we use in-context\nlearning with ChatGPT, guided by a few manually-curated examples, and validate\nthese labels using an LLM-as-a-judge approach. Our soft-pruning experiments\nreveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as\npruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning\nrandom or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential\nconcepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific\nreasoning, and video-language understanding.

Previous methods struggle to perform well due\nto the longer navigation path, more complicated 3D scenes, and the neglect of\nthe interplay between vertical and horizontal actions. In this paper, we\npropose a novel grid-based view selection framework that formulates aerial VLN\naction prediction as a grid-based view selection task, incorporating vertical\naction prediction in a manner that accounts for the coupling with horizontal\nactions, thereby enabling effective altitude adjustments.

Although the streaming instability (SI) is widely recognized as a\npowerful mechanism for planetesimal formation, its properties can be sensitive\nto the gas dynamical environment. The outer region of PPDs is subject to the\nvertical shear instability (VSI), which could further induce the Rossby wave\ninstability (RWI) to generate numerous vortices. In this work, we use the\nmultifluid dust module in Athena++ to perform a 3D global simulation with mesh\nrefinement to achieve adequate domain size and resolution to resolve and\naccommodate all these instabilities. The VSI mainly governs the overall gas\ndynamics, dominated by the breathing mode due to dust mass loading. The dust\nstrongly settles to the midplane layer, which is much more densely populated\nwith small vortices compared to the dust-free case. Strong dust clumping is\nobserved, which is likely owing to the joint action of the SI and dusty RWI,\nand those sufficient for planetesimal formation reside only in a small fraction\nof such vortices. Dust clumping becomes stronger with increasing resolution,\nand has not yet achieved numerical convergence in our exploration. In addition,\nwe find evidence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) operating at certain\nparts of the dust-gas interface, which may contribute to the temporary\ndestruction of dust clumps.",

To assist researchers to bridge the \\textit{sim-to-real gap}, in\nthis paper, we describe a low-cost physical inverted pendulum apparatus and\nsoftware environment for exploring sim-to-real DRL methods. In particular, the\ndesign of our apparatus enables detailed examination of the delays that arise\nin physical systems when sensing, communicating, learning, inferring and\nactuating. Moreover, we wish to improve access to educational systems, so our\napparatus uses readily available materials and parts to reduce cost and\nlogistical barriers. Our design shows how commercial, off-the-shelf electronics\nand electromechanical and sensor systems, combined with common metal\nextrusions, dowel and 3D printed couplings provide a pathway for affordable\nphysical DRL apparatus. The physical apparatus is complemented with a simulated\nenvironment implemented using a high-fidelity physics engine and OpenAI Gym\ninterface.",

Previous works in wireless respiration monitoring have\nprimarily focused on estimating respiration rate, where the breath waveforms\nare often generated as a by-product. As a result, issues such as waveform\ndeformation and inversion have largely been overlooked, reducing the signal's\nutility for applications requiring breathing waveforms. To address this\nproblem, we present a novel approach, MobiVital, that improves the quality of\nrespiration waveforms obtained from ultra-wideband (UWB) radar data.

    "abstract": "The $T^2$-scaling of resistivity with temperature is often viewed as a\nclassic hallmark of a Fermi-liquid (FL) behavior in metals. However, if umklapp\nscattering is suppressed, this scaling is not universally guaranteed to occur.\nIn this case, the resistivity behavior is influenced by several factors, such\nas dimensionality (two vs. three), topology (simply- vs. multiply-connected\nFermi surfaces), and (in two dimensions) the shape (convex vs. concave) of the\nFermi surface (FS). Specifically for an isotropic spectrum, as well as for a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) convex FS, the $T^2$ term is absent, and the first\nnon-zero contribution scales as $T^4\\ln T$ in 2D and as $T^4$ in 3D. In this\npaper, we study the $T$-dependence of the resistivity, arising from\nelectron-electron interactions, in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We\nshow that, for an isotropic FS in any dimensions and for a convex 2D FS, the\n$T^2$ term is also absent in both Hall and diagonal components of the\nmagnetoconductivity, which instead scale as $BT^4\\ln T$ and $B^2T^4\\ln T$,\nrespectively, in 2D and as $BT^4$ and $B^2T^4$ in 3D. The FL-like scaling,\ni.e., $BT^2$ and $B^2T^2$ of the Hall and diagonal conductivities is recovered\nfor a concave FS in 2D. Furthermore, we show that, for an isotropic spectrum,\nmagnetoresistance is absent even in the presence of electron-electron\ninteractions. Additionally, we examine the high-temperature limit, when\nelectron-electron scattering prevails over electron-impurity one, and show that\nall the components of the conductivity tensor saturate in this limit at values\nthat are determined by impurity scattering but, in general, differ from the\ncorresponding values at $T=0$.",

Creating aesthetically pleasing banner\ndesigns while conveying the campaign messages is challenging due to the large\nsearch space involving multiple design elements.

Since design is intrinsically an iterative and subjective\nprocess, flexible editability is also in high demand for practical usage. While\ncurrent models have served as assistants to human designers in various design\ntasks, they typically handle only segments of the creative design process or\nproduce pixel-based outputs that limit editability.

The identifiability results are, then, used to design\nnear-optimal adaptive control policies which alternate between periods of\nexploration, where the agent attempts to learn the true kernel, and periods of\nexploitation where the knowledge accrued throughout the exploration phase is\nused to minimize costs.

    "abstract": "To overcome computational challenges of Optimal Transport (OT), several\nvariants of Sliced Wasserstein (SW) has been developed in the literature. These\napproaches exploit the closed-form expression of the univariate OT by\nprojecting measures onto (one-dimensional) lines. However, projecting measures\nonto low-dimensional spaces can lead to a loss of topological information.\nTree-Sliced Wasserstein distance on Systems of Lines (TSW-SL) has emerged as a\npromising alternative that replaces these lines with a more advanced structure\ncalled tree systems. The tree structures enhance the ability to capture\ntopological information of the metric while preserving computational\nefficiency. However, at the core of TSW-SL, the splitting maps, which serve as\nthe mechanism for pushing forward measures onto tree systems, focus solely on\nthe position of the measure supports while disregarding the projecting domains.\nMoreover, the specific splitting map used in TSW-SL leads to a metric that is\nnot invariant under Euclidean transformations, a typically expected property\nfor OT on Euclidean space. In this work, we propose a novel class of splitting\nmaps that generalizes the existing one studied in TSW-SL enabling the use of\nall positional information from input measures, resulting in a novel\nDistance-based Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (Db-TSW) distance. In addition, we\nintroduce a simple tree sampling process better suited for Db-TSW, leading to\nan efficient GPU-friendly implementation for tree systems, similar to the\noriginal SW. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of proposed\nclass of splitting maps to verify the injectivity of the corresponding Radon\nTransform, and demonstrate that Db-TSW is an Euclidean invariant metric. We\nempirically show that Db-TSW significantly improves accuracy compared to recent\nSW variants while maintaining low computational cost via a wide range of\nexperiments.",

Comparing causal graphs is,\ntherefore, essential for evaluating assumptions, integrating insights, and\nresolving disagreements. The rise of AI tools has further amplified this need,\nas they are increasingly used to generate hypothesized causal graphs by\nsynthesizing information from various sources such as prior research and\ncommunity inputs, providing the potential for automating and scaling causal\nmodeling for complex systems. Similar to humans, these tools also produce\ninconsistent results across platforms, versions, and iterations. Despite its\nimportance, research on causal graph comparison remains scarce.

A key requirement\nfor designing efficient molecular nanomotors is ensuring unidirectional\nrotation during isomerization and thermal helix inversion. Here, we used\nnon-adiabatic trajectory surface hopping molecular dynamics based on TDDFT to\nstudy the excited state dynamics of the stable M- and metastable P-conformers\nof a second-generation Feringa-type molecular nanomotor. From the trajectories,\nwe computed quantum yields for clockwise and anti-clockwise photoisomerization.\nResults show that the helicity of the initial structure dictates the direction\nof the isomerization: 52 $\\%$ of the trajectories starting from M-conformers\nisomerize clockwise, whereas 23 $\\%$ of the trajectories starting from\nP-conformers isomerize anti-clockwise. The quantum yield for clockwise\nisomerization can be maximized by excitation in the center of the absorption\nspectrum (350 - 400 nm). In this region, the M-conformer exhibits its maximum\nabsorption and maximum (clockwise) isomerization quantum yield, whereas the\nP-conformer shows negligible excitation probability and (anti-clockwise)\nisomerization quantum yield. Moreover, we also find several trajectories, where\nthermal helix inversion occurs in the hot ground state, directly after excited\nstate relaxation. While helix inversion was observed to proceed in both\ndirections, its net effect favors unidirectional rotation.

For temporal coherence, we design a\ncorrelated Gaussian noise structure that links frames over time, allowing each\nframe to depend meaningfully on prior frames.

Here, A-site cation disorder engineering is employed in the\nn = 2 Ruddlesden-Popper layered perovskite La2Ba1-xSrxIn2O7 to achieve\nroom-temperature ferroelectricity. Systematic substitution of Sr2+ for Ba2+\ndrives symmetry transitions from a parent centrosymmetric (CS) P42/mnm\nstructure (x = 0) to two emergent phases: a CS Amam phase (for x from 0.3 to\n0.4) and a polar A21am phase (for x from 0.5 to 0.9).

Cation disorder at A-sites suppresses the interfacial\nrumpling-induced octahedral elongation (deformation) while enhancing the\noctahedral rotations which are critical for the polar symmetry stabilization.\nFirst-principles calculations further elucidate that Sr/La disorder mitigates\nelectrostatic interactions, enabling oxygen octahedral distortions necessary\nfor ferroelectricity.

    "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI\ndevelopment, yet the resource demands beyond a single cluster or even\ndatacenter, limiting accessibility to well-resourced organizations.\nDecentralized training has emerged as a promising paradigm to leverage\ndispersed resources across clusters, datacenters and regions, offering the\npotential to democratize LLM development for broader communities. As the first\ncomprehensive exploration of this emerging field, we present decentralized LLM\ntraining as a resource-driven paradigm and categorize existing efforts into\ncommunity-driven and organizational approaches. We further clarify this\nthrough: (1) a comparison with related paradigms, (2) a characterization of\ndecentralized resources, and (3) a taxonomy of recent advancements. We also\nprovide up-to-date case studies and outline future directions to advance\nresearch in decentralized LLM training.",

    "abstract": "We present an fully AI-driven design framework for photonic crystals (PhCs),\nengineered to achieve high efficiency in photonic crystal surface-emitting\nlasers (PCSELs). By discretizing the PhC structure into a grid, where the edges\nof the holes are represented by the cross-sections of two-dimensional Gaussian\nsurfaces, we achieve high-degree-of-freedom and fabrication-friendly hole\ndesign. Coupled-wave theory (CWT) generates a dataset by evaluating\nsurface-emitting efficiency ($SEE$) and quality factor ($Q$) of PhC designs,\nwhile a multi-layered neural network (NN) learns and extracts essential\nfeatures from these designs. Finally, black-box optimization (BBO) is employed\nto fine-tune the photonic crystal structure, enabling a fully AI-driven design\nprocess. The model achieves high prediction accuracy, with Pearson correlation\ncoefficients of 0.780 for $SEE$ and 0.887 for the log-transformed $Q$.\nAdditionally, we perform Shapley value analysis to identify the most important\nFourier coefficients, providing insights into the factors that impact the\nperformance of PCSEL designs. Our work accelerates the design process by over\n1,000,000 times compared to traditional FDTD simulations, reducing parameter\noptimization from two weeks to just one second. Our work speeds up the design\nprocess and enables efficient optimization of high-performance PCSELs, driving\nthe development of fully photonic design automation (PDA).",

Many autonomous and\ncontrolled systems involve dynamics that evolve on multiple timescales, and for\nthese systems, singular perturbation methods can be used for model reduction.\nHowever, such methods are more challenging to apply in HJR due to the presence\nof an underlying differential game. In this work, we leverage prior work on\nsingularly perturbed differential games to identify a class of systems which\ncan be readily reduced, and we relate these results to the quantities of\ninterest in HJR. We demonstrate the utility of our results on two examples\ninvolving biological systems, where dynamics fitting the identified class are\nfrequently encountered.",

    "abstract": "Accurate robot localization is essential for effective operation. Monte Carlo\nLocalization (MCL) is commonly used with known maps but is computationally\nexpensive due to landmark matching for each particle. Humanoid robots face\nadditional challenges, including sensor noise from locomotion vibrations and a\nlimited field of view (FOV) due to camera placement. This paper proposes a fast\nand robust localization method via iterative landmark matching (ILM) for\nhumanoid robots. The iterative matching process improves the accuracy of the\nlandmark association so that it does not need MCL to match landmarks to\nparticles. Pose estimation with the outlier removal process enhances its\nrobustness to measurement noise and faulty detections. Furthermore, an\nadditional filter can be utilized to fuse inertial data from the inertial\nmeasurement unit (IMU) and pose data from localization. We compared ILM with\nIterative Closest Point (ICP), which shows that ILM method is more robust\ntowards the error in the initial guess and easier to get a correct matching. We\nalso compared ILM with the Augmented Monte Carlo Localization (aMCL), which\nshows that ILM method is much faster than aMCL and even more accurate. The\nproposed method's effectiveness is thoroughly evaluated through experiments and\nvalidated on the humanoid robot ARTEMIS during RoboCup 2024 adult-sized soccer\ncompetition.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning have achieved widespread\nsuccess in many domains but remain constrained during real-world deployment.\nOne of the main issues is the additional requirements that were not considered\nduring training. To address this challenge, policy customization has been\nintroduced, aiming to adapt a prior policy while preserving its inherent\nproperties and meeting new task-specific requirements. A principled approach to\npolicy customization is Residual Q-Learning (RQL), which formulates the problem\nas a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and derives a family of value-based learning\nalgorithms. However, RQL has not yet been applied to policy gradient methods,\nwhich restricts its applicability, especially in tasks where policy gradient\nhas already proven more effective. In this work, we first derive a concise form\nof Soft Policy Gradient as a preliminary. Building on this, we introduce\nResidual Policy Gradient (RPG), which extends RQL to policy gradient methods,\nallowing policy customization in gradient-based RL settings. With the view of\nRPG, we rethink the KL-regularized objective widely used in RL fine-tuning. We\nshow that under certain assumptions, KL-regularized objective leads to a\nmaximum-entropy policy that balances the inherent properties and task-specific\nrequirements on a reward-level. Our experiments in MuJoCo demonstrate the\neffectiveness of Soft Policy Gradient and Residual Policy Gradient.",

Existing methods frequently overlook the heterogeneity among views\nduring recovery, leading to significant distribution discrepancies between\nrecovered and true data. Additionally, many approaches focus on cross-view\ncorrelations, neglecting insights from intra-view reliable structure and\ncross-view clustering structure. To address these issues, we propose BURG, a\nnovel method for incomplete multi-view clustering with distriBution\ndUal-consistency Recovery Guidance. We treat each sample as a distinct category\nand perform cross-view distribution transfer to predict the distribution space\nof missing views. To compensate for the lack of reliable category information,\nwe design a dual-consistency guided recovery strategy that includes intra-view\nalignment guided by neighbor-aware consistency and cross-view alignment guided\nby prototypical consistency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate\nthe superiority of BURG in the incomplete multi-view scenario.",

    "abstract": "We analyze quantum parameter estimation by studying the dynamics of the\nquantum Fisher information (QFI) for two classes of parameters, acceleration\nand initial-state weight, in an Unruh-DeWitt detector undergoing four distinct\nnoninertial motions: linear, cusped, catenary, and circular trajectories\nrespectively. We assume that the detector is initialized in a pure\nsuperposition state with a weight parameter $\\theta$ characterizing the\nprobability of the detector occupying each state. Our results reveal that, over\nlong evolution times, the QFI for the acceleration parameter converges to a\nnonnegative asymptotic value that depends sensitively on the trajectory,\nwhereas the QFI for the weight parameter decays to zero as the system\nthermalizes. Importantly, for sufficiently large accelerations, one can attain\nthe optimal precision in estimating the acceleration parameter within a finite\ninteraction time, eliminating the need for infinitely long measurements.\nComparing trajectories, we find that for small accelerations (relative to the\ndetector's energy gap), linear motion yields the highest QFI for $\\theta$,\nwhile for large accelerations, circular motion becomes optimal for estimating\n$\\theta$. By contrast, circular motion offers the best precision for estimating\nacceleration itself in both the small- and large-acceleration regimes (the\nlatter only at very long times). These contrasting behaviors of QFI across\ntrajectories suggest a novel metrological protocol for inferring the underlying\nnoninertial motion of a quantum probe.",

Speed tests were conducted for systems\nof different sizes, varying symmetries, and sampling densities of Brillouin\nzone \\textbf{\\textit{q}} points, showing that compared to the diagonal\nsupercell method, the non-diagonal approach is approximately an order of\nmagnitude faster and becomes even more efficient with increasing system\ncomplexity.

To accomplish this, a\nlightweight noise-resistant visual perception system and a nonlinearity-robust\nservo system are adopted.\n  We conduct a series of tests in both simulated and real-world environments.\nThe visual perception system achieves the speed of 11 ms per frame due to its\nlightweight nature, and the servo system achieves sub-centimeter accuracy with\nthe proposed controller.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces TARDIS (Temporal Allocation for Resource Distribution\nusing Intelligent Scheduling), a novel power-aware job scheduler for\nHigh-Performance Computing (HPC) systems that minimizes electricity costs\nthrough both temporal and spatial optimization. Our approach addresses the\ngrowing concerns of energy consumption in HPC centers, where electricity\nexpenses constitute a substantial portion of operational costs and have a\nsignificant financial impact. TARDIS employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to\naccurately predict individual job power consumption, then uses these\npredictions to strategically schedule jobs across multiple HPC facilities based\non time-varying electricity prices. The system integrates both temporal\nscheduling, shifting power-intensive workloads to off-peak hours, and spatial\nscheduling, distributing jobs across geographically dispersed centers with\ndifferent pricing schemes. We evaluate TARDIS using trace-based simulations\nfrom real HPC workloads, demonstrating cost reductions of up to 18% in temporal\noptimization scenarios and 10 to 20% in multi-site environments compared to\nstate-of-the-art scheduling approaches, while maintaining comparable system\nperformance and job throughput. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that TARDIS\neffectively addresses limitations in existing power-aware scheduling approaches\nby combining accurate power prediction with holistic spatial-temporal\noptimization, providing a scalable solution for sustainable and cost-efficient\nHPC operations.",

    "abstract": "The superconducting qubit is one of the promising directions in realizing\nfault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC), which requires many high-quality\nqubits. To achieve this, it is desirable to leverage modern semiconductor\nindustry technology to ensure quality, uniformity, and reproducibility.\nHowever, conventional Josephson junction fabrication relies mainly on\nresist-assistant double-angle evaporation, posing integration challenges. Here,\nwe demonstrate a lift-off-free qubit fabrication that integrates seamlessly\nwith existing industrial technologies. This method employs a silicon oxide\n(SiO$_2$) scaffold to define an etched window with a well-controlled size to\nform a Josephson junction. The SiO$_2$, which has a large dielectric loss, is\netched away in the final step using vapor HF leaving little residue. This\nWindow junction (WJ) process mitigates the degradation of qubit quality during\nfabrication and allows clean removal of the scaffold.

The project's main goal is to develop a scalable plasma\nsource for use in a beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator as part of the\nAWAKE project. We measure the plasma density with a new heterodyne microwave\ninterferometer that features several improvements over traditional approaches.\nThe design uses a single microwave source combined with an upconverter to avoid\nfrequency drift and reduce overall cost. Elliptical mirrors focus the probe\nbeam into the plasma and guide it back to the receiver. The transmitter and\nreceiver along with the measurement electronics are co-located in a small\nenclosure and are assisted by two small mirrors on the opposite side of MAP.\nBoth halves of the system move independently on computer-controlled motion\nplatforms. This setup enables fast repositioning of the interferometer to\nmeasure at any axial location despite the magnets, wiring and structural\nsupports that would block movement of a waveguide-based system. A high-speed,\nhigh-precision mixed signal circuit and FPGA analyze the probe signal directly\nin the enclosure which obviates the need for a digitizer or oscilloscope. The\ninterferometer resolves phase shifts down to one hundredth of a fringe,\nresulting in a line-averaged resolution of $1.5\\mathrm{\\cdot 10^{17}\\;\nm^{-3}}$.

    "abstract": "Action recognition is a crucial task in artificial intelligence, with\nsignificant implications across various domains. We initially perform a\ncomprehensive analysis of seven prominent action recognition methods across\nfive widely-used datasets. This analysis reveals a critical, yet previously\noverlooked, observation: as the velocity of actions increases, the performance\nof these methods variably declines, undermining their robustness. This decline\nin performance poses significant challenges for their application in real-world\nscenarios. Building on these findings, we introduce the Velocity-Aware Action\nRecognition (VA-AR) framework to obtain robust action representations across\ndifferent velocities. Our principal insight is that rapid actions (e.g., the\ngiant circle backward in uneven bars or a smash in badminton) occur within\nshort time intervals, necessitating smaller temporal attention windows to\naccurately capture intricate changes. Conversely, slower actions (e.g.,\ndrinking water or wiping face) require larger windows to effectively encompass\nthe broader context. VA-AR employs a Mixture of Window Attention (MoWA)\nstrategy, dynamically adjusting its attention window size based on the action's\nvelocity. This adjustment enables VA-AR to obtain a velocity-aware\nrepresentation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of action recognition. Extensive\nexperiments confirm that VA-AR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the\nsame five datasets, demonstrating VA-AR's effectiveness across a broad spectrum\nof action recognition scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Writing Assistants (e.g., Grammarly, Microsoft Copilot) traditionally\ngenerate diverse image captions by employing syntactic and semantic variations\nto describe image components. However, human-written captions prioritize\nconveying a central message alongside visual descriptions using pragmatic cues.\nTo enhance caption diversity, it is essential to explore alternative ways of\ncommunicating these messages in conjunction with visual content. We propose\nRONA, a novel prompting strategy for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM)\nthat leverages Coherence Relations as a controllable axis for pragmatic\nvariations. We demonstrate that RONA generates captions with better overall\ndiversity and ground-truth alignment, compared to MLLM baselines across\nmultiple domains.

    "abstract": "Language Models (LMs) often encounter knowledge conflicts when parametric\nmemory contradicts contextual knowledge. Previous works attribute this conflict\nto the interplay between \"memory heads\" and \"context heads\", attention heads\nassumed to promote either memory or context exclusively. In this study, we go\nbeyond this fundamental assumption by uncovering a critical phenomenon we term\nthe superposition of contextual information and parametric memory, where highly\ninfluential attention heads simultaneously contribute to both memory and\ncontext. Building upon this insight, we propose Just Run Twice (JuICE), a\ntest-time attention intervention method that steers LMs toward either\nparametric beliefs or contextual knowledge without requiring fine-tuning. JuICE\nidentifies a set of reliable attention heads and leverages a dual-run approach\nto mitigate the superposition effects. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets\nand 6 model architectures demonstrate that JuICE sets the new state-of-the-art\nperformance and robust generalization, achieving significant and consistent\nimprovement across different domains under various conflict types. Finally, we\ntheoretically analyze knowledge conflict and the superposition of contextual\ninformation and parametric memory in attention heads, which further elucidates\nthe effectiveness of JuICE in these settings.

    "abstract": "The enforcement of global energy conservation in phase-field fracture\nsimulations has been an open problem for the last 25 years. Specifically, the\noccurrence of unstable fracture is accompanied by a loss in total potential\nenergy, which suggests a violation of the energy conservation law. This\nphenomenon can occur even with purely quasi-static, displacement-driven loading\nconditions, where finite crack growth arises from an infinitesimal increase in\nload. While such behavior is typically seen in crack nucleation, it may also\noccur in other situations. Initial efforts to enforce energy conservation\ninvolved backtracking schemes based on global minimization, however in recent\nyears it has become clearer that unstable fracture, being an inherently dynamic\nphenomenon, cannot be adequately resolved within a purely quasi-static\nframework. Despite this, it remains uncertain whether transitioning to a fully\ndynamic framework would sufficiently address the issue. In this work, we\npropose a pseudo-dynamic framework designed to enforce energy balance without\nrelying on global minimization. This approach incorporates dynamic effects\nheuristically into an otherwise quasi-static model, allowing us to bypass\nsolving the full dynamic linear momentum equation. It offers the flexibility to\nsimulate crack evolution along a spectrum, ranging from full energy\nconservation at one extreme to maximal energy loss at the other. Using data\nfrom recent experiments, we demonstrate that our framework can closely\nreplicate experimental load-displacement curves, achieving results that are\nunattainable with classical phase-field models.",

In this paper, we seek to uncover fundamental\nstatistical limits concerning aligning LLMs with human preferences, with a\nfocus on the probabilistic representation of human preferences and the\npreservation of diverse preferences in aligned LLMs. We first show that human\npreferences can be represented by a reward model if and only if the preference\namong LLM-generated responses is free of any Condorcet cycle. Moreover, we\nprove that Condorcet cycles exist with probability converging to one\nexponentially fast under a probabilistic preference model, thereby\ndemonstrating the impossibility of fully aligning human preferences using\nreward-based approaches such as reinforcement learning from human feedback.\nNext, we explore the conditions under which LLMs would employ mixed strategies\n-- meaning they do not collapse to a single response -- when aligned in the\nlimit using a non-reward-based approach, such as Nash learning from human\nfeedback (NLHF). We identify a necessary and sufficient condition for mixed\nstrategies: the absence of a response that is preferred over all others by a\nmajority. As a blessing, we prove that this condition holds with high\nprobability under the probabilistic preference model, thereby highlighting the\nstatistical possibility of preserving minority preferences without explicit\nregularization in aligning LLMs. Finally, we leverage insights from our\nstatistical results to design a novel, computationally efficient algorithm for\nfinding Nash equilibria in aligning LLMs with NLHF.

This observation is attributed to the interplay between\nspin and charge gaps. Due to the spontaneous ferromagnetism, the spin gap\ndominates at low field, while the charge gap becomes appreciable once the\nmagnetic field freezes spin fluctuations.

    "abstract": "Quantum computers allow a near-exponential speed-up for specific applications\nwhen compared to classical computers. Despite recent advances in the hardware\nof quantum computers, their practical usage is still severely limited due to a\nrestricted number of available physical qubits and quantum gates, short\ncoherence time, and high error rates. This paper lays the foundation towards a\nmetric independent approach to quantum circuit optimization based on exhaustive\nsearch algorithms. This work uses depth-first search and iterative deepening\ndepth-first search. We rely on ZX calculus to represent and optimize quantum\ncircuits through the minimization of a given metric (e.g. the T-gate and edge\ncount). ZX calculus formally guarantees that the semantics of the original\ncircuit is preserved. As ZX calculus is a non-terminating rewriting system, we\nutilise a novel set of pruning rules to ensure termination while still\nobtaining high-quality solutions. We provide the first formalization of quantum\ncircuit optimization using ZX calculus and exhaustive search. We extensively\nbenchmark our approach on 100 standard quantum circuits. Finally, our\nimplementation is integrated in the well-known libraries PyZX and Qiskit as a\ncompiler pass to ensure applicability of our results.",

    "abstract": "Occlusion poses a significant challenge in pedestrian detection from a single\nview. To address this, multi-view detection systems have been utilized to\naggregate information from multiple perspectives. Recent advances in multi-view\ndetection utilized an early-fusion strategy that strategically projects the\nfeatures onto the ground plane, where detection analysis is performed. A\npromising approach in this context is the use of 3D feature-pulling technique,\nwhich constructs a 3D feature volume of the scene by sampling the corresponding\n2D features for each voxel. However, it creates a 3D feature volume of the\nwhole scene without considering the potential locations of pedestrians. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel model that efficiently leverages traditional 3D\nreconstruction techniques to enhance deep multi-view pedestrian detection. This\nis accomplished by complementing the 3D feature volume with probabilistic\noccupancy volume, which is constructed using the visual hull technique. The\nprobabilistic occupancy volume focuses the model's attention on regions\noccupied by pedestrians and improves detection accuracy. Our model outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models on the MultiviewX dataset, with an MODA of 97.3%, while\nachieving competitive performance on the Wildtrack dataset.",

We focus on the case where two components are strongly\ncoupled by the drive, forming hybrid superpositions, and interacting with an\nuncoupled third component. Using a generalized Bardeen- Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\nansatz, we show that there are two coupled superfluid order parameters, and we\nobtain the associated free energy and quasiparticle excitation spectrum. We\nfind that we can drive BCS-BCS, BCS-Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and BEC-BEC\ncrossovers purely by varying the detuning of the Rabi drive from the bare\ntransition, with the precise crossover depending on the sign of the underlying\ninteractions between the coupled and uncoupled components. We furthermore\nidentify an exotic excited branch which features both normal to BCS superfluid\ntransitions, as well as a BCS-BEC-BCS crossover. Introducing a generalized\nThouless criterion, we show that this behavior is reflected in the critical\ntemperature for superfluidity. Our Rabi-coupled scenario also gives possesses\nadditional thermodynamic properties related to the pseudospin of the coupled\ncomponents, which provide novel signatures of the state of the many-body\nsystem.

Here, we have utilized a Ramsey-like pulse sequence to monitor\nchanges in the parity states of five transmon qubits. The five qubits have\nshunting capacitors with two different geometries and fabricated from both Al\nand Ta. The charge parity rate differs by a factor of two for the two transmon\ndesigns studied here but does not depend on the material of the shunting\ncapacitor. The underlying mechanism of the source of parity switching is\nfurther investigated in one of the qubit devices by increasing the\nquasiparticle trapping rate using induced vortices in the electrodes of the\ndevice. The charge parity rate exhibited a weak dependence on the quasiparticle\ntrapping rate, indicating that the main source of charge parity events is from\nthe production of quasiparticles across the Josephson junction.

Why do structures emerge, and how do they enable\nlearning, generalization, and prediction? What computational principles\nunderlie this core aspect of perception and intelligence?

In the first\nproject, I investigated factors influencing chunking in a serial reaction time\ntask and showed that humans adapt to underlying chunks while balancing speed\nand accuracy. Building on this, I developed models that learn chunks and parse\nsequences chunk by chunk. Normatively, I proposed chunking as a rational\nstrategy for discovering recurring patterns and nested hierarchies, enabling\nefficient sequence factorization. Learned chunks serve as reusable primitives\nfor transfer, composition, and mental simulation -- letting the model compose\nthe new from the known. I demonstrated this model's ability to learn\nhierarchies in single and multi-dimensional sequences and highlighted its\nutility for unsupervised pattern discovery. The second part moves from concrete\nto abstract sequences. I taxonomized abstract motifs and examined their role in\nsequence memory.

Since then, substantial research has aimed at narrowing the gap\nbetween their algorithm and the best achievable approximation by an algorithm\nguaranteed to open exactly $k$ centers.

Our approach builds on a\ncombination of two algorithms. First, we present a non-trivial modification of\nthe Greedy algorithm that operates with $O(\\log n/\\epsilon^2)$ adaptive phases.\nThrough a novel walk-between-solutions approach, this enables us to construct a\n$(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-median that consistently opens\nat most $k + O(\\log n{/\\epsilon^2})$ centers. Second, we develop a novel\n$(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm tailored for stable instances, where\nremoving any center from an optimal solution increases the cost by at least an\n$\\Omega(\\epsilon^3/\\log n)$ fraction.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in human mobility research have revealed consistent pairwise\ncharacteristics in movement behavior, yet existing mobility models often\noverlook the spatial and topological structure of mobility networks. By\nanalyzing millions of devices' anonymized cell phone trajectories, we uncover a\ndistinct modular organization within these networks, demonstrating that\nmovements within spatial modules differ significantly from those between\nmodules. This finding challenges the conventional assumption of uniform\nmobility dynamics and underscores the influence of heterogeneous environments\non human movement. Inspired by switching behaviors in animal movement patterns,\nwe introduce a novel \"switch mechanism\" to differentiate movement modes,\nallowing our model to accurately reproduce both the modular structures of\ntrajectory networks and spatial mobility patterns. Our results provide new\ninsights into the dynamics of human mobility and its impact on network\nformation, with broad applications in traffic prediction, disease transmission\nmodeling, and urban planning. Beyond advancing the theoretical and practical\nunderstanding of mobility networks, this work opens new avenues for\nunderstanding societal dynamics at large.",

The fundamental\ncharacteristic of imbalanced Boolean functions is that the proportion of\nelements in their domain that take the value $0$ is not equal to the proportion\nof elements that take the value $1$. For every positive integer $n$, the\nhierarchy contains a class of Boolean functions defined based on their\nbehavioral pattern. The common trait of all the functions belonging to the same\nclass is that they possess the same imbalance ratio. Our algorithm achieves\nclassification in a straightforward manner as the final measurement reveals the\nunknown function with probability $1$. Let us also note that the proposed\nalgorithm is an optimal oracular algorithm because it can classify the\naforementioned functions with a single query to the oracle. At the same time we\nexplain in detail the methodology we followed to design this algorithm in the\nhope that it will prove general and fruitful, given that it can be easily\nmodified and extended to address other classes of imbalanced Boolean functions\nthat exhibit different behavioral patterns.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks\nin challenging dexterous manipulation settings. As new methods are developed,\nthey must be rigorously evaluated and compared against corresponding baselines\nthrough repeated evaluation trials. However, policy comparison is fundamentally\nconstrained by a small feasible sample size (e.g., 10 or 50) due to significant\nhuman effort and limited inference throughput of policies. This paper proposes\na novel statistical framework for rigorously comparing two policies in the\nsmall sample size regime. Prior work in statistical policy comparison relies on\nbatch testing, which requires a fixed, pre-determined number of trials and\nlacks flexibility in adapting the sample size to the observed evaluation data.\nFurthermore, extending the test with additional trials risks inducing\ninadvertent p-hacking, undermining statistical assurances. In contrast, our\nproposed statistical test is sequential, allowing researchers to decide whether\nor not to run more trials based on intermediate results. This adaptively\ntailors the number of trials to the difficulty of the underlying comparison,\nsaving significant time and effort without sacrificing probabilistic\ncorrectness. Extensive numerical simulation and real-world robot manipulation\nexperiments show that our test achieves near-optimal stopping, letting\nresearchers stop evaluation and make a decision in a near-minimal number of\ntrials. Specifically, it reduces the number of evaluation trials by up to 32%\nas compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving the probabilistic\ncorrectness and statistical power of the comparison. Moreover, our method is\nstrongest in the most challenging comparison instances (requiring the most\nevaluation trials); in a multi-task comparison scenario, we save the evaluator\nmore than 160 simulation rollouts.",

    "abstract": "Modern Large Language Model (LLM) systems typically rely on Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) which aims to gather context that is useful for\nresponse generation. These RAG systems typically optimize strictly towards\nretrieving context that is maximally relevant to the query. However,\nconventional theory suggests that retrieval systems which seek to maximize\ncontext relevance without any additional explicit criteria can create\ninformation bottlenecks. We reaffirm this finding in the modern age of LLM's by\nshowing that in standard RAG pipelines, maximizing for context relevance alone\ncan degrade downstream response quality. In response, we show evaluations of\nexisting RAG methods which account for both context relevance and answer\nquality. These evaluations introduce a novel finding that existing RAG systems\nscale poorly with inference time compute usage when considering our combined\nmetric. We introduce \"RErank BEyond reLevance (REBEL)\", which enables RAG\nsystems to scale with inference-time compute via injection of multi-criteria\noptimization using Chain-of-Thought prompting (and optionally Multi-Turn\ndialogue). Ultimately, this enables a new performance/speed tradeoff curve,\nwhere RAG systems are able to achieve both higher relevance of retrieved\ncontexts and superior answer quality as inference time increases.

Despite\nits well-established nature, certain foundational aspects remain subtle. In\nthis paper, we revisit three key properties of policy optimization in LQR: (i)\nstrong duality in the nonconvex policy optimization formulation, (ii) the\ngradient dominance property, examining when it holds and when it fails, and\n(iii) the global optimality of linear static policies. Using primal-dual\nanalysis and convex reformulation, we refine and clarify existing results by\nleveraging Riccati equations/inequalities, semidefinite programming (SDP)\nduality, and a recent framework of Extended Convex Lifting (\\texttt{ECL}). Our\nanalysis confirms that LQR 1) behaves almost like a convex problem (e.g.,\nstrong duality) under the standard assumptions of stabilizability and\ndetectability and 2) exhibits strong convexity-like properties (e.g., gradient\ndominance) under slightly stronger conditions. In particular, we establish a\nbroader characterization under which gradient dominance holds using\n\\texttt{ECL} and the notion of Cauchy directions.
