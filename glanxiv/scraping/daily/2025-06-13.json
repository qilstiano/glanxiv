    "abstract": "The large-scale dynamics of the universe is generally described in terms of\nthe time-dependent scale factor $a(t)$. To make contact with observational\ndata, the $a(t)$ function needs to be related to the observable $z(r)$\nfunction, redshift versus distance. Model fitting of data has shown that the\nequation that governs $z(r)$ needs to contain a constant term, which has been\nidentified as Einstein's cosmological constant. Here, it is shown that the\nrequired constant term is not a cosmological constant but is due to an\noverlooked geometric difference between proper time $t$ and look-back time\n$t_{\\rm lb}$ along lines of sight, which fan out isotropically in all\ndirections of the 3D (3-dimensional) space that constitutes the observable\nuniverse. The constant term is needed to satisfy the requirement of spatial\nisotropy in the local limit. Its magnitude is independent of the epoch in which\nthe observer lives and agrees with the value found by model fitting of\nobservational data. Two of the observational consequences of this explanation\nare examined: an increase in the age of the universe from 13.8 Gyr to 15.4 Gyr,\nand a resolution of the $H_0$ tension, which restores consistency to\ncosmological theory.",

The distinctive properties of our microscopic graph model and the\ncorresponding coarse-grained viscoelasticity are that (i) net cell\nproliferation is spatially inhomogeneous and (ii) cellular dynamics cannot be\nexpressed as an energy gradient. To overcome the general challenge of inferring\nmicroscopic model parameters from noisy high-dimensional data, we develop a\nnudged automatic differentiation algorithm (NADA) that can handle large\nfluctuations in cell positions observed in single tissue snapshots. This\ndata-calibrated microscopic model quantitatively captures proliferation-driven\ntissue flows observed at large scales in our experiments on fibroblastoma cell\ncultures. Beyond chirality, our inference algorithm can be used to extract\ninterpretable graph models from limited amounts of noisy data of living and\ninanimate cellular systems such as networks of convection cells and flowing\nfoams.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\nvarious domains. However, their potential to generate harmful responses has\nraised significant societal and regulatory concerns, especially when\nmanipulated by adversarial techniques known as \"jailbreak\" attacks. Existing\njailbreak methods typically involve appending carefully crafted prefixes or\nsuffixes to malicious prompts in order to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms\nof these models.\n  In this work, we identify a new vulnerability in which excessive linguistic\ncomplexity can disrupt built-in safety mechanisms-without the need for any\nadded prefixes or suffixes-allowing attackers to elicit harmful outputs\ndirectly. We refer to this phenomenon as Information Overload.\n  To automatically exploit this vulnerability, we propose InfoFlood, a\njailbreak attack that transforms malicious queries into complex,\ninformation-overloaded queries capable of bypassing built-in safety mechanisms.\nSpecifically, InfoFlood: (1) uses linguistic transformations to rephrase\nmalicious queries, (2) identifies the root cause of failure when an attempt is\nunsuccessful, and (3) refines the prompt's linguistic structure to address the\nfailure while preserving its malicious intent.\n  We empirically validate the effectiveness of InfoFlood on four widely used\nLLMs-GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini 2.0, and LLaMA 3.1-by measuring their\njailbreak success rates. InfoFlood consistently outperforms baseline attacks,\nachieving up to 3 times higher success rates across multiple jailbreak\nbenchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that commonly adopted post-processing\ndefenses, including OpenAI's Moderation API, Perspective API, and SmoothLLM,\nfail to mitigate these attacks. This highlights a critical weakness in\ntraditional AI safety guardrails when confronted with information\noverload-based jailbreaks.",

For the most complex task in our\nstudy, even the GPT-4o-based agent exhibits low alignment with human behavior,\nwith low F1 scores for dialog acts (0.464), excessive and often misaligned tool\nusage with a F1 score of 0.139, and ineffective usage of external knowledge.\nReducing such behavior gaps leads to significant performance improvement (24.3%\non average). This study highlights the importance of comprehensive behavioral\nevaluations and improved alignment strategies to enhance the effectiveness of\nLLM-based TODS in handling complex tasks.",

    "abstract": "In Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) networks, users covered by a mobile\nnetwork can exploit edge clouds (ECs), computational resources located at the\nnetwork's edge, to execute virtual network functions (VNFs). ECs are\nparticularly useful when deploying VNFs with strict delay and availability\nrequirements. As users roam in the network and get handed over between cells,\ndeployed VNFs must follow users to retain the benefits of edge computing. Yet,\nhaving VNFs ready at the closest EC can be challenging: (i) ECs are not usually\npowerful enough to store and run any combination of VNFs simultaneously; (ii)\nif a VNF is not available at the needed EC, a series of time-consuming\noperations has to be performed before the VNF becomes operational. These\nlimitations can be addressed by proactively starting VNFs instances at (likely)\nfuture locations, balancing better latency properties against higher resource\nusage. Such proactive deployment does need forecasting of user movements, but\nthese will be imperfect, creating yet another tradeoff. We present our approach\nto this service provisioning problem, SWAVES. When compared on the ratio of\nusers' unsuccessful packets, SWAVES improves such metric by orders of magnitude\nwith respect to other proposed heuristic.",

Geometric and combinatorial analysis is used to derive closed-form\nexpressions for transition probabilities between spheres around an optimum\ngiving a complete description of Markov evolution of distances from an optimum\nover multiple generations. This paves the way for optimization of parameters of\nmutation and recombination operators. Here we derive optimality conditions for\nmutation and recombination radii maximizing the probabilities of mutation and\ncrossover into the optimum. The analysis highlights important differences\nbetween these evolutionary operators. While mutation can potentially reach any\npart of the search space, the probability of beneficial mutation decreases with\ndistance to an optimum, and the optimal mutation radius or rate should also\ndecrease resulting in a slow-down of evolution near the optimum. Crossover\nrecombination, on the other hand, acts in a subspace of the search space\ndefined by the current population of strings. However, probabilities of\nbeneficial and deleterious crossover are balanced, and their characteristics,\nsuch as variance, are translation invariant in a Hamming space, suggesting that\nrecombination may complement mutation and boost the rate of evolution near the\noptimum.",

However, these manipulation policies often\nfail to generalize beyond their training viewpoints, which is a persistent\nchallenge in achieving perspective-agnostic manipulation, especially in\nsettings where the camera is expected to move at runtime. Although collecting\ndata from many angles seems a natural solution, such a naive approach is both\nresource-intensive and degrades manipulation policy performance due to\nexcessive and unstructured visual diversity. This paper proposes Vantage, a\nframework that systematically identifies and integrates data from optimal\nperspectives to train robust, viewpoint-agnostic policies. By formulating\nviewpoint selection as a continuous optimization problem, we iteratively\nfine-tune policies on a few vantage points. Since we leverage Bayesian\noptimization to efficiently navigate the infinite space of potential camera\nconfigurations, we are able to balance exploration of novel views and\nexploitation of high-performing ones, thereby ensuring data collection from a\nminimal number of effective viewpoints. We empirically evaluate this framework\non diverse standard manipulation tasks using multiple policy learning methods,\ndemonstrating that fine-tuning with data from strategic camera placements\nyields substantial performance gains, achieving average improvements of up to\n46.19% when compared to fixed, random, or heuristic-based strategies.",

We introduce EgoPrivacy, the\nfirst large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of privacy risks\nin egocentric vision. EgoPrivacy covers three types of privacy (demographic,\nindividual, and situational), defining seven tasks that aim to recover private\ninformation ranging from fine-grained (e.g., wearer's identity) to\ncoarse-grained (e.g., age group). To further emphasize the privacy threats\ninherent to egocentric vision, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Attack, a novel\nattack strategy that leverages ego-to-exo retrieval from an external pool of\nexocentric videos to boost the effectiveness of demographic privacy attacks. An\nextensive comparison of the different attacks possible under all threat models\nis presented, showing that private information of the wearer is highly\nsusceptible to leakage. For instance, our findings indicate that foundation\nmodels can effectively compromise wearer privacy even in zero-shot settings by\nrecovering attributes such as identity, scene, gender, and race with 70-80%\naccuracy.

Vectors in the dual cone are usually\nassociated with separating hyperplanes, and so they are interpreted as\ncertificates of non-membership in the standard theory of duality. Complementing\nthis, we present constructive certification schemes through which members of\nthe dual cone can be interpreted as primal membership certificates. Every\nvector in the interior of $K$ is assigned a full-dimensional cone of\ncertificates, making the numerical computation of rigorous certificates easy,\nprovided that the dual cone has an efficiently computable logarithmically\nhomogeneous self-concordant barrier. Of particular interest are cones that are\nlow-dimensional linear images of much higher dimensional cones. In the context\nof optimization (as opposed to feasibility) problems, these certificates can be\nused to easily compute, using a closed-form formula, exact primal feasible\nsolutions from suitable dual feasible solutions, with the guarantee that the\ncloser the dual solutions are to optimality, the closer to optimality are the\ncomputed primal solutions, too.

    "abstract": "Collaborative robots must quickly adapt to their partner's intent and\npreferences to proactively identify helpful actions. This is especially true in\nsituated settings where human partners can continually teach robots new\nhigh-level behaviors, visual concepts, and physical skills (e.g., through\ndemonstration), growing the robot's capabilities as the human-robot pair work\ntogether to accomplish diverse tasks. In this work, we argue that robots should\nbe able to infer their partner's goals from early interactions and use this\ninformation to proactively plan behaviors ahead of explicit instructions from\nthe user. Building from the strong commonsense priors and steerability of large\nlanguage models, we introduce ProVox (\"Proactive Voice\"), a novel framework\nthat enables robots to efficiently personalize and adapt to individual\ncollaborators. We design a meta-prompting protocol that empowers users to\ncommunicate their distinct preferences, intent, and expected robot behaviors\nahead of starting a physical interaction. ProVox then uses the personalized\nprompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a\nuser's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to\nsuggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the\namount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot.\nWe evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation\ntasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the\ncollaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use,\nand reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity\nare critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less\nuser burden relative to non-active baselines.

However, Nature often harnesses these instabilities to achieve new\nfunctionalities, such as the mechanical snap-through of the Venus flytrap.\nInspired by this, engineers and physicists have increasingly exploited elastic\ninstabilities to enable rapid shape changes in metamaterials and soft robots,\nprovided the structure remains elastic throughout the transition. Here, we\nstudy the fluid-induced snapping instability of a spherical elastic shell at\nlow Reynolds numbers, the umbrella flipping problem when life is at low\nReynolds numbers. We combine precision desktop-scale experiments,\nfluid-structure simulations, shell theory, fluid mechanics, and scaling\nanalysis to determine the instability threshold as a function of the\ngeometrical and material parameters of the system. Building on these findings,\nwe devise a snapping-based valve that passively and abruptly alters the\nhydraulic resistance of a channel, offering robust flow control without active\ncomponents. These valves could be deployed in soft robotics and, because our\nresults are expressed in terms of key dimensionless parameters, we speculate\nthat the system can be miniaturized for use in microfluidic circuits. Beyond\nthe application, our study presents what we believe to be a prototypical\nexample of fluid-induced elastic instability at low Reynolds numbers, providing\na foundation for future explorations in soft hydraulics and flow-responsive\nstructures.",

As sulfur is linked to environmental concerns, sulfur-free\nzinc phosphate coatings have been sputtered from a Zn3(PO4)2 target and\ninvestigated here. Based on the bridging to non-bridging oxygen ratio,\ndetermined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the as deposited coatings\nare classified as metaphosphates. As the annealing temperature is increased,\nthe chain lengths are reduced, as witnessed by XPS data indicated by a loss of\nphosphorus and oxygen of the coating surface, likely due to hydrolysis with\nwater from the atmosphere. Transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive\nX-ray spectroscopy line scans show that the XPS-revealed composition change of\nthe coating surface upon annealing occurs over the whole thickness of the\ncoating. This alteration in composition and chain length reductions causes a\nrise in hardness, reduced Young's modulus, and wear resistance. Therefore, the\nproperties of the artificial zinc phosphate tribofilms can be tailored via a\nthermally stimulated composition change, causing an alternation in chain length\nfrom meta- to orthophosphate and thereby enabling the design of coatings with\ndesired mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "We study the possibility of discriminating between metric theories within the\nParametrized Post-Newtonian formalism. In this approach, the two-dimensional\nquantum state of a massive quantum clock becomes, after propagating at low\nspeed and in a weak gravitational field, a function of the post-Newtonian\nparameters and thus a signature of a metric theory. To discriminate among\nmetric theories, we resort to quantum-state discrimination strategies such as\nminimum error and unambiguous state discrimination. In particular, we show that\nit is possible to refute the hypothesis that a particular metric theory\ndescribes spacetime with a single detection event and that it is possible to\ndiscriminate with certainty between two different metrics, also with a single\ndetection event. In general, the success probability of the discrimination\nstrategy is a harmonic function of the product of the difference of the proper\ntime corresponding to each quantum clock state, the energy difference between\nthe energy eigenstates of the quantum clock, the propagation length, and speed.\nIt is thus possible to find suitable length and speed scales such that the\nsuccess probability is close to one by selecting a quantum system with the\nhighest energy difference and the largest natural lifetime. According to this,\natomic nuclei such as thorium are considered the most suitable quantum clocks.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as research tools\nin the history, philosophy, and sociology of science (HPSS). LLMs are\nremarkably effective at processing unstructured text and inferring meaning from\ncontext, offering new affordances that challenge long-standing divides between\ncomputational and interpretive methods. This raises both opportunities and\nchallenges for HPSS, which emphasizes interpretive methodologies and\nunderstands meaning as context-dependent, ambiguous, and historically situated.\nWe argue that HPSS is uniquely positioned not only to benefit from LLMs'\ncapabilities but also to interrogate their epistemic assumptions and\ninfrastructural implications. To this end, we first offer a concise primer on\nLLM architectures and training paradigms tailored to non-technical readers. We\nframe LLMs not as neutral tools but as epistemic infrastructures that encode\nassumptions about meaning, context, and similarity, conditioned by their\ntraining data, architecture, and patterns of use. We then examine how\ncomputational techniques enhanced by LLMs, such as structuring data, detecting\npatterns, and modeling dynamic processes, can be applied to support\ninterpretive research in HPSS. Our analysis compares full-context and\ngenerative models, outlines strategies for domain and task adaptation (e.g.,\ncontinued pretraining, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation), and\nevaluates their respective strengths and limitations for interpretive inquiry\nin HPSS. We conclude with four lessons for integrating LLMs into HPSS: (1)\nmodel selection involves interpretive trade-offs; (2) LLM literacy is\nfoundational; (3) HPSS must define its own benchmarks and corpora; and (4) LLMs\nshould enhance, not replace, interpretive methods.",

Despite the\nincreasing maturity of surgical techniques, re-tearing of the rotator cuff\nafter surgery remains common. The main reason for this issue is that the\noriginal structure of the rotator cuff at the TBI area is difficult to fully\nrestore after surgery, and anatomical healing of the rotator cuff TBI is\nchallenging to achieve solely through surgery. With the advancement of tissue\nengineering technology, more and more basic researchers and clinical surgeons\nare recognizing the enormous potential of tissue engineering in promoting TBI\nhealing. Growing research evidence indicates that tissue engineering technology\nnot only effectively promotes repairing and remodeling of the TBI but also\nreduces the formation of fibrous vascular scar tissue, leading to more orderly\ntissue reconstruction. The core of tissue engineering technology approaches\nlies in combining the use of various scaffolds, cells and bioactive molecules\nto simulate the natural environment of TBI healing, achieving optimal\ntherapeutic outcomes. In this review, we will systematically summarize and\nhighlight recent progress in the application of tissue engineering on TBI\nregeneration, particularly focusing on advancements in novel scaffolds and\ntheir role and potential in promoting healing of the TBI of rotator cuff,\nproviding valuable references for clinical application and research.",

    "abstract": "We propose a generalization of the False Vacuum Skyrme model for any simple\ncompact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. The Skyrme\nfield that in the original theory takes its values in $SU(2)$ Lie group, now\ntakes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries\nof a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\\dim G \\times \\dim G$-dimensional\nmatrix $h$. This model is also an extension of the generalized BPS Skyrme\nmodel. We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being\nself-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a\nparticular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically\nsymmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the\nminimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in\nthe context of false vacuum decay. This imposes a condition on the Skyrme\nfield, which, if satisfied, makes the total energy of the global minima, as\nwell as the main properties of the model, equivalent to those obtained for the\n$G=SU(2)$ case. We study this condition and its consequences within the\ngeneralized rational map ansatz and show how it can be satisfied for\n$G=SU(p+q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with the Hermitian\nsymmetric spaces being $SU(p+q)/SU(p) \\otimes SU(q) \\otimes U(1)$. In such a\ncase, the model is completely equivalent to the $G=SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme\nmodel, independent of the values of $p$ and $q$. We also provide a numerical\nstudy of the baryon density, RMS radius, and binding energy per nucleon that\ndeepens the analysis conducted for the $SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model.",

However, model fitting remains challenging due to\nlimited number of measurements, low signal-to-noise ratio and complex nonlinear\nbiophysical model. In this work, we comprehensively investigated and elucidated\nthe dependence of RWBM fitting performance on tissue property, data acquisition\nand processing, and provided insights on improving data acquisition and model\nfitting. We numerically evaluated the accuracy and precision of RWBM fitting\nusing non-linear least squares as a function of model parameters, noise levels,\nand maximum effective diffusion times over a wide range of microstructural\nparameter values. We then elucidated these results by examining the model's\ndegeneracy and fitting landscape. In vivo fitting results on patients with HNCs\nwere analyzed and were interpreted using the numerical results. We observed\nthat free diffusivity estimates were accurate and precise over a wide range of\nmicrostructural parameters, whereas the accuracy and precision of\nsurface-to-volume ratio and membrane permeability depended on the values of the\nparameters. In addition, a maximum effective diffusion time of 200 ms provided\nthe lowest bias and variance in membrane permeability estimations. By fitting\nto the short-time limit expression, we observed that the variance of parameter\nestimation was reduced, and that a more accurate and precise estimation of\nmembrane permeability was achieved.

Ensuring fairness in machine learning requires understanding\nhow sensitive attributes causally influence outcomes, yet CD methods often\nintroduce spurious or biased pathways.

We assess how well CD\nmethods recover both global structure and fairness-critical paths.\n  Our results show that LLM-guided methods, including the proposed method,\ndemonstrate competitive or superior performance in recovering such pathways\nunder noisy conditions.

High-$\\beta$ plasmas, dominated by thermal\npressure, are prone to instabilities (e.g., firehose, mirror) that limit\nanisotropy, reduce viscosity, and enable small-scale dynamo-driven magnetic\namplification. This study examines viscosity evolution in the ICM during\nturbulent magnetic field amplification. We performed 3D MHD simulations of\nforced turbulence with an initially weak, uniform magnetic field. Using the\nCGL-MHD framework, we incorporate anisotropic pressure dynamics and\ninstability-driven anisotropy limitation. We analyze effective viscosity and\ndynamo evolution, comparing results with Braginskii-MHD and uniform-viscosity\nMHD. Results show viscosity decreases over time, allowing magnetic field\namplification to saturation levels similar to non-viscous MHD. Viscosity\ndistribution becomes bimodal, reflecting (i) collisional values and (ii)\nturbulence-dominated values proportional to $10^{-4} L_{\\rm turb} U_{\\rm turb}$\nin unstable regions. At saturation, 60% of plasma retains collisional\nviscosity. Braginskii-MHD reproduces similar magnetic amplification and\nviscosity structures. However, uniform-viscosity MHD, where viscosity equals\nthe mean saturated CGL-MHD value, fails to capture the turbulence inertial\nrange. These findings highlight the need for anisotropic viscosity models in\nstudying ICM processes like magnetic topology, cosmic ray transport, and\nAGN-driven shocks.

A natural\nquestion arises: can we take advantage of the efficiency of small transformers\nto deal with long input sequences?\n  In this paper, we show that transformers with long input sequences (large\ntransformers) can be efficiently simulated by transformers that can only take\nshort input sequences (small transformers). Specifically, we prove that any\ntransformer with input length $N$ can be efficiently simulated by only\n$O((N/M)^2)$ transformers with input length $M \\ll N$, and that this cannot be\nimproved in the worst case. However, we then prove that in various natural\nscenarios including average-case inputs, sliding window masking and attention\nsinks, the optimal number $O(N/M)$ of small transformers suffice.",

In this work, {\\it we first\nshow that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it\nalready emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent\nability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects\nreflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained\nmodels. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from\n0.6\\% to 18.6\\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our\nanalysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned\nmodels maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from\nnon-reflective contexts.

By manipulating this vector, we enable\nbidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and\nfine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that\nenhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\\%, while\nsuppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to\nnavigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without\nrequiring additional training.

    "abstract": "Many important quantities of interest are only partially identified from\nobservable data: the data can limit them to a set of plausible values, but not\nuniquely determine them. This paper develops a unified framework for\ncovariate-assisted estimation, inference, and decision making in partial\nidentification problems where the parameter of interest satisfies a series of\nlinear constraints, conditional on covariates. In such settings, bounds on the\nparameter can be written as expectations of solutions to conditional linear\nprograms that optimize a linear function subject to linear constraints, where\nboth the objective function and the constraints may depend on covariates and\nneed to be estimated from data. Examples include estimands involving the joint\ndistributions of potential outcomes, policy learning with inequality-aware\nvalue functions, and instrumental variable settings. We propose two de-biased\nestimators for bounds defined by conditional linear programs. The first\ndirectly solves the conditional linear programs with plugin estimates and uses\noutput from standard LP solvers to de-bias the plugin estimate, avoiding the\nneed for computationally demanding vertex enumeration of all possible solutions\nfor symbolic bounds. The second uses entropic regularization to create smooth\napproximations to the conditional linear programs, trading a small amount of\napproximation error for improved estimation and computational efficiency. We\nestablish conditions for asymptotic normality of both estimators, show that\nboth estimators are robust to first-order errors in estimating the conditional\nconstraints and objectives, and construct Wald-type confidence intervals for\nthe partially identified parameters.

Notably, federated low-rank\nadaptation LoRA-based fine-tuning methods have recently gained attention, which\nallows clients to fine-tune FMs with a small portion of trainable parameters\nlocally. However, most existing methods do not account for the heterogeneous\nresources of clients or lack an effective local training strategy to maximize\nglobal fine-tuning performance under limited resources. In this work, we\npropose Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that\nenables clients to collaboratively fine-tune an FM with different local\ntrainable LoRA layers. To ensure its effectiveness, we develop several\nheterogeneous LoRA allocation (HLA) strategies that adaptively allocate local\ntrainable LoRA layers based on clients' resource capabilities and the layer\nimportance. Specifically, based on the dynamic layer importance, we design a\nFisher Information Matrix score-based HLA that leverages dynamic gradient norm\ninformation. To better stabilize the training process, we consider the\nintrinsic importance of LoRA layers and design a Geometrically-Defined HLA\nstrategy. It shapes the collective distribution of trainable LoRA layers into\nspecific geometric patterns, such as Triangle, Inverted Triangle, Bottleneck,\nand Uniform. Moreover, we extend GD-HLA into a randomized version, named\nRandomized Geometrically-Defined HLA, for enhanced model accuracy with\nrandomness. By co-designing the proposed HLA strategies, we incorporate both\nthe dynamic and intrinsic layer importance into the design of our HLA strategy.\nWe evaluate our approach on five datasets under diverse federated LoRA\nfine-tuning settings, covering three levels of data distribution from IID to\nextreme Non-IID.

Polarized microtubule arrays are key\nto facilitating cargo transport in long cells such as neurons. Microtubules\nalso undergo dynamic instability, where the plus and minus ends of the\nfilaments switch between growth and shrinking phases, leading to frequent\nmicrotubule turnover. Although microtubules often completely disassemble and\nnew filaments nucleate, microtubule arrays have been observed to both maintain\ntheir biased orientation throughout the cell lifetime and to rearrange their\npolarity as an adaptive response to injury. Motivated by cytoskeleton\norganization in neurites, we propose a spatially-explicit stochastic model of\nmicrotubule arrays and investigate how nucleation of new filaments could\ngenerate biased polarity in a simple linear domain. Using a continuous-time\nMarkov chain model of microtubule growth dynamics, we model and parameterize\ntwo experimentally-validated nucleation mechanisms: nucleation feedback, where\nthe direction of filament growth depends on existing microtubule content, and a\ncheckpoint mechanism, where microtubules that nucleate in a direction opposite\nto the majority experience frequent catastrophe. When incorporating these\nvalidated mechanisms into the spatial model, we find that nucleation feedback\nis sufficient to establish biased polarity in neurites of different lengths,\nand that the emergence and maintenance of biased polarity is relatively stable\nin spite of stochastic fluctuations.

However, they often\nstruggle to capture complex cellular and tissue structures in challenging\nscenarios such as background clutter and object overlap.

To address these\nissues, we propose an efficient framework for the segmentation task, named\nInceptionMamba, which encodes multi-stage rich features and offers both\nperformance and computational efficiency. Specifically, we exploit semantic\ncues to capture both low-frequency and high-frequency regions to enrich the\nmulti-stage features to handle the blurred region boundaries (e.g., cell\nboundaries). These enriched features are input to a hybrid model that combines\nan Inception depth-wise convolution with a Mamba block, to maintain high\nefficiency and capture inherent variations in the scales and shapes of the\nregions of interest. These enriched features along with low-resolution features\nare fused to get the final segmentation mask.

    "abstract": "We investigate the redshift evolution of disk and bulge-dominated galaxies\nusing a mass-complete sample of $\\sim$14,000 galaxies from the CANDELS survey,\nselected with $H_{\\rm mag} \\leq 24$, $M_{\\rm stellar} \\geq 10^9\\,{\\rm\nM}_\\odot$, and spanning $0.2 \\leq z \\leq 2.4$. Adopting an unbiased\nmorphological classification, free from visual inspection or parametric\nassumptions, we explore the evolution of specific star formation rate (sSFR),\nstellar mass, structural properties, and galaxy fractions as a function of\nredshift and morphology. We find that while disk and bulge-dominated galaxies\nexhibit similar sSFR distributions at $z \\sim 2.4$, bulge-dominated systems\ndevelop a redshift-dependent bimodality below $z < 1.6$, unlike the unimodal\nbehaviour of disks. This bimodality correlates with stellar mass:\nbulge-dominated galaxies with lower sSFR are significantly more massive and\nexhibit higher S\\'ersic indices than their star-forming counterparts, despite\nhaving similar effective radii. Based on a Gaussian mixture decomposition, we\nidentify two evolutionary tracks for bulge-dominated galaxies: G1, a\nlong-lived, star-forming population with disk-like properties; and G2, a\nquenched, massive population whose prominence increases with decreasing\nredshift. The evolution of the star formation main sequence and\nmorphology--mass fractions support a scenario in which G2 systems form through\nmerger-driven transformations of massive disks. Our results indicate that\nbulge-dominated galaxies are not a homogeneous population, but instead follow\ndivergent evolutionary paths driven by distinct physical mechanisms.",

Rather than directly calling tools,\nit can be more effective for LLMs to write code to perform the tool calls,\nenabling them to automatically generate complex control flow such as\nconditionals and loops. Such code actions are typically provided as Python\ncode, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the\nideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and\nreliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called\nQuasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve\nperformance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate\nhallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate\nactions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically\ntranspiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question\nanswering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with\nQuasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while\nreducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing\nuser approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by\napplying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level.",

We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset\ncomprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from\n2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts,\nall sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were\nrigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal\nintegrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical\nmetadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR),\nand HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and\ndeep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data,\nprogress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets.\nBreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models,\nincluding state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial\ntraining data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed\nthe first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision\nTransformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast\nphases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT\nmodel achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2-\npatients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93).

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday\napplications. As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and\nunderlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model\npersonality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with\ndiverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific\ndiscoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking\nkey events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires\nreasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small\nmodels like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as\nClaude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another\nLLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection\nand classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits:\nfor instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal\ndynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When\nanalyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual\nframing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors\nstep-by-step causal reasoning.

    "abstract": "Variational phase-field models of brittle fracture are powerful tools for\nstudying Griffith-type crack propagation in complex scenarios. However, as\napproximations of Griffith's theory-which does not incorporate a strength\ncriterion-these models lack flexibility in prescribing material-specific\nstrength surfaces. Consequently, they struggle to accurately capture crack\nnucleation under multiaxial stress conditions. In this paper, inspired by\nAlessi et al. (2014), we propose a variational phase-field model that\napproximates cohesive fracture. The model accommodates an arbitrary (convex)\nstrength surface, independent of the regularization length scale, and allows\nfor flexible tuning of the cohesive response. Our formulation results in sharp\ncohesive cracks and naturally enforces a sharp non-interpenetration condition,\nthereby eliminating the need for additional energy decomposition strategies. It\ninherently satisfies stress softening and produces \"crack-like\" residual\nstresses by construction. To ensure strain hardening, the ratio of the\nregularization length to the material's cohesive length must be sufficiently\nsmall; however, if crack nucleation is desired, this ratio must also be large\nenough to make the homogeneous damaged state unstable. We investigate the model\nin one and three dimensions, establishing first- and second-order stability\nresults. The theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations\nusing the finite element method, employing standard discretization and solution\ntechniques.",

Their simplicity and ability to compute exact likelihoods\ndistinguish them from other generative networks. We adjust the NF's training\nobjective to distinguish between relevant (in manifold) and noise dimensions\n(out of manifold). Additionally, we find that different behavioral states align\nwith the components of the latent Gaussian mixture model, enabling their\ntreatment as distinct curved manifolds. Subsequently, we approximate the\nnetwork for each mixture component with a quadratic mapping, allowing us to\ncharacterize both neural manifold curvature and non-Gaussian correlations among\nrecording channels.\n  Applying the method to recordings in macaque visual cortex, we demonstrate\nthat state-dependent manifolds are curved and exhibit complex statistical\ndependencies.

A\nseparate HST program provided complementary ACS optical imaging contemporaneous\nwith the second and third epochs of the NIRCam observations. Spectroscopic\nidentifications were carried out for three transients using the NIRSpec\ninstrument. One of them was confirmed to be a Type Ia supernova at z=1.63,\nwhile the other two had their host galaxies identified at $z=2.64$ and 1.90,\nrespectively. Combining these redshifts with the photometric redshifts of the\nhost galaxies in the rest of the sample, we find that the transients are either\nin a \"mid-z\" group at z>1.6 with M_V < -16.0 mag or a \"low-z\" group at z<0.4\nwith M_H > -14.0 mag. The mid-z transients are consistent with various types of\nsupernovae. In contrast, by their luminosities, the low-z transients fall in\nthe range of the so-called ``gap transients'' between those of supernovae and\nclassical novae. While they might contain some known types of gap transients\n(e.g., supernova impostors and luminous red novae), there could also be new\nkinds of transients.

    "abstract": "With the development of science, many nonlinear problems have emerged. At\nthis time, the classical function space has certain restrictions. For example,\nit has lost its effectiveness for nonlinear problems under nonstandard growth\nconditions. In the process of studying such nonlinear problems, scholars are\npaying more and more attention to the transition from classical function space\nto variable exponent function space. Also, there is a big difference between\nvariable exponent space and classical function space, mainly because variable\nexponent function space has lost translation invariance. This difference leads\nto many properties that hold in classical space no longer hold in variable\nexponent space. It is important to emphasize that variable exponent function\nspaces are a fundamental building block in harmonic analysis. In recent years,\nthere has been a growing interest in the study of function spaces equipped with\nvariable exponents, leading to the development of a new framework known as\nvariable exponent analysis. These spaces provide a powerful tool for analyzing\nfunctions with variable growth or decay rates and have found applications in\nvarious areas of mathematics, including partial differential equations,\nharmonic analysis and image processing.

An optimal experimental design (OED) refers to the choice\nof a particular experiment that optimizes a particular design criteria, e.g.,\nmaximizing a utility function, which measures the information content of the\ndata. However, traditional approaches for optimal experimental design typically\nrequire solving a large number of computationally intensive inverse problems to\nfind the data that maximizes the utility function. Here, we introduce two novel\nOED criteria that are specifically crafted for the data consistent inversion\n(DCI) framework, but do not require solving inverse problems. DCI is a specific\napproach for solving a class of stochastic inverse problems by constructing a\npullback measure on uncertain parameters from an observed probability measure\non the outputs of a quantity of interest (QoI) map. While expected information\ngain (EIG) has been used for both DCI and Bayesian based OED, the\ncharacteristics and properties of DCI solutions differ from those of solutions\nto Bayesian inverse problems which should be reflected in the OED criteria. The\nnew design criteria developed in this study, called the expected scaling effect\nand the expected skewness effect, leverage the geometric structure of\npre-images associated with observable data sets, allowing for an intuitive and\ncomputationally efficient approach to OED. These criteria utilize singular\nvalue computations derived from sampled and approximated Jacobians of the\nexperimental designs. We present both simultaneous and sequential (greedy)\nformulations of OED based on these innovative criteria.

In unsupervised healthcare data analysis, interpreting clustered data\ncan offer meaningful insights into patients' health outcomes, which hold direct\nimplications for healthcare providers. This paper addresses the problem of\ninterpreting clustered sensor data collected from older adult patients\nrecovering from lower-limb fractures in the community. A total of 560 days of\nmultimodal sensor data, including acceleration, step count, ambient motion, GPS\nlocation, heart rate, and sleep, alongside clinical scores, were remotely\ncollected from patients at home. Clustering was first carried out separately\nfor each data modality to assess the impact of feature sets extracted from each\nmodality on patients' recovery trajectories. Then, using context-aware\nprompting, a large language model was employed to infer meaningful cluster\nlabels for the clusters derived from each modality. The quality of these\nclusters and their corresponding labels was validated through rigorous\nstatistical testing and visualization against clinical scores collected\nalongside the multimodal sensor data. The results demonstrated the statistical\nsignificance of most modality-specific cluster labels generated by the large\nlanguage model with respect to clinical scores, confirming the efficacy of the\nproposed method for interpreting sensor data in an unsupervised manner.

    "abstract": "Nonadiabatic Thouless pumping of electrons is studied in the framework of\ntopological Floquet engineering, particularly focused on how changes to\nchemical moieties can control the emergence of the Floquet topological phase.\nWe employ real-time time-dependent density functional theory to investigate the\nextent to which the topological invariant, the winding number, is impacted by\nmolecular-level changes to trans-polyacetylene. In particular, several\nsubstitutions to trans-polyacetylene are studied to examine different effects\non the electronic structure including mesomeric effect, inductive effect, and\nelectron conjugation effect. Maximally-localized Wannier functions are employed\nto relate the winding number to the valence bond description by expressing the\ntopological pumping as the transport dynamics of the localized Wannier\nfunctions. By further exploiting the gauge invariance of the quantum dynamics\nin terms of the minimal particle-hole excitations, the topological pumping of\nelectrons can be also represented as a cyclic transition among the bonding and\nantibonding orbitals. Having connected the topological invariant to chemically\nintuitive concepts, we show the molecular-level control on the emergence of the\nFloquet topological phase, presenting us with a great opportunity for the\nintuitive engineering of molecular systems for such an exotic topological\nphase.",

Leveraging these observations, we perform\nretrievals (i.e., analyses) of Titan's transmission spectrum to investigate the\nstrengths/limitations of exoplanet atmospheric retrievals with a particular\nfocus on the underlying assumptions regarding the molecular species included in\nthe retrieval. We find that multiple hydrocarbons can be ``retrieved''\ndepending on the selection made ahead of a retrieval. More importantly, we find\nthat the estimates of other parameters such as the abundance of key absorbers\nlike methane can be biased by $\\sim$0.5 dex (by a factor of $\\sim$3) due to\nsuch choices. This shows that beyond the possible misidentification of a\nmolecular feature (e.g., current debate surrounding dimethyl sulfide, DMS, in\nK2-18 b), the implicit molecular detections made pre-retrieval to avoid\nretrieving for hundreds of molecules at a time can bias a large range of\nparameters. We thus recommend sensitivity analysis to assess the dependencies\nof atmospheric inferences on such selections in tandem with complementary\ninformation (e.g., chemistry models) to support any pre-retrieval selection.\nFinally, we introduce an independent path to constrain the dominant atmospheric\nconstituent, even when lacking observable absorption feature (e.g., H$_2$ and\nN$_2$) through the scale height.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of spatially variable local dynamics, or dynamic heterogeneity,\nis common in multicomponent polymer systems. Such heterogeneity is understood\nto arise from differences between the intrinsic dynamical fluctuations\nassociated with one component versus another. However, the nature of the\ndynamic coupling between these components and how it depends on composition,\ntemperature, and environmental fluctuations is not fully understood. Here, we\nuse molecular dynamics simulations to characterize nanoscale dynamic\nheterogeneity in miscible blends of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polymethyl\nmethacrylate (PMMA) as a function of both temperature and blend composition.\nProbed over timescales of 100~ps, local PMMA segmental dynamics in blends align\nwith neat PMMA when normalized by $T_\\text{g}$, whereas PEO exhibits enhanced\nmobility caused by free-volume effects. The effects of dynamical coupling are\nfound to be asymmetric between the extent of enhancement to PMMA and\nsuppression of PEO dynamics based on analysis of local environment composition\nwithin blends. Asymmetric effects in the melt state are also identified over\nlonger timescales according to a Rouse mode analysis over larger sub-chains for\neach species. These results provide fundamental insights into how dynamic\nheterogeneity manifests at the nanoscale, across conditions and compositions in\nmiscible polymer blends. They establish a foundation for exploring whether such\nasymmetries are generalizable and how dynamic heterogeneity can be tuned\nthrough temperature, composition, and morphology.",

Following recent works in the area, we use\na linearized analysis to derive formal predictions for front position and\nleading-edge spatial decay. We then use a comparison principle approach to\nestablish a rigorous spreading result in the case of an unbounded temporal\nparameter. We then consider patterned-invasion in the complex Ginzburg-Landau\nequation with dynamic bifurcation parameter, a prototype for slow passage\nthrough a spatio-temporal Hopf instability. Linearized analysis once again\ngives front position and decay asymptotics, but also the selected spatial\nwavenumber at the leading edge. We then use a Burger's modulation analysis to\npredict the slowly-varying wavenumber in the wake of the front. Finally, in\nboth equations, we used the recently developed concept of a space-time memory\ncurve to characterize delayed invasion in the case where the parameter is\ninitially stable before a subsequent slow passage through instability and\ninvasion. We also provide preliminary results studying invasion in other\nprototypical pattern formation models modified with a dynamic parameter, as\nwell as numerical results for delayed transition between pushed and pulled\nfronts in Nagumo's equation with dynamic parameter.",

Using\nNIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the $F200W-F356W$ color\nvs $F356W$ magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS\nspectrum reveals the emission from HeI$\\lambda 10830$ and PaG line, both\nshowing a narrow and a broad ($FWHM\\gtrsim 2000\\ \\rm kms^{-1}$) component. The\nHeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI\ncolumn density in the $2^3S$ level $N\\sim 0.5-1.2\\times 10^{14}\\rm cm^{-2}$,\ndepending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of\n$\\Delta v \\sim -830\\ \\rm kms^{-1}$. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD\ndoes not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric\nluminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to $M_{\\rm\nBH}\\sim 10^8\\rm M_{\\odot}$ and $L_{\\rm bol}\\sim 2.9\\times 10^{45}\\rm\nergs^{-1}$, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with\nother two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 (\"Rosetta\nStone\") at $z=2.26$ and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at $z=3.1$. The blueshifted HeI\nabsorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be\ncommon in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at\n$z<3$ based on JWST data, as a function of $L_{\\rm bol}$ and BH mass. The space\ndensity is only a factor of $\\sim 2-3$ lower than that of UV-selected quasars\nwith comparable $L_{\\rm bol}$ and $z$, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to\nthe broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is\nalso observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs\nprobe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may\nsuggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to\ncosmic noon.",

This construction\ngeneralizes earlier single-coupling setups and allows both curvature--induced\nand matter--induced scalarization within one framework, which allows us to\novercome the limitations of each mechanism alone. We focus on charged,\nspherically symmetric black holes and demonstrate that our model substantially\nexpands the range of black hole masses and charges that permit scalar hair.\nNegative Gauss--Bonnet couplings, previously associated only with\nnear--extremal charges or rapidly spinning black holes, now trigger\nscalarization for much broader charge intervals. We develop a numerical\nprocedure to solve the field equations, and investigate the various properties\nof these black holes. This results in new branches emerging at distinct mass\nthresholds, a behavior not seen in the pure Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet or\nEinstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet--Ricci models. The scalar charge depends\nsensitively on the coupling parameters and on the $U(1)$ charge. Our analysis\nalso shows that these black holes have larger entropy than their\nReissner--Nordstr\\\"om counterparts and can become overcharged, surpassing the\nusual extremal limit of charge-to-mass ratio. Analyzing the scalar charge\nbehavior suggests that adding matter-coupling appears to stabilize solutions\nthat were previously prone to higher-order instabilities in pure Gauss--Bonnet\nmodels with quadratic coupling and broadens the range of possible\nconfigurations, making this model a promising candidate for further studies in\nstrong gravity.",

It was discovered within a day of explosion, and rose to peak brightness in\n10 d. Two distinct phases of circumstellar interaction are evident in the data.\nThe first is marked by a steep blue continuum (T $>15,000$ K) with\nflash-ionisation features due to hydrogen and He II. The second, weaker phase\nis marked by a change in the colour evolution accompanied by changes in the\nshapes and velocities of the spectral line profiles. Narrow P-Cygni profiles (~\n$150$ km s$^{-1}$) of He I further indicate the presence of slow-moving\nunshocked material and suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. The fast\ndecline of the light curve from peak (3.48$\\pm$ 0.26 mag $\\rm (50\\,d)^{-1}$ in\n$g$-band) implies that the ejecta mass must be low. Spectroscopically, until\n$+35$ d there are similarities to some Type IIb SNe but then there is a\ntransition to spectra that are more reminiscent of an interacting SN II.\nHowever, metal lines are largely absent in the spectra, even at epochs of 80 d.\nIts remote location from the presumed host galaxy, a dwarf with $\\rm M_B$ ~\n$-14.4$ mag, is consistent with our metallicity estimate - close to the SMC\nvalue - obtained from scaling relations. Furthermore, several lines of evidence\n(including intrinsic polarisation of $p$ ~ (0.5-1.0) %) point to deviations\nfrom spherical symmetry. We suggest that a plausible way of uniting the\nobservational clues is to consider a binary system that underwent case C mass\ntransfer. This failed to remove the entire H-envelope of the progenitor before\nit underwent core-collapse. In this scenario, the progenitor itself would be\nmore compact and perhaps straddle the boundary between blue and yellow\nsupergiants, tying in with the early spectroscopic similarity to Type IIb SNe.",

We used MESA to build a series of aEMS models up to 2e4\nM_sun for three [Fe/H] values, covering the metallicity range of Galactic GCs,\nwith different treatments of super-adiabatic convection. We set analytical\nprescriptions to quantify collision-induced mass loss when a star spirals in\nand deposits energy into the envelope of the aEMS. We used a Monte Carlo\napproach to simulate the effects of multiple collisions on an aEMS of initial\nmass 10^3 M_sun in a static proto-GC, accounting for mass loss and gain from\ncollisions, gas accretion, and stellar winds. We show that assumptions on\nsuper-adiabaticity in radiation-dominated layers significantly impact aEMS\nproperties and their collision responses: extended stars tend to lose mass,\nwhile compact ones are more likely to gain it. Our MC simulations predict total\nmass lost and gained, along with timescales and contributions from winds and\ncollisions. The results depend on both the aEMS structure and the gas accretion\nrate during the collision phase. Under certain conditions, the EMS shows a\n\"conveyor belt\" behavior, processing up to 10^5.5 M_sun of material in 5 Myr.\nThis study provides theoretical predictions supporting aEMSs as contributors to\nthe abundance anomalies observed in GCs. It emphasizes the need to include\ncollision dynamics and mass transfer in aEMS formation and evolution models in\ndense stellar environments.

Many of these\nobservations imply galaxies with black holes that are overmassive compared to\ntheir low-z counterparts. However, the bright quasar point source removal may\ncause significant biases in these stellar mass measurements. We develop a\nsimulation-based inference method to disentangle the quasar host galaxy stellar\nmass measurements from observational biases during the point source removal. We\nuse the BlueTides simulation to generate mock images and perform point source\nremoval on thousands of simulated high-z quasar host galaxies, constructing\ncorrected host magnitude posteriors.

We find that stellar\nmass estimates are generally robust, or overestimated by $\\leq0.3$ dex. We also\nfind that the stellar masses of a subset of hosts (J1120+0641, J0844-0132,\nJ0911+0152, and J1146-0005) remain unconstrained, as key photometric bands\nprovide only flux upper limits.

Their\nstellar masses are consistent with the average stellar mass of quasar hosts as\nexpected from abundance matching and clustering analysis.

These\nresults lie in the expected range for interstellar dust compositions dominated\nby carbon, magnesium silicates, and iron. The absorption results suggest a\nsubstantial mass fraction of iron at $35\\pm7\\%$. The MRN distribution fit\nreturns a maximum grain radius, $a_{\\rm max}=0.24\\pm 0.01\\,\\mu$m; all fits\nstrongly rule out models with $\\sim0.4\\,\\mu$m grains for this sightline. The\nsoft x-ray spectrum of the prompt GRB can also be inferred from the fitting,\nwith the best-fit providing a spectral slope that is consistent with the slope\nof the low energy side of the best-fit Band model of the directly measured\nprompt emission. Forcing a different grain size or composition than the best\nfit results in an inferred prompt spectrum different to the observed prompt\nemission. The refractive index is consistent with standard average dust\ncompositions, showing that x-ray scattering is an effective tool to measure\ninterstellar dust optical properties. [abridged]",

These fields, while not driving\ncosmic expansion, generate blue-tilted isocurvature fluctuations that naturally\nsatisfy current CMB constraints at large scales while producing enhanced power\nspectra at smaller scales accessible to GW detectors. The resulting GW spectrum\nspans an exceptionally broad frequency range from $10^{-20}$ to $1$ Hz, with\namplitudes ranging from $\\Omega_{\\text{GW}}h^2 \\sim 10^{-20}$ to $10^{-12}$\ndepending on the reheating temperature and spectator field mass. For heavy\nspectator fields with effective masses near the inflationary Hubble scale\n$H_I$, the mechanism produces observable signals across multiple detector bands\naccessible to pulsar timing arrays, space-based interferometers, and\nground-based detectors. Our analysis reveals multiple complementary constraints\non spectator field parameters.

The\nsubregion algebras consist of operators dressed to this \"observer\" and are\ntypically Type II von Neumann algebras. Nevertheless, as opposed to standard\nphysical systems, such an \"observer\" was postulated to have a Hamiltonian\n$\\hat{H}_{\\text{obs}}$ linear in phase space variable. This linear form\nsuggests that the complete dynamics of such an \"observer\" should also be\ncontrolled by an external system or some underlying degrees of freedom within\nthe system. In this paper, we show that this is exactly the case in the island\nmodel. In the island model, we have a gravitational asymptotically anti-de\nSitter (AdS) spacetime coupled with a non-gravitational bath, and the\ndiffeomorphism symmetries in the gravitational AdS are spontaneously broken due\nto the bath coupling. In this setup, the \"observer\" is constructed using the\nGoldstone vector field associated with the spontaneously broken diffeomorphism\nsymmetry, and the external system that also controls the dynamics of the\n\"observer\" is the non-gravitational bath. The basic consistency of the\nentanglement wedge reconstruction requires operators in the entanglement island\nto be dressed to this \"observer\". Thus, we establish the result that\nentanglement islands correspond to emergent Type II$_{\\infty}$ von Neumann\nalgebras from the holographic dual perspective. This result relies on assuming\nthe geometric modular flow conjecture. Our study also raises a question for\nearlier constructions of Type II$_{1}$ von Neumann algebras.",

While their existence as fundamental particles is still\nuncertain, growing evidence shows they emerge as quasiparticles in special\nmaterials called Weyl semimetals (WSMs). These materials possess unique\nelectronic properties and hold promise for future technologies. This thesis\ninvestigates how electrons behave in WSMs, focusing on the chiral anomaly (CA).\nThe CA remains central in condensed matter physics, typically observed via\nlongitudinal magnetoconductance (LMC) and the planar Hall effect (PHE).\nAlthough finite intervalley scattering can reverse the LMC sign, we identify\nanother mechanism: a smooth cutoff in the linear dispersion, inherent to real\nWeyl materials, introduces nonlinearity that causes negative LMC even without\nintervalley scattering. Using a lattice model of tilted Weyl fermions and the\nBoltzmann approximation, we explore LMC and PHE, mapping phase diagrams in key\nparameter spaces. We also study the effects of strain, which acts as an axial\nmagnetic field and influences diffusive transport. Our results show that\nstrain-induced gauge fields can cause a strong LMC sign-reversal, unlike\nexternal fields which need intervalley scattering. The interplay of strain and\nexternal fields produces rich LMC behavior. We further predict distinct PHE\nresponses due to strain. Finally, we extend the study to nonlinear transport,\ndeveloping a theory for the chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect\n(CNLHE). In Weyl semimetals, the nonlinear Hall conductivity shows nonmonotonic\nbehavior and strong sign-reversal with scattering. In contrast, spin-orbit\ncoupled metals show consistently negative, quadratic responses. We also explore\npseudospin-1 fermions, finding enhanced sensitivity to internode scattering,\nrevealing new transport signatures and broadening the scope of chiral anomaly\nstudies.",

In\nthis paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs\non code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,\nand similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked\nto arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends\nin the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of\nLLM-generated code.

We\npropose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,\nrule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic\nfeedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core\ndimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making.

    "abstract": "The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated\nin 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image\nComputing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised\ncross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and\ntransferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen\nto serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical\napplication perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and\ncochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over\ntime, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance.\nThe challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic\nsegmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading\nin 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and\nsub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we\nreport the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective\nanalysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the\nsuccessive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers\ndecreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of\nscanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach\nof the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing\ndata, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation\nperformance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined\nin 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations\naffecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for\nclinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that\na more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.",

In this paper, we\npropose a novel merging DBA algorithm, called the Dynamic Time and Wavelength\nAllocation (DTWA) algorithm, for a virtualized DBA (vDBA) architecture in\nmulti-tenant PON environments. The Algorithm, which enables the merging of\nmultiple virtual DBAs into a physical bandwidth map, introduces multi-channel\nsupport, allowing each Optical Network Unit (ONU) to dynamically change, taking\ninto consideration different switching times, transmission wavelength.\nLeveraging the Numba APIs for high-performance optimization, the algorithm\nachieves real-time performance with minimal additional latency, meeting the\nstringent requirements of SLA-compliant, latency-critical 6G applications and\nservices. Our analysis highlights an important trade-off in terms of throughput\nin multi-tenant conditions, between single-channel vs. multi-channel PONs, as a\nfunction of ONUs tuning time. We also compare the performance of our algorithm\nfor different traffic distributions. Finally, in order to assess the time\ncomputing penalty of dynamic wavelength optimisation in the merging DBA\nalgorithm, we compare it against a baseline Static Wavelength Allocation (SWA)\nalgorithm, where ONUs are designated a fixed wavelength for transmission.",

We explore this by\ncalculating the Renormalization Group flow of CPT violating interactions under\nthe impact of quantum fluctuations of the metric. We find that CPT symmetry\ncannot be emergent and conclude that quantum-gravity approaches must avoid the\nbreaking of CPT symmetry.

In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are\nwell suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs).

This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex\nvisual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image\ndetails. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel\nreasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained\nvisual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the\nquestion or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects\nrelevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise\nanswers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a\nlarge-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed\nvision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows\nthe model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is\nintroduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,\nenhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline\nshow that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring\ncomprehensive image detail understanding.

Our results\nshow that a medium-range mid-latitude forecast improves substantially when the\nstratosphere and boundary layer are relaxed, while relaxation of the tropical\natmosphere has a negligible effect. This underscores the need for a more\naccurate representation of the stratosphere and the planetary boundary layer to\nimprove medium-range weather predictability. Additionally, we investigate the\nrelationship between the forecast error sensitivity to initial conditions and\nrelaxation experiments. By utilising auto-differentiability, we identify\noverlapping regions of large error sensitivity and strong forecast skill\nimprovement from relaxation. Average mid-latitude error sensitivity to initial\nconditions shows negligible influence from the tropics, corroborating the\nresults of the tropical relaxation experiments. The error sensitivity shows a\nphysically consistent influence of upstream weather dynamics and sea surface\ntemperatures on forecast accuracy.

    "abstract": "Chains of Rydberg atoms have emerged as an amazing platform for simulating\nquantum physics in low dimensions. This remarkable success is due to the\nversatility of lattice geometries achieved by trapping neutral atoms with\noptical tweezers. On a given lattice, the competition between the repulsive van\nder Waals potential and the detuning of the laser frequency brings the atoms to\nhighly excited Rydberg states, leading to a variety of exotic phases and\nquantum phase transitions. Experiments on the simplest one-dimensional array of\nRydberg atoms have stimulated tremendous progress in understanding quantum\nphase transitions into crystalline phases. In addition to standard conformal\ntransitions, numerical simulations have predicted two exotic chiral transitions\nand a floating phase, raising the question of their experimental realization.\nHowever, in reality, optical tweezers have a finite width, which results in\nsmall deviations in interatomic distances and disorder in interaction strength.\nHowever, disorder can affect the nature of transitions. Infinite randomness\ncriticality in the random transverse-field Ising chain is perhaps the most\nprominent examples. In this paper, we demonstrate how the disorder typical for\nRydberg experiments alters the Ising transition to the period-2 phase.\nFollowing the experimental protocol closely, we probe the nature of quantum\ncriticality with Kibble-Zurek dynamics. While we clearly observe infinite\nrandomness for strong disorder and large system sizes, we also report a\ncrossover into a clean Ising transition, which is visible for small system\nsizes and weak disorder.

Following the LiMBeR\nframework, we deliberately maintain a frozen large language model (LLM) and a\nfrozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training a linear adapter\nduring visual instruction tuning. By keeping the language model frozen, we\nensure it maintains its original language representations without adaptation to\nvisual data. Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly\ninto the LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the\nlanguage model to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning.\nOur experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse\nautoencoders (SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain\nperfectly aligned with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of\nthe learned language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of\nSAE reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we\nreveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations\ngradually align with language feature representations, converging in\nmiddle-to-later layers.

In this\npaper, we propose CnC-PRAC, a PRAC implementation that addresses both\nperformance and energy overheads. Unlike prior works focusing on caching\nactivation counts to reduce their overheads, our key idea is to reorder and\ncoalesce accesses to activation counts located in the same physical row. Our\ndesign achieves this by decoupling counter access from the critical path of\ndata accesses. This enables optimizations such as buffering counter\nread-modify-write requests and coalescing requests to the same row. Together,\nthese enable a reduction in row activations for counter accesses by almost\n75%-83% compared to state-of-the-art solutions like Chronus and enable a PRAC\nimplementation with negligible slowdown and a minimal dynamic energy overhead\nof 0.84%-1% compared to insecure DDR5 DRAM.",

Moreover, we note that, if one fixes a geometry in real space that\nlies in the conical intersection seam and scans over the corresponding momentum\nspace, one finds a double well (with minima at $\\pm \\bP_{min} \\ne 0$),\nindicating that the stationary electronic states of the phase space electronic\nHamiltonian carry electronic momentum -- a feature that cannot be captured by a\nBorn-Oppenheimer electronic state. Interestingly, for $BeH_2$, this electronic\nmomenta (as calculated with full configuration interaction) agrees with what is\npredicted by approximate complex restricted Hartree-Fock calculations,\nindicating a physical interpretation of complex instabilities in modern\nelectronic structure calculations. Altogether, this study suggests that we have\nstill have a lot to learn about conical intersections when it comes to\nelectronic momentum, and highlights the urgent need for more experiments to\nprobe what photochemical observables can and/or cannot be captured by standard\nelectronic structure that isolates conical intersections within the\nBorn-Oppenheimer framework.",

The methods used can be broadly categorized into\nscaling approaches and floating-point arithmetic manipulations. Scaling\napproaches entail re-scaling values to ensure computations stay within a\nrepresentable range. Floating-point arithmetic manipulations involve changes to\norder of operations and alternative summation algorithms to minimize errors in\ncalculations. The Implicit Monte Carlo method has nonlinear dependencies,\nquantities spanning many orders of magnitude, and a sensitive coupling between\nradiation and material energy that provide significant difficulties to accurate\nreduced-precision implementations.

When the oscillation induces a difference in fore-aft\nwave amplitude squared, these self-generated waves can be used as a mechanism\nto propel the body horizontally across the surface (Longuet-Higgins and Stewart\n1964). The optimisation of this wave-driven propulsion (WDP) is the interest of\nthis work. To study the conditions necessary to produce optimal thrust we will\nutilise a shallow water set-up where a periodically oscillating pressure source\nacts as the body. In this framework, an expression for the thrust is derived by\nrelation to the aforementioned difference in fore-aft amplitude squared. The\nconditions on the source for maximal thrust are explored both analytically and\nnumerically in two optimal control problems. The first case is where a bound is\nimposed on the norm of the control function to regularise it. Secondly, a more\nphysically motivated case is studied where the power injected by the source is\nbounded. The body is permitted to have a drift velocity $U$. When scaled with\nthe wave speed $c$, the dimensionless velocity $v=U/c$ divides the study into\nsubcritical, critical and supercritical regimes and the optimal conditions are\npresented for each. The result in the bounded power case is then used to\ndemonstrate how the modulation of power injected can slowly change the cruising\nvelocity from rest to supercritical velocities.",

Some prior work has considered the effectiveness of LLMs\nin answering expert-written health queries/prompts, questions from medical\nexamination banks, or queries based on pre-existing clinical cases.\nUnfortunately, these existing studies completely ignore an in-the-wild\nevaluation of the effectiveness of LLMs in answering everyday health concerns\nand queries typically asked by general users, which corresponds to the more\nprevalent use case for LLMs. To address this research gap, this paper presents\nthe findings from a university-level competition that leveraged a novel,\ncrowdsourced approach for evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in answering\neveryday health queries. Over the course of a week, a total of 34 participants\nprompted four publicly accessible LLMs with 212 real (or imagined) health\nconcerns, and the LLM generated responses were evaluated by a team of nine\nboard-certified physicians. At a high level, our findings indicate that on\naverage, 76% of the 212 LLM responses were deemed to be accurate by physicians.\nFurther, with the help of medical professionals, we investigated whether RAG\nversions of these LLMs (powered with a comprehensive medical knowledge base)\ncan improve the quality of responses generated by LLMs. Finally, we also derive\nqualitative insights to explain our quantitative findings by conducting\ninterviews with seven medical professionals who were shown all the prompts in\nour competition.

It outlines the assumptions required\nfor identification under dynamic confounding and demonstrates how extending\nsequential estimands to dynamic policies enables the construction of more\nrealistic counterfactuals. Furthermore, the paper explores recently developed\nmethods for estimating effects across multiple treatments and time periods,\nutilizing Double Machine Learning (DML), a flexible estimator that avoids\nparametric assumptions while preserving desirable statistical properties. Using\nSwiss administrative data, the methods are demonstrated through an empirical\napplication assessing the participation of unemployed individuals in active\nlabor market policies, where assignment decisions by caseworkers can be\nreconsidered between two periods. The analysis identifies a temporary wage\nsubsidy as the most effective intervention, on average, even after adjusting\nfor its extended duration compared to other programs. Overall, DML-based\nanalysis of dynamic policies proves to be a useful approach within the program\nevaluation toolkit.",

Conventional PINNs, trained with partial\ndifferential equation residuals, frequently face convergence issues and lower\naccuracy near discontinuities. To address these issues, we build on the\nrecently proposed locally linearized PINNs (LLPINNs), which improve shock\ndetection by modifying the Jacobian matrix resulting from the linearization of\nthe equations, only in regions where the velocity field exhibits strong\ncompression. However, the original LLPINN framework required a priori knowledge\nof shock velocities, limiting its practical utility. We present a generalized\nLLPINN method that dynamically computes shock speeds using neighboring states\nand applies jump conditions through entropy constraints. Additionally, we\nintroduce locally Roe PINNs (LRPINNs), which incorporate an approximate Roe\nRiemann solver to improve shock resolution and conservation properties across\ndiscontinuities. These methods are adapted to two-dimensional Riemann problems\nby using a divergence-based shock detection combined with dimensional\nsplitting, delivering precise solutions. Compared to a high-order weighted\nessentially non-oscillatory solver, our method produces sharper shock\ntransitions but smoother solutions in areas with small-scale vortex structures.\nFuture research will aim to improve the resolution of these small-scale\nfeatures without compromising the model's ability to accurately capture shocks.",

The objective of this study is to develop a fully\nautomated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable\ntreatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a\nhierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep\nQ-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning\nparameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and\norgan-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both\ndose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward\nfunction incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints,\nincluding D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder,\nrectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a\ncustomized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time\ndistribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function.\nThe framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator\ngeometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful\nTPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients,\nthe RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%,\noutperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are\nnotable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full\ntarget coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.",

This limits the task throughput of a robotic\nsystem, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation.\nIn this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling\nfaster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify\nfundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts.\nWe instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation\nLearning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components:\n(1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at\nhigh speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets,\n(3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on\nmotion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system\nlatencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct\nrobot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration\nspeed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world.

However, due to shared third-party services\nand technical loopholes, non-consensual cross-site tracking can still occur. In\nfact, contrary to user expectations of seemingly isolated consent, a user's\ndecision on one website may affect tracking behavior on others. In this study,\nwe investigate the technical and behavioral mechanisms behind these\ndiscrepancies. Specifically, we disclose a persistent tracking mechanism\nexploiting web cookies. These cookies, which we refer to as intractable, are\ninitially set on websites with accepted banners, persist in the browser, and\nare subsequently sent to trackers before the user provides explicit consent on\nother websites. To meticulously analyze this covert tracking behavior, we\nconduct an extensive measurement study performing stateful crawls on over 20k\ndomains from the Tranco top list, strategically accepting banners in the first\nhalf of domains and measuring intractable cookies in the second half. Our\nfindings reveal that around 50% of websites send at least one intractable\ncookie, with the majority set to expire after more than 10 days. In addition,\nenabling the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal initially reduces the number\nof intractable cookies by 30% on average, with a further 32% reduction possible\non subsequent visits by rejecting the banners. Moreover, websites with Consent\nManagement Platform (CMP) banners, on average, send 6.9 times more intractable\ncookies compared to those with native banners.

    "abstract": "Powder metallurgy hot isostatic pressing (PM-HIP) is an advanced\nmanufacturing process that produces near net shape parts with high material\nutilization and uniform microstructures. Despite being used frequently to\nproduce small-scale components, the application of PM-HIP to large-scale\ncomponents is limited due to inadequate understanding of its complex mechanisms\nthat cause unpredictable post-HIP shape distortions. A computational model can\nprovide necessary information about the intermediate and final stages of the\nHIP process that can help understand it better and make accurate predictions.\nGenerally, two types of computational models are employed for PM-HIP\nsimulations, namely, plastic and visco-plastic models. Between these, the\nplastic model is preferred due to its cheaper calibration approach requiring\nless experimental data. However, the plastic model sometimes produces incorrect\npredictions when slight variations of the HIP conditions are encountered in\npractical situations. Therefore, this work presents a visco-plastic model that\naddresses these limitations of the plastic model. A novel modified calibration\napproach is employed for the visco-plastic model that utilizes less\nexperimental data than existing approaches. With the new approach, the data\nrequirement is same for both plastic and visco-plastic models. This also\nenables a quantitative comparison of plastic and visco-plastic models, which\nhave been only qualitatively compared in the past. When calibrated with the\nsame experimental data, both the models are found to produce similar results.\nThe calibrated visco-plastic model is applied to several complex geometries,\nand the predictions are found to be in good agreement with experimental\nobservations.",

In this study, we\ngenerate mock data for a Stage-IV weak lensing survey such as the Legacy Survey\nof Space and Time (LSST), X-ray gas fractions, and stacked kinetic\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements, to jointly constrain cosmological and\nastrophysical parameters describing baryonic effects (using the Baryon\nCorrection Model - BCM). First, using WL data alone, we quantify the level to\nwhich the BCM parameters will need to be constrained to recover the\ncosmological constraints obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of\nbaryonic feedback. We identify the most relevant baryonic parameters and\ndetermine that they must be calibrated to a precision of $\\sim 10$-$20\\%$ to\navoid significant degradation of the fiducial WL constraints.

This persistent knowledge gap limits our ability to interpret viral\nsequence data, understand virus-host interactions, and assess the ecological or\napplied significance of viral genes. Among the most intriguing components of\nviral dark matter are auxiliary viral genes (AVGs), including auxiliary\nmetabolic genes (AMGs), regulatory genes (AReGs), and host physiology-modifying\ngenes (APGs), which may alter host function during infection and contribute to\nmicrobial metabolism, stress tolerance, or resistance. In this review, we\nexplore recent advances in the discovery and functional characterization of\nviral dark matter. We highlight representative examples of novel viral proteins\nacross diverse ecosystems including human microbiomes, soil, oceans, and\nextreme environments, and discuss what is known, and still unknown, about their\nroles. We then examine the bioinformatic and experimental challenges that\nhinder functional characterization, and present emerging strategies to overcome\nthese barriers. Finally, we highlight both the fundamental and applied benefits\nthat multidisciplinary efforts to characterize viral proteins can bring. By\nintegrating computational predictions with experimental validation, and\nfostering collaboration across disciplines, we emphasize that illuminating\nviral dark matter is both feasible and essential for advancing microbial\necology and unlocking new tools for biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Atomic hydrogen constitutes the gas reservoir from which molecular gas and\nstar formation in galaxies emerges. However, the weakness of the line means it\nhas been difficult to directly detect in all but the very local Universe. Here\nwe present results from the first search using the MeerKAT International Tiered\nExtragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey for high-redshift ($z>0.25$) H{\\sc\ni} emission from individual galaxies. By searching for 21-cm emission centered\non the position and redshift of optically-selected emission-line galaxies we\novercome difficulties that hinder untargeted searches. We detect 11 galaxies at\n$z>0.25$, forming the first sample of $z>0.25$ detections with an\ninterferometer, with the highest redshift detection at $z = 0.3841$. We find\nthey have much larger H{\\sc i} masses than their low-redshift H{\\sc i}-selected\ncounterparts for a given stellar mass. This can be explained by the much larger\ncosmological volume probed at these high redshifts, and does not require any\nevolution of the H{\\sc i} mass function. We make the first-ever measurement of\nthe baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (bTFr) with H{\\sc i} at $z>0.25$ and find\nconsistency with the local bTFr, but with tentative evidence of a flattening in\nthe relation at these redshifts for higher-mass objects. This may signify\nevolution, in line with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations, or that the\nmolecular gas mass in these high-mass galaxies could be significant. This study\npaves the way for future studies of H{\\sc i} beyond the local Universe, using\nboth searches targeted at known objects and via pure H{\\sc i} selection.",

However, it remains unclear how\neffectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In\nan ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would\nexpect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers\nto correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to\nincorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For\neach problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator\nwith access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,\nafter which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse\nrange of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific\nreasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language\nmodels including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,\neven under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show\nresistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To\nmitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like\nprogressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously\nattempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help\nmodels achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of\npotential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model\noverconfidence and data familiarity.

Through a tailored search procedure, several trial points are\ngenerated at each iteration and they can be added to the current set if a\ndecrease is obtained for at least one objective function.

Global Minimum Cut is one of the most basic and extensively studied\nproblems in combinatorial optimization and graph theory. While an almost-linear\ntime algorithm was known for the edge version of the problem for awhile\n(Karger, STOC 1996 and J.

    "abstract": "The search for non-ergodic mechanisms in quantum many-body systems has become\na frontier area of research in non-equilibrium physics. In this Letter, we\nintroduce Hilbert subspace imprint (HSI)-a novel mechanism that enables evasion\nof thermalization and bridges the gap between quantum many-body scars (QMBS)\nand Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF). HSI manifests when initial states\noverlap exclusively with a polynomial scaling (with system size) set of\neigenstates. We demonstrate this phenomenon through two distinct approaches:\nweak symmetry breaking and initial state engineering. In the former case, we\nobserve that ferromagnetic states including those with a single spin-flip\ndisplay non-thermal behavior under weak U(1) breaking, while antiferromagnetic\nstates thermalize. In contrast, the Z2-symmetric model shows thermalization for\nboth ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. In the latter case, we\nengineer the initial state prepared by shallow quantum circuits that enhance\nthe overlap with the small target subspace. Our results establish HSI as a\nmechanism equally fundamental to non-thermalization as QMBS and HSF.",

This precision places the burst 0.5 kpc from the nucleus of its\nlow-metallicity star-forming dwarf host at a spectroscopic redshift of z =\n0.1300. Our Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) spectroscopic follow-up reveals that\nthe dwarf FRB host is gravitationally bound to a more massive, star-forming\nspiral galaxy. This establishes the first known instance of an FRB residing in\na satellite galaxy within a larger galactic system. This configuration,\nanalogous to the Small Magellanic Cloud orbiting the Milky Way (but at a lower\noverall mass scale), expands the known diversity of FRB host environments and\noffers important insights for interpreting seemingly \"hostless\" or highly\noffset FRBs. Furthermore, our detailed dispersion measure (DM) budget analysis\nindicates that the dominant contribution to FRB 20240114A's DM likely\noriginates from the foreground halo of the central galaxy. This finding\naddresses the anomalously high DM observed for this FRB and underscores the\nsignificant role of intervening foreground structures in shaping observed FRB\nDMs, which is important for accurate FRB-based cosmological measurements.

Recent numerical studies have highlighted\nthe presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of\nthickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be\ndescribed by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin\nfilms which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In\nparticular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in\nreciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a\ndifferent homotopy group $\\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy\nphonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law\nwith frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency\nproportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely\nproportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon\npopulation becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases,\nwhich then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement.\nThe theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent\nmolecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines\nas to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the\nmaterial.",

This\neffectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR\nscenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from\nbackbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained\nstructural details.

In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used\nin policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates\nbut also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action\nvalues relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights\nstate-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking\nspurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors.

    "abstract": "Diagnostic errors remain a major cause of preventable deaths, particularly in\nresource-limited regions. Medical training simulators, including robopatients,\nplay a vital role in reducing these errors by mimicking real patients for\nprocedural training such as palpation. However, generating multimodal feedback,\nespecially auditory pain expressions, remains challenging due to the complex\nrelationship between palpation behavior and sound. The high-dimensional nature\nof pain sounds makes exploration challenging with conventional methods. This\nstudy introduces a novel experimental paradigm for pain expressivity in\nrobopatients where they dynamically generate auditory pain expressions in\nresponse to palpation force, by co-optimizing human feedback using machine\nlearning. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning\n(RL) technique optimized for continuous adaptation, our robot iteratively\nrefines pain sounds based on real-time human feedback. This robot initializes\nrandomized pain responses to palpation forces, and the RL agent learns to\nadjust these sounds to align with human preferences. The results demonstrated\nthat the system adapts to an individual's palpation forces and sound\npreferences and captures a broad spectrum of pain intensity, from mild\ndiscomfort to acute distress, through RL-guided exploration of the auditory\npain space. The study further showed that pain sound perception exhibits\nsaturation at lower forces with gender specific thresholds. These findings\nhighlight the system's potential to enhance abdominal palpation training by\noffering a controllable and immersive simulation platform.",

This last feature is\ncrucial in order to make the theory applicable to \"zero-order\" methods, where\nthe gradient is estimated using just two function evaluations.\n  We present a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the unified\nalgorithm.

In this paper, we investigate\nuplink DMRS-based channel estimation for MU-MIMO systems with Type II OCC\npattern standardized in 3GPP Release 18, leveraging location-specific\nstatistical channel state information (SCSI) to enhance performance.\nSpecifically, we propose a SCSI-assisted Bayesian channel estimator (SA-BCE)\nbased on the minimum mean square error criterion to suppress the pilot\ninterference and noise, albeit at the cost of cubic computational complexity\ndue to matrix inversions. To reduce this complexity while maintaining\nperformance, we extend the scheme to a windowed version (SA-WBCE), which\nincorporates antenna-frequency domain windowing and beam-delay domain\nprocessing to exploit asymptotic sparsity and mitigate energy leakage in\npractical systems. To avoid the frequent real-time SCSI acquisition, we\nconstruct a grid-based location-specific SCSI database based on the principle\nof spatial consistency, and subsequently leverage the uplink received signals\nwithin each grid to extract the SCSI. Facilitated by the multilinear structure\nof wireless channels, we formulate the SCSI acquisition problem within each\ngrid as a tensor decomposition problem, where the factor matrices are\nparameterized by the multi-path powers, delays, and angles. The computational\ncomplexity of SCSI acquisition can be significantly reduced by exploiting the\nVandermonde structure of the factor matrices.

    "abstract": "Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet\nthe integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge:\ndetermining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This\nliterature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher\ntraining, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new\npedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this\npaper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI\nprototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue\nthat hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose\nexcessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent\nempirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive\nfor photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address\nthis gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting\ntrainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral\ncomplexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline\na novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic\nengine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic,\nreal-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning\nmodels. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next\ngeneration of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to\nrealism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education\ntools.",

Using both asymptotic and numerical techniques, we\ninvestigate the behaviour of the beam under increasing body force and the\nmaximum force that can be supported before it must slip between the supports.\nWe quantify this maximum body force as a function of the separation between the\ntwo supports. Surprisingly, we show the existence of a critical separation\nbelow which the beam can withstand an arbitrarily large body force, even in the\nabsence of friction.

    "abstract": "Instruction subsets (ISs) are heuristics that can shrink the size of the\ninductive programming (IP) search space by tens of orders of magnitude. Here,\nwe extend the IS approach by introducing instruction and solution probabilities\nas additional heuristics. Instruction probability reflects the expectation of\nan instruction occurring in a solution, based on the frequency of instruction\noccurrence in a large code sample. The solution probability for a partial or\ncomplete program is simply the product of all constituent instruction\nprobabilities, including duplicates. We treat the minimum solution\nprobabilities observed in code sample program units of different sizes as\nsolution probability thresholds. These thresholds are used to prune the search\nspace as partial solutions are constructed, thereby eliminating any branches\ncontaining unlikely combinations of instructions. The new approach has been\nevaluated using a large sample of human code. We tested two formulations of\ninstruction probability: one based on instruction occurrence across the entire\ncode sample and another that measured the distribution separately for each IS.\nOur results show that both variants produce substantial further reductions in\nthe IP search space size of up to tens of orders of magnitude, depending on\nsolution size. In combination with IS, reductions of over 100 orders of\nmagnitude can be achieved. We also carried out cross-validation testing to show\nthat the heuristics should work effectively with unseen code.

Unlike traditional software defects,\nconnector vulnerabilities exhibit subtle behavioral patterns and are inherently\nchallenging to detect. Besides, nonstandardized implementation of connectors\nleaves potential risks (a.k.a. unsafe implementations) but is more elusive. As\na result, traditional fuzzing methods are incapable of finding such\nvulnerabilities. Even for LLM-enable test case generation, due to a lack of\ndomain knowledge, they are also incapable of generating test cases that invoke\nall interface and internal logic of connectors. In this paper, we propose\nreinforcement learning (RL)-guided LLM test-case generation for database\nconnector testing. Specifically, to equip the LLM with sufficient and\nappropriate domain knowledge, a parameterized prompt template is composed which\ncan be utilized to generate numerous prompts. Test cases are generated via LLM\nwith a prompt, and are dynamically evaluated through differential testing\nacross multiple connectors. The testing is iteratively conducted, with each\nround RL is adopted to select optimal prompt based on prior-round behavioral\nfeedback, so as to maximize control flow coverage. We implement aforementioned\nmethodology in a practical tool and evaluate it on two widely used JDBC\nconnectors: MySQL Connector/J and OceanBase Connector/J.

However, it has\nbeen observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is\nsusceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this\nissue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation\nclassification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we\npropose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new\nconcept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial\nattacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an\nAdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an\nadversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we\ncombine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural\nnetwork model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to\ndetecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into\nthe operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism.\nWe show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT,\ninfluencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in\nthe input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous.

PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot\nexploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We\nfind that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional\nor noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar\nor noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the\nheterophily of the graph is increased.

This approach leverages synthetic\nEMG data generated by a pre-trained model, followed by a proposed filtering\nmechanism based on phoneme-level confidence to enhance the ETS model through\nthe proposed self-training techniques. Experiments demonstrate our method\nimproves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word\nerror rate, confirming the effectiveness of our CoM2S approach for V-ETS. In\nsupport of future research, we will release the codes and the proposed\nLibri-EMG dataset-an open-access, time-aligned, multi-speaker voiced EMG and\nspeech recordings.",

    "abstract": "A shell model can be considered as a chain of triads, where each triad can be\ninterpreted as a nonlinear oscillator that can be mapped to a spinning top.\nInvestigating the relation between phase dynamics and intermittency in a such a\nchain of nonlinear oscillators, it is found that synchronization is linked to\nincreased energy transfer. In particular, the results provide evidence that the\nobserved systematic increase of intermittency, as the shell spacing is\ndecreased, is associated with strong phase alignment among consecutive triadic\nphases, facilitating the energy cascade. It is shown that while the overall\nlevel of synchronization can be quantified using a Kuramoto order parameter for\nthe global phase coherence in the inertial range, a local, weighted Kuramoto\nparameter can be used for the detection of burst-like events propagating across\nshells in the inertial range. This novel analysis reveals how partially\nphase-locked states are associated with the passage of extreme events of energy\nflux. Applying this method to helical shell models, reveals that for a\nparticular class of helical interactions, a reduction in phase coherence\ncorrelates with suppression of intermittency. When inverse cascade scenarios\nare considered using two different shell models including a non local helical\nshell model, and a local standard shell model with a modified conservation law,\nit was shown that a particular phase organization is needed in order to sustain\nthe inverse energy cascade. It was also observed that the PDFs of the triadic\nphases were peaked in accordance with the basic considerations of the form of\nthe flux, which suggests that a triadic phase of \\pi/2 and -\\pi/2 maximizes the\nforward and the inverse energy cascades respectively.",

Existing methods typically retrieve\npersona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity\nand result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel\ntwo-stage framework that reverses this process.

This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes\nnaturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.\nExperiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA\nsignificantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and\npersona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for\nlong-term personalized dialogue generation.",

Here we present James Webb Space Telescope\nspectroscopic observations of LAP1-B, an ultra-faint galaxy at redshift\nz_{spec}=6.625 +/-0.001, corresponding to a cosmic age of 800 million years\nafter the Big Bang, strongly magnified by gravitational lensing. LAP1-B\nexhibits a gas-phase oxygen abundance of (4.2 +/- 1.8) x 10^{-3} times the\nsolar value, making it the most chemically primitive galaxy ever identified at\nany epoch to date. The galaxy displays an exceptionally hard ionizing radiation\nfield, which is inconsistent with chemically enriched stellar populations or\naccreting black holes, but consistent with theoretical predictions for\nzero-metallicity stars. It also shows an elevated carbon-to-oxygen abundance\nratio for its metallicity in the interstellar medium, matching nucleosynthetic\nyields expected from stellar population formed in the absence of initial\nmetals. The lack of detectable stellar continuum constrains the stellar mass to\n<2700 Msun, while the dynamical mass, derived from emission-line kinematics,\nexceeds the combined stellar and gas mass by more than two orders of magnitude,\nindicating the presence of a dominant dark matter halo. These observations\nestablish LAP1-B as the most chemically primitive star-forming galaxy yet\nidentified, offering a rare window into the earliest stages of galaxy\nformation.",

The Sculptor 'classical' dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a system with\ntwo distinct stellar populations and high-quality data, offers a remarkable\nopportunity to study DM distributions in these galaxies. In this work, we infer\nthe DM halo density distribution of Sculptor, applying a method based on\nspherically symmetric distribution functions depending on actions to fit the\nstellar structural and kinematic properties of Sculptor. The galaxy is\nrepresented via four components: two distinct stellar populations based on\ndistribution functions, tracers within a fixed and dominant DM potential, plus\nthe contribution of a third stellar component that accounts for possible\nsources of contamination. The model-data comparison accounts for the kinematics\nand metallicities of individual stars, allowing us to assign probabilities of\nmembership to each star. The modeling is applied on the largest available set\nof spectroscopic data, which have not been previously analyzed with this\nobjective. We find the DM distribution of Sculptor to have a logarithmic inner\nslope of 0.39+0.23-0.26 and a scale radius of 0.79+0.38-0.17 kpc at 1 sigma\nconfidence level. Our results show that Sculptor DM density profile deviates\nfrom predictions of DM-only simulations at a 3 sigma level over a large range\nof radii. Our analysis suggests that the velocity distribution of Sculptor's\ntwo main stellar components is isotropic in the center and becomes radially\nanisotropic in the outskirts. Additionally, we provide predictions for the\nprojected radial and tangential velocity dispersion profiles. We also present\nupdated DM annihilation and decay J- and D-factors, finding J = 18.15+0.11-0.12\nand D = 18.07+0.10-0.10 for an angular aperture of 0.5 degrees.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a\nsignificant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based\ngraph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning\npower of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of\ninput nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and\ntask-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the\nrobustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely\nunexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes\nscenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study\nevaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three\ndimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement\nstate-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess\nmodel resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from\ndiverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to\ntext attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's\ntextual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods\ncan significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the\ncandidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.\nBeyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques\ntailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial\ntraining, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of\nGraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,\nequitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.",

This limitation undermines occupant comfort\nand trust, potentially hindering the adoption of AV technologies. We propose\nPACE-ADS (Psychology and Cognition Enabled Automated Driving Systems), a\nhuman-centered autonomy framework enabling AVs to sense, interpret, and respond\nto both external traffic conditions and internal occupant states. PACE-ADS uses\nan agentic workflow where three foundation model agents collaborate: the Driver\nAgent interprets the external environment; the Psychologist Agent decodes\npassive psychological signals (e.g., EEG, heart rate, facial expressions) and\nactive cognitive inputs (e.g., verbal commands); and the Coordinator Agent\nsynthesizes these inputs to generate high-level decisions that enhance\nresponsiveness and personalize the ride. PACE-ADS complements, rather than\nreplaces, conventional AV modules. It operates at the semantic planning layer,\nwhile delegating low-level control to native systems. The framework activates\nonly when changes in the rider's psychological state are detected or when\noccupant instructions are issued. It integrates into existing AV platforms with\nminimal adjustments, positioning PACE-ADS as a scalable enhancement. We\nevaluate it in closed-loop simulations across diverse traffic scenarios,\nincluding intersections, pedestrian interactions, work zones, and\ncar-following. Results show improved ride comfort, dynamic behavioral\nadjustment, and safe recovery from edge-case scenarios via autonomous reasoning\nor rider input.

This\nrelation provides a key window into galactic formation history, tracing both\nthe kinematics of stars at birth and the dynamical heating of stars after\nbirth.

The MW exhibits significantly colder\nstellar kinematics, with 2-3 times lower $\\sigma(\\tau)/v_{\\phi,0}$ at a given\nage, than all but one other observed galaxy. Therefore, the MW is a kinematic\noutlier. To assess how measurement effects influence $\\sigma(\\tau)$, we analyze\nthe FIRE-2 cosmological simulations, quantifying the impact of uncertainties in\nstellar age, aperture size, galactocentric radius, and galaxy inclination.\nAperture size and galactocentric radius affect $\\sigma(\\tau)$ by up to a factor\nof $\\approx2$ for stars younger than 100 Myr, with milder effects on older\nstars. Age uncertainties up to 40\\% change the \\textit{value} of $\\sigma(\\tau)$\nat a given age by $\\lesssim20\\%$ but can reshape the relation with age and\nerase merger signatures. We compare $\\sigma(\\tau)/v_{\\phi,0}$ in FIRE-2\nsimulations with observations. FIRE-2 agrees well with M31 and M33 at all\nmeasured ages, and with PHANGS for stars older than $\\approx500$ Myr.

These results not only validate the\nfeasibility of quantum sensing based on Rydberg atomic receivers but also\nunderscore the architecture's inherent scalability: by harnessing the atoms'\nultra-broad spectral response, the synthesized bandwidth can be extended well\nbeyond the current range, enabling sub-centimeter resolution in future radar\nsystems while preserving quantum-traceable calibration and a highly simplified\nfront end.",

We systematically evaluate leading LLMs\non diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,\nmarket report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques.

Building human-like causal competency into\nmachine learning systems may facilitate the construction of effective and\ninterpretable AI. Indeed, the machine learning community has been importing\nideas on causality formalized by the Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework,\nwhich provides a rigorous formal language for many aspects of causality and has\nled to significant advances. However, the SCM framework fails to capture some\nsalient aspects of human causal cognition and has likewise not yet led to\nadvances in machine learning in certain critical areas where humans excel. We\ncontend that the problem of causality in the ``human niche'' -- for a social,\nautonomous, and goal-driven agent sensing and acting in the world in which\nhumans live -- is quite different from the kind of causality captured by SCMs.\nFor example, everyday objects come in similar types that have similar causal\nproperties, and so humans readily generalize knowledge of one type of object\n(cups) to another related type (bowls) by drawing causal analogies between\nobjects with similar properties, but such analogies are at best awkward to\nexpress in SCMs. We explore how such causal capabilities are adaptive in, and\nmotivated by, the human niche. By better appreciating properties of human\ncausal cognition and, crucially, how those properties are adaptive in the niche\nin which humans live, we hope that future work at the intersection of machine\nlearning and causality will leverage more human-like inductive biases to create\nmore capable, controllable, and interpretable systems.",

The Random Batch Method (RBM) offers significant relief from these\ndemands by enabling the simulation of large-scale systems with reduced\ncomputational cost.\n  In this paper, we analyze the application of RBM for solving PDEs on\none-dimensional graphs, specifically concentrating on the heat equation. Our\napproach involves a two-step process: initially discretizing the PDE to\ntransform it into a finite-dimensional problem, followed by the application of\nthe RBM. We refer to this integrated approach as discretize+RBM. We establish\nthe convergence of this method in expectation, under the appropriate selection\nand simultaneous reduction of the switching parameter in RBM and the\ndiscretization parameters. Moreover, we extend these findings to include the\noptimal control of the heat equation on graphs, enhancing the practical utility\nof our methodology. The efficacy and computational efficiency of our proposed\nsolution are corroborated through numerical experiments that not only\ndemonstrate convergence but also show significant reductions in computational\ncosts.\n  Our algorithm can be viewed as a randomized variant of domain decomposition,\nspecifically adapted for PDEs defined on graph structures.

In\nPE-MA, each agent maintains a lightweight personalized adapter to support\nagent-specific behavior, while a shared adapter is collaboratively optimized\nacross neighboring agents.

While efficient numerical methods\nexist to compute integrals for high-dimensional Gaussian and other separable\ndistributions based on sparse grids (SG), input data arising in practice often\ndoes not fall into this class. We therefore employ transport maps to transform\ncomplex distributions to multivatiate standard normals. In generative learning,\na number of neural network architectures have been introduced that accomplish\nthis task approximately. Examples are affine coupling flows (ACF) and ordinary\ndifferential equation-based networks such as conditional flow matching (CFM).\nTo compute the expectation of a quantity of interest, we numerically integrate\nthe composition of the inverse of the learned transport map with the simulation\ncode output. As this map is integrated over a multivariate Gaussian\ndistribution, SG techniques can be applied. Viewing the images of the SG\nquadrature nodes as learned quadrature nodes for a given complex distribution\nmotivates our title. We demonstrate our method for monomials of total degrees\nfor which the unmapped SG rules are exact. We also apply our approach to the\nstationary diffusion equation with coefficients modeled by exponentiated L\\'evy\nrandom fields, using a Karhunen-Lo\\`eve-like modal expansions with 9 and 25\nmodes. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate errors due to\nlearning accuracy, quadrature, statistical estimation, truncation of the modal\nseries of the input random field, and training data size for three normalizing\nflows (ACF, conditional Flow Matching and Optimal transport Flow Matching) We\ndiscuss the mathematical assumptions on which our approach is based and\ndemonstrate its shortcomings when these are violated.",

This task becomes\nparticularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,\nyielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in\nthis setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between\nvariable outcomes.

By mapping the pattern representations\nonto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal\nparameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.\nWe evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and\nan agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers\nparameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes.

These speculations were largely\nsettled by the demonstration from DeepSeek-R1 that chains-of-thought and\nreinforcement learning (RL) can effectively replicate reasoning on top of base\nLLMs. However, it remains valuable to explore alternative methods for\ntheoretically eliciting reasoning that could help elucidate the underlying\nmechanisms, as well as providing additional methods that may offer\ncomplementary benefits.\n  Here, we build on the long-standing literature in cognitive psychology and\ncognitive architectures, which postulates that reasoning arises from the\norchestrated, sequential execution of a set of modular, predetermined cognitive\noperations. Crucially, we implement this key idea within a modern agentic\ntool-calling framework. In particular, we endow an LLM with a small set of\n\"cognitive tools\" encapsulating specific reasoning operations, each executed by\nthe LLM itself. Surprisingly, this simple strategy results in considerable\ngains in performance on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to\nbase LLMs, for both closed and open-weight models. For instance, providing our\n\"cognitive tools\" to GPT-4.1 increases its pass@1 performance on AIME2024 from\n26.7% to 43.3%, bringing it very close to the performance of o1-preview.\n  In addition to its practical implications, this demonstration contributes to\nthe debate regarding the role of post-training methods in eliciting reasoning\nin LLMs versus the role of inherent capabilities acquired during pre-training,\nand whether post-training merely uncovers these latent abilities.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in\nexplainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based\nmetrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work reveals that\nthese evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted\nclasses within the same dataset. These \"class-dependent evaluation effects\"\nraise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures\nattribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and\nevaluation trustworthiness. We investigate under which conditions these\nclass-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with\nsynthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We\nsystematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary\nclassification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with\nground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods.\nOur experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both\nevaluation approaches, even in simple scenarios with temporally localized\nfeatures, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent\nbetween classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground\ntruth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality\nacross classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These\nfindings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics\nwith care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly\nidentify discriminating features. By showing this disconnect, our work points\ntoward reconsidering what attribution evaluation actually measures and\ndeveloping more rigorous evaluation methods that capture multiple dimensions of\nattribution quality.",

Inertial measurement units\n(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,\nparticularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current\nreal-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset\nneeds to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical\nmotion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing\nerrors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen\nmovements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming\nand impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a\nself-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint\nkinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth\nlabels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the\nhuman body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement\ndata. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the\nmeasured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion\ncapture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint\nmoments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and\nrunning at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the\nframework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can\ninfer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the\npotential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time\nbiomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.",

This Lyapunov function decreases monotonically at a\nlinear rate along the iterations of the algorithm for a fixed inertial\nparameter. Our analysis demonstrates that the best theoretical convergence\nguarantees for FISTA in this context are obtained when the full strong\nconvexity is treated as if it belongs to the smooth part of the objective.\nWithin this framework, we compare the performance of forward-backward splitting\n(FBS) and several FISTA variants, and find that this strategy leads FISTA to\noutperform all other configurations, including FBS.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are\ncomputationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low\nbit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods\nexhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,\nwhile QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational\ncosts, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and\nlacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel\nframework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is\nfounded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation\nquantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization\n``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential\n``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32\nwhile quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to\nkeep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2\nquantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than\nexisting QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32\ntraining, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with\nFP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse\ndownstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object\ndetection.

Methods: Data\nwere acquired with a 3D radial IR-UTE pulse sequence, implemented using the\nopen-source framework Pulseq. A denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN)\nwas trained in a supervised fashion using data from eight healthy subjects.\nConjugate gradient sensitivity encoding (CG-SENSE) reconstructions of different\nretrospectively undersampled subsets (corresponding to 2.5-min, 5-min and\n10-min acquisition times) were paired with the respective reference dataset\nreconstruction (30-min acquisition time). The DnCNN was then integrated into a\nLandweber-based reconstruction algorithm, enabling physics-based iterative\nreconstruction. Quantitative evaluations of the approach were performed using\none prospectively accelerated scan as well as retrospectively undersampled\ndatasets from four additional healthy subjects, by assessing the structural\nsimilarity index measure (SSIM), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the\nnormalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), and the perceptual sharpness index\n(PSI). Results: Both the reconstructions of prospective and retrospective\nacquisitions showed good agreement with the reference dataset, indicating high\nimage quality, particularly for an acquisition time of 5 min.

    "abstract": "The addition of a small quantity of flexible fibers in a granular material is\nan efficient technique to increase the yield stress of the material. While the\ninfluence of fiber addition on the mechanical strength of granular media has\nbeen studied, much less is known about the flow properties of grain-fiber\nmixtures. In this article, we explore the effect of flexible fibers on the flow\nbehavior of grain-fiber mixtures above the yield stress. We use a vane geometry\nto study the rheology of a dry granular material mixed with flexible fibers\nwith different volume fractions and properties. The vane is immersed in the\nmaterial, and the granular pressure increases with the depth of immersion. When\nthe vane begins rotating, we observe a transient regime, which depends on the\nnumber of blades and is associated with the mobilization of material between\nthe blades. Following this transient phase, a stationary regime is reached. By\nmeasuring and modeling the stationary flow that develops around the vane, we\ndeduce the effective friction coefficient of the material from the torque\nmeasured on the vane. Following this approach, we investigate the effect of the\nfiber volume fraction and the aspect ratio on the effective friction\ncoefficient of the grain-fiber mixture. Our results show that the effective\nfriction coefficient increases linearly with fiber volume fraction and\nexponentially with fiber aspect ratio.

    "abstract": "Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with\nCMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\\sigma$\nCL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the\nDE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor\nexpansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary\nand may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake\nspurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of\nDE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to\neliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We\nassign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior\ndistributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic\napproach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities,\nexamining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa\nlikelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE.\nOur results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for\nthe first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and\nSNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence\nat redshift $z_{\\rm cross}\\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies\nbetween 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a\nsimple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\\sim\n2-4\\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark\nenergy density below $z\\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the\nHubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the\nPlanck/$\\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic\nbiases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed.\n[abridged]",

    "abstract": "The competition over natural reserves of minerals is expected to increase in\npart because of the linear-economy paradigm based on take-make-dispose.\nSimultaneously, the linear economy considers end-of-use products as waste\nrather than as a resource, which results in large volumes of waste whose\nmanagement remains an unsolved problem. Since a transition to a circular\neconomy can mitigate these open issues, in this paper we begin by enhancing the\nnotion of circularity based on compartmental dynamical thermodynamics, namely,\n$\\lambda$, and then, we model a thermodynamical material network processing a\nbatch of 2 solid materials of criticality coefficients of 0.1 and 0.95, with a\nrobotic disassembler compartment controlled via reinforcement learning (RL),\nand processing 2-7 kg of materials. Subsequently, we focused on the design of\nthe robotic disassembler compartment using state-of-the-art RL algorithms and\nassessing the algorithm performance with respect to $\\lambda$ (Fig. 1). The\nhighest circularity is -2.1 achieved in the case of disassembling 2 parts of 1\nkg each, whereas it reduces to -7.2 in the case of disassembling 4 parts of 1\nkg each contained inside a chassis of 3 kg. Finally, a sensitivity analysis\nhighlighted that the impact on $\\lambda$ of the performance of an RL controller\nhas a positive correlation with the quantity and the criticality of the\nmaterials to be disassembled.

    "abstract": "Longform audio recordings obtained with microphones worn by children-also\nknown as child-centered daylong recordings-have become a standard method for\nstudying children's language experiences and their impact on subsequent\nlanguage development. Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich\nanalyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical\nlongform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time,\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant\nchallenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no\nexisting study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data. However,\nprevious attempts have assumed that ASR must process each longform recording in\nits entirety. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect\nthose utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern\nASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a\nnotable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the\napproach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a\nmedian word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%\nof the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech\nwithout any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%. We also\ncompare word log-frequencies derived from the automatic transcripts with those\nfrom manual annotations and show that the frequencies correlate at r = 0.92\n(Pearson) for all transcribed words and r = 0.98 for words that appear at least\nfive times in the automatic transcripts. Overall, the work provides a concrete\nstep toward increasingly detailed automated linguistic analyses of\nchild-centered longform audio.",

    "abstract": "Time-Triggered Communication is a key technology for many safety-critical\nsystems, with applications spanning the areas of aerospace and industrial\ncontrol. Such communication relies on time-triggered flows, with each flow\nconsisting of periodic packets originating from a source and destined for a\ndestination node. Each packet needs to reach its destination before its\ndeadline. Different flows can have different cycle lengths. To achieve assured\ntransmission of time-triggered flows, existing efforts constrain the packets of\na flow to be cyclically transmitted along the same path. Under such Fixed\nCyclic Scheduling (FCS), reservation for flows with different cycle lengths can\nbecome incompatible over a shared link, limiting the total number of admissible\nflows. Considering the cycle lengths of different flows, a hyper-cycle has\nlength equal to their least common multiple (LCM). It determines the time\nduration over which the scheduling compatibility of the different flows can be\nchecked. In this work, we propose a more flexible schedule scheme called the\nHypercycle-level Flexible Schedule (HFS) scheme, where a flow's resource\nreservation can change across cycles within a hypercycle. HFS can significantly\nincrease the number of admitted flows by providing more scheduling options\nwhile remaining perfectly compatible with existing Time-Triggered Ethernet\nsystem. We show that, theoretically the possible capacity gain provided by HFS\nover FCS can be unbounded. We formulate the joint pathfinding and scheduling\nproblem under HFS as an ILP problem which we prove to be NP-Hard. To solve HFS\nefficiently, we further propose a least-load-first heuristic (HFS-LLF), solving\nHFS as a sequence of shortest path problems. Extensive study shows that HFS\nadmits up to 6 times the number of flows achieved by FCS. Moreover, our\nproposed HFS-LLF can run 104 times faster than solving HFS using a generic\nsolver.",

    "abstract": "Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory\nfootprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine\nlearning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,\nwhich, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph\nto the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured\nby the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening\nframeworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting\nmatrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a\ncoarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of\nthese two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on\nthe lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the\ncoarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this\npaper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not\nnecessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy\nof ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different\nproperties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form\ndescription or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed\nlifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the\nreduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a\nconstrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been\nlinked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the\nimpact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened\ngraphs.",

Namely, we promote the parameters of a standard\ninput-output economic model to random variables, in order to characterize the\ntypical statistical properties of its equilibria. A central feature of our work\nis the explicit inclusion of a waste variable as a proxy for the unwanted\nbyproducts, such as emissions, generated by different production processes. We\nfind that the interplay between economic development and waste gives rise to a\ndouble phase transition, separating a region of viable economic activity from\ntwo distinct shutdown regimes. Notably, more wasteful (\"brown\") economies\nsupport a larger number of technologies per good but fail to activate most of\nthem, limiting their productive capacity. In contrast, \"greener\" economies,\nwhile having access to fewer technologies, tend to achieve higher economic\nwelfare, up to a critical point where rapid growth under tight waste\nconstraints may destabilize them. Our results highlight the structural tensions\nbetween technological development and environmental sustainability, suggesting\nthat the green transition may require careful navigation to avoid abrupt\ncollapses in economic activity.

In high-dimensional systems, we cannot expect a\npriori chosen scalar observables to show significant EWS, and some may even\nshow an opposite signal.

    "abstract": "The response of water to electric fields is critical to the performance and\nstability of electrochemical devices, and the selectivity of enzymatic,\natmospheric, and organic reactions. A key process in this context is the water\n(auto)dissociation reaction (WD), which governs acid-base aqueous chemistry and\nshapes reaction rates and mechanisms. Despite its significance, the\nthermodynamics of the WD reaction in electrified environments remains poorly\nunderstood. Here, we investigate the WD reaction under external electric fields\nusing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations within the framework of the\nmodern theory of polarization. Our results reveal that strong electric fields\ndramatically enhance the WD reaction, increasing the equilibrium constant by\nseveral orders of magnitude. Moreover, we show that the applied field\ntransforms the WD reaction from an entropically hindered process to an\nentropy-driven one. Analysis shows that this is because the electric field\nalters the tendency of ions to be structure makers or structure breakers. By\nhighlighting how strong electric fields reshape solvent organization and\nreactivity, this work opens new avenues for designing aqueous electro-catalysts\nthat leverage solvent entropy to enhance their performance.",

However, most inverse problems are ill-posed,\nnecessitating robust mathematical treatment to yield meaningful solutions.\nWhile classical approaches provide mathematically rigorous and computationally\nstable solutions, they are constrained by the ability to accurately model\nsolution properties and implement them efficiently.\n  A more recent paradigm considers deriving solutions to inverse problems in a\ndata-driven manner. Instead of relying on classical mathematical modeling, this\napproach utilizes highly over-parameterized models, typically deep neural\nnetworks, which are adapted to specific inverse problems using carefully\nselected training data. Current approaches that follow this new paradigm\ndistinguish themselves through solution accuracy paired with computational\nefficiency that was previously inconceivable.\n  These notes offer an introduction to this data-driven paradigm for inverse\nproblems. The first part of these notes will provide an introduction to inverse\nproblems, discuss classical solution strategies, and present some applications.\nThe second part will delve into modern data-driven approaches, with a\nparticular focus on adversarial regularization and provably convergent linear\nplug-and-play denoisers.

This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory\nand bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant\nadvantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,\nhardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs\n(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and\nmatrix engines tailored for DL workloads.

We investigate the use of taxi fleets as mobile\nsensing platforms, analyzing over 100 million PM2.5 readings from more than\n3,000 vehicles across six major U.S. cities during one year. Our findings show\nthat taxis provide fine-grained, street-level air quality insights while\nensuring city-wide coverage.

While individual ARs exhibit significant variability,\nensemble averaging offers a method to extract their typical properties and\nevolution. Aims: This study aims to construct an average bipolar AR using\nensemble averaging of observational data. By normalizing ARs in space and time,\nwe seek to identify general trends in the evolution of magnetic flux, velocity\nfields, and atmospheric emissions, providing insights into the underlying\nphysical mechanisms governing AR development. Methods: We analysed a sample of\nbipolar ARs observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The ARs were selected\nbased on strict criteria, ensuring clear polarity separation and emergence\nwithin 60 degrees of the solar central meridian. Normalisation procedures were\napplied to align ARs spatially and temporally before computing an ensemble\naverage of various observables, including line-of-sight magnetograms,\nDopplergrams, and multi-wavelength intensity maps. Results: The average AR\nexhibits a well-defined evolutionary pattern, with flux emergence followed by\npeak activity and subsequent decay. The leading polarity retains coherence\nlonger than the trailing one, consistent with previous studies. Surface flow\nmaps revealed a diverging outflow near the emergence site before the emerged AR\nis clearly visible in magnetograms. Atmospheric emission variations indicate\nenhanced heating above the AR in later phases, possibly due to persistent\nreconnection events.

In prior work, we proposed a method for estimating the\nearly part of RIRs along a linear trajectory in a time-varying acoustic\nscenario involving a static sound source and a microphone moving at constant\nvelocity. This approach relies on measured RIRs at the start and end points of\nthe trajectory and assumes that the time intervals occupied by the direct sound\nand individual reflections along the trajectory are non-overlapping. The\nmethod's applicability is therefore restricted to relatively small areas within\na room, and its performance has yet to be validated with real-world data. In\nthis paper, we propose a practical extension of the method to more realistic\nscenarios by segmenting longer trajectories into smaller linear intervals where\nthe assumptions approximately hold.

However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the\nlearning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and\ninterpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset\ntypes, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we\npropose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge\ncollapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a\ngraph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural\ndiversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity\nmeasure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process.\nFurther, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable\nalternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative\npooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii)\npreserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high\naccuracy across varying pooling ratios.",

PRIMER employs a\ncoordinate-based diffusion model that learns from arbitrary spatial locations\nand associated precipitation values, enabling seamless integration of gridded\ndata and irregular gauge observations. Through two-stage training--first\nlearning large-scale patterns, then refining with accurate gauge\nmeasurements--PRIMER captures both large-scale climatology and local precision.\nOnce trained, it can downscale forecasts, interpolate sparse observations, and\ncorrect systematic biases within a principled Bayesian framework. Using gauge\nobservations as ground truth, PRIMER effectively corrects biases in existing\ndatasets, yielding statistically significant error reductions at most stations\nand furthermore enhancing the spatial coherence of precipitation fields.\nCrucially, it generalizes without retraining, correcting biases in operational\nforecasts it has never seen.

    "abstract": "Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges\nfrom modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and\nheterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized\nassumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to\ndynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships\nbetween modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named\nDynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key\nideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to\nsuppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with\nadaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through\nattention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and\nPrototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via\ncovariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic\nconsistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it\npresents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization\nunder imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and\nto balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting\nlosses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020\ndemonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete\nmulti-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and\nMyoPS2020 demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete\nmulti-modal medical image segmentation.

    "abstract": "Thousands of exoplanets orbit nearby stars, showcasing a remarkable diversity\nin mass, size, and orbits. With the James Webb Space Telescope now operational,\nwe are observing exoplanet atmospheres and aiming to reach down to small,\nhabitable-zone exoplanets in search of signs of habitability and possibly even\nbiosignature gases. Given the scarcity of targets, it is imperative to embrace\nthe known diversity and consider the range of exoplanets that might host life.\nWe review how Earth life interacts with various atmospheric gases, noting that\nbacteria can survive in high concentrations of gases such as H2, He, CO2, and\nCO. Additionally, we consider the potential for life in alternative solvents\nand in cloud biospheres where rocky surfaces are excessively hot, as well as in\nhypothesized planetary global oceans. We highlight that life fundamentally\nrequires metal ions for catalytic reactions, suggesting that environments\nwithout surface contact need meteoritic delivery to provide these essential\nelements. Despite today's observational limits, a suite of next-generation\ntelescopes is being designed specifically for exoplanet studies, promising to\nexpand our capabilities and understanding in the future.",

    "abstract": "Sodium iodide crystals doped with thallium NaI(Tl) can be used as detector\nmaterial for direct dark matter detection by taking advantage of their particle\ndetection properties of scintillation. In order to achieve this, it is crucial\nthat these crystals are of ultra-high purity. Radioimpurities within the\ncrystals may potentially mimic dark matter signals and thus must be quantified,\nminimised where possible and distinguished from real events. Abundances of\nradionuclides $^{129}$I and $^{210}$Pb, which are dominant sources of\nradioimpurities in NaI(Tl) crystals, were measured using accelerator mass\nspectrometry at the Australian National University (ANU) and the Australian\nNuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). NaI powder chemically\nprocessed to AgI, and, for the first time, unprocessed NaI powder, were shown\nto be suitable as AMS targets. A consistent $^{129}$I/$^{127}$I ratio of (2.0\n$\\pm$ 0.3) x 10$^{-13}$ was measured in three different commercially available\nNaI powders. Therefore, it was concluded that the choice of NaI powder has a\nnegligible influence on the $^{129}$I contribution to low-background dark\nmatter experiments. For $^{210}$Pb, different Pb molecular ion species were\nassessed with PbO$_2^-$ being the preferred species and applied to investigate\ndifferent lead oxide compounds for their suitability as Pb carriers. A\n$^{210}$Pb/Pb isotopic ratio of (3.6 $\\pm$ $^{1.7}_{1.4}$) x 10$^{-15}$ was\nmeasured in Pb$_3$O$_4$ powder. This met the required lower activity limit of\n$^{210}$Pb when adding 1 mg of stable lead into 1 kg of NaI(Tl) powder with a\ndesired maximum $^{210}$Pb/Pb isotopic ratio of 1 x 10$^{-14}$. These results\nindicate the suitability of the investigated Pb$_3$O$_4$ as a potential carrier\nfor incorporation with Pb extracted from NaI used for dark matter experiments.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have\nsignificantly improved editing tasks, with a primary emphasis on maintaining\ncross-view consistency throughout the generative process. Contemporary methods\ntypically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing\nconsistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either\nexplicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D\nreconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in\nparticular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish\ngeometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with\nthe added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal.\nIn this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that\noutperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction\nphase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors\nexplicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision\nstrategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for\ntraditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization.\nThrough extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art\nbenchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving\na threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method,\nhighlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness.",

In this work, we conduct a\nsystematic, multi-wavelength investigation of a sample of z ~ 2-4 emitters from\nthe MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field surveys, utilising both MUSE and JWST/NIRSpec\ndata and extending the sample presented by previous studies. We derive\ngas-phase metallicities and key physical properties, including electron\ndensities, temperatures and the production rates of hydrogen- and He+-ionising\nphotons. Our results suggest that a combination of factors-such as stellar\nmass, initial mass function, stellar metallicity, and stellar\nmultiplicity-likely contributes to the origin of the observed nebular emission.\nSpecifically, for our galaxies with higher gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H)\n> 7.55), we find that models for binary population with Salpeter IMF (Mup=100\nMsol) and stellar metallicity ~ 0.001 (i.e., similar to that of the gas) can\nreproduce the observed ionising conditions. However at lower metallicities,\nmodels for binary population with `top-heavy' initial mass function (Mup = 300\nMsol) and Zstar much lower < Zstar) than that of the gas are required to fully\naccount for the observed ionising photon production. These results reinforce\nthat the ionisation keeps challenging current stellar populations, and the\nionisation problem persists in the very low metallicity regime.",

They have been detected in\nthe soft X-ray band by Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, and, most recently, by\nEinstein Probe, which has reported more than 50 FXTs in its first year of\noperation. While several models have been proposed, the nature of many FXTs\nremains unknown. One model suggests FXTs are powered by the spin-down of newly\nformed millisecond magnetars, typically produced by binary neutron star (BNS)\nmergers. However, the BNS volumetric rate, ~10^2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1, barely overlaps\nwith the estimated FXT rate of 10^3-10^4 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. Even within that\noverlap, BNS mergers would need to produce FXTs at nearly 100% efficiency. We\nexplore whether other millisecond magnetar formation channels could account for\nthis discrepancy. We compile rate densities for several proposed progenitors:\naccretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs, binary white dwarf mergers, neutron\nstar-white dwarf mergers, and the collapse of massive stars, and convert\nGalactic event rates into volumetric rates using either the star formation rate\nor the stellar mass density distributions as a function of redshift. We find\nthat the highest potential formation rates arise from binary white dwarf\nmergers and massive star collapses. However, both channels face theoretical and\nobservational challenges: the spin and magnetic field properties of the\nresulting neutron stars are uncertain, and few are expected to satisfy both\nconditions required for FXT production. Across all scenarios, the fraction of\nsuitable millisecond magnetars is low or poorly constrained. We conclude that\nthey are unlikely to be the dominant progenitors of FXTs and can contribute to\nat most 10% of the observed FXT population.",

On the\nother hand, if wavefunctions are localized, the levels exhibit no level\nrepulsion and their statistics is Poisson. At the boundary between quantum\nchaos and localization, however, one observes critical behavior, not complying\nwith any of those characteristics. An outstanding open question is whether\nthere exist yet another type of universality, which is genuine for the critical\npoint. Previous work suggested that there may exist a relation between the\nglobal characteristics of energy spectrum, such as spectral compressibility\n$\\chi$, and the degree of wavefunction delocalization, expressed via the\nfractal dimension $D_1$ of the Shannon--von Neumann entropy in a preferred\n(e.g., real-space) basis. Here we study physical systems subject to local and\nnon-local hopping, both with and without time-reversal symmetry, with the\nAnderson models in dimensions three to five being representatives of the first\nclass, and the banded random matrices as representatives of the second class.\nOur thorough numerical analysis supports validity of the simple relation $\\chi\n+ D_1 = 1$ in all systems under investigation. Hence we conjecture that it\nrepresents a universal property of a broad class of critical models. Moreover,\nwe test and confirm the accuracy of our surmise for a closed-form expression of\nthe spectral compressibility in the one-parameter critical manifold of random\nbanded matrices. Based on these findings we derive a universal function\n$D_{1}(r)$, where $r$ is the averaged level spacing ratio, which is valid for a\nbroad class of critical systems.",

    "abstract": "Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and\nreports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and\nefficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing\nmodels suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of\nnegative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion\nof false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking\nthe fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition\ntasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but\nignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.\nMotivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal\nCluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,\nit extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the\nsingle-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.\nThis improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model\nrepresentation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image\nReconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features\nobtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.\nThis module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information\ninteraction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for\ndownstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed\nCM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable\nfor various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on\nclassification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream\ndatasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on\nmultiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.",

The difficulty with this approach lies\nin removing only the target information while leaving other information\nunchanged.

However, most existing methods\nadopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static\nmodel capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets\nfor dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two\nchallenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require\nvarying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different\ntasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts\n(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with\ncontrolled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining\npreviously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise\nexpert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to\nresolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to\nfacilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based\ninter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module\nin MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate\nthe modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average\nimprovement over the best baseline.

The FFB and non-FFB halos\noriginate from $>4\\sigma$ and $2-3\\sigma$ density peaks, respectively. The\npost-FFB galaxies quench their star formation soon after the FFB phase and\nremain quiescent due to (a) gas depletion by the FFB starbursts and outflows,\n(b) compaction events driven by angular-momentum loss in colliding streams\nwithin the high-sigma-peak FFB halos, (c) turbulent circum-galactic medium\n(CGM) that suppresses feeding by cold streams, and (d) BH feedback, being a key\nfor complete quenching. BH feedback is enhanced by FFB-driven BH seeding and\ngrowth. It seems capable of disrupting the streams by generating CGM turbulence\nor photo-heating, but this remains an open challenge.

    "abstract": "Developing autonomous driving systems (ADSs) involves generating and storing\nextensive log data from test drives, which is essential for verification,\nresearch, and simulation. However, these high-frequency logs, recorded over\nvarying durations, pose challenges for developers attempting to locate specific\ndriving scenarios. This difficulty arises due to the wide range of signals\nrepresenting various vehicle components and driving conditions, as well as\nunfamiliarity of some developers' with the detailed meaning of these signals.\nTraditional SQL-based querying exacerbates this challenge by demanding both\ndomain expertise and database knowledge, often yielding results that are\ndifficult to verify for accuracy.\n  This paper introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach that\ncombines signal log data with video recordings from test drives, enabling\nnatural language based scenario searches while reducing the need for\nspecialized knowledge. By leveraging scenario distance graphs and relative gap\nindicators, it provides quantifiable metrics to evaluate the reliability of\nquery results. The method is implemented as an API for efficient database\nquerying and retrieval of relevant records, paired with video frames for\nintuitive visualization. Evaluation on an open industrial dataset demonstrates\nimproved efficiency and reliability in scenario retrieval, eliminating\ndependency on a single data source and conventional SQL.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a 1D planetary atmosphere model that solves in a\nself-consistent manner the evolution of temperature and disequilibrium\nchemistry in the vertical direction. Thermochemical kinetics is based on a\nreaction network built from scratch that includes 164 gaseous species composed\nof H, C, N, O, S, Si, P, Ti, He, and Ar, connected by 2352 forward reactions.\nThe model is applied to the well-known gas giant exoplanets WASP-33b,\nHD209458b, HD189733b, GJ436b, and GJ1214b, and to secondary atmospheres that\nexoplanets characterized in the future may plausibly have. For irradiated gas\ngiants with solar or supersolar metallicity, the corrections to the temperature\ndue to disequilibrium chemistry are relatively small, on the order of 100 K at\nmost, in agreement with previous studies. Although the atmospheric composition\nof some of these planets deviates significantly from chemical equilibrium, the\nimpact on the temperature is moderate because the abundances of the main\natmospheric species that provide opacity, such as H2O, CO2, CO, and/or CH4, are\nnot seriously modified by disequilibrium chemistry. An impact on the\ntemperature greater than 100 K appears in hot Jupiters due to TiO, which is\npredicted to be seriously depleted by UV photons in the upper layers. However,\nthe extent of this depletion, and thus of its impact on the temperature, is\nuncertain due to the lack of knowledge about TiO photodestruction. In secondary\natmospheres, the impact of disequilibrium chemistry on the temperature depends\non the composition. In atmospheres dominated by H2O and/or CO2 the temperature\nis not affected to an important extent. However, reducing atmospheres dominated\nby CH4 and oxidizing atmospheres dominated by O2 see their temperature being\nseriously affected due to the important processing of the atmospheric\ncomposition induced by disequilibrium chemistry.",

To study this phenomenon we consider the simplest directed network,\na single cycle, and excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons. We show\nnumerically that a stationary dynamical state emerges in the form of a\nself-sustained traveling wave, through a saddle-point bifurcation of limit\ncycles that does not destabilize the global fixed point of the system. We then\nformulate an effective model for the dynamical steady state of the cycle in\nterms of a single-neuron Delay Differential Equation (DDE) featuring an\nexplicitly delayed feedback, demonstrating numerically the possibility of\nmapping stationary solutions between the two models. The DDE based model is\nshown to reproduce the entire bifurcation, which also in this case does not\ndestabilize the global fixed point, even though global properties differ in\ngeneral between the systems. The discrete nature of the cycle graph is revealed\nas the origin of these coordinated states by the parametric analysis of\nsolutions, and the DDE effective model is shown to preserve this feature\naccurately.

Finally,\nwe propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional\ndistance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression\ntasks.

Note that a similar well-known\nexperiment, Pokrovski's experiment, in which a focused liquid jet is generated\nin a test tube, is free from the effect of the converging shape. The results\nshowed that the jet was up to about 1.6 times faster in a converging-shaped\ncontainer than in a test tube, despite the same impact velocity. To understand\nthe mechanism of the increase in the jet velocity, the Laplace equation on the\npressure impulse was solved numerically under the boundary condition that the\npressure impulse is given at the bottom of the container. The normalized\ngas-liquid interfacial velocity obtained from the numerical solution of the\npressure impulse field agrees well with the normalized jet velocity in\nexperiments, showing that the jets we observed are driven by the pressure\nimpulse generated at the bottom. In addition, numerical solutions of pressure\nimpulse fields in a simpler-shaped container with different degrees of\nconvergence were compared with analytical solutions obtained from a lower-order\nmodel of the pressure impulse field. We confirmed that the gas-liquid\ninterfacial velocity of the impact-induced focused liquid jet is governed by\nchanges in both the flow rate and pressure impulse gradient at the central axis\nof the container caused by changes in the cross-sectional area of the\ncontainer. We showed that by changing the container shape, we can increase the\nvelocity of the gas-liquid interface after the container impact.

    "abstract": "The recent advent of programmable switches makes distributed algorithms\nreadily deployable in real-world datacenter networks. However, there are still\ngaps between theory and practice that prevent the smooth adaptation of CONGEST\nalgorithms to these environments. In this paper, we focus on the memory\nrestrictions that arise in real-world deployments. We introduce the\n$\\mu$-CONGEST model where on top of the bandwidth restriction, the memory of\nnodes is also limited to $\\mu$ words, in line with real-world systems. We\nprovide fast algorithms of two main flavors.\n  First, we observe that many algorithms in the CONGEST model are\nmemory-intensive and do not work in $\\mu$-CONGEST. A prime example of a family\nof algorithms that use large memory is clique-listing algorithms. We show that\nthe memory issue that arises here cannot be resolved without incurring a cost\nin the round complexity, by establishing a lower bound on the round complexity\nof listing cliques in $\\mu$-CONGEST. We introduce novel techniques to overcome\nthese issues and generalize the algorithms to work within a given memory bound.\nCombined with our lower bound, these provide tight tradeoffs between the\nrunning time and memory of nodes.\n  Second, we show that it is possible to efficiently simulate various families\nof streaming algorithms in $\\mu$-CONGEST. These include fast simulations of\n$p$-pass algorithms, random order streams, and various types of mergeable\nstreaming algorithms.\n  Combining our contributions, we show that we can use streaming algorithms to\nefficiently generate statistics regarding combinatorial structures in the\nnetwork. An example of an end result of this type is that we can efficiently\nidentify and provide the per-color frequencies of the frequent monochromatic\ntriangles in $\\mu$-CONGEST.",

    "abstract": "We explored the effect of space-time geometry on the trajectory of light rays\nin the context of a charged, rotating black hole. We derived an analytical\nexpression for the deflection of light rays in Kerr-Newman space-time geometry,\nusing a material medium approach, on non-equatorial plane. From this deflection\nangle expression it is evident that the charge and rotation of the black hole\ncan affect the light rays' paths. Additionally, we calculated the refractive\nindex of light rays by treating space-time as a medium. We demonstrated how the\nrotation parameter and charge influence the refractive index and hence the\ndeflection angle of light rays. For Kerr-Newman geometry, the deflection angle\ndecreases with increasing charge when the rotation parameter is held constant.\nConversely, for a constant charge, the deflection angle increases with the\nrotation parameter for prograde and decreases for retrograde trajectories.\nApplying both factors results in the deflection angle being lower than that of\nthe Schwarzschild geometry. Non-equatorial study of the deflection angle\nreveals that it is maximum in the equatorial plane than in the pole. The\nframe-dragging effects in the Kerr-Newman field were taken into account to\ncalculate the velocity of light rays, leading to the determination of the\nrefractive index in this field geometry. This study concludes that depending on\nthe values of the rotation parameter and charge parameter both prograde and\nretrograde trajectories coincide, resulting in the conclusion that at some\npoint the frame dragging effect is the same for prograde and retrograde motion.\nAlso, the frame dragging increases towards poles for retrograde trajectories\nwhile decreasing for prograde trajectories, and these nontrivial nature results\nbecause of the interplay between charge and rotation.",

Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation\nfor their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to\nclassical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step\nforward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we\nrefer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning\narchitectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal\ndistinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing\ntheir strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance,\nwe show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with\northonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned\nEckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up\ndeveloping the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is\nbased on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To\nvalidate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we\nbenchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the\nimportance of model design and initialization.",

We\nextend this framework by introducing a fusion mechanism that maps the\ncollection of single-band embeddings to a unified sequence representation,\nenabling multiband modeling for downstream tasks. The challenge lies in\ndevising a mechanism within the encoder to coordinate between data from\ndifferent wavelengths, which are often recorded at asynchronous times.

Experimental results show that both our proposed multiband\narchitectures outperform the single-band models by approximately 10% in\nF1-score, with jointly pre-trained multiband encoders further improving\nperformance over a collection of independently pre-trained single-band\nencoders. Furthermore, our experiments show that there are minimal differences\nin multiband performance when sampling individual band data asynchronously\nversus sampling all individual bands on the same set of time-steps.

Quantum chemical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing density\nfunctional tight binding (DFTB) demonstrate that the kinetics of carbon\nnucleation on an iron nanoparticle catalyst can be tuned via oxygen loading.\nIncreasing the oxygen content in the catalyst leads to activation of\nsurface-bound carbon species and enhanced carbon chain growth due to respective\nweakening and strengthening of the C-C and Fe-C bonding. This is due to oxygen\nmodulating the electronic structure of the iron catalyst, with the Fermi level\nof the catalyst increasing proportionally with oxygen content until the\niron:oxygen stoichiometry reaches parity.

However, this\nfamily of techniques faces challenges such as model mismatches between training\nand testing phases. This work introduces FieldFormer, a self-supervised neural\nprior learned solely from the limited {\\it in situ} observations without the\nneed of offline training. Specifically, the proposed framework starts with\nmodeling the fields of interest using the tensor Tucker model of a high\nmultilinear rank, which ensures a universal approximation property for all\nfields. In the sequel, an attention mechanism is incorporated to learn the\nsparsity pattern that underlies the core tensor in order to reduce the solution\nspace.\n  In this way, a ``complexity-adaptive'' neural representation, grounded in the\nTucker decomposition, is obtained that can flexibly represent\n  various types of fields. A theoretical analysis is provided to support the\nrecoverability of the proposed design. Moreover, extensive experiments, using\nvarious physical field tensors, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\napproach compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is\nhighly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity\nis the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability\nof materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent\ndirectionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their\ncrystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural\npiezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to\nleverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an\nintegrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials\nwith customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of\ntruss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the\ntopology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity.\nThen, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic\npiezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of\nphoto-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework\ndiscovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic,\nunidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive\nmanufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating\nthese metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over\n48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized\nmetamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved\nmetamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than\nits longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk\nmaterials.

An over\nreliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the\nphysics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true\nunderlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes\na valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced\ndemand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance\nis a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies\nthrough time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid\nwithin particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur\nwhen given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures).

In circumstances where\nusers may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may\nbe automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and\nintuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical\nphenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative\ncapture of uncertainty alongside predictions.

First, by incorporating text\nsemantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce\nposture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,\nbased on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a\ncross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse\nsign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the\ndiversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is\nintroduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss\nweighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity\nof information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and\nensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose\nmodalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce\nhigh-fidelity sign language videos.

Inspired by the principles of\nmachine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates\nattribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and\ntargeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach\nemploys gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish\nhigh-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing\nrestrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based\nsensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to\nnoise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data\nsubset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This\nintegrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over\nconventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level\nunlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full\nmodel retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on\nrepresentative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech\nrecognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both\naccuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a\n10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with\ninjected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some\nsettings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the\nproposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are progressively deployed in various\nreal-world applications, personalization of LLMs has become increasingly\nimportant. While various approaches to LLM personalization such as prompt-based\nand training-based methods have been actively explored, the development of\neffective decoding-time algorithms remains largely overlooked, despite their\ndemonstrated potential. In this paper, we propose CoPe (Contrasting Personal\nPreference), a novel decoding-time approach applied after performing\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on user-specific data. Our core idea is\nto leverage reward-guided decoding specifically for personalization by\nmaximizing each user's implicit reward signal. We evaluate CoPe across five\nopen-ended personalized text generation tasks. Our empirical results\ndemonstrate that CoPe achieves strong performance, improving personalization by\nan average of 10.57% in ROUGE-L, without relying on external reward models or\nadditional training procedures.",

    "abstract": "GraphRAG-Causal introduces an innovative framework that combines graph-based\nretrieval with large language models to enhance causal reasoning in news\nanalysis. Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex,\nimplicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses\nthese challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured\ncausal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges\nsemantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to\naccurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a\nthree-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are\nmeticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause,\neffect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these\ngraphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid\nCypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and\nstructural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage\nutilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with\nXML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal\nrelationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal\nachieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20\nfew-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency,\nmaking it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability\nassessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.",

Knowing how clients\nare using their APIs allows for data-driven decisions on prioritising bug\nreports, feature requests, and testing activities. For example, the priority of\na bug report concerning an API can be partly determined by how widely that API\nis used.\n  In this paper, we present an empirical study in which we analyse API usage\nacross 21 popular open-source C libraries, such as OpenSSL and SQLite, with a\ncombined total of 3,061 C/C++ clients. We compare API usage by clients with how\nwell library test suites exercise the APIs to offer actionable insights for\nlibrary developers. To our knowledge, this is the first study that compares API\nusage and API testing at scale for the C/C++ ecosystem. Our study shows that\nlibrary developers do not prioritise their effort based on how clients use\ntheir API, with popular APIs often poorly tested. For example, in LMDB, a\npopular key-value store, 45% of the APIs are used by clients but not tested by\nthe library test suite. We further show that client test suites can be\nleveraged to improve library testing e.g., improving coverage in LMDB by 14.7%\nwith the important advantage that those tests are representative of how the\nAPIs are used in the field.\n  For our empirical study, we have developed LibProbe, a framework that can be\nused to analyse a large corpus of clients for a given library and produce\nvarious metrics useful to library developers.",

Existing\napproaches are primarily either generation-based, using pretrained language\nmodels, or information retrieval-based (IR), reusing comments from similar past\nexamples. While generation-based methods leverage code-specific pretraining on\nlarge code-natural language corpora to learn semantic relationships between\ncode and natural language, they often struggle to generate low-frequency but\nsemantically important tokens due to their probabilistic nature. In contrast,\nIR-based methods excel at recovering such rare tokens by copying from existing\nexamples but lack flexibility in adapting to new code contexts-for example,\nwhen input code contains identifiers or structures not found in the retrieval\ndatabase. To bridge the gap between generation-based and IR-based methods, this\nwork proposes to leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for RCG by\nconditioning pretrained language models on retrieved code-review exemplars.

Ci Bai Capsule (CB) has been\nreported to enhance white blood cell levels; however, its mechanisms and\nbioactive compounds remain unclear.Aim: This study aimed to identify the\nbioactive compounds group of CB and elucidate its potential mechanisms in\nradiation-induced leukopenia.Methods: Syndrome-related data were gathered from\nSYMMAP and CTD database. CB's target profile is predicted by DrugCIPHER.\nNetwork pharmacology approaches were employed to identify active compounds and\nrelated pathways. Experimental validation was conducted through flow cytometry\nand RNA-sequencing in both ex vivo and in vivo models.Results: A total of 22\npathways related to cellular processes, immune responses, and signal\ntransduction were identified. Five key bioactive compounds\n(kaempferol-3-glucorhamnoside, syringin, schisandrin, 3-hydroxytyrosol\n3-O-glucoside and salidroside) were found to significantly modulate\nsyndrome-related pathways. Optimal dosing of this compound combination enhanced\nleukocyte counts and splenic immune cell proliferation in irradiated mice.\nTranscriptomic analysis revealed that the compounds exert regulatory effects on\nPP1A, RB, CDK4/6, CDK2, and CDK1, thereby modulating downstream immune and\nhematopoietic markers such as MNDA, BST2, and HSPA1A.Conclusion: Our findings\nsuggest that CB mitigates radiation-induced leukopenia by enhancing immune and\nhematopoietic recovery, offering a promising therapeutic approach for managing\nradiation-related hematological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Since weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, reliable decision making\nrequires information on the likelihoods of future weather scenarios. We explore\nthe sensitivity of machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) using the 24h\nPangu Weather ML model of Huawei to errors in the initial conditions with a\nspecific kind of Singular Vector (SV) perturbations. Our Arnoldi-SV (A-SV)\nmethod does not need linear nor adjoint model versions and is applicable to\nnumerical weather prediction (NWP) as well as MLWP. It observes error growth\nwithin a given optimization time window by iteratively applying a forecast\nmodel to perturbed model states. This creates a Krylov subspace, implicitly\nbased on a matrix operator, which approximates the local error growth. Each\niteration adds new dimensions to the Krylov space and its leading right SVs are\nexpected to turn into directions of growing errors. We show that A-SV indeed\nfinds dynamically meaningful perturbation patterns for the 24h Pangu Weather\nmodel, which grow right from the beginning of the forecast rollout. These\nperturbations describe local unstable modes and could be a basis to initialize\nMLWP ensembles. Since we start A-SV from random noise perturbations, the\nalgorithm transforms noise into perturbations conditioned on a given reference\nstate - a process that is akin to the denoising process of the generic\ndiffusion based ML model of GenCast, therefor we briefly discuss similarities\nand differences.",

Secure inference offers a privacy-preserving\nsolution, but existing frameworks suffer from high computational overhead and\ncommunication costs, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. We\nintroduce SecONNds, a non-intrusive secure inference framework optimized for\nlarge ImageNet-scale Convolutional Neural Networks. SecONNds integrates a novel\nfully Boolean Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol for secure comparison\n-- addressing Yao's millionaires' problem -- using preprocessed Beaver's bit\ntriples generated from Silent Random Oblivious Transfer. Our novel protocol\nachieves an online speedup of 17$\\times$ in nonlinear operations compared to\nstate-of-the-art solutions while reducing communication overhead. To further\nenhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)\npreprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption\noperations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\\times$ on GPU\nfor linear operations. We also present SecONNds-P, a bit-exact variant that\nensures verifiable full-precision results in secure computation, matching the\nresults of plaintext computations. Evaluated on a 37-bit quantized SqueezeNet\nmodel, SecONNds achieves an end-to-end inference time of 2.8 s on GPU and 3.6 s\non CPU, with a total communication of just 420 MiB. SecONNds' efficiency and\nreduced computational load make it well-suited for deploying privacy-sensitive\napplications in resource-constrained environments.

Although several\ninfluence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,\nMarginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,\nthere are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting\ndifferent glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common\ninfluence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and\ntabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).\nThrough extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence\neffectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can\ndetect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training\ndynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during\ntraining, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,\ninfluence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in\nmisleading influence attribution.",

While most\nworks focus on linear and polynomial/rational systems of ODEs, general\nnonlinear systems have received far less attention and, to the best of our\nknowledge, no general constructive methodology has been proposed to assess and\nguarantee parameter and state recoverability in this context. We consider a\nclass of systems of parameterized nonlinear ODEs and some observations, and\nstudy if a system of this class is observable, identifiable or jointly\nobservable-identifiable; our goal is to identify its parameters and/or\nreconstruct the initial condition from the data. To achieve this, we introduce\na family of efficient and fully constructive procedures that allow\nrecoverability of the unknowns with low computational cost and address the\naforementioned gap. Each procedure is tailored to different observational\nscenarios and based on the resolution of linear systems. As a case study, we\napply these procedures to several epidemic models, with a detailed focus on the\nSIRS model, demonstrating its joined observability-identifiability when only a\nportion of the infected individuals is measured, a scenario that has not been\nstudied before. In contrast, for the same observations, the SIR model is\nobservable and identifiable, but not jointly observable-identifiable. This\ndistinction allows us to introduce a novel approach to discriminating between\ndifferent epidemiological models (SIR vs. SIRS) from short-time data.

It\nis challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's\nspecific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning\nduring inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,\nevaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is\ncrucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and\ncontrollable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1.

Using the designed pipeline, we\nconstructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in\nimages that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby\nchanging the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that\nhave different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual\nreasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing\nthe test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's\nreasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics\nto expose this relationship.

Method : The\nmethod presented here uses optical data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to\nconstruct surface brightness (SB) profiles for each galaxy. A characteristic UV\nradius is defined to examine the XUV disks. The surface brightness profiles are\nfitted using simple exponential functions, and the extracted parameters are\ncompared with the literature to identify possible GLSB galaxies. We examined\nalso other diagnostics, including color profiles. Results : The analysis of the\noptical surface brightness profiles of XUV galaxies reveal that they can be\nclassified into three different families. One third meet the GLSB criteria in\nterms of diffuseness, another third are regular, and the remaining have a\nstronger decline in the outer disk than in the inner disk, opposite to GLSBs.\nThe color profiles allowed us, in addition to distinguish one of the galaxy,\nNGC1140, likely resulting from a rare dwarf-dwarf merger.",

We show that this family of\ninvariants satisfies some concavity and hereditary properties. From which we\ndeduce that (n -m)$\\chi$(g) is a lower bound, where $\\chi$(g) is the index of\ng. We prove that this lower bound is in fact an equality for a dense set of\norbits, and that if g is reductive, it is always an equality when m = 0 (and\nalso some special orbits). We conjecture that equality holds for all m when g\nis reductive.",

To help developers and security\nexperts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of\none of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective\nof vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real\nvulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can\ngenerate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code\nbefore and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation.

    "abstract": "Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot\ntasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for\nsafety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a\nnon-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.\nHowever, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a\nrotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model\nfitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any\nsingularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,\nrevealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere\nsurface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method\nto solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional\nrobustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics\nprocessing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of\nGPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for\nlarge-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\\%$ outlier ratio) rotation\nestimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical\nframework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct\ncontrolled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments\nprovide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our\napproach in solving rotation estimation problems.",

    "abstract": "State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable\nintelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,\nrobotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and\npredictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise\nstatistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,\nreal-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and\nmissing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting\nconventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering\nmethods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering\nproposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and\npropose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference\nframeworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation\ntechniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential\nMonte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian\nCram\\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To\nvalidate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations\nand experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D\npoint cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The\nfundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with\npossible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning\npipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing\nchallenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with\noutliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.",

This study introduces the\nDelayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,\nby developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)\ntransformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state\n(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From\ndynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than\nindividual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such\nnonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a\nsingle shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical\nstates from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs\ndistinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently\npredicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical\nfoundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of\nTransformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in\nforecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Here, we study both\ntopological and trivial flat bands in a twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice for\nultracold atoms and present the evolution of the flat bands with different\ninterlayer coupling strength (ICS). Our results demonstrate that an isolated\ntopological flat band can emerge at the Dirac point energy for a specific value\nof weak ICS, referred to as the ``critical coupling\".

As the ICS is\nfurther increased into the strong coupling regime, trivial flat bands arise\naround Dirac point energy. Meanwhile, more trivial flat bands appear, extending\nfrom the lowest to higher energy bands, and remain flat as the ICS increases.\nThe topological properties of the flat bands are studied through the winding\npattern of the Wilson loop spectrum.

    "abstract": "We propose transformed Diffsuion-Wave fractional Physics-Informed Neural\nNetworks (tDWfPINNs) for efficiently solving time-fractional diffusion-wave\nequations with fractional order $\\alpha\\in(1,2)$. Conventional numerical\nmethods for these equations often compromise the mesh-free advantage of\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) or impose high computational costs\nwhen computing fractional derivatives. The proposed method avoids first-order\nderivative calculations at quadrature points by introducing an integrand\ntransformation technique, significantly reducing computational costs associated\nwith fractional derivative evaluation while preserving accuracy. We conduct a\ncomprehensive comparative analysis applying this integrand transformation in\nconjunction with both Monte Carlo integration and Gauss-Jacobi quadrature\nschemes across various time-fractional PDEs. Our results demonstrate that\ntDWfPINNs achieve superior computational efficiency without sacrificing\naccuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate the proposed approach into adaptive\nsampling approaches such as the residual-based adaptive distribution (RAD) for\nthe time-fractional Burgers equation with order $\\alpha\\in(1,2)$, which\nexhibits complex solution dynamics. The experiments show that the Gauss-Jacobi\nmethod typically outperforms the Monte Carlo approach; however, careful\nconsideration is required when selecting the number of quadrature points.\nOverall, the proposed tDWfPINNs offer a significant advancement in the\nnumerical solution of time-fractional diffusion-wave equations, providing an\naccurate and scalable mesh-free alternative for challenging fractional models.",

This\nposition paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series\nreasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic\nprimitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This\nrealignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning\napproaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by\nsystematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task\nengineering.

    "abstract": "Voltage regulation under conventional grid-forming controllers is tightly\ncoupled to power sharing and dc-link dynamics. Consequently, its tracking\naccuracy deteriorates during grid faults, sudden power sharing changes, or\ndc-bus voltage varying. To address this issue, a symmetric sliding-mode control\n(SSMC) method is developed and its voltage precision region is derived. It\nillustrates how much ac-side power dynamics and dc-link voltage varying can be\ndecoupled from the voltage regulation task, which helps predict when an\nabnormal entangling appears. While conventional sliding-mode controls address\nvoltage-tracking error through complex sliding surface designs, repetitive\ncorrection techniques or special reaching laws, this work identifies that the\nerror at power-line frequency primarily stem from the asymmetry property of\ninverters with the delay effect and the computational inaccuracy. Guided by\nthis insight, an asymmetry compensation structure is proposed, which avoids\nadded design complexity and directly mitigates voltage tracking error.\nFurthermore, the control design is supported by a physical and quantitative\nexplanation, aiding in parameter tuning. Simulation and experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster tracking responses while\nmaintaining robust and more accurate tracking under both dc-link voltage and\nac-side current variations. Conventional grid-forming and classical\nsliding-mode controllers, which handle these variations separately, cannot\nmatch this combined speed and robustness. Furthermore, the voltage precision\nregion is explicitly verified.",

Although there are more\nsophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for\npost-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization\nor high computation overhead.

This paper introduces\n\\textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework,\nfeaturing a \\emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for\neach phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate\nconcise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing\nthinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch\nphase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving\nphase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to\npredefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic\nsearch methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch\nsubgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training\nor fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\\%, 32.8\\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from\nminiF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets\ncompared to state-of-the-arts.

Additionally, DSP+\ngenerates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the\nidentification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized\nstatements in miniF2F are discovered.

Results reveal that pretrained BERT\nenables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.\nHowever, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding\nspace only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks.

Consequently, vulnerability severity assessment has\nemerged as a critical component in optimizing software development efficiency.\nExisting vulnerability assessment methods typically rely on manually crafted\ndescriptions associated with source code artifacts. However, due to variability\nin description quality and subjectivity in intention interpretation, the\nperformance of these methods is seriously limited.

We propose the\nGraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph\nTransformer and decouples dynamic-static objects optimization for 3D Gaussian\nSplatting-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph\nAttenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric\ngraph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling\nlarge-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while\ncompact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph\nretaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly\nencode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the\nMulti-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers\noptimizes boundary details, while coarsegrained attention at higher layers\nmodels object-level topology.

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain\nof Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach\nto interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation\nthat certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --\nconsistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like\ncognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of\ncognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce\nCogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.\nCogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,\nand employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit\nidentification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16\nwidely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that\nLRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also\nadaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses\nfurther uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit\nprofiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and\nDeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that\ncertain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with\nthe generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying\npersistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper\nunderstanding of LLM misbehavior.

Thus, it is\ncrucial that the practitioner selects the desired sensitivity analysis method\njudiciously, making sure to match the selected approach to the specifics of\ntheir problem and to their desired objectives. In this chapter, we provide a\npractical overview of a collection of widely used, widely available sensitivity\nanalysis methods. We focus on global sensitivity approaches, which seek to\ncharacterize how uncertainty in the model output may be allocated to sources of\nuncertainty in model inputs across the entire input space. Generally, this will\nrequire the practitioner to specify a probability distribution over the input\nspace. On the other hand, methods for local sensitivity analysis do not require\nthis specification but they have more limited utility, providing insight into\nsources of uncertainty associated only with a particular, specified location in\nthe input space. Our hope is that this chapter may serve as a decision-making\ntool for practitioners, helping to guide the selection of a sensitivity\nanalysis approach that will best fit their needs. To support this goal, we have\nselected a suite of approaches to cover, which, while not exhaustive, we\nbelieve provides a flexible and robust sensitivity analysis toolkit.

    "abstract": "A networked system can fail when most of its components are unable to support\nflux through the nodes and edges. As studied earlier this scenario can be\ntriggered by an external perturbation such as an intentional attack on nodes or\nfor internal reasons such as due to malfunction of nodes. In either case, the\nasymptotic failure of the network is preceded by a cascade of nodal failures.\nIn this work, we focus on the nodal failure arising from the intrinsic\nfluctuations in the flux passing through the nodes. By modeling these as\nextreme events, it is shown that three distinct nodal failure regimes can be\nidentified before a complete network failure takes place. Further, the approach\nto network failure through the three regimes is shown to be qualitatively\nsimilar on a square lattice, all-to-all, scale free, and Erdos-Renyi networks.\nWe obtain approximate analytical description of the approach to failure for an\nall-to-all network. This is also demonstrated numerically for real\ntransportation network of flights.",

This paper investigates the QCD\ncorrections to the angular separation distribution $\\theta_{12}$ between two\nobserved hadrons, $H_1$ and $H_2$, in the process $e^+e^- \\to H_1 H_2 + X$ up\nto $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$, with particular emphasis on the intermediate\nregion $\\theta_{12} \\in (0,\\pi)$. The partonic processes at this accuracy\nconsist of two sorts of contributions, the real-virtual and double-real\ncorrections. Of them, the evaluation of four-body phase space integrals in the\nlatter case is at the core of this study. To address them, we first employ the\nintegration-by-parts (IBP) identities to reduce the number of independent\nintegrals and then apply the differential equations (DE) method to recursively\nsolve the resulting master integrals. In kinematic regions where the invariant\nmass of the unresolved partons vanishes, IBP coefficients can develop\ndivergences. To this end, we resum higher-order terms in the dimensional\nregulator for each master integral based on the asymptotic behavior of the\ncanonical DEs. After combining the real and virtual corrections with the\ncounter terms from fragmentation function renormalization, we demonstrate that\nthe pole terms in the final analytic expressions exactly cancel out in all\npartonic channels, thereby providing a non-trivial validation of collinear\nfactorization at the next-to-leading order (NLO). Eventually, when presenting\nour analytic expressions of the finite partonic coefficients, we transform the\ntranscendental functions resulting from the DE solutions into classical\n(poly)logarithmic functions, in order to facilitate the implementation in event\ngenerators.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\\rm e}$) in non-equilibrium\n{plasma} flows is critical, yet hampered by inadequate models for electron\nheating from vibrationally excited states. Prior models often relied on ad-hoc\nscaling or flawed applications of detailed balance that failed to ensure the\nconvergence of electron temperature and species-specific vibrational\ntemperature ($T_{\\rm v}$) at thermal equilibrium. This paper introduces a\nnovel, thermodynamically consistent electron heating model derived rigorously\nfrom the principle of detailed balance. By assuming a Boltzmann vibrational\ndistribution and employing an effective activation energy, our approach yields\na simple heating-to-cooling ratio of $\\exp(\\theta_{\\rm v}/T_{\\rm e}-\\theta_{\\rm\nv}/T_{\\rm v})$, where $\\theta_{\\rm v}$ is the characteristic vibrational\ntemperature of the species under consideration. This formulation guarantees\nthat $T_{\\rm e}$ correctly converges to $T_{\\rm v}$ at equilibrium. A key\nadvantage is that our model can utilize total cooling rates determined from\nswarm experiments, leading to higher accuracy at low electron temperatures. For\nre-entry flows, the proposed approach predicts an electron temperature several\ntimes lower than previous models which results in improved agreement with some\nflight test data. These more reliable predictions can significantly enhance the\nmodeling fidelity of plasma-assisted combustion, laser-induced plasmas, and\nvarious hypersonic plasma technologies such as electron transpiration cooling\nor magnetohydrodynamic force generators.",

A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this\nstructure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only\na subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive\nobjective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead:\nchoosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based\nacquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose\nan accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a\nmodest loss in query efficiency.

    "abstract": "Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that\ninvolves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,\nST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by\nenhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal\nrepresentations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves\nconsistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked\nmodeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying quantum entanglement is a pivotal challenge in quantum\ninformation science, particularly for high-dimensional systems, due to its\ncomputational complexity. This thesis extends the geometric measure of\nentanglement (GME) to introduce and investigate a suite of GME-based\nentanglement monotones tailored for diverse quantum contexts, including pure\nstates, subspaces, and mixed states. These monotones are applicable to both\nbipartite and multipartite systems, offering a unified framework for\ncharacterizing entanglement across various scenarios. Notably, the proposed\nmonotones are adept at identifying entanglement with varying entanglement\ndimensionalities, making them particularly effective for detecting\nhigh-dimensional entanglement. To support practical computation, we develop a\nnon-convex optimization framework that yields accurate upper bounds,\ncomplemented by semidefinite programming techniques to establish robust lower\nbounds. Together, these approaches provide a consistent and efficient\ncomputational methodology. This work advances both the theoretical\nunderstanding and algorithmic tools for entanglement quantification,\ncontributing to the study of complex quantum correlations in entangled systems.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in the\ntask of text ranking for information retrieval. While Pointwise ranking\napproaches offer computational efficiency by scoring documents independently,\nthey often yield biased relevance estimates due to the lack of inter-document\ncomparisons. In contrast, Pairwise methods improve ranking accuracy by\nexplicitly comparing document pairs, but suffer from substantial computational\noverhead with quadratic complexity ($O(n^2)$). To address this tradeoff, we\npropose \\textbf{RefRank}, a simple and effective comparative ranking method\nbased on a fixed reference document. Instead of comparing all document pairs,\nRefRank prompts the LLM to evaluate each candidate relative to a shared\nreference anchor. By selecting the reference anchor that encapsulates the core\nquery intent, RefRank implicitly captures relevance cues, enabling indirect\ncomparison between documents via this common anchor. This reduces computational\ncost to linear time ($O(n)$) while importantly, preserving the advantages of\ncomparative evaluation. To further enhance robustness, we aggregate multiple\nRefRank outputs using a weighted averaging scheme across different reference\nchoices. Experiments on several benchmark datasets and with various LLMs show\nthat RefRank significantly outperforms Pointwise baselines and could achieve\nperformance at least on par with Pairwise approaches with a significantly lower\ncomputational cost.",

The three-dimensional\nmagnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that\nhas been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic\nwhirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed\nby microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an\nelectronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall\neffect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the\nhopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect\narises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and\nout-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be\nseen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other\ntextures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy\nexperiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion\ndetermines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional\ntopological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional\ntopological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions\nattractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures\nallow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.",

To address this issue, prior research has explored\nvirtualization techniques for monolithic NPUs, but has neglected inter-core\nconnected NPUs with the hardware topology.\n  This paper introduces vNPU, the first comprehensive virtualization design for\ninter-core connected NPUs, integrating three novel techniques: (1) NPU route\nvirtualization, which redirects instruction and data flow from virtual NPU\ncores to physical ones, creating a virtual topology; (2) NPU memory\nvirtualization, designed to minimize translation stalls for SRAM-centric and\nNoC-equipped NPU cores, thereby maximizing the memory bandwidth; and (3)\nBest-effort topology mapping, which determines the optimal mapping from all\ncandidate virtual topologies, balancing resource utilization with end-to-end\nperformance. We have developed a prototype of vNPU on both an FPGA platform\n(Chipyard+FireSim) and a simulator (DCRA).

While recent approaches leverage\nfoundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality\nknowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to\naddress the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a\nnovel framework that \\textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation\nmodels (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation\nmodel (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these\nmodels poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge\nbetween SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the\ninsufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a\ntext-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class\nprototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio\nand visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages\ntext as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual\nmodalities.

Nowadays, more and more\nspacecraft equip electric propulsion and perform long-duration maneuvers to\nrealize orbital transfer. Previous studies have investigated impulsive maneuver\ndetection with space surveillance data. But, the developed method does not\nsuffice for cases where maneuver durations are long. In this study, an improved\nuncooperative spacecraft maneuver detection method with space-based optical\nobservations is proposed. Instead of a sudden maneuver event, the maneuver\nduration is considered. The maneuver starting/ending times are estimated along\nwith the thrust acceleration vector. The angular residuals of nonlinear least\nsquare estimates are used to judge whether a maneuver policy could be a\npotential solution. The global optimum maneuver policy is chosen from multiple\nlocal minima according to the minimum-fuel principle. It is demonstrated that\nthe maneuver duration is poorly observable if the thrust is along the orbital\nnormal direction attributed to the nature of orbital dynamics.

Though there are some efforts devoted\nto explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion\nmodels, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model\ninternal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not\nreliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing\nframework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA).

Multigrade chains are also investigated, involving\nmultiple sets of integers satisfying the GPTE system. The study of PTE and GPTE\nproblems is further extended from integers to trigonometric functions. Three\nnovel generalizations of the Girard-Newton Identities are introduced to solve\nthe PTE and GPTE problems: the first extends the domain of exponents to all\nintegers; the second further generalizes to a broader form; and the third\nfocuses on odd integer exponents. The constant $C$ in the PTE and GPTE problems\nis investigated, and a novel approach is proposed by introducing the normalized\nGPTE problem with six conjectures to determine bounds for each variable.

To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks\nand propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition\nstrategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea\nthen merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.\nAdditionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity\nand the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive\nexperiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that\nChelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining\ncomparable model performance.

Our method\nimproves on an existing non-parametric method, which uses at most oblique\nsplits to induce survival regression trees. In the prior work, these oblique\nsplits were created via a non-SVM approach, by minimizing a piece-wise linear\nobjective, called a dipole splitting criterion, constructed from pairs of\ncovariates and their associated survival information. We extend this method by\nenabling splits from a general class of non-linear surfaces. We achieve this by\nridge regularizing the dipole-splitting criterion to enable application of\nkernel methods in a manner analogous to classical SVMs. The ridge\nregularization provides robustness and can be tuned. Using various kernels, we\ninduce both linear and non-linear survival trees to compare their sizes and\npredictive powers on real and simulated data sets. We compare traditional\nunivariate log-rank splits, oblique splits using the original dipole-splitting\ncriterion and a variety of non-linear splits enabled by our method. In these\ntests, trees created by non-linear splits, using polynomial and Gaussian\nkernels show similar predictive power while often being of smaller sizes\ncompared to trees created by univariate and oblique splits.

For\nexample, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG\nsystem might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,\ncausing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even\nwhen the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this\npaper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which\nsystematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases\nthrough a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation\nmethod based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection\ntechniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback\nmechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream\nlarge language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance\nmodel biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense\nmechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack.

This two-part paper proposes a compositional\nand equilibrium-free approach to analyzing power system stability. In Part I,\nwe prove that using equilibrium-free local conditions we can certificate\nsystem-wide stability of power systems with heterogeneous nonlinear devices and\nstructure-preserving lossy networks. This is built on a recently developed\nnotion of delta dissipativity, which yields local stability conditions without\nknowing the system-wide equilibrium. As a consequence, our proposed theory can\ncertificate stability of equilibria set rather than single equilibrium. In Part\nI, we verify our theory and demonstrate promising implications by the single\nmachine single load benchmark, which helps to better explain the compositional\nand equilibrium-set-oriented stability analysis. Part II of this paper will\nprovide methods for applying our theory to complex power grids, together with\ncase studies across a wide range of system scales. Our results enable a more\nscalable and adaptable approach to stability analysis. It also sheds light on\nhow to regulate grid-connected devices to guarantee system-wide stability.",

Because efficiency has been the main metric of\nprogress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible\ncatastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to\nsearch for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small\namount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream\ntask classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token\nfor decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from\nincorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to\ncontrol a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In\nSSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected\nby the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be\ncontrolled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models\nfrom three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and\nfour diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias\nin Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a\nsingle token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,\nfor light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA\nrank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable\nto small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence\nimproving robustness.",

DYNAMO offers flexibility by integrating various loss\nfunctions, making it practical for learning linear and non-linear causal\nstructures from a general class of non-stationary causal processes.

    "abstract": "As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued\ninterest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training\nstage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build\nknowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling\n(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes\nincreasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking\n(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,\nusing a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web\ndata, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks\nPIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus\nwith a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly\ntechnical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively\nincreasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better\ngeneralization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.\nAltogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of\nprogressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving\ngeneralization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.",

    "abstract": "The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in\nthe 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform\nmachines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires\nhigh-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for\nhigh levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.\nUncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement\nnoise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although\nadvanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are\nutilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic\nerrors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a\ncomparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated\nmanufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that\nsimulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications\ncan reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great\nextent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on\ndeveloping control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few\nhave discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In\na manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary\nsignificantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects\nof environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image\nshot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel\nalgorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera\nworkspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is\nminimized.",

    "abstract": "Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic\nexpressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing\nbenchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,\nlimiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific\nunderstanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale\nbenchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections\nof literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical\nlayouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and\ngraphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,\ncovering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,\nencompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering\ngrounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of\nrepresentative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source\nmodels, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and\nconceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic\nlayout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and\ninferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant\nperformance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple\ndimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table\nunderstanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for\nadvancing scientific reasoning.",

The model extends the classical\nNavier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard (NSCH) system by introducing an Allen-Cahn-type\ntransmembrane flux governed by chemical potential imbalances, resulting in a\nstrongly coupled system involving fluid motion, solute transport, and interface\ndynamics. To solve this system efficiently and accurately, we develop\nhigh-order, energy-stable numerical schemes. The local discontinuous Galerkin\n(LDG) method is employed for spatial discretization, offering high-order\naccuracy and geometric flexibility. For temporal integration, we first\nconstruct a first-order decoupled scheme with rigorous energy stability, and\nthen improve temporal accuracy via a semi-implicit spectral deferred correction\n(SDC) method. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical properties of the\nproposed scheme and demonstrate the influence of osmotic pressure and membrane\npermeability on droplet morphology at equilibrium.

We consider a setting where an adversary\ntries to learn the optimal linear-quadratic attack against a system, the\ndynamics of which it does not know. On the other end, a defender who knows its\ndynamics exploits its information advantage and injects a deceptive input into\nthe system to mislead the adversary. The defender's aim is to then\nstrategically design this deceptive input: it should force the adversary to\nlearn, as closely as possible, a pre-selected attack that is different from the\noptimal one. We show that this deception design problem boils down to the\nsolution of a coupled algebraic Riccati and a Lyapunov equation which, however,\nare challenging to tackle analytically. Nevertheless, we use a block successive\nover-relaxation algorithm to extract their solution numerically and prove the\nalgorithm's convergence under certain conditions.

To address these issues, we propose a physics-informed neural\nnetwork (PINN) framework grounded in an energy-based formulation that treats\nboth forward and inverse problems within a unified architecture. The forward\nproblem is recast as a saddle-point optimization of the total potential energy,\nsolved via the deep energy method (DEM), which circumvents the direct\ncomputation of high-order derivatives. For the inverse problem of identifying\nunknown flexoelectric coefficients from sparse measurements, we introduce an\nadditional variational loss that enforces stationarity with respect to the\nelectric potential, ensuring robust and stable parameter inference. The\nframework integrates finite element-based numerical quadrature for stable\nenergy evaluation and employs hard constraints to rigorously enforce boundary\nconditions. Numerical results for both direct and converse flexoelectric\neffects show excellent agreement with mixed-FEM solutions, and the inverse\nmodel accurately recovers material parameters from limited data. This study\nestablishes a unified, mesh-compatible, and scalable PINN approach for\nhigh-order electromechanical problems, offering a promising alternative to\ntraditional simulation techniques.",

While traditional statistical watermarking techniques\nhave proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct\nadaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to\na phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and\nretokenized sequences during the image generation process.

    "abstract": "This thesis explores the impact of the Climate Emergency movement on local\ngovernment climate policy, using computational methods. The Climate Emergency\nmovement sought to accelerate climate action at local government level through\nthe mechanism of Climate Emergency Declarations (CEDs), resulting in a series\nof commitments from councils to treat climate change as an emergency. With the\naim of assessing the potential of current large language models to answer\ncomplex policy questions, I first built and configured a system named PALLM\n(Policy Analysis with a Large Language Model), using the OpenAI model GPT-4.\nThis system is designed to apply a conceptual framework for climate emergency\nresponse plans to a dataset of climate policy documents. I validated the\nperformance of this system with the help of local government policymakers, by\ngenerating analyses of the climate policies of 11 local governments in Victoria\nand assessing the policymakers' level of agreement with PALLM's responses.\nHaving established that PALLM's performance is satisfactory, I used it to\nconduct a large-scale analysis of current policy documents from local\ngovernments in the state of Victoria, Australia. This thesis presents the\nmethodology and results of this analysis, comparing the results for councils\nwhich have passed a CED to those which did not. This study finds that GPT-4 is\ncapable of high-level policy analysis, with limitations including a lack of\nreliable attribution, and can also enable more nuanced analysis by researchers.\nIts use in this research shows that councils which have passed a CED are more\nlikely to have a recent and climate-specific policy, and show more attention to\nurgency, prioritisation, and equity and social justice, than councils which\nhave not. It concludes that the ability to assess policy documents at scale\nopens up exciting new opportunities for policy researchers.",

One key\nchallenge is that angular kinematic trajectories are highly interconnected, and\nthe structures of the interconnections vary across different components.\nNeglecting the interconnections and the variability in the connectivity\nstructures impairs the understanding of age-associated gait coordination. To\nthis end, we develop a novel kinematic connectivity analysis framework,\ngrounded in multiple functional regression, to evaluate lower-limb joint\neffective age and uncover age-related kinematic features. The proposed approach\nis built upon the concept of filtration, a widely used tool in network analysis\nand topological data analysis for multi-resolution exploration. Specifically,\nwe develop a forest-structured covariate grouping framework in which different\nkinematic trajectories are aggregated hierarchically to capture both\n(partially) shared and idiosyncratic motion signatures which are strongly\nassociated with aging. We also develop a novel filtrated functional partial\nleast squares approach for model estimation and feature extraction. Compared to\nexisting approaches, our proposed approach demonstrates superior predictive\npower while providing novel insights into the coordinated evolution of angular\nkinematics during aging.

    "abstract": "An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it\ncaptures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing\nnode label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional\nNoise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the\nEdge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in\nreal-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between\nnodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes\nand edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three\nvariants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its\ndegree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node\ndegree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph\ndatasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for\ngraph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater\nperformance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing\nnoise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We\nstatistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem.

The methodology\nincorporates samples from the target model (target domain) alongside those from\nauxiliary models (source domains), transferring knowledge of coefficient shape\nfrom the source domains to the target domain. This shape-based knowledge\ntransfer offers two key advantages. First, it is robust to covariate scaling,\nensuring effectiveness despite variations in data distributions across\ndifferent source domains. Second, the notion of coefficient shape homogeneity\nrepresents a meaningful advance beyond traditional coefficient homogeneity,\nallowing the method to exploit a wider range of source domains and achieve\nsignificantly improved model estimation. We rigorously analyze the convergence\nrates of the proposed estimator and examine the minimax optimality. Our\nfindings show that the degree of improvement depends not only on the similarity\nof coefficient shapes between the target and source domains, but also on\ncoefficient magnitudes and the spectral decay rates of the functional\ncovariates covariance operators. To address situations where only a subset of\nauxiliary models is informative for the target model, we further develop a\ndata-driven procedure for identifying such informative sources.
