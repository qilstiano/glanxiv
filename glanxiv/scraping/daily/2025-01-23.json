    "abstract": "Energy management decreases energy expenditures and consumption while\nsimultaneously increasing energy efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, and\nenhancing operational performance. Smart grids are a type of sophisticated\nenergy infrastructure that increase the generation and distribution of\nelectricity's sustainability, dependability, and efficiency by utilizing\ndigital communication technologies. They combine a number of cutting-edge\ntechniques and technology to improve energy resource management. A large amount\nof research study on the topic of smart grids for energy management has been\ncompleted in the last several years. The authors of the present study want to\ncover a number of topics, including smart grid benefits and components,\ntechnical developments, integrating renewable energy sources, using artificial\nintelligence and data analytics, cybersecurity, and privacy. Smart Grids for\nEnergy Management are an innovative field of study aiming at tackling various\ndifficulties and magnifying the efficiency, dependability, and sustainability\nof energy systems, including: 1) Renewable sources of power like solar and wind\nare intermittent and unpredictable 2) Defending smart grid system from various\ncyber-attacks 3) Incorporating an increasing number of electric vehicles into\nthe system of power grid without overwhelming it. Additionally, it is proposed\nto use AI and data analytics for better performance on the grid, reliability,\nand energy management. It also looks into how AI and data analytics can be used\nto optimize grid performance, enhance reliability, and improve energy\nmanagement. The authors will explore these significant challenges and ongoing\nresearch. Lastly, significant issues in this field are noted, and\nrecommendations for further work are provided.",

    "abstract": "Topolectrical circuits have emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing\nstatic topological states that are challenging to construct in other systems,\nfacilitating the design of robust circuit devices. In addition to spatial\ndimensionality, synergistic engineering of both temporal and spatial degrees in\ncircuit networks holds tremendous potential across diverse technologies, such\nas wireless communications, non-reciprocal electronics and dynamic signal\ncontrols with exotic space-time topology. However, the realization of\nspace-time modulated circuit networks is still lacking due to the necessity for\nflexible modulation of node connections in both spatial and temporal domains.\nHere, we propose a new class of topolectrical circuits, referred to as\ntopolectrical space-time circuits, to bridge this gap. By designing and\napplying a novel time-varying circuit element controlled by external voltages,\nwe can construct circuit networks exhibiting discrete space-time translational\nsymmetries in any dimensionality, where the circuit dynamical equation is in\nthe same form with time-dependent Schrodinger equation. Through the\nimplementation of topolectrical space-time circuits, three distinct types of\ntopological space-time crystals are experimentally demonstrated, including the\n(1+1)-dimensional topological space-time crystal with midgap edge modes,\n(2+1)-dimensional topological space-time crystal with chiral edge states, and\n(3+1)-dimensional Weyl space-time semimetals.

Participants include students,\nfaculty, alumni, and industry professionals. However, forecasts are given as\nscalar values without expression of uncertainty, probabilities being a keystone\nof meteorological forecasting today, and previous attempts to add probabilistic\nelements to WxChallenge have failed partly due to challenges in making\nprobability forecasting accessible to all, and inability to combine scores with\ndifferent units while also appropriately rewarding forecasts using proper\nscoring rules. Much of the competition's maintenance relies on dedicated\nvolunteers, highlighting need for more automation. Hence I propose three new\nfeatures: (1) automated forecast problems based on morning ensemble guidance,\nforming prediction baselines, thresholds over which the players demonstrate\nskill in their later forecast; (2) a spread betting game, where the players\nallocate 100 confidence credits to the over-under for exceeding a percentile\n(e.g., 50pc) threshold of a variable (e.g., maximum temperature) derived from\nthe ensemble baseline; and (3) a game where players distribute 100 confidence\ncredits across bins of a continuous variable (e.g., accumulated precipitation)\napproximating a probability mass function. Forecasts are evaluated using\nShannon information gained over the baseline forecast, yielding additive units\nof bits that allow score combinations of different variables and units.\nInformation gain parallels the Brier Score and is likewise a sound measure of\nskill due its punishment of hedging.

Three models -- the power law, power law with\nan exponential cutoff, and log-parabola -- are employed to analyze the spectral\nproperties, and most sources exhibit significant curvature. The high-redshift\nblazars exhibit higher $\\gamma$-ray luminosities and softer spectral indices\ncompared with their low-redshift counterparts, where B3~1343+451 has the\nhighest integrated flux, $\\rm 1.13 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{\\ ph \\ cm^{-2}\ns^{-1}}$.

We find that blazars with higher accretion disk\nluminosities tend to have lower IC peak frequencies, leading to more efficient\ncooling of high-energy electrons.

    "abstract": "Until now multiscale quantum problems have appeared to be out of reach at the\nmany-body level relevant to strongly correlated materials and current quantum\ninformation devices. In fact, they can be modeled with $q$-th order fractional\nderivatives, as we demonstrate in this work, treating classical and quantum\nphase transitions in a fractional Ising model for $0 < q \\leq 2$ ($q = 2$ is\nthe usual Ising model). We show that fractional derivatives not only enable\ncontinuous tuning of critical exponents such as $\\nu$, $\\delta$, and $\\eta$,\nbut also define the Hausdorff dimension $H_D$ of the system tied geometrically\nto the anomalous dimension $\\eta$. We discover that for classical systems,\n$H_D$ is precisely equal to the fractional order $q$. In contrast, for quantum\nsystems, $H_D$ deviates from this direct equivalence, scaling more gradually,\ndriven by additional degrees of freedom introduced by quantum fluctuations.\nThese results reveal how fractional derivatives fundamentally modify the\nfractal geometry of many-body interactions, directly influencing the universal\nsymmetries of the system and overcoming traditional dimensional restrictions on\nphase transitions. Specifically, we find that for $q < 1$ in the classical\nregime and $q < 2$ in the quantum regime, fractional interactions allow phase\ntransitions in one dimension. This work establishes fractional derivatives as a\npowerful tool for engineering critical behavior, offering new insights into the\ngeometry of multiscale systems and opening avenues for exploring tunable\nquantum materials on NISQ devices.",

    "abstract": "Multi-plane light converters (MPLCs) - also known as linear diffractive\nneural networks - are an emerging optical technology, capable of converting an\northogonal set of optical fields into any other orthogonal set via a unitary\ntransformation. MPLC design is a non-linear problem typically solved by\noptimising a digital model of the optical system. However, inherently high\nlevels of design complexity mean that even a minor mismatch between this\ndigital model and the physically realised MPLC leads to a severe reduction in\nreal-world performance. Here we address this challenge by creating a\nself-configuring free-space MPLC. Despite the large number of parameters to be\noptimised (typically tens of thousands or more), our proof-of-principle device\nconverges in minutes using a method in which light only needs to be transmitted\nin one direction through the MPLC. Two innovations make this possible. Firstly,\nwe devise an in-situ optimisation algorithm combining wavefront shaping with\nthe principles of wavefront matching that would conventionally be used to\ninverse-design MPLCs offline in simulation. Secondly, we introduce a new MPLC\nplatform incorporating a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) phase-only light\nmodulator - allowing rapid MPLC switching at up to kiloHertz rates. Our scheme\nautomatically accounts for the physical characteristics of all system\ncomponents and absorbs any unknown misalignments and aberrations into the final\ndesign. We demonstrate self-configured MPLCs capable of mapping random\northogonal speckle input fields to well-defined Laguerre-Gaussian and\nHermite-Gaussian output modes, as well as universal mode sorters. Our work\npaves the way towards large-scale ultra-high-fidelity fast-switching MPLCs and\ndiffractive neural networks, which promises to unlock new applications in areas\nranging from optical communications to optical computing and imaging.",

Such an\nenhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due\nto an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction\neffects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the\nstrongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl\nsemimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore\nbe an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.",

Our method is based on a two-stage Dirichlet process mixture\ninstrumental variable (DPMIV) model which simultaneously models the first-stage\nrandom error term for the exposure variable and the second-stage random error\nterm for the time-to-event outcome using a bivariate Gaussian mixture of the\nDirichlet process (DPM) model.

We develop an MCMC algorithm for the DPMIV model\ntailored for partly interval-censored data and conduct extensive simulations to\nassess the performance of our DPMIV method in comparison with some competing\nmethods.

For nonlinear dynamical systems, this presents a\ncritical challenge as the linear modal transformation, which is universal for\nlinear systems, does not apply to nonlinear dynamical systems. As natural\nextensions to linear normal modes,the nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) framework\nprovides a comprehensive representation of nonlinear dynamics. Theoretically,\nNNMs may either be computed numerically or analytically from the closed-form\nmodels or equations of dynamical systems, or experimentally identified from\ncontrollable input-output tests, both of which, however, are typically unknown\nor unavailable practically. In this study, we present a physics-integrated\nNormalizing Flows deep learning-based data-driven approach which identifies the\nNNMs and the nonlinear modal transformation function of NNMs using measured\nresponse data only. Specifically, we leverage the unique features of the\nNormalizing Flows model: 1) the independent latent spaces, naturally spanned by\nthe Normalizing Flows, are exploited to facilitate nonlinear modal\ndecomposition; 2) the invertible transformation through the Normalizing Flows,\nenabling efficient and accurate nonlinear transformation between original and\nmodal coordinates transformation.

To\nreach the nonzero desired setpoints, a feedforward input is additionally\napplied to the control law and a time-varying feedforward input is used instead\nof the constant one to effectively track a time-varying desired boom tip\ndeflection. This control law is assessed by numerical simulations and by tests\nusing a smaller-scale prototype of Solar Cruiser. Both the simulation and the\ntest results show that this PD control with the time-varying feedforward input\nrobustly controls the flexible cable-actuated solar sail.",

    "abstract": "Digital data continues to grow, there has been a shift towards using\neffective regulatory mechanisms to safeguard personal information. The CCPA of\nCalifornia and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European\nUnion are two of the most important privacy laws. The regulation is intended to\nsafeguard consumer privacy, but it varies greatly in scope, definitions, and\nmethods of enforcement. This paper presents a fresh approach to adaptive\ncompliance, using machine learning and emphasizing natural language processing\n(NLP) as the primary focus of comparison between the GDPR and CCPA. Using NLP,\nthis study compares various regulations to identify areas where they overlap or\ndiverge. This includes the \"right to be forgotten\" provision in the GDPR and\nthe \"opt-out of sale\" provision under CCPA. International companies can learn\nvaluable lessons from this report, as it outlines strategies for better\nenforcement of laws across different nations.

    "abstract": "Supply networks require collaboration in a competitive environment. To\nachieve this, nodes in the network often form symbiotic relationships as they\ncan be adversely effected by the closure of companies in the network,\nespecially where products are niche. However, balancing support for other nodes\nin the network against profit is challenging. Agents are increasingly being\nexplored to define optimal strategies in these complex networks. However, to\ndate much of the literature focuses on homogeneous agents where a single policy\ncontrols all of the nodes. This isn't realistic for many supply chains as this\nlevel of information sharing would require an exceptionally close relationship.\nThis paper therefore compares the behaviour of this type of agent to a\nheterogeneous structure, where the agents each have separate polices, to solve\nthe product ordering and pricing problem. An approach to reward sharing is\ndeveloped that doesn't require sharing profit. The homogenous and heterogeneous\nagents exhibit different behaviours, with the homogenous retailer retaining\nhigh inventories and witnessing high levels of backlog while the heterogeneous\nagents show a typical order strategy. This leads to the heterogeneous agents\nmitigating the bullwhip effect whereas the homogenous agents do not. In the\nhigh demand environment, the agent architecture dominates performance with the\nSoft Actor-Critic (SAC) agents outperforming the Proximal Policy Optimisation\n(PPO) agents. Here, the factory controls the supply chain. In the low demand\nenvironment the homogenous agents outperform the heterogeneous agents. Control\nof the supply chain shifts significantly, with the retailer outperforming the\nfactory by a significant margin.",

The proposed and baseline\ntechniques are applied on Urdu Customer Support data set and IMDB Urdu movie\nreview data set by using pretrained Urdu word embeddings that are suitable for\n(SA) at the document level. Results of these techniques are evaluated and our\nproposed model outperforms all other DL techniques for Urdu SA. BiLSTM-SLMFCNN\noutperformed the baseline DL models and achieved 83{\\%}, 79{\\%}, 83{\\%} and\n94{\\%} accuracy on small, medium and large sized IMDB Urdu movie review data\nset and Urdu Customer Support data set respectively.",

We present a\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) photometric dataset of Y dwarfs: twenty-three\nwere imaged in wide-field mode, 20 using NIRCam with the F150W and F480M\nfilters, and 3 using NIRISS with the F480M filter. We present an F480M vs.\nF150W $-$ F480M color-magnitude diagram for our sample, and other brown dwarfs\nwith F150W and F480M colors synthesized from JWST spectra by Beiler et al.\n(2024). For one target, WISEA J083011.95$+$283716.0, its detection in the\nnear-infrared confirms it as one of the reddest Y dwarfs known, with F150W $-$\nF480M $= 9.62$ mag. We provide its updated parallax and proper motion. One of\nthe Beiler et al. Y dwarfs, CWISEP J104756.81+545741.6, is unusually blue,\nconsistent with strong CO absorption seen in its spectrum which the F480M\nfilter is particularly sensitive to. The strong CO and the kinematics of the\nobject suggest it may be very low-mass and young. We update the resolved\nphotometry for the close binary system WISE J033605.05$-$014350.4 AB, and find\nthat the secondary is almost as cold as WISE 085510.83$-$071442.5, with $T_{\\rm\neff} \\lesssim 300$ K, however the F150W $-$ F480M color is significantly bluer,\npossibly suggesting the presence of water clouds.

Our results indicate that the net cost of mitigation\nand social norms have minimal impact on tipping points when social norms are\nweak. As social norms strengthen, the climate tipping point can trigger a\ntipping element in the social model. However, faster social learning can delay\nor prevent the climate tipping point: sufficiently fast social learning means\ngrowing climate change mitigation can outpace the oncoming climate tipping\npoint, despite social-climate feedback. By comparing high- and low-risk\nscenarios, we demonstrated high-risk scenarios increase the likelihood of\ntipping points.

In this study, buoyant, passive tracers are employed as\ngeneralized probes to investigate an active bath comprising motile bacteria\nconfined within a droplet.

Using a stochastic analytical\nframework, we extract the temporal memory and diffusivity parameters that\ndefine such an active bath. Notably, the diffusivity scales linearly with\nbacterial concentration, modulated by a factor representing the role of\nconfinement, expressed as the ratio of the confining radius to the probe\nradius. This finding, while still awaiting a complete theoretical explanation,\noffers new insights into the transport properties of confined active baths and\npaves the way for a deeper understanding of active emulsions driven by confined\nactive matter.",

Ignoring for the moment gauge and Yukawa\ninteractions, we derive six-loop renormalization group equations (RGE) for all\nthe invariants entering the set. We do not compute a single Feynman diagram but\nrely heavily on the general RGE results for scalar theories. We use linear\nalgebra together with techniques from Invariant Theory. The latter not only\nallow one to compute the number of linearly independent invariants entering\nbeta functions at a certain loop order (via Hilbert series) but also provide a\nconvenient tool for dealing with polynomial relations (so-called syzygies)\nbetween invariants from the generating set.",

In this work, we propose a\nsimple technique whereby LMs communicate via activations; concretely, we pause\nan LM $\\textit{B}$'s computation at an intermediate layer, combine its current\nactivation with another LM $\\textit{A}$'s intermediate activation via some\nfunction $\\textit{f}$, then pass $\\textit{f}$'s output into the next layer of\n$\\textit{B}$ and continue the forward pass till decoding is complete.

This ensures that the encoder cannot gain by changing the\nsingle-letter conditional distribution. This argument relies on a careful\nidentification of the sequence of auxiliary random variables.

Traditional 3D cages are typically composed of triangles\nand quads. While quads can represent non-planar regions when their four corners\nare not coplanar, they form ruled surfaces with straight isoparametric curves,\nwhich limits their ability to handle curved and high-curvature deformations. In\nthis work, we extend the cage for curved boundaries using B\\'{e}zier patches,\nenabling flexible and high-curvature deformations with only a few control\npoints. The higher-order structure of the B\\'{e}zier patch also allows for the\ncreation of a more compact and precise curved cage for the input model. Based\non Green's third identity, we derive the Green coordinates for the B\\'{e}zier\ncage, achieving shape-preserving deformation with smooth surface boundaries.\nThese coordinates are defined based on the vertex positions and normals of the\nB\\'{e}zier control net. Given that the coordinates are approximately calculated\nthrough the Riemann summation, we propose a global projection technique to\nensure that the coordinates accurately conform to the linear reproduction\nproperty.

The DM has several contributions that can be\nmeasured (or estimated), including the contribution from the host galaxy\nitself, DM_host. In this work, we empirically estimate DM_host for a sample of\n12 galaxy hosts, using a direct method based solely on the properties of the\nhost galaxies themselves (DM_host_dir). We use VLT/MUSE observations of the FRB\nhosts for estimating DM_host_dir. The method relies on estimating the DM\ncontribution of both the FRB host galaxy's interstellar medium and its halo\nseparately. For comparison purposes, we also provide an alternative indirect\nmethod to estimate DM_host based on the Macquart relation (DM_host_mq). We find\nan average <DM_host> = 80+/-11 pc/cc with a standard deviation of 38 pc/cc (in\nthe rest-frame) based on our direct method, with a systematic uncertainty of\n30%. We report positive correlations between DM_host and both the stellar\nmasses and the star-formation rates of their host galaxies. In contrast, we do\nnot find any strong correlation between DM_host and neither redshift nor the\nprojected distances to the FRB hosts centers. Finally, we do not find any\nstrong correlation between DM_host_dir and DM_host_mq, although their average\nvalues are consistent. Our reported correlations could be used to improve the\npriors used in establishing DM_host for individual FRBs. Similarly, such\ncorrelations and the lack of a strong redshift evolution can be used to\nconstrain models for the progenitor of FRBs. However, the lack of a DM_host_dir\nand DM_host_mq correlation indicates that there may still be contributions to\nthe DM of FRBs not included in our modeling, e.g. large DMs from the FRB\nprogenitor and/or intervening large-scale structures not accounted for in\nDM_host_mq.",

Recent\nobservations of outflows around FR0 galaxies, that host compact radio-loud\nsources, imply that lower-power jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) may have a\nsignificant impact on their hosts through jet interactions with the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). Using the Arepo code, we launch jets of low and\nintermediate power (10$^{38}$ - 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) within a ~kpc-scale\nperiodic box with driven turbulence to study how the jets propagate through a\nturbulent ISM. Our simulation results broadly fit into three different\nscenarios $\\unicode{x2013}$ jets penetrating easily through the ISM, becoming\ncompletely stalled, or the interesting intermediate stage, when jets are highly\ndisturbed and redirected. We suggest that intermediate power jets do not have\nenough ram pressure to affect the turbulent structure of the ISM, and so only\nfill pre-existing cavities.

We efficiently selected\nextremely metal-poor candidates in the core and streams for high-resolution\nspectroscopic analysis using metallicity-sensitive photometry from SkyMapper\nDR2, and Gaia DR3 XP spectra and proper motions. This allowed us to obtain a\nhigh-purity selection of Sgr members based on stellar kinematics while reducing\nthe chances of potential contamination from the Milky Way halo. We present a\nsample of 37 Sgr stars with detailed chemical abundances, of which we identify\n10 extremely metal-poor (EMP; $\\rm{[Fe/H]} \\le -3.0$) stars, 25 very metal-poor\n(VMP; $\\rm{[Fe/H]} \\le -2.0$) stars, and 2 metal-poor (MP; $\\rm{[Fe/H]} \\le\n-1.0$) stars. This sample increases the number of extremely metal-poor Sgr\nstars analyzed with high-resolution spectroscopy by a factor of five. Of these\nstars, 15 are identified as members of the Sgr tidal stream, while the\nremaining 22 are associated with the core. We derive abundances for up to 20\nelements and identify no statistically significant differences between the\nelement abundance patterns across the core and stream samples. Intriguingly, we\nidentify stars that may have formed in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies that accreted\nonto Sgr, in addition to patterns of C and r-process elements distinct from the\nMilky Way halo. Over half of the sample shows a neutron-capture element\nabundance pattern consistent with the scaled solar pure r-process pattern,\nindicating early r-process enrichment in the Sgr progenitor.",

    "abstract": "Spin-orbit coupling in systems with broken inversion symmetry gives rise to\nthe Edelstein effect, which is the induced spin polarization in response to an\napplied electric field or current, and the inverse Edelstein effect, which is\nthe induced electric current in response to an oscillatory magnetic field or\nspin polarization. At the same time, an interplay between spin-orbit coupling\nand electron-electron interaction leads to a special type of collective\nexcitations -- chiral-spin modes -- which are oscillations of spin polarization\nin the absence of a magnetic field. As a result, both Edelstein and inverse\nEdelstein effects exhibit resonances at the frequencies of spin-chiral\ncollective modes. Here, we present a detailed study of the effect of electron\ncorrelation on the Edelstein and inverse Edelstein effects in a single-valley\ntwo-dimensional electron gas and a multi-valley Dirac system with\nproximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. While the chiral-spin modes involve both\nin-plane and out-of-plane oscillations of spins, we show that only the in-plane\nmodes are responsible for the above resonances. In the multi-valley system,\nelectron correlation splits the in-plane modes into two. We also study the\nspectral weight distribution between the two resonances over a large parameter\nspace of intra- and inter-valley interactions.",

To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's\nvulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox:\nexisting RAG poisoning attacks are less effective under GraphRAG than\nconventional RAG, due to GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval; yet,\nthe same features also create new attack surfaces.

    "abstract": "There is a range of ways to organize hiring and admissions in higher\neducation, as in many domains, ranging from very centralized processes where a\nsingle person makes final decisions to very decentralized processes where many\npeople make decisions about who to admit or hire. Decentralized processes can\nenable individual and collective empowerment, but this may come at the cost of\nefficiency. With the advent of automated decision making, this question of\ncentralization has a big impact on hiring and admissions, given that automated\nsystems often are easier to implement, or even require, more centralized\ndecision making.\n  In this paper, we develop a strategic model to explore the impact of the\ndegree of centralization on both the candidates and the hirers, with a focus on\nuniversity admissions. The model reflects a trade-off between a centralized\ncommittee where preferences may not capture individual hirers' preferences, and\na decentralized process where individual hirers face extra costs to interview\ncandidates themselves. We characterize when individual hirers prefer the\ndecentralized process over the centralized process as a function of the degree\nto which the centralized process and hirers' preferences are aligned. We also\nshow that decentralization can have devastating consequences for fairness,\nleading to major disparities in the likelihood of getting hired across\ncandidates. Our results demonstrate the trade-offs that occur under the\nquestion of centralization vs decentralization, and point to how an answer to\nthis question can impose significant harm to people in these systems.",

The resulting data was then used for ML with\nscikit-learn algorithms. The ML models were trained by 27,756 samples and\ntested by 5,466.

However, it has\nbeen unclear why decision makers have often difficulties to develop a good\nsense on when to trust a prediction using AI confidence values. Very recently,\nCorvelo Benz and Gomez Rodriguez have argued that, for rational decision\nmakers, the utility of AI-assisted decision making is inherently bounded by the\ndegree of alignment between the AI confidence values and the decision maker's\nconfidence on their own predictions. In this work, we empirically investigate\nto what extent the degree of alignment actually influences the utility of\nAI-assisted decision making. To this end, we design and run a large-scale human\nsubject study (n=703) where participants solve a simple decision making task -\nan online card game - assisted by an AI model with a steerable degree of\nalignment. Our results show a positive association between the degree of\nalignment and the utility of AI-assisted decision making.

NRPyEllipticGPU is the first\nGPU-enabled elliptic solver in the NR community, supporting a variety of\ncoordinate systems and demonstrating substantial performance improvements on\nboth consumer-grade and HPC-grade GPUs. We show that, when compared to a\nhigh-end CPU, NRPyEllipticGPU achieves on a high-end GPU up to a sixteenfold\nspeedup in single precision while increasing double-precision performance by a\nfactor of 2--4. This performance boost leverages the GPU's superior parallelism\nand memory bandwidth to achieve a compute-bound application and enhancing the\noverall simulation efficiency.

This sample comprises both archival data and our new\nobservations of 99 CCSNe conducted with the AMI-LA radio array in a systematic\napproach devised to constrain the mass-loss at different stages of stellar\nevolution.

One solution is to distribute the\nlogical quantum computation across multiple small quantum computers, with\nnon-local operations enabled via distributed Bell states. Previous\ninvestigations of distributed quantum error correction have largely focused on\nthe surface code, which offers good error suppression but poor encoding rates,\nwith each surface code instance only able to encode a single logical qubit. In\nthis work, we argue that hyperbolic Floquet codes are particularly well-suited\nto distributed quantum error correction for two reasons. Firstly, their\nhyperbolic structure enables a high number of logical qubits to be stored\nefficiently. Secondly, the fact that all measurements are between pairs of\nqubits means that each measurement only requires a single Bell state. Under the\ncircuit-level noise model, we demonstrate through simulations that distributed\nhyperbolic Floquet codes offer good performance with achievable local and\nnon-local fidelities of approximately $99.97\\%$ and $99\\%$, respectively. This\nshows that distributed quantum error correction is not only possible but also\nefficiently realisable.",

    "abstract": "The formation of cataclysmic variables (CVs) has long been modeled as a\nproduct of common envelope evolution (CEE) in isolated binaries. However, a\nsignificant fraction of intermediate-mass stars -- the progenitors of the white\ndwarfs (WDs) in CVs -- are in triples. We therefore investigate the importance\nof triple star dynamics in CV formation. Using Gaia astrometry and existing CV\ncatalogs, we construct a sample of $\\sim50$ CVs in hierarchical triples within\n1 kpc of the Sun, containing main-sequence (MS) and WD tertiaries at\nseparations of 100 - 30,000 au. We infer that at least 10% of CVs host wide\ntertiaries. To interpret this discovery, we evolve a population of 2000 triples\nusing detailed three-body simulations, 47 of which become CVs. We predict that\n20% of CVs in triples form without ever experiencing CEE, where the WD and\ndonor are brought together by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism after\nthe formation of the WD. These systems favor larger donor stars and longer\nbirth orbital periods (8-20 hrs) than typical CVs. Among systems that do\nundergo CEE, about half would not have interacted without the presence of the\ntertiary. Triple formation channels both with and without CEE require initially\nwide inner orbits ($\\gtrsim 1$ au), which in turn require larger tertiary\nseparations to be stable. Consistent with this prediction, we find that the\nobserved Gaia CV triples have wider separations on average than normal wide\nbinaries selected in the same way. Our work underscores the importance of\ntriples in shaping interacting binary populations including CVs, ultracompact\nbinaries, and low-mass X-ray binaries.",

    "abstract": "The mass of galaxy clusters estimated from weak-lensing observations is\naffected by projection effects, leading to a systematic underestimation\ncompared to the true cluster mass, varying with both mass and redshift. The\nmagnitude depends on the criteria used to select clusters and the spatial scale\nover which their mass is measured. We leverage hydrodynamical simulations of\ngalaxy clusters carried out with GadgetX and GIZMO-SIMBA as part of the Three\nHundred project. We used them to quantify weak-lensing mass biases with respect\nalso to the results from dark matter-only simulations. We also investigate how\nthe biases propagate into the richness-mass relation. We aim to shed light on\nthe effect of the presence of baryons on the weak-lensing mass bias and also\nwhether this bias depends on the galaxy formation recipe; we seek to model the\nrichness-mass relation that can be used as guidelines for observational\nexperiments for cluster cosmology. We produced weak-lensing simulations of\nrandom projections to model the expected excess surface mass density profile of\nclusters up to redshift $z=1$. We then estimated the observed richness by\ncounting the number of galaxies in a cylinder and correcting by projected\ncontaminants. We derived the weak-lensing mass-richness relation and found\nconsistency across hydrodynamical simulations. The intercept parameter of the\nrelation is independent of redshift but varies with the minimum of the stellar\nmass to define the richness. At the same time, the slope is relatively constant\nup to $z=0.55$. The scatter in observed richness at a fixed weak-lensing mass\nincreases linearly with redshift at a fixed stellar mass cut. As expected, we\nobserved that the scatter in richness at a given true mass is smaller than at a\ngiven weak-lensing mass. Our results for the weak-lensing mass-richness\nrelation align well with SDSS redMaPPer cluster analyses. [Abridged]",

Jet reconstruction in heavy ion collisions involves a\nnecessarily imperfect subtraction of the large and fluctuating underlying\nevent: reconstructed jets always include underlying event contamination.

While our calculations always predict a critical separation for\ntidal circularization at about 3-4 times the stellar radii, binaries with less\nevolved giants are observed to be circularized out to about twice as far.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of diffusion models, text-to-image(T2I) models\nhave made significant progress, showcasing impressive abilities in prompt\nfollowing and image generation. Recently launched models such as FLUX.1 and\nIdeogram2.0, along with others like Dall-E3 and Stable Diffusion 3, have\ndemonstrated exceptional performance across various complex tasks, raising\nquestions about whether T2I models are moving towards general-purpose\napplicability. Beyond traditional image generation, these models exhibit\ncapabilities across a range of fields, including controllable generation, image\nediting, video, audio, 3D, and motion generation, as well as computer vision\ntasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. However, current\nevaluation frameworks are insufficient to comprehensively assess these models'\nperformance across expanding domains. To thoroughly evaluate these models, we\ndeveloped the IMAGINE-E and tested six prominent models: FLUX.1, Ideogram2.0,\nMidjourney, Dall-E3, Stable Diffusion 3, and Jimeng. Our evaluation is divided\ninto five key domains: structured output generation, realism, and physical\nconsistency, specific domain generation, challenging scenario generation, and\nmulti-style creation tasks. This comprehensive assessment highlights each\nmodel's strengths and limitations, particularly the outstanding performance of\nFLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0 in structured and specific domain tasks, underscoring\nthe expanding applications and potential of T2I models as foundational AI\ntools.

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models\n(video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos\nremains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose\nTemporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework\ndesigned to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through\npreference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to\ndifferentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by\nleveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal\ngrounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal\ngrounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video\nsequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly\nenhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated\ndata. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding\nbenchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness\nof TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO\nestablishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark,\nunderscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for\nadvancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses\nhuman feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation\nmodel. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference\ndataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise\nannotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a\nmulti-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various\ndesign choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement\nlearning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we\nintroduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those\nfrom diffusion models. These include two training-time strategies: direct\npreference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for\nflow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies\nreward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that\nVideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO\ndemonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard\nsupervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom\nweights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video\nquality needs. Project page: https://gongyeliu.github.io/videoalign.",

Using PHOENIX\natmospheric models in a forward-model framework that fits the spectrum of the\ncompanion and diffracted starlight simultaneously, we detect HD 206893 B at\n$>8\\sigma$ significance via cross-correlation in two epochs. We find an\neffective temperature for the companion of $1634^{+72}_{-38}$ K and a log(g) of\n$4.55^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$. Only accounting for statistical uncertainties, we\nmeasure the carbon-oxygen ratio (C/O) of this companion to be $0.57 \\pm 0.02$,\nor near-solar while assuming solar metallicity. The C/O ratio we measure fits\nthe tentative trend of $>4 M_{Jup}$ companions having near-solar C/O ratios\nwhile less massive companions have greater-than-solar C/O ratios. Using\nsubstellar evolution models, we find an age of $112^{+36}_{-22}$ Myr, a mass of\n$22.7^{+2.5}_{-1.7} M_{Jup}$, and a radius of $1.11 \\pm 0.03 R_{Jup}$ for this\ncompanion. We also use KPIC radial velocity data to fit the orbit of HD 206893\nB and analyze the orbital stability of this system. We find that the orbital\nstability is relatively independent of the mass of HD 206893 B, and favors an\norbital configuration where B and its interior planetary companion, HD 206893\nc, are co-planar. The measured C/O ratio coupled with the current architecture\nof the system cannot rule out a core accretion scenario, nor a disk\nfragmentation scenario regarding the formation pathway of HD 206893 B.",

    "abstract": "Generative diffusion models are becoming one of the most popular prior in\nimage restoration (IR) tasks due to their remarkable ability to generate\nrealistic natural images. Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods\nbased on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most\nnon-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model\nto guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on\nfamilies of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks.\nThe above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability\nto handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel\nINN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image\nrestoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the\nperfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the\nstrong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically,\nwe train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation\nprocess and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to\nguide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also\nintroduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and\ninference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm\nobtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both\nquantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.",

In this work, we hypothesized that leveraging multiple CT phases for the\nquality enhancement of one phase may prove advantageous for downstream tasks,\nsuch as segmentation. A 3D progressive fusion and non-local (PFNL) network was\ndeveloped. It was trained with three degraded (low-quality) phases\n(non-contrast, arterial, and portal venous) to enhance the quality of the\nportal venous phase. Then, the effect of scan quality enhancement was evaluated\nusing a proxy task of pancreas segmentation, which is useful for tracking\npancreatic cancer. The proposed approach improved the pancreas segmentation by\n3% over the corresponding low-quality CT scan. To the best of our knowledge, we\nare the first to harness multiphase CT for scan quality enhancement and\nimproved pancreas segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Surrogate models are frequently employed as efficient substitutes for the\ncostly execution of real-world processes. However, constructing a high-quality\nsurrogate model often demands extensive data acquisition. A solution to this\nissue is to transfer pre-trained surrogate models for new tasks, provided that\ncertain invariances exist between tasks. This study focuses on transferring\nnon-differentiable surrogate models (e.g., random forests) from a source\nfunction to a target function, where we assume their domains are related by an\nunknown affine transformation, using only a limited amount of transfer data\npoints evaluated on the target. Previous research attempts to tackle this\nchallenge for differentiable models, e.g., Gaussian process regression, which\nminimizes the empirical loss on the transfer data by tuning the affine\ntransformations. In this paper, we extend the previous work to the random\nforest and assess its effectiveness on a widely-used artificial problem set -\nBlack-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) testbed, and on four real-world\ntransfer learning problems. The results highlight the significant practical\nadvantages of the proposed method, particularly in reducing both the data\nrequirements and computational costs of training surrogate models for complex\nreal-world scenarios.",

Online retail organizations like\nMicrosoft and Amazon utilize taxonomies to improve product recommendations and\noptimize advertisement by enhancing query interpretation. However, the manual\nconstruction of taxonomies requires significant human effort. As web content\ncontinues to expand at an unprecedented pace, existing taxonomies risk becoming\noutdated, struggling to incorporate new and emerging information effectively.\nAs a consequence, there is a growing need for dynamic taxonomy expansion to\nkeep them relevant and up-to-date. Existing taxonomy expansion methods often\nrely on classical word embeddings to represent entities. However, these\nembeddings fall short in capturing hierarchical polysemy, where an entity's\nmeaning can vary based on its position in the hierarchy and its surrounding\ncontext. To address this challenge, we introduce QuanTaxo, an innovative\nquantum-inspired framework for taxonomy expansion. QuanTaxo encodes entity\nrepresentations in quantum space, effectively modeling hierarchical polysemy by\nleveraging the principles of Hilbert space to capture interference effects\nbetween entities, yielding richer and more nuanced representations.\nComprehensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets show that\nQuanTaxo significantly outperforms classical embedding models, achieving\nsubstantial improvements of 18.45% in accuracy, 20.5% in Mean Reciprocal Rank,\nand 17.87% in Wu & Palmer metrics across eight classical embedding-based\nbaselines.

Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed\napproach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language\nmodels with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI\nsystems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization,\ngeneralization, and privacy remains a significant challenge.\nOver-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while\nstringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both\npersonalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially\nPrivate Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by\nleveraging a low-rank factorization scheme to capture generalization while\nmaintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization.\nTo ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local\ndifferential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and\nglobal differential privacy to the global prompt.

The\nobstructions are well-controlled flips of large half-graphs and of disjoint\nunions of many long paths. Applying this characterization, we show that on\nevery hereditary class of unbounded shrub-depth, MSO is more expressive than\nFO. This confirms a conjecture of [Gajarsk\\'y and Hlin\\v{e}n\\'y; LMCS 2015] who\nproved that on classes of bounded shrub-depth FO and MSO have the same\nexpressive power. Combined, the two results fully characterize the hereditary\nclasses on which FO and MSO coincide, answering an open question by [Elberfeld,\nGrohe, and Tantau; LICS 2012].\n  Our work is inspired by the notion of stability from model theory. A graph\nclass C is MSO-stable, if no MSO-formula can define arbitrarily long linear\norders in graphs from C. We show that a hereditary graph class is MSO-stable if\nand only if it has bounded shrub-depth.

We use very\nhigh-quality ultraviolet spectra of low-z galaxies to create mock\nhigh-redshift, low-resolution spectra complete with a damping wing resulting\nfrom the IGM and HI absorption from local, dense gas to mimic current James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the early universe. The simulated\nspectra are used to test the ability to recover the \"true\" values of the column\ndensity of the DLA (N_DLA) and the volume neutral hydrogen fraction (x_HI) of\nthe IGM through modified stellar continuum fitting. We find that the ability to\nrecover the true values of N_DLA and x_HI simultaneously is compromised by\ndegeneracies between these two parameters, and the spectral shape itself at\nlow-resolution (R~100). The root mean squared error between the recovered and\ntrue column density of the DLAs is on the order of 1 dex. This error somewhat\ndecreases with improved resolution (R~1000), but systematically underestimates\nN_DLA when Ly{\\alpha} emission is present in the mock spectra.

    "abstract": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) action grounding is a critical step in GUI\nautomation that maps language instructions to actionable elements on GUI\nscreens. Most recent works of GUI action grounding leverage large GUI datasets\nto fine-tune MLLMs. However, the fine-tuning data always covers limited GUI\nenvironments, and we find the performance of the resulting model deteriorates\nin novel environments. We argue that the GUI grounding models should be further\naligned to the novel environments to reveal their full potential, when the\ninference is known to involve novel environments, i.e., environments not used\nduring the previous fine-tuning. To realize this, we first propose GUI-Bee, an\nMLLM-based autonomous agent, to collect high-quality, environment-specific data\nthrough exploration and then continuously fine-tune GUI grounding models with\nthe collected data. Our agent leverages a novel Q-value-Incentive In-Context\nReinforcement Learning (Q-ICRL) method to optimize exploration efficiency and\ndata quality. Additionally, we introduce NovelScreenSpot, a benchmark for\ntesting how well the data can help align GUI action grounding models to novel\nenvironments and demonstrate the effectiveness of data collected by GUI-Bee in\nthe experiments. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to validate the\nQ-ICRL method in enhancing the efficiency of GUI-Bee. Project page:\nhttps://gui-bee.github.io",

Various\nradiation- and fault-tolerant methods, such as error correction codes (ECC) and\nredundancy-based approaches, have been explored over the last decades to\nmitigate temporary soft errors on software and hardware. However, conventional\nECC methods fail to deal with hard errors or permanent faults in the hardware\ncomponents. This work introduces a detection- and response-based countermeasure\nto deal with partially damaged processor chips. It recovers the processor chip\nfrom permanent faults and enables continuous operation with available undamaged\nresources on the chip. We incorporate digitally-compatible delay-based sensors\non the target processor's chip to reliably detect the incoming radiation or\nglitching attempts on the physical fabric of the chip, even before a fault\noccurs. Upon detecting a fault in one or more components of the processor's\narithmetic logic unit (ALU), our countermeasure employs adaptive software\nrecompilations to resynthesize and substitute the affected instructions with\ninstructions of still functioning components to accomplish the task.\nFurthermore, if the fault is more widespread and prevents the correct operation\nof the entire processor, our approach deploys adaptive hardware partial\nreconfigurations to replace and reroute the failed components to undamaged\nlocations of the chip. To validate our claims, we deploy a high-energy\nnear-infrared (NIR) laser beam on a RISC-V processor implemented on a 28~nm\nFPGA to emulate radiation and even hard errors by partially damaging the FPGA\nfabric. We demonstrate that our sensor can confidently detect the radiation and\ntrigger the processor testing and fault recovery mechanisms. Finally, we\ndiscuss the overhead imposed by our countermeasure.",

They have also created an interdependent fabric\nof geographically distributed process operations (clients) across these\nenterprises. Granger causality is an effective approach to detect and quantify\ninterdependencies by examining how one client's state affects others over time.\nUnderstanding these interdependencies captures how localized events, such as\nfaults and disruptions, can propagate throughout the system, possibly causing\nwidespread operational impacts. However, the large volume and complexity of\nindustrial data pose challenges in modeling these interdependencies. This paper\ndevelops a federated approach to learning Granger causality. We utilize a\nlinear state space system framework that leverages low-dimensional state\nestimates to analyze interdependencies. This addresses bandwidth limitations\nand the computational burden commonly associated with centralized data\nprocessing. We propose augmenting the client models with the Granger causality\ninformation learned by the server through a Machine Learning (ML) function. We\nexamine the co-dependence between the augmented client and server models and\nreformulate the framework as a standalone ML algorithm providing conditions for\nits sublinear and linear convergence rates. We also study the convergence of\nthe framework to a centralized oracle model. Moreover, we include a\ndifferential privacy analysis to ensure data security while preserving causal\ninsights. Using synthetic data, we conduct comprehensive experiments to\ndemonstrate the robustness of our approach to perturbations in causality, the\nscalability to the size of communication, number of clients, and the dimensions\nof raw data.

Our results indicate that the LLM-based model\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in 8 of the 11 features and performs\ncomparably in the remaining 3. Moreover, the LLM successfully classifies\nlong-tail murmur features with limited training data, a task that all previous\nmethods have failed to classify. These findings underscore the potential of\naudio LLMs as assistants to human cardiologists in enhancing heart disease\ndiagnosis.",

The first is the nucleation of failure due to\ncross-slip in critically located grains within transgranular band of localized\ndeformation, and this follows the classical Hall-Petch law that predicts a\nhigher failure stress for smaller grains. The second is the resistance to the\npropagation of a mode I crack, where grain boundaries can potentially pin a\ncrack, and this follows an inverse Hall-Petch law with higher toughness for\nlarger grains.

Unfortunately, they are also extremely\ntime-expensive. We aim to investigate the most economic way of performing this\nanalysis. We benchmark the dust characterization analysis on multi-wavelength\nobservations of two disk models. We test three different combinations of bands\n(in the 0.45 mm $\\to$ 7.46 mm range) to see how optically thick and thin\nobservations aid the reconstruction of the dust properties for different\nmorphologies and in three different dust mass regimes. We also test different\nspatial resolutions. Dust properties are robustly measured in a multi-band\nanalysis if optically thin observations are included. For typical disks, this\nrequires wavelengths longer than 3 mm. High-resolution (< 0.03\"-0.05\") is\nfundamental to resolve the changes in dust content of substructures. However,\nlower-resolution results still provide an accurate measurement of the total\ndust mass and of the level of grain growth of rings. Additionally, we propose a\nnew approach that successfully combines lower and higher resolution\nobservations in the multi-wavelength analysis without losing spatial\ninformation. We also test individually enhancing the resolution of each radial\nintensity profile with Frank but we note the presence of artifacts. Finally, we\ndiscuss on the total dust mass that we derive from the SED analyses and compare\nit with the traditional method of deriving dust masses from millimeter fluxes.\nAccurate dust mass measurements from the SED analysis can be derived by\nincluding optically thin tracers. On the other hand, single-wavelength\nflux-based masses are always underestimated by even more than one order of\nmagnitude.",

Using US-based data on\ncarbon offset potential, the amount of avoided carbon emissions from using\nrooftop PV instead of electric grid energy, and the number of existing solar\ninstallations, we surprisingly observe that locations and demographics with a\nhigher carbon offset potential have fewer existing installations. For instance,\nneighborhoods with relatively higher black population have 7.4% higher carbon\noffset potential than average but 36.7% fewer installations; lower-income\nneighborhoods have 14.7% higher potential and 47% fewer installations. We\npropose several equity- and carbon-aware solar siting strategies. In evaluating\nthese strategies, we develop Sunsight, a toolkit that combines\nsimulation/visualization tools and our relevant datasets, which we are\nreleasing publicly. Our projections show that a multi-objective siting strategy\ncan address two problems at once; namely, it can improve societal outcomes in\nterms of distributional equity and simultaneously improve the carbon-efficiency\n(i.e., climate impact) of current installation trends by up to 39.8%.",

The\nanswer depends on topological quantum numbers which specify the action of\nlattice rotations and translations in the low energy theory. One can understand\nthe topological quantum numbers as a twist of continuum gauge fields in terms\nof crystalline gauge fields. We find that disclinations and dislocations --\ndefects of crystalline symmetries -- generally lead in the continuum to a\ncertain ``emanant'' quantized magnetic flux. To demonstrate these facts, we\nstudy in detail tight-binding models whose low-energy descriptions are (2+1)D\nDirac cones. Our map from lattice to continuum defects explains the crystalline\ntopological response to disclinations and dislocations, and motivates the\nfermion crystalline equivalence principle used in the classification of\ncrystalline topological phases. When the gap closes, the presence of emanant\nflux leads to pair creation from the vacuum with the particles and\nanti-particles swirling around the defect. We compute the associated currents\nand energy density using the tools of defect conformal field theory. There is a\nrich set of renormalization group fixed points, depending on how particles\nscatter from the defect. At half flux, there is a defect conformal manifold\nleading to a continuum of possible low-energy theories. We present extensive\nnumerical evidence supporting the emanant magnetic flux at lattice defects and\nwe test our map between lattice and continuum defects in detail. We also point\nout a no-go result, which implies that a single (2+1)D Dirac cone in symmetry\nclass AII is incompatible with a commuting $C_M$ rotational symmetry with\n$(C_M)^M = +1$.",

Modeling bosonic systems relies heavily on\neffective descriptions: typical examples include truncating their\ninfinite-dimensional state space and restricting their dynamics to a simple\nclass of Hamiltonians, such as polynomials of canonical operators, which are\nused to define quantum computing over bosonic modes. However, many natural\nbosonic Hamiltonians do not belong to this simple class, and some quantum\neffects harnessed by bosonic computers inherently require infinite-dimensional\nspaces, questioning the validity of such effective descriptions of bosonic\nsystems. How can we trust results obtained with such simplifying assumptions to\ncapture real effects?\n  Driven by the increasing importance of bosonic systems for quantum\ntechnologies, we solve this outstanding problem by showing that these effective\ndescriptions do in fact capture the relevant physics of bosonic systems. Our\ntechnical contribution is twofold: firstly, we prove that any physical, bosonic\nunitary evolution can be strongly approximated by a finite-dimensional unitary\nevolution; secondly, we show that any finite-dimensional unitary evolution can\nbe generated exactly by a bosonic Hamiltonian that is a polynomial of canonical\noperators.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of electronic band gaps in halide perovskites using\ndensity functional theory is crucial for optoelectronic applications. Standard\nhybrid functionals like HSE and PBE0 are becoming computationally accessible,\nyet can fail at predicting the band gaps for three-dimensional (3D) and/or\nlayered halide perovskite. This study evaluates the doubly screened\ndielectric-dependent hybrid (DSH) functional for predicting band gaps of Pb-\nand Sn-based inorganic and hybrid 3D halide perovskites, as well as layered\nhybrid perovskites. The DSH functional employs material-dependent mixing\nparameters derived from macroscopic dielectric constants, and accurately\npredicts band gaps for 3D perovskites only if structural local disorder is\ntaken into account. For layered hybrid perovskites, the DSH functional based on\naverage dielectric constants tends to overestimate the band gaps. To improve\npredictions, we propose using the calculated dielectric constant of the\nrespective 3D perovskites to define the DSH screening. This method is then\napplied to Pb- and Sn-based layered halide perovskites with various organic\nspacers and multilayered structures, such as $BA_2MA_{n-1}Pb_{n}I_{3n-1}$ with\nn =1, 2, 3, resulting in improved precision. The HSE functional systematically\nunderestimates band gaps in layered perovskites due to the missing non-local\nlong-range dielectric screening. On the other hand, the PBE0 is in good\nagreement with the experimental values, in particular for the layered iodide\nperovskites. The computational framework introduced here provides an efficient\nparameter-free \\textit{ab initio} methodology suitable for predicting the\nelectronic properties of 3D, layered halide perovskites and their\nheterostructures, towards modelling materials for advanced optoelectronic\ndevices",

Since the seminal\n1984 work of Frankl and Pach, which established the elegant upper bound\n$\\binom{n}{d}$, this question has resisted significant progress. The best-known\nlower bound is $\\binom{n-1}{d} + \\binom{n-4}{d-2}$, obtained by Ahlswede and\nKhachatrian, leaving a substantial gap of $\\binom{n-1}{d-1}-\\binom{n-4}{d-2}$.\nDespite decades of effort, improvements to the Frankl--Pach bound have been\nincremental at best: Mubayi and Zhao introduced an $\\Omega_d(\\log{n})$\nimprovement for prime powers $d$, while Ge, Xu, Yip, Zhang, and Zhao achieved a\ngain of 1 for general $d$.\n  In this work, we provide a purely combinatorial approach that significantly\nsharpens the Frankl--Pach upper bound. Specifically, for large $n$, we\ndemonstrate that the Frankl--Pach bound can be improved to $\\binom{n}{d} -\n\\binom{n-1}{d-1} + O_d(n^{d-1 - \\frac{1}{4d-2}})=\\binom{n-1}{d}+O_d(n^{d-1 -\n\\frac{1}{4d-2}})$. This result completely removes the main term\n$\\binom{n-1}{d-1}$ from the previous gap between the known lower and upper\nbounds. It also offers fresh insights into the combinatorial structure of\nuniform set systems with small VC-dimension. In addition, the original\nErd\\H{o}s--Frankl--Pach conjecture, which sought to generalize the EKR theorem\nin the 1980s, has been disproven. We propose a new refined conjecture that\nmight establish a sturdier bridge between VC-dimension and the EKR theorem, and\nwe verify several specific cases of this conjecture, which is of independent\ninterest.",

This ``voidiness'' fraction is a rudimentary proxy for the\ndensity along the line of sight to the galaxies. The voidiness of SDSS-observed\nquasars (QSOs) is distinctly different from randomly distributed source\npopulations, with a median p-value of $4.6\\times10^{-5}$ and $\\ll\n1\\times10^{-7}$, when compared with 500 simulated populations with randomly\nsimulated locations but matching redshifts in the $0.1\\leq z<0.4$ and $0.4\\leq\nz < 0.7$ intervals, respectively. A similar comparison of the voidiness for\nLAT-detected AGN shows median p-values greater than 0.05 in each redshift\ninterval. When comparing the SDSS QSO population to the LAT-detected AGN, we\nmitigate potential bias from a relationship between redshift and voidiness by\ncomparing the LAT-detected AGN to a ``redshift-matched'' set of SDSS QSOs.

However, the design of optimal relocation policies is a\ncomplex problem, and global optimisation solutions are often limited to very\nsmall network sizes for computational reasons.

Those previous studies looked for candidate GRB neutrinos in a\nfixed (neutrino-energy-independent) time window after the GRB onset and relied\nrather crucially on crude estimates of the redshift of GRBs whose redshift has\nnot been measured. We here introduce a complementary approach to the search of\nquantum-spacetime-affected GRB neutrinos which restricts the analysis to GRBs\nof sharply known redshift, and, in a way that we argue is synergistic with\nhaving sharp information on redshift, adopts a neutrino-energy-dependent time\nwindow. We find that knowing the redshift of the GRBs strengthens the analysis\nenough to compensate for the fact that of course the restriction to GRBs of\nknown redshift reduces the number of candidate GRB neutrinos. And rather\nremarkably our estimate of the magnitude of the in-vacuo-dispersion effects is\nfully consistent with what had been found using the previous approach.

    "abstract": "Understanding the transition from atomic gas to molecular gas is critical to\nexplain the formation and evolution of molecular clouds. However, the gas\nphases involved, cold HI and CO-dark molecular gas, are challenging to directly\nobserve and physically characterize. We observed the Cygnus X star-forming\ncomplex in carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) at 274--399 MHz with the\nGreen Bank Telescope at 21 pc (48') resolution. Of the 30 deg^2 surveyed, we\ndetect line-synthesized C273alpha emission from 24 deg^2 and produce the first\nlarge-area maps of low-frequency CRRLs. The morphology of the C273alpha\nemission reveals arcs, ridges, and extended possibly sheet-like gas which are\noften on the outskirts of CO emission and likely transitioning from HI-to-H_2.\nThe typical angular separation of C273alpha and 13CO emission is 12 pc, and we\nestimate C273alpha gas densities of n_H ~ 40 - 400 cm^3. The C273alpha line\nprofiles are Gaussian and likely turbulent broadened, spanning a large range of\nFWHM from 2 to 20 km/s with a median of 10.6 km/s. Mach numbers fall within\n10--30. The turbulent timescale is relatively short, 2.6 Myr, and we deduce\nthat the turbulent pressure likely dominates the evolution of the C273alpha\ngas. Velocity offsets between C273alpha and 13CO components are apparent\nthroughout the region and have a typical value of 2.9 km/s. Two regimes have\nemerged from the data: one regime in which C273alpha and 13CO are strongly\nrelated (at N_H ~ 4 x 10^21 cm^-2), and a second, in which C273alpha emits\nindependently of the 13CO intensity. In the former regime, C273alpha may arise\nfrom the the envelopes of massive clouds (filaments), and in the latter,\nC273alpha emits from cold clumps in a more-diffuse mix of HI and H_2 gas.",

This important result has inspired\nan extensive literature, with a significant portion dedicated to constructing\nstructured random matrices with fast matrix-vector multiplication algorithms\nthat generate such embeddings for finite point sets. In this paper, we briefly\nconsider fast JL embedding matrices for {\\it infinite} subsets of\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$.

Motivated by this, we\nexplore an alternate strategy for removing this $d$-dependence from $k$ herein:\nExtending a concentration inequality proven by Ailon and Liberty\n\\cite{Ailon2008fast} in the hope of later utilizing it in a chaining argument\nto obtain a near-optimal result for infinite sets. %, and $(ii)$ utilizing a\nsimple secondary Gaussian embedding of an initial fast JL embedding of a given\ninfinite set.\n  Though this strategy ultimately fails to provide the near-optimal embedding\ndimension we seek, along the way we obtain a stronger-than-sub-exponential\nextension of the concentration inequality in \\cite{Ailon2008fast} which may be\nof independent interest.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a method that globally converges to B-stationary points\nof mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPECs) in a finite\nnumber of iterations. B-stationarity is necessary for optimality and means that\nno feasible first-order direction improves the objective. Given a feasible\npoint of an MPEC, B-stationarity can be certified by solving a linear program\nwith equilibrium constraints (LPEC) constructed at this point. The proposed\nmethod solves a sequence of LPECs, which either certify B-stationarity or\nprovide an active-set estimate for the complementarity constraints, and\nnonlinear programs (NLPs) - referred to as branch NLPs (BNLPs) - obtained by\nfixing the active set in the MPEC. A BNLP is more regular than the MPEC, easier\nto solve, and with the correct active set, its solution coincides with the\nsolution of the MPEC. The method has two phases: the first phase identifies a\nfeasible BNLP or certifies local infeasibility, and the second phase solves a\nfinite sequence of BNLPs until a B-stationary point of the MPEC is found. The\npaper provides a detailed convergence analysis and discusses implementation\ndetails. In addition, extensive numerical experiments and an open-source\nsoftware implementation are provided. The experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed method is more robust and faster than relaxation-based methods, while\nalso providing a certificate of B-stationarity without requiring the usual\ntoo-restrictive assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have intensified the debate\nsurrounding the fundamental nature of their reasoning capabilities. While\nachieving high performance on benchmarks such as GPQA and MMLU, these models\nexhibit limitations in more complex reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for\nmore rigorous evaluation methodologies. We propose a novel phenomenological\napproach that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to probe the underlying\nmechanisms of model behavior, establishing a framework that could broadly\nimpact how we analyze and understand AI systems. Using positional bias in\nmultiple-choice reasoning tasks as a case study, we demonstrate how systematic\nperturbations can reveal fundamental aspects of model decision-making. To\nanalyze these behaviors, we develop two complementary phenomenological models:\na Probabilistic Mixture Model (PMM) that decomposes model responses into\nreasoning, memorization, and guessing components and an Information-Theoretic\nConsistency (ITC) analysis that quantifies the relationship between model\nconfidence and strategy selection. Through controlled experiments on reasoning\nbenchmarks, we show that true reasoning remains challenging for current models,\nwith apparent success often relying on sophisticated combinations of\nmemorization and pattern matching rather than genuine logical deduction. More\nfundamentally, we demonstrate that accuracy alone often overstates a model's\nreasoning abilities, as model behavior can be characterized through underlying\nmechanisms in the phase space of cognitive strategies, revealing how models\ndynamically balance different approaches when responding to queries. This\nframework enables quantitative criteria for real-world deployments, allowing\napplications to specify reliability thresholds based on strategy distributions\nrather than aggregate performance metrics.",

    "abstract": "The inherent nonlinearity of the power flow equations poses significant\nchallenges in accurately modeling power systems, particularly when employing\nlinearized approximations. Although power flow linearizations provide\ncomputational efficiency, they can fail to fully capture nonlinear behavior\nacross diverse operating conditions. To improve approximation accuracy, we\npropose conservative piecewise linear approximations (CPLA) of the power flow\nequations, which are designed to consistently over- or under-estimate the\nquantity of interest, ensuring conservative behavior in optimization. The\nflexibility provided by piecewise linear functions can yield improved accuracy\nrelative to standard linear approximations. However, applying CPLA across all\ndimensions of the power flow equations could introduce significant\ncomputational complexity, especially for large-scale optimization problems. In\nthis paper, we propose a strategy that selectively targets dimensions\nexhibiting significant nonlinearities. Using a second-order sensitivity\nanalysis, we identify the directions where the power flow equations exhibit the\nmost significant curvature and tailor the CPLAs to improve accuracy in these\nspecific directions. This approach reduces the computational burden while\nmaintaining high accuracy, making it particularly well-suited for mixed-integer\nprogramming problems involving the power flow equations.",

These challenges make\nit difficult to ensure safety and reliability, as processing high-dimensional\nimage data is computationally intensive and neural networks are typically\ntreated as black boxes. To address these issues, we propose SEVIN (Scalable and\nExplainable Verification of Image-Based Neural Network Controllers), a\nframework that leverages a Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to encode\nhigh-dimensional images into a lower-dimensional, explainable latent space. By\nannotating latent variables with corresponding control actions, we generate\nconvex polytopes that serve as structured input spaces for verification,\nsignificantly reducing computational complexity and enhancing scalability.\nIntegrating the VAE's decoder with the neural network controller allows for\nformal and robustness verification using these explainable polytopes. Our\napproach also incorporates robustness verification under real-world\nperturbations by augmenting the dataset and retraining the VAE to capture\nenvironmental variations. Experimental results demonstrate that SEVIN achieves\nefficient and scalable verification while providing explainable insights into\ncontroller behavior, bridging the gap between formal verification techniques\nand practical applications in safety-critical systems.",

We prompt LLMs to generate natural language\ndescriptions from molecular SMILES strings and incorporate these often\nhallucinated descriptions into downstream classification tasks. Evaluating\nseven instruction-tuned LLMs across five datasets, we find that hallucinations\nsignificantly improve predictive accuracy for some models.

We further identify and categorize over 18,000 beneficial\nhallucinations, with structural misdescriptions emerging as the most impactful\ntype, suggesting that hallucinated statements about molecular structure may\nincrease model confidence.

    "abstract": "Online boards offer a platform for sharing and discussing content, where\ndiscussion emerges as a cascade of comments in response to a post. Branching\npoint process models offer a practical approach to modelling these cascades;\nhowever, existing models do not account for apparent features of empirical\ndata. We address this gap by illustrating the flexibility of Hawkes processes\nto model data arising from this context as well as outlining the computational\ntools needed to service this class of models. For example, the distribution of\nreplies within discussions tends to have a heavy tail. As such, a small number\nof posts and comments may generate many replies, while most generate few or\nnone, similar to `superspreading' in epidemics. Here, we propose a novel model\nfor online discussion, motivated by a dataset arising from discussions on the\nr/ireland subreddit, that accommodates such phenomena and develop a framework\nfor Bayesian inference that considers in- and out-of-sample tests for\ngoodness-of-fit. This analysis shows that discussions within this community\nfollow a circadian rhythm and are subject to moderate superspreading dynamics.\nFor example, we estimate that the expected discussion size is approximately\nfour for initial posts between 04:00 and 12:00 but approximately 2.5 from 15:00\nto 02:00. We also estimate that 58% to 62% of posts fail to generate any\ndiscussion, with 95% posterior probability.

Instead, operators are required to make use of existing\ninfrastructure more efficiently. In this regard, this paper considers the\nproblem of determining lines and frequencies in a public transit system,\nfactoring in the impact of crowding. Methodology: We introduce a novel\nformulation to address the line planning problem under crowding and propose a\nmixed-integer second-order cone programming (MI-SOCP) reformulation. Three\nvariants of the cut-and-column generation algorithm with tailored acceleration\ntechniques find near-system-optimal solutions by dynamically generating\npassenger routes and adding linear cutting planes to deal with the\nnon-linearity introduced by the crowding terms. We find integral solutions\nusing a diving heuristic. In practice, passengers may deviate from\nsystem-optimal routes. We, thus, evaluate line plans by computing a\nuser-equilibrium routing based on Wardrop's first principle. Results and\nimplications: We experimentally evaluate the performance of the proposed\napproaches on both an artificial network and the Beijing metro network. The\nresults demonstrate that our algorithm effectively scales to large-scale\ninstances involving hundreds of stations and candidate lines, and nearly 57,000\norigin-destination pairs. We find that considering crowding while developing\nline plans can significantly reduce crowding, at only a minor expense to the\ntravel time passengers experience.

The detection of this kind of celestial body has become\npossible with modern experimental techniques, inter alia, such as the Optical\nGravitational Lensing Experiment. Recently, an excess of ultra-short\nmicrolensing events with crossing times of 0.1 to 0.3 days has been reported,\nsuggesting the possible existence of sub-Earth-mass primordial black holes in\nour solar system. The primordial black hole Vulcan planetary mass hypothesis\ncould then explain the anomalous advance of Mercury's perihelion under the\ninfluence of its gravitational attraction, still remaining hidden from\nastronomers' telescopes. But in this case, it will also influence the\nperihelion advance of the other planets. To this end, I first calculate the\nmutual partial contributions to the perihelion motion of all the planets by two\ndifferent methods without Vulcan in a model of simplified solar system\nconsisting of the Sun and eight planets. Next, I include Vulcan in this model\nwithin the framework of the Newtonian theory of classical gravitation and\nanalyze Vulcan's influence on the perihelion advance of the inner planets,\nusing Vulcan parameters from my previous work. These results are compared with\nthe perihelion advances of the inner planets predicted by the theory of general\nrelativity, and with the data obtained by modern observations.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the post-inflationary dynamics of a simple\nsingle-field model with a renormalizable inflaton potential featuring a\nnear-inflection point at a field value $\\phi_0$. Due to the concave shape of\nthe scalar potential, the effective mass of the inflaton becomes imaginary\nduring as well as for some period after slow-roll inflation. As a result, in\nthe initial reheating phase, where the inflaton oscillates around its minimum\nwith a large amplitude, some field fluctuations grow exponentially; this effect\nbecomes stronger at smaller $\\phi_0$. This aspect can be analyzed using the\nFloquet theorem. We also analytically estimate the backreaction time after\nwhich the perturbations affect the evolution of the average inflaton field. In\norder to fully analyze this non-perturbative regime, we perform a (classical)\nlattice simulation, which reveals that the exponential growth of field\nfluctuations can fragment the system. This leads to a large amount of\nnon-Gaussianity at very small scales, but the equation of state remains close\nto matter-like. The evolution of the background field throughout the\nfragmentation phase can be understood using the Hartree approximation. For\nsufficiently small $\\phi_0$ soliton-like objects, called oscillons in the\nliterature, are formed. This leads to areas with high local over-density,\n$\\delta \\rho \\gg \\bar\\rho$ where $\\bar\\rho$ is the average energy density. We\nspeculate that this could lead to the formation of light primordial black\nholes, with lifetime $\\gtrsim 10^{-19} \\text{sec}$. Other possibly\nobservational consequences, in particular gravitational waves in the\n$\\text{MHz} - \\text{GHz}$ range, are discussed as well. Although a complete\nanalytical study is difficult in our case, we obtain a power law scaling for\nthe potential observables on $\\phi_0$.",

The hybrid system enables efficient use of computational resources\nwhile minimizing the overhead associated with server usage. The recently\nproposed Learning to Help (L2H) model trains a server model given a fixed local\n(client) model, differing from the Learning to Defer (L2D) framework, which\ntrains the client for a fixed (expert) server. In both L2D and L2H, the\ntraining includes learning a rejector at the client to determine when to query\nthe server. In this work, we extend the L2H model from binary to multi-class\nclassification problems and demonstrate its applicability in a number of\ndifferent scenarios of practical interest in which access to the server may be\nlimited by cost, availability, or policy. We derive a stage-switching surrogate\nloss function that is differentiable, convex, and consistent with the Bayes\nrule corresponding to the 0-1 loss for the L2H model.

    "abstract": "Resource-constrained devices such as wireless sensors and Internet of Things\n(IoT) devices have become ubiquitous in our digital ecosystem. These devices\ngenerate and handle a major part of our digital data. However, due to the\nimpending threat of quantum computers on our existing public-key cryptographic\nschemes and the limited resources available on IoT devices, it is important to\ndesign lightweight post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes suitable for these\ndevices. In this work, we explored the design space of learning with\nerror-based PQC schemes to design a lightweight key-encapsulation mechanism\n(KEM) suitable for resource-constrained devices. We have done a scrupulous and\nextensive analysis and evaluation of different design elements, such as\npolynomial size, field modulus structure, reduction algorithm, and secret and\nerror distribution of an LWE-based KEM. Our explorations led to the proposal of\na lightweight PQC-KEM, Rudraksh, without compromising security. Our scheme\nprovides security against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA) with more than 100\nbits of Core-SVP post-quantum security and belongs to the NIST-level-I security\ncategory (provide security at least as much as AES-128). We have also shown how\nASCON can be used for lightweight pseudo-random number generation and hash\nfunction in the lattice-based KEMs instead of the widely used Keccak for\nlightweight design. Our FPGA results show that Rudraksh currently requires the\nleast area among the PQC KEMs of similar security. Our implementation of\nRudraksh provides a $\\sim3\\times$ improvement in terms of the area requirement\ncompared to the state-of-the-art area-optimized implementation of Kyber, can\noperate at $63\\%$-$76\\%$ higher frequency with respect to high-throughput\nKyber, and improves time-area-product $\\sim2\\times$ compared to the\nstate-of-the-art compact implementation of Kyber published in HPEC 2022.",

In particular, we focus on the advection-dominated regime typical\nof aqueous droplets drying at room temperature and systematically investigate\nthe role of hydrodynamic interactions during this nonequilibrium process. In\ngeneral, drying produces transient particle concentration gradients within the\ndroplet in this regime, with a considerable accumulation of particles at the\ndroplet's liquid-vapor interface. We find that these gradients become\nsignificantly larger with pairwise hydrodynamic interactions between colloidal\nparticles instead of a free-draining hydrodynamic approximation; however, the\nsolvent's boundary conditions at the droplet's interface (unbounded, slip, or\nno-slip) do not have a significant effect on the particle distribution. DDFT\ncalculations leveraging radial symmetry of the drying droplet are in excellent\nagreement with particle-based simulations for free-draining hydrodynamics, but\nDDFT unexpectedly fails for pairwise hydrodynamic interactions after the\nparticle concentration increases during drying, manifesting as an ejection of\nparticles from the droplet. We hypothesize that this unphysical behavior\noriginates from an inaccurate approximation of the two-body density\ncorrelations based on the bulk pair correlation function, which we support by\nmeasuring the confined equilibrium two-body density correlations using\nparticle-based simulations.

Superconducting detectors, such as the\nsuperconducting nanowire single-photon detector, perform best when a large QP\npopulation is generated in response to small perturbations. Conversely, for\nsuperconducting qubits and topologically protected Majorana fermions, even\nrelatively small QP densities can lead to significant performance degradation,\nand thus, ideal materials are less susceptible to QP poisoning. However,\nexisting models of these devices lack a rigorous description of the QP and\nphonon dynamics, relying on approximations and phenomenology. In this article,\nwe combine kinetic equations with density functional theory to model the\nnonequilibrium dynamics of a superconducting film ab initio. To demonstrate the\nuniversality of our model, we illustrate two examples: (1) we develop a model\nfor the detection of single photons in superconducting nanowires, and (2) we\ncalculate the energy-relaxation rate of a transmon qubit due to the presence of\nexcess QPs. Our examples demonstrate from first principles that NbN is\nwell-suited for single-photon detection and that Ta transmon qubits possess\nreduced sensitivity to QP poisoning relative to other materials, which is\nlikely in part responsible for their longer coherence times. In contrast to\nprevious models, our ab initio approach makes these predictions without\nexperimental input and thus can be used to accelerate progress in device\ndevelopment. Moreover, by considering the full-bandwidth electron-phonon\ncoupling, our approach can incorporate strong-coupling effects. Our methods\neffectively integrate ab initio materials modeling with nonequilibrium theory\nof superconductivity to perform practical modeling of superconducting devices,\nproviding a comprehensive approach that connects fundamental theory with device\napplications.",

In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these\nrelativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of\nparticle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to\nrobustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and\npolarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these\nspectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase\nshift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying\nthese methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at\nabout $10\\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\\sigma$ with\nadditional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole\nTelescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model\nprediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the\ncapabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise\nphase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the\n$1\\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a fundamental quantum transport\nphenomenon that holds significant implications for spintronics and\nsuperconducting devices. However, its experimental detection and enhancement\nremain challenging. Recently, magnetic materials exhibiting $p$-wave magnetic\nordering, distinct from conventional spin-orbit coupling, referred to as\n$p$-wave magnets, have attracted considerable interest. In this work, we\npropose a junction consisting of $p$-wave magnets and a triplet superconductor\nas a promising platform to enhance CAR. The setup features a triplet\nsuperconductor sandwiched between two collinear $p$-wave magnets rotated by\n$180^\\circ$ relative to each other, allowing for precise control over transport\nprocesses. We demonstrate that CAR can dominate over electron tunneling (ET)\nwithin specific parameter regimes, such as the orientation angle of the\n$p$-wave magnets and their chemical potential. Enhanced CAR occurs when the\nconstant energy contours of the two spins in the $p$-wave magnets are\nwell-separated. Furthermore, the conductivities display Fabry-P\\'erot-type\noscillations due to interference effects, with CAR diminishing as the length of\nthe superconductor exceeds the decay length of the wavefunctions.

In the non-adaptive setting, tests are designed in\nadvance and represented by a measurement matrix $\\mM$, where rows correspond to\ntests and columns to items. A test is positive if it includes at least one\ndefective item. Traditionally, $\\mM$ remains fixed during both testing and\nrecovery. In this work, we address the case where some entries of $\\mM$ are\nmissing, yielding a missing measurement matrix $\\mG$. Our aim is to reconstruct\n$\\mM$ from $\\mG$ using available samples and their outcome vectors.\n  The above problem can be considered as a problem intersected between Boolean\nmatrix factorization and matrix completion, called the matrix completion in\ngroup testing (MCGT) problem, as follows. Given positive integers $t,s,n$, let\n$\\mY:=(y_{ij}) \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{t \\times s}$, $\\mM:=(m_{ij}) \\in \\{0,1\\}^{t \\times\nn}$, $\\mX:=(x_{ij}) \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n \\times s}$, and matrix $\\mG \\in \\{0,1 \\}^{t\n\\times n}$ be a matrix generated from matrix $\\mM$ by erasing some entries in\n$\\mM$.

Next, we show that\ncertain rows with missing entries aid recovery while others do not. For\nBernoulli measurement matrices, we establish that larger $s$ increases the\nhigher the probability that $\\mM$ can be recovered.

Most recently, these attacks have been extended to target Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs), revealing significant vulnerabilities. This new\ndevelopment naturally raises questions about the best strategies to defend GNNs\nagainst BFAs, a challenge for which no solutions currently exist. Given the\napplications of GNNs in critical fields, any defense mechanism must not only\nmaintain network performance, but also verifiably restore the network to its\npre-attack state. Verifiably restoring the network to its pre-attack state also\neliminates the need for costly evaluations on test data to ensure network\nquality. We offer first insights into the effectiveness of existing honeypot-\nand hashing-based defenses against BFAs adapted from the computer vision domain\nto GNNs, and characterize the shortcomings of these approaches. To overcome\ntheir limitations, we propose Crossfire, a hybrid approach that exploits weight\nsparsity and combines hashing and honeypots with bit-level correction of\nout-of-distribution weight elements to restore network integrity. Crossfire is\nretraining-free and does not require labeled data. Averaged over 2,160\nexperiments on six benchmark datasets, Crossfire offers a 21.8% higher\nprobability than its competitors of reconstructing a GNN attacked by a BFA to\nits pre-attack state.

Although initial observations\nsuggested that I19312 might be an evolved star, its characteristics are not\nfully consistent with this classification. This study aims to further\ninvestigate the nature of I19312 by conducting long-term monitoring of its\nmaser emissions and comparing the results with other known astrophysical\nobjects. We conducted long-term monitoring of SiO, H$_2$O, and OH maser\nemissions using single-dish radio telescopes. The results were then compared\nwith historical maser data and the characteristics of similar objects to infer\nthe possible origin of I19312. The SiO maser emissions from I19312 were\ndetected over a wide velocity range and exhibited significant time variability.\nThe OH maser lines suggest characteristics of an evolved star, while the H$_2$O\nmaser lines indicate molecular outflows. These features suggest that I19312\ncould be a candidate for a Water Fountain (WF) star, though there are\ninconsistencies, such as the large molecular gas mass, that challenge this\nhypothesis. The possibility of I19312 being a Red Nova Remnant (RNR) is also\nconsidered, but this remains speculative due to the lack of direct evidence.\nThe evolutionary stage of I19312 remains unclear, but it shares multiple\ncharacteristics with both evolved stars with peculiar properties and RNRs.\nFurther long-term monitoring and high-resolution interferometric observations\nare required to better constrain the nature of this object.",

It employs the use of\nProper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for the computation of the basis\nfunctions and the Galerkin projection for the computation of the reduced\ncoefficients. The main novelty of this work lies in the extension of the\nlifting function method, which typically is adopted for treating nonhomogeneous\ninlet velocity boundary conditions, to the handling of nonhomogeneous outlet\nboundary conditions for the pressure, representing a very delicate point in the\nnumerical simulations of the cardiovascular system. Moreover, we incorporate a\nproperly trained neural network in the ROM framework to approximate the mapping\nfrom the time parameter to the outflow pressure, which in the most general case\nis not available in closed form. We define our approach as \"hybrid\", because it\nmerges physics-based elements with data-driven ones. At full order level, a\nFinite Volume method is employed for the discretization of the unsteady\nNavier-Stokes equations while a two-element Windkessel model is adopted to\nenforce a valuable estimation of the outflow pressure.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural models have shown considerable promise in solving\nTraveling Salesman Problems (TSPs) without relying on much hand-crafted\nengineering. However, while non-autoregressive (NAR) approaches benefit from\nfaster inference through parallelism, they typically deliver solutions of\ninferior quality compared to autoregressive ones. To enhance the solution\nquality while maintaining fast inference, we propose DEITSP, a diffusion model\nwith efficient iterations tailored for TSP that operates in a NAR manner.\nFirstly, we introduce a one-step diffusion model that integrates the controlled\ndiscrete noise addition process with self-consistency enhancement, enabling\noptimal solution prediction through simultaneous denoising of multiple\nsolutions. Secondly, we design a dual-modality graph transformer to bolster the\nextraction and fusion of features from node and edge modalities, while further\naccelerating the inference with fewer layers. Thirdly, we develop an efficient\niterative strategy that alternates between adding and removing noise to improve\nexploration compared to previous diffusion methods. Additionally, we devise a\nscheduling framework to progressively refine the solution space by adjusting\nnoise levels, facilitating a smooth search for optimal solutions. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world and large-scale TSP instances demonstrate that DEITSP\nperforms favorably against existing neural approaches in terms of solution\nquality, inference latency, and generalization ability.

However, existing benchmarks often fall short, either\nlacking extensive coverage of undergraduate-level mathematical problems or\nprobably suffering from test-set contamination. To address these issues, we\nintroduce UGMathBench, a diverse and dynamic benchmark specifically designed\nfor evaluating undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning with LLMs.\nUGMathBench comprises 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics,\nfeaturing 10 distinct answer types. Each problem includes three randomized\nversions, with additional versions planned for release as leading open-source\nLLMs become saturated in UGMathBench. Furthermore, we propose two key metrics:\neffective accuracy (EAcc), which measures the percentage of correctly solved\nproblems across all three versions, and reasoning gap ($\\Delta$), which\nassesses reasoning robustness by calculating the difference between the average\naccuracy across all versions and EAcc. Our extensive evaluation of 23 leading\nLLMs reveals that the highest EAcc achieved is 56.3\\% by OpenAI-o1-mini, with\nlarge $\\Delta$ values observed across different models. This highlights the\nneed for future research aimed at developing \"large reasoning models\" with high\nEAcc and $\\Delta = 0$.

Another issue with deep learning is its high energy consumption,\nwhich is not that desirable from a sustainability perspective.\n  Therefore, alternative approaches are being considered to address these\nissues, both of which are inspired by the functioning of the human brain. One\napproach is causal learning, which takes into account causality among the items\nin the dataset on which the neural network is trained. It is expected that this\nwill help minimize the spurious correlations that are prevalent in the learned\nrepresentations of deep neural networks. The other approach is Neurochaos\nLearning, a recent development, which draws its inspiration from the nonlinear\nchaotic firing intrinsic to neurons in biological neural networks\n(brain/central nervous system). Both approaches have shown improved results\nover just deep learning alone.\n  To that end, in this position paper, we investigate how causal and neurochaos\nlearning approaches can be integrated together to produce better results,\nespecially in domains that contain linked data.

For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $V$, we say that $A$\n\\emph{dominates} $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one vertex\nof $A$. A vertex partition $\\pi = \\{V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_k\\}$ of $G$ is called a\n\\emph{transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1\n\\leq i < j \\leq k$. In this article, we study a variation of the transitive\npartition, namely the \\emph{total transitive partition}. The total transitivity\n$Tr_t(G)$ is defined as the maximum order of a vertex partition $\\pi = \\{V_1,\nV_2, \\ldots, V_k\\}$ of $G$ obtained by repeatedly removing a total dominating\nset from $G$ until no vertices remain. Thus, $V_1$ is a total dominating set of\n$G$, $V_2$ is a total dominating set of the graph $G_1 = G - V_1$, and, for $2\n\\leq i \\leq k - 1$, $V_{i+1}$ is a total dominating set in the graph $G_i = G -\n\\bigcup_{j=1}^i V_j$. A vertex partition of order $Tr_t(G)$ is called a\n$Tr_t$-partition. The \\textsc{Maximum Total Transitivity Problem} is to find a\ntotal transitive partition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts.\nFirst, we characterize split graphs with total transitivity equal to $1$ and\n$\\omega(G) - 1$. Moreover, for a split graph $G$ and $1 \\leq p \\leq \\omega(G) -\n1$, we provide necessary conditions for $Tr_t(G) = p$. Furthermore, we show\nthat the decision version of this problem is NP-complete for bipartite graphs.\nOn the positive side, we prove that this problem can be solved in linear time\nfor bipartite chain graphs. Finally, we design a polynomial-time algorithm to\nsolve the \\textsc{Maximum Total Transitivity Problem} in trees.",

RSG generates new tail features and compensates for the tail\nfeature space squeezed by SCL. Similarly, LDAM is known to introduce a larger\nmargin specifically for tail classes; we demonstrate that LDAM further bolsters\nthe model's performance on tail classes when combined with the more explicit\ndecision boundaries achieved by SCL and RSG. Furthermore, SCL can compensate\nfor the dominant class accuracy sacrificed by RSG and LDAM. Our research\nemphasises the synergy and balance among the three techniques, with each\namplifying the strengths of the others and mitigating their shortcomings. Our\nexperiment on long-tailed distribution datasets, using an end-to-end\narchitecture, yields competitive results by enhancing tail class accuracy\nwithout compromising dominant class performance, achieving a balanced\nimprovement across all classes.",

Feedback\nfrom star formation activities in return impacts the properties of the\nenvelopes, offering us a unique opportunity to investigate star formation\nprocesses. We aim to characterise the warm envelopes of proto- or young stellar\nobjects in different evolutionary stages based on the morphology and kinematics\nof the $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission and to examine their relations with star\nformation processes. Using the APEX telescope, we obtained maps of the mid-$J$\n$^{13}$CO emission with an angular size of 80\" x 80\" towards 99 massive clumps\nfrom the ATLASGAL survey. Our maps are classified based on morphological\ncomplexities, and the radial structure of the emission is characterised for\nsimple single-core sources. The velocity centroids of the emission are compared\nto small- and large-scale gas kinematics, aiming to shed light on the origin of\nenvelope kinematics. $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission is detected towards sources in all\nstages of high-mass star formation, with a detection rate of 83% for the whole\nsample. The detection rate, line width, and line peak increase with evolution,\nand the line luminosity is strongly correlated with $L_{\\mathrm{bol}}$ and\n$M_{\\mathrm{clump}}$, indicating that the excitation of $^{13}$CO(6-5) emission\nis closely related to star formation processes. In addition, the radial\ndistributions of the emission for single-core sources can be well fitted by\npower-law functions, suggesting a relatively simple envelope structure for many\nsources. As for the envelope kinematics, linear velocity gradients are common\namong the single-core sources. Our comparison of kinematics on different scales\nsuggests that the origin of the linear velocity gradients in the warm envelopes\nis complex and unclear for many sources.",

    "abstract": "Laser-induced breakdown with ultrashort laser pulses is isochoric and\ninertially confined. It is characterized by a sequence of nonlinear energy\ndeposition and hydrodynamics events such as shock wave emission and cavitation\nbubble formation. With nanosecond pulses, inertial confinement is lost\nespecially during micro- and nanobubble generation and energy deposition and\nhydrodynamic events occur concurrently. The onset of bubble expansion during\nthe laser pulse reduces peak pressure, bubble wall velocity, conversion into\nmechanical energy, and prevents shock wave formation. Here we present an\nextension of the Gilmore model of bubble dynamics in a compressible liquid that\nenables to describe the interplay between particle velocity during acoustic\ntransient emission and bubble wall acceleration in the inertial fluid at any\ndegree of confinement. Energy deposition during a finite laser pulse duration\nis encoded in the time evolution of the bubble's equilibrium radius such that\nno explicit description of phase transitions is required. The model is used to\nsimulate bubble generation, acoustic transient emission and energy partitioning\nas a function of laser pulse duration and bubble size at fixed plasma energy\ndensity and ambient pressure. It turns out that bubble formation with\nfemtosecond laser pulses is more disruptive than with nanosecond pulses. This\napplies mainly for micro- and nano-cavitation but to a lesser degree also for\nmillimeter-sized bubbles.

    "abstract": "Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets of specific\nprogramming language according to natural language descriptions. The continuous\nadvancements in deep learning, particularly pre-trained models, have empowered\nthe code generation task to achieve remarkable performance. One main challenge\nof pre-trained models for code generation is the semantic gap between natural\nlanguage requirements and source code. To address the issue, prior studies\ntypically adopt a retrieval-augmented framework for the task, where the similar\ncode snippets collected by a retrieval process can be leveraged to help\nunderstand the requirements and provide guidance for the generation process.\nHowever, there is a lack of systematic study on the application of this\nframework for code generation, including the impact of the final generated\nresults and the specific usage of the framework. In this paper, we choose three\npopular pre-trained code models, namely CodeGen, UniXcoder, and CodeT5, to\nassess the impact of the quality and utilization of retrieved code on the\nretrieval-augmented framework. Our analysis shows that the retrieval-augmented\nframework is beneficial for improving the performance of the existing\npre-trained models. We also provide suggestions on the utilization of the\nretrieval-augmented code generation framework: BM25 and Sequential Integration\nFusion are recommended due to their convenience and superior performance.\nSketch Filling Fusion, which extracts a sketch of relevant code, could help the\nmodel improve its performance further. Additionally, we conduct experiments to\ninvestigate the influence of the retrieval-augmented framework on large\nlanguage models for code generation, showing the effectiveness of the\nframework, and we discuss the trade-off between performance improvement and\ncomputational costs in each phase within the framework.",

Several recent works utilize deep\nlearning (DL) techniques to process subgraph matching queries. Most of them\nfind approximate subgraph matching results without accuracy guarantees. Unlike\nthese DL-based inexact subgraph matching methods, we propose a learning-based\nexact subgraph matching framework, called \\textit{graph neural network\n(GNN)-based anchor embedding framework} (GNN-AE). In contrast to traditional\nexact subgraph matching methods that rely on creating auxiliary summary\nstructures online for each specific query, our method indexes small feature\nsubgraphs in the data graph offline and uses GNNs to perform graph isomorphism\ntests for these indexed feature subgraphs to efficiently obtain high-quality\ncandidates. To make a tradeoff between query efficiency and index storage cost,\nwe use two types of feature subgraphs, namely anchored subgraphs and anchored\npaths. Based on the proposed techniques, we transform the exact subgraph\nmatching problem into a search problem in the embedding space. Furthermore, to\nefficiently retrieve all matches, we develop a parallel matching growth\nalgorithm and design a cost-based DFS query planning method to further improve\nthe matching growth algorithm. Extensive experiments on 6 real-world and 3\nsynthetic datasets indicate that GNN-AE is more efficient than the baselines,\nespecially outperforming the exploration-based baseline methods by up to 1--2\norders of magnitude.",

This is particularly important in\nhigh-noise environments where the communication channel significantly alters\ntransmitted signals. Sync word frame synchronization is a subcategory of\nsynchronization methods where sync words are detected through digital\ncorrelation. Despite its simplicity, this method has been overlooked in\nliterature in favor of more sophisticated and mathematically more optimal\nsolutions. In this article we employ binary sync-word correlation-based\nsynchronization to achieve near perfect frame synchronization at any noise\nlevel. The proposed architecture leverages XNOR gates, adder and comparator\ntree structures to detect sync words that are placed in front of the frames\nthrough digital correlation. The tree structures are circuit elements that\nmimic binary trees in form and provide the summation (adder tree) or the\nmaximum/minimum (comparator tree) of a set of binary numbers as output. Due to\ntheir minimalistic nature, synchronization can be implemented practically for\nvery large sync word sizes (>500 bit) with multigigabit bit rates (>20 Gbps)\nand very high accuracy (10e-5 synchronization error when the bit error rate on\nthe bitstream is close to 0.3) on commercial FPGAs.

We propose a rapid wavefront shaping scheme that transitions from\ncoordinate descent to gradient descent optimization, using the same measurement\nto update all modulation parameters simultaneously. To achieve this, we have\ndeveloped an analytical framework that expresses the gradient of the wavefront\nshaping score with respect to all modulation parameters. Although this gradient\ndepends on the unknown tissue structure, we demonstrate how it can be inferred\nfrom the optical system's measurements. Our new framework enables rapid\ninference of wavefront shaping modulations. Additionally, since the complexity\nof our algorithm does not scale with the number of modulation parameters, we\ncan achieve very high-resolution modulations, leading to better corrections in\nthicker tissue layers. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in\ncorrecting aberrations in a coherent confocal microscope.",

    "abstract": "I introduce two novel loss functions for classification in deep learning. The\ntwo loss functions extend standard cross entropy loss by regularizing it with\nminimum entropy and Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence terms. The first of the\ntwo novel loss functions is termed mixed entropy loss (MIX-ENT for short),\nwhile the second one is termed minimum entropy regularized cross-entropy loss\n(MIN-ENT for short). The MIX-ENT function introduces a regularizer that can be\nshown to be equivalent to the sum of a minimum entropy term and a K-L\ndivergence term. However, it should be noted that the K-L divergence term here\nis different from that in the standard cross-entropy loss function, in the\nsense that it swaps the roles of the target probability and the hypothesis\nprobability. The MIN-ENT function simply adds a minimum entropy regularizer to\nthe standard cross entropy loss function. In both MIX-ENT and MIN-ENT, the\nminimum entropy regularizer minimizes the entropy of the hypothesis probability\ndistribution which is output by the neural network. Experiments on the\nEMNIST-Letters dataset shows that my implementation of MIX-ENT and MIN-ENT lets\nthe VGG model climb from its previous 3rd position on the paperswithcode\nleaderboard to reach the 2nd position on the leaderboard, outperforming the\nSpinal-VGG model in so doing. Specifically, using standard cross-entropy, VGG\nachieves 95.86% while Spinal-VGG achieves 95.88% classification accuracies,\nwhereas using VGG (without Spinal-VGG) our MIN-ENT achieved 95.933%, while our\nMIX-ENT achieved 95.927% accuracies.

    "abstract": "A recurring and important task in control engineering is parameter tuning\nunder constraints, which conceptually amounts to optimization of a blackbox\nfunction accessible only through noisy evaluations. For example, in control\npractice parameters of a pre-designed controller are often tuned online in\nfeedback with a plant, and only safe parameter values should be tried, avoiding\nfor example instability. Recently, machine learning methods have been deployed\nfor this important problem, in particular, Bayesian optimization (BO). To\nhandle safety constraints, algorithms from safe BO have been utilized,\nespecially SafeOpt-type algorithms, which enjoy considerable popularity in\nlearning-based control, robotics, and adjacent fields. However, we identify two\nsignificant obstacles to practical safety. First, SafeOpt-type algorithms rely\non quantitative uncertainty bounds, and most implementations replace these by\ntheoretically unsupported heuristics. Second, the theoretically valid\nuncertainty bounds crucially depend on a quantity - the reproducing kernel\nHilbert space norm of the target function - that at present is impossible to\nreliably bound using established prior engineering knowledge. By careful\nnumerical experiments we show that these issues can indeed cause safety\nviolations. To overcome these problems, we propose Lipschitz-only Safe Bayesian\nOptimization (LoSBO), a safe BO algorithm that relies only on a known Lipschitz\nbound for its safety. Furthermore, we propose a variant (LoS-GP-UCB) that\navoids gridding of the search space and is therefore applicable even for\nmoderately high-dimensional problems.",

Purpose: To address alignment challenges and enable\nconsistent tumor segmentation across different MRI field strengths. Study type:\nRetrospective. Subjects: Nine female subjects with breast tumors were involved:\nsix histologically proven invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) and three\nfibroadenomas. Field strength/sequence: Imaging was performed at 3T and 7T\nscanners using post-contrast T1-weighted three-dimensional time-resolved\nangiography with stochastic trajectories (TWIST) sequence. Assessments: The\nmethod's performance for joint image registration and tumor segmentation was\nevaluated using several quantitative metrics, including signal-to-noise ratio\n(PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), normalized cross-correlation (NCC),\nDice coefficient, F1 score, and relative sum of squared differences (rel SSD).\nStatistical tests: The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to test the\nrelationship between the registration and segmentation metrics. Results: When\ncalculated for each subject individually, the PSNR was in a range from 27.5 to\n34.5 dB, and the SSIM was from 82.6 to 92.8%. The model achieved an NCC from\n96.4 to 99.3% and a Dice coefficient of 62.9 to 95.3%. The F1 score was between\n55.4 and 93.2% and the rel SSD was in the range of 2.0 and 7.5%. The\nsegmentation metrics Dice and F1 Score are highly correlated (0.995), while a\nmoderate correlation between NCC and SSIM (0.681) was found for registration.\nData conclusion: Initial results demonstrate that the proposed method may be\nfeasible in providing joint tumor segmentation and registration of MRI data\nacquired at different field strengths.",

In this paper, we numerically investigate the dynamics\nof dark matter utilizing the merging of self-gravitating condensates. We have\nused the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson model and identified distinct turbulent\nregimes based on the merging speed of the condensate. As a result of collision,\nwe notice the appearance of various dark soliton-mediated instabilities that\nfinally lead to the turbulent state characterized by Kolmogorov-like turbulence\nscaling \\( \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{kin}}^i \\sim k^{-5/3} \\) in the infrared and \\(\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{kin}}^i \\sim k^{-3} \\) in the ultraviolet regions. The\ncompressible spectrum suggests weak-wave turbulence. The turbulent fluctuations\nin the condensate cease as the vortices formed via soliton decay are expelled\nto the condensate's periphery, manifested in the transferring of kinetic energy\nfrom incompressible and compressible flows to the quantum pressure energy. We\nalso establish the significant role played by the self-gravitating trap in\ndetermining the distribution of compressible kinetic energy and the resulting\ndensity waves, which differ markedly from those observed in atomic condensates\nunder harmonic confinement.

Through this procedure, we obtain the system's impulse\nup to the second order for two massive objects. Similarly, we apply the forward\nscattering of the QBE to the gravitational impulse of a photon due to a massive\nobject, during which we consider the photon as the system and the massive\nobject as the environment. In this methodology, we use the QBE to compute the\ntime evolution of the momentum operator associated with the system.

Determining the Poynting flux supplied by the waves is required for\nconstraining their role in plasma heating and acceleration, as well as\nproviding a constraint for Alfv\\'en wave driven models that aim to predict\ncoronal and solar wind properties. Previous studies of the Alfv\\'enic waves in\npolar coronal holes have been able to provide a measure of energy flux for\narbitrary case studies. Here we build upon previous work and take a more\nsystematic approach, examining if there is evidence for any variation in\nvertical Poynting flux over the course of the solar cycle. We use imaging data\nfrom SDO/AIA to measure the displacements of the fine-scale structure present\nin coronal holes. It is found that the measure for vertical Poynting flux is\nbroadly similar over the solar cycle, implying a consistent contribution from\nwaves to the energy budget of the solar wind. There is variation in energy flux\nacross the measurements (around 30\\%), but this is suggested to be due to\ndifferences in the individual coronal holes rather than a feature of the solar\ncycle. Our direct estimates are in agreement with recent studies by\n\\cite{Huang_2023,Huang2024} who constrain the vertical Poynting flux through\ncomparison of predicted wind properties from Alfv\\'enic wave driven turbulence\nmodels to those observed with OMNI at 1~AU.

This\ndevelopment is linked to broader cultural and pedagogical shifts, including the\nadoption of fingering techniques that reduce hand shifts, thereby facilitating\ngreater technical precision at faster tempos. Nonetheless, my study identifies\nthe persistence of 'silent portamento' as an expressive device, allowing\nperformers to retain stylistic expression without compromising rhythmic\nintegrity.

This lowered threshold enhances\nsensitivity in the sub-GeV mass range, extending the reach for direct detection\nof low-mass dark matter. Although no excess of WIMP-like events was observed,\nthe increased sensitivity enabled a model-independent comparison between the\nexpected WIMP signal rate-based on mass limits from our data-and DAMA's\nreported modulation amplitude. Our findings strongly disfavor the DAMA signal\nas originating from WIMP interactions, fully excluding DAMA/LIBRA 3$\\sigma$\nallowed regions and providing enhanced WIMP mass limits by an order of\nmagnitude in the spin-independent model compared to previous results. In the\nspin-dependent model, cross-section upper limits were obtained in the mass\nrange [0.1-5.0] GeV/c$^2$, with additional sensitivity to sub-GeV WIMPs through\nthe inclusion of the Migdal effect.

By contrast with the previously identified `ultra-high-beta' and\n`Alfv\\'en-inhibiting' states, the newly identified `Alfv\\'en-enabling' state,\nwhich is realised when the macroscopic evolution time $\\tau$ exceeds the\nion-Larmor frequency by a $\\beta$-dependent parameter, can support linear\nAlfv\\'en waves and Alfv\\'enic turbulence because the magnetic tension\nassociated with the plasma's macroscopic magnetic field is never completely\nnegated by anisotropic pressure forces. We characterise these states in detail,\nincluding their saturated magnetic-energy spectra. The effective collision\noperator associated with the firehose fluctuations is also described; we find\nit to be well approximated in the Alfv\\'en-enabling state by a simple\nquasilinear pitch-angle scattering operator.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success by\nintegrating visual and textual modalities. However, they incur significant\ncomputational overhead due to the large number of vision tokens processed,\nlimiting their practicality in resource-constrained environments. We introduce\nLanguage-Guided Vision Token Pruning (LVPruning) for MLLMs, an effective yet\nsimple method that significantly reduces the computational burden while\npreserving model performance. LVPruning employs cross-attention modules to\ncompute the importance of vision tokens based on their interaction with\nlanguage tokens, determining which to prune. Importantly, LVPruning can be\nintegrated without modifying the original MLLM parameters, which makes\nLVPruning simple to apply or remove. Our experiments show that LVPruning can\neffectively reduce up to 90% of vision tokens by the middle layer of LLaVA-1.5,\nresulting in a 62.1% decrease in inference Tera Floating-Point Operations Per\nSecond (TFLOPs), with an average performance loss of just 0.45% across nine\nmulti-modal benchmarks.",

Most existing\nSPP estimators can estimate SPP accurately from the background noise.\nNevertheless, numerous challenges persist, including the difficulty of\naccurately estimating SPP from non-stationary noise with statistics-based\nmethods and the high latency associated with deep learning-based approaches.\nThis paper presents an improved SPP estimation approach based on deep learning\nto achieve higher SPP estimation accuracy, especially in non-stationary noise\nconditions. To promote the information extraction performance of the DNN, the\nglobal information of the observed signal and the local information of the\ndecoupled frequency bins from the observed signal are connected as hybrid\nglobal-local information. The global information is extracted by one encoder.\nThen, one decoder and two fully connected layers are used to estimate SPP from\nthe information of residual connection. To evaluate the performance of our\nproposed SPP estimator, the noise PSD estimation and speech enhancement tasks\nare performed. In contrast to existing minimum mean-square error (MMSE)-based\nnoise PSD estimation approaches, the noise PSD is estimated by the sub-optimal\nMMSE based on the current frame SPP estimate without smoothing. Directed by the\nnoise PSD estimate, a standard speech enhancement framework, the log spectral\namplitude estimator, is employed to extract clean speech from the observed\nsignal. From the experimental results, we can confirm that our proposed SPP\nestimator can achieve high noise PSD estimation accuracy and speech enhancement\nperformance while requiring low model complexity.",

In this work, we\npresent an end-to-end neural network that uses Gaussian distributions in latent\nspaces to obtain invariant representations of bags of examples. This approach\naddresses the quantification problem using deep learning, enabling the\noptimization of specific loss functions relevant to the problem and avoiding\nthe need for an intermediate classifier, tackling the quantification problem as\na direct optimization problem. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results,\nboth against traditional quantification methods and other deep learning\napproaches for quantification.

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel molecular representation through Algebraic Data Types\n(ADTs) - composite data structures formed through the combination of simpler\ntypes that obey algebraic laws. By explicitly considering how the datatype of a\nrepresentation constrains the operations which may be performed, we ensure\nmeaningful inference can be performed over generative models (programs with\nsample} and score operations). This stands in contrast to string-based\nrepresentations where string-type operations may only indirectly correspond to\nchemical and physical molecular properties, and at worst produce nonsensical\noutput. The ADT presented implements the Dietz representation for molecular\nconstitution via multigraphs and bonding systems, and uses atomic coordinate\ndata to represent 3D information and stereochemical features. This creates a\ngeneral digital molecular representation which surpasses the limitations of the\nstring-based representations and the 2D-graph based models on which they are\nbased. In addition, we present novel support for quantum information through\nrepresentation of shells, subshells, and orbitals, greatly expanding the\nrepresentational scope beyond current approaches, for instance in Molecular\nOrbital theory. The framework's capabilities are demonstrated through key\napplications: Bayesian probabilistic programming is demonstrated through\nintegration with LazyPPL, a lazy probabilistic programming library; molecules\nare made instances of a group under rotation, necessary for geometric learning\ntechniques which exploit the invariance of molecular properties under different\nrepresentations; and the framework's flexibility is demonstrated through an\nextension to model chemical reactions.

Recent research has shown better alignment of vision-language DNN\nmodels, such as CLIP, with the activity of the human ventral occipitotemporal\ncortex (VOTC) than earlier vision models, supporting the idea that language\nmodulates human visual perception. However, interpreting the results from such\ncomparisons is inherently limited due to the \"black box\" nature of DNNs. To\naddress this, we combined model-brain fitness analyses with human brain lesion\ndata to examine how disrupting the communication pathway between the visual and\nlanguage systems causally affects the ability of vision-language DNNs to\nexplain the activity of the VOTC. Across four diverse datasets, CLIP\nconsistently outperformed both label-supervised (ResNet) and unsupervised\n(MoCo) models in predicting VOTC activity. This advantage was left-lateralized,\naligning with the human language network. Analyses of the data of 33 stroke\npatients revealed that reduced white matter integrity between the VOTC and the\nlanguage region in the left angular gyrus was correlated with decreased CLIP\nperformance and increased MoCo performance, indicating a dynamic influence of\nlanguage processing on the activity of the VOTC. These findings support the\nintegration of language modulation in neurocognitive models of human vision,\nreinforcing concepts from vision-language DNN models. The sensitivity of\nmodel-brain similarity to specific brain lesions demonstrates that leveraging\nmanipulation of the human brain is a promising framework for evaluating and\ndeveloping brain-like computer models.",

Building on this work, we investigate\nfurther and demonstrate that, for a particular class of non-arithmetic\nsequences, the statistically characterized subgroup coincides with the\ncorresponding characterized subgroup. In this context it should be kept in mind\nthat statistical convergence (convergence w.r. to the ideal of natural density\nzero sets) encompasses much more sequences than usual convergence (convergence\nw.r. to the ideal of finite sets) and it had already been shown that\nstatistically characterized subgroups corresponding to arithmetic sequences can\nnot be characterized by any sequence [Das et al., Bull. Sci. Math.\n179(2):103157, 2022] and they are always of the size of the continuum. From the\nvery beginning it has been an open question as to whether statistically\ncharacterized subgroups can be small in size i.e. countably infinite.

Given the computational cost of deploying SSMs on\nresource-limited edge devices, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a technique\nwith the potential for efficient deployment of SSMs. In this work, we propose\nQMamba, one of the first PTQ frameworks to our knowledge, designed for vision\nSSMs based on the analysis of the activation distributions in SSMs. We reveal\nthat the distribution of discrete parameters exhibits long-tailed skewness and\nthe distribution of the hidden state sequence exhibits highly dynamic\nvariations. Correspondingly, we design Long-tailed Skewness Quantization (LtSQ)\nto quantize discrete parameters and Temporal Group Quantization (TGQ) to\nquantize hidden states, which reduces the quantization errors.

For many behaviors, the tendency of\nindividuals to adhere to social norms can reinforce the status quo. However,\nthese same social processes can also result in rapid, self-reinforcing change.\nInterventions may be strategically targeted to initiate endogenous social\nchange processes, often referred to as social tipping. While recent research\nhas considered how the size and targeting of such interventions impact their\neffectiveness at bringing about change, they tend to overlook constraints faced\nby policymakers, including the cost, speed, and distributional consequences of\ninterventions. To address this complexity, we introduce a game-theoretic\nframework that includes heterogeneous agents and networks of local influence.\nWe implement various targeting heuristics based on information about individual\npreferences and commonly used local network properties to identify individuals\nto incentivize. Analytical and simulation results suggest that there is a\ntrade-off between preventing backsliding among targeted individuals and\npromoting change among non-targeted individuals. Thus, where the change is\ninitiated in the population and the direction in which it propagates is\nessential to the effectiveness of interventions.

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence involves understanding the\ncognitive mechanisms underlying visual reasoning in sophisticated models like\nVision-Language Models (VLMs). How do these models integrate visual perception\nwith abstract thought, especially when reasoning across multiple images or\nrequiring fine-grained compositional understanding? Drawing inspiration from\ncognitive science, this paper introduces a structured evaluation framework\nusing diverse visual reasoning tasks-Bongard Problems (BPs) and Winoground-to\ndissect the perception-reasoning interface in VLMs. We propose three distinct\nevaluation paradigms, mirroring human problem-solving strategies: Direct Visual\nRule Learning (DVRL; holistic processing), Deductive Rule Learning (DRL; rule\nextraction and application), and Componential Analysis (CA; analytical\ndecomposition via task-agnostic textual descriptions). These paradigms\nsystematically vary cognitive load and probe processing stages. Notably, CA\nenables multi-image reasoning evaluation even for single-image architectures\nand isolates reasoning from perception by operating on textual descriptions.\nApplying this framework, we demonstrate that CA, leveraging powerful language\nmodels for reasoning over rich, independently generated descriptions, achieves\nnew state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on challenging benchmarks including\nBongard-OpenWorld, Bongard-HOI, and Winoground. Ablation studies confirm\nreasoning improves significantly when perceptual challenges are mitigated,\nrevealing a critical perception bottleneck.

A source of\nadditional power is the interaction between the supernova (SN) ejecta and a\nmassive circumstellar material (CSM). This is an important power source in Type\nIIn SNe, which show narrow spectral lines arising from the unshocked CSM, but\nnot all interacting SNe show such narrow lines. We present photometric and\nspectroscopic observations of the hydrogen-rich SN 2021irp, which is both\nluminous, with $M_{o} < -19.4$ mag, and long-lived, remaining brighter than\n$M_{o} = -18$ mag for $\\sim$ 250 d. We show that an additional energy source is\nrequired to power such a SN, and determine the nature of the source. We also\ninvestigate the properties of the pre-existing and newly formed dust associated\nwith the SN. Photometric observations show that the luminosity of the SN is an\norder of magnitude higher than typical Type II SNe and persists for much\nlonger. We detect a infrared excess attributed to dust emission. Spectra show\nmulti-component line profiles, an Fe II pseudo-continuum, and a lack of\nabsorption lines, all typical features of Type IIn SNe. We detect a narrow (<\n85 kms$^{-1}$) P-Cygni profile associated with the unshocked CSM. An asymmetry\nin emission line profiles indicates dust formation occurring from 250-300 d.\nAnalysis of the SN blackbody radius evolution indicates asymmetry in the shape\nof the emitting region. We identify the main power source of SN 2021irp as\nextensive interaction with a massive CSM, and that this CSM is distributed\nasymmetrically around the progenitor star. The infrared excess is explained\nwith emission from newly formed dust although there is also some evidence of an\nIR echo from pre-existing dust at early times.",

    "abstract": "$Z(2)$ lattice gauge theory plays an important role in the study of the\nthreshold probability of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) for a quantum code. For\ncertain QEC codes, such as the well-known Kitaev's toric/surface code, one can\nfind a mapping of the QEC decoding problem onto a statistical mechanics model\nfor a given noise model. The investigation of the threshold probability then\ncorresponds to that of the phase diagram of the mapped statistical mechanics\nmodel. This can be studied by Monte Carlo simulation of the statistical\nmechanics model. In~\\cite{Rispler}, we investigate the effects of realistic\nnoise models on the toric/surface code in two dimensions together with syndrome\nmeasurement noise and introduce the random coupled-plaquette gauge model,\n3-dimensional $Z(2) \\times Z(2)$ lattice gauge theory. This new Z(2) gauge\ntheory model captures main aspects of toric/surface code under depolarizing and\nsyndrome noise. In these proceedings, we mainly focus on the aspects of Mont\nCarlo simulation and discuss preliminary results from Monte Carlo simulations\nof mapped classes of Z(2) lattice theories.",

We assume that\nthe reward of each dimension (a.k.a. {\\em objective}) is generated\nindependently of the others. The best arm of any given objective is the arm\nwith the largest component of mean corresponding to the objective. The end goal\nis to identify the best arm of {\\em every} objective in the shortest (expected)\ntime subject to an upper bound on the probability of error (i.e.,\nfixed-confidence regime). We establish a problem-dependent lower bound on the\nlimiting growth rate of the expected stopping time, in the limit of vanishing\nerror probabilities.

    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning remains a challenging area for large language models\n(LLMs), prompting the development of math-specific LLMs such as LLEMMA,\nDeepSeekMath, and Qwen2-Math, among others. These models typically follow a\ntwo-stage training paradigm: pre-training with math-related corpora and\npost-training with problem datasets for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite\nthese efforts, the improvements in mathematical reasoning achieved through\ncontinued pre-training (CPT) are often less significant compared to those\nobtained via SFT. This study addresses this discrepancy by exploring\nalternative strategies during the pre-training phase, focusing on the use of\nproblem-solving data over general mathematical corpora. We investigate three\nprimary research questions: (1) Can problem-solving data enhance the model's\nmathematical reasoning capabilities more effectively than general mathematical\ncorpora during CPT? (2) Are synthetic data from the same source equally\neffective, and which synthesis methods are most efficient? (3) How do the\ncapabilities developed from the same problem-solving data differ between the\nCPT and SFT stages, and what factors contribute to these differences? Our\nfindings indicate that problem-solving data significantly enhances the model's\nmathematical capabilities compared to general mathematical corpora. We also\nidentify effective data synthesis methods, demonstrating that the tutorship\namplification synthesis method achieves the best performance. Furthermore,\nwhile SFT facilitates instruction-following abilities, it underperforms\ncompared to CPT with the same data, which can be partially attributed to its\npoor learning capacity for more challenging problem-solving data. These\ninsights provide valuable guidance for optimizing the mathematical reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs, culminating in our development of a powerful mathematical\nbase model called MathGPT-8B.",

FL circumvents this constraint by carrying out model training in\ndistribution. The parameters of these local models are shared intermittently\namong participants and aggregated to enhance model accuracy. This strategy has\nbeen rapidly adopted by the industry in efforts to overcome privacy and\nresource constraints in model training. However, the application of FL to\nreal-world settings brings additional challenges associated with heterogeneity\nbetween participants. Research into mitigating these difficulties in FL has\nlargely focused on only two types of heterogeneity: the unbalanced distribution\nof training data, and differences in client resources. Yet more types of\nheterogeneity are becoming relevant as the capability of FL expands to cover\nmore complex problems, from the tuning of LLMs to enabling machine learning on\nedge devices. In this work, we discuss a novel type of heterogeneity that is\nlikely to become increasingly relevant in future applications: this is\npreference heterogeneity, emerging when clients learn under multiple\nobjectives, with different importance assigned to each objective on different\nclients. In this work, we discuss the implications of this type of\nheterogeneity and propose FedPref, a first algorithm designed to facilitate\npersonalised FL in this setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nalgorithm across different problems, preference distributions and model\narchitectures. In addition, we introduce a new analytical point of view, based\non multi-objective metrics, for evaluating the performance of FL algorithms in\nthis setting beyond the traditional client-focused metrics.

Both theoretical and numerical results\nconfirm the effectiveness of our new approach. To our knowledge, our method is\nthe first one to provably handle both commission and omission outliers\nsimultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Recent approaches in hierarchical text classification (HTC) rely on the\ncapabilities of a pre-trained transformer model and exploit the label semantics\nand a graph encoder for the label hierarchy. In this paper, we introduce an\neffective hierarchical text classifier RADAr (Transformer-based Autoregressive\nDecoder Architecture) that is based only on an off-the-shelf RoBERTa\ntransformer to process the input and a custom autoregressive decoder with two\ndecoder layers for generating the classification output. Thus, unlike existing\napproaches for HTC, the encoder of RADAr has no explicit encoding of the label\nhierarchy and the decoder solely relies on the label sequences of the samples\nobserved during training. We demonstrate on three benchmark datasets that RADAr\nachieves results competitive to the state of the art with less training and\ninference time. Our model consistently performs better when organizing the\nlabel sequences from children to parents versus the inverse, as done in\nexisting HTC approaches. Our experiments show that neither the label semantics\nnor an explicit graph encoder for the hierarchy is needed. This has strong\npractical implications for HTC as the architecture has fewer requirements and\nprovides a speed-up by a factor of 2 at inference time. Moreover, training a\nseparate decoder from scratch in conjunction with fine-tuning the encoder\nallows future researchers and practitioners to exchange the encoder part as new\nmodels arise.

    "abstract": "We study the succinct representations of vertex cuts by centralized oracles\nand labeling schemes. For an undirected $n$-vertex graph $G = (V,E)$ and\ninteger parameter $f \\geq 1$, the goal is supporting vertex cut queries: Given\n$F \\subseteq V$ with $|F| \\leq f$, determine if $F$ is a vertex cut in $G$. In\nthe centralized data structure setting, it is required to preprocess $G$ into\nan $f$-vertex cut oracle that can answer such queries quickly, while occupying\nonly small space. In the labeling setting, one should assign a short label to\neach vertex in $G$, so that a cut query $F$ can be answered by merely\ninspecting the labels assigned to the vertices in $F$. While the ``$st$ cut\nvariants'' of the above problems have been extensively studied and are known to\nadmit very efficient solutions, the basic (global) ``cut query'' setting is\nessentially open (particularly for $f > 3$). This work achieves the first\nsignificant progress on these problems:\n  [$f$-Vertex Cut Labels:] Every $n$-vertex graph admits an $f$-vertex cut\nlabeling scheme, where the labels have length of $\\tilde{O}(n^{1-1/f})$ bits\n(when $f$ is polylogarithmic in $n$). This nearly matches the recent lower\nbound given by Long, Pettie and Saranurak (SODA 2025).\n  [$f$-Vertex Cut Oracles:] For $f=O(\\log n)$, every $n$-vertex graph $G$\nadmits $f$-vertex cut oracle with $\\tilde{O}(n)$ space and $\\tilde{O}(2^f)$\nquery time. We also show that our $f$-vertex cut oracles for every $1 \\leq f\n\\leq n$ are optimal up to $n^{o(1)}$ factors (conditioned on plausible\nfine-grained complexity conjectures). If $G$ is $f$-connected, i.e., when one\nis interested in \\emph{minimum} vertex cut queries, the query time improves to\n$\\tilde{O}(f^2)$, for any $1 \\leq f \\leq n$.",

In\nthis article, we introduce WFCRL (Wind Farm Control with Reinforcement\nLearning), the first open suite of multi-agent reinforcement learning\nenvironments for the wind farm control problem. WFCRL frames a cooperative\nMulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem: each turbine is an agent and\ncan learn to adjust its yaw, pitch or torque to maximize the common objective\n(e.g. the total power production of the farm). WFCRL also offers turbine load\nobservations that will allow to optimize the farm performance while limiting\nturbine structural damages. Interfaces with two state-of-the-art farm\nsimulators are implemented in WFCRL: a static simulator (FLORIS) and a dynamic\nsimulator (FAST.Farm). For each simulator, $10$ wind layouts are provided,\nincluding $5$ real wind farms. Two state-of-the-art online MARL algorithms are\nimplemented to illustrate the scaling challenges.

Our findings\nindicate that one of the tested ICF schemes better reproduces the Ne/O, S/O,\nand Ar/O trends. Ne/O ratios in HII regions display large dispersion and no\nclear dependence on O/H, suggesting that current ICF(Ne) schemes fail for these\nobjects.

The geometric Serre weight conjecture formulated by\nDiamond and Sasaki can be viewed as a geometric variant of the\nBuzzard-Diamond-Jarvis conjecture, where they have the notion of geometric\nmodularity in the sense that $\\rho$ arises from a mod $p$ Hilbert modular form\nand algebraic modularity in the sense of Buzzard-Diamond-Jarvis. Diamond and\nSasaki conjecture that if $\\rho$ is geometrically modular of weight $(k,l)\\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^\\Sigma_{\\geq 2}\\times\\mathbb{Z}^\\Sigma$ and $k$ lies in the minimal\ncone, then $\\rho$ is algebraically modular of the same weight, where $\\Sigma$\nis the set of embeddings from $F$ into $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$.

    "abstract": "Traditional Incremental Learning (IL) targets to handle sequential\nfully-supervised learning problems where novel classes emerge from time to\ntime. However, due to inherent annotation uncertainty and ambiguity, collecting\nhigh-quality annotated data in a dynamic learning system can be extremely\nexpensive. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel weakly-supervised\nlearning paradigm called Incremental Partial Label Learning (IPLL), where the\nsequentially arrived data relate to a set of candidate labels rather than the\nground truth. Technically, we develop the Prototype-Guided Disambiguation and\nReplay Algorithm (PGDR) which leverages the class prototypes as a proxy to\nmitigate two intertwined challenges in IPLL, i.e., label ambiguity and\ncatastrophic forgetting. To handle the former, PGDR encapsulates a\nmomentum-based pseudo-labeling algorithm along with prototype-guided\ninitialization, resulting in a balanced perception of classes. To alleviate\nforgetting, we develop a memory replay technique that collects\nwell-disambiguated samples while maintaining representativeness and diversity.\nBy jointly distilling knowledge from curated memory data, our framework\nexhibits a great disambiguation ability for samples of new tasks and achieves\nless forgetting of knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGDR\nachieves superior",

    "abstract": "The core of the general recommender systems lies in learning high-quality\nembedding representations of users and items to investigate their positional\nrelations in the feature space. Unfortunately, data sparsity caused by\ndifficult-to-access interaction data severely limits the effectiveness of\nrecommender systems. Faced with such a dilemma, various types of\nself-supervised learning methods have been introduced into recommender systems\nin an attempt to alleviate the data sparsity through distribution modeling or\ndata augmentation. However, most data augmentation relies on elaborate manual\ndesign, which is not only not universal, but the bloated and redundant\naugmentation process may significantly slow down model training progress. To\ntackle these limitations, we propose a novel Dual Mixing-based Recommendation\nFramework (MixRec) to empower data augmentation as we wish. Specifically, we\npropose individual mixing and collective mixing, respectively. The former aims\nto provide a new positive sample that is unique to the target (user or item)\nand to make the pair-wise recommendation loss benefit from it, while the latter\naims to portray a new sample that contains group properties in a batch. The two\nmentioned mixing mechanisms allow for data augmentation with only one parameter\nthat does not need to be set multiple times and can be done in linear time\ncomplexity. Besides, we propose the dual-mixing contrastive learning to\nmaximize the utilization of these new-constructed samples to enhance the\nconsistency between pairs of positive samples. Experimental results on four\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of MixRec in terms of\neffectiveness, simplicity, efficiency, and scalability.",

We argue that employing the\nsame activation function at every node is suboptimal and propose leveraging\ndifferent activation functions at each node to increase flexibility and\nadaptability. To achieve this, we introduce Local Control Networks (LCNs),\nwhich leverage B-spline functions to enable distinct activation curves at each\nnode.

    "abstract": "AU Mic is a very active M dwarf with an edge-on debris disk and two\ntransiting sub-Neptunes with a possible third planetary companion. The two\ntransiting planets exhibit significant transit-timing variations (TTVs) that\nare caused by the gravitational interaction between the bodies in the system.\nUsing photometrical observations taken with the CHaracterizing ExOPlanet\nSatellite (CHEOPS), our goal is to constrain the planetary radii, the orbital\ndistances and periods of AU Mic b and c. We aim to determine the superperiod of\nthe TTVs for AU Mic b and to update the transit ephemeris for both planets.\nBased on the observed TTVs, we study the possible presence of a third planet in\nthe system. We conducted high precision photometric observations with CHEOPS in\n2022 and 2023. We used Allesfitter to fit the planetary transits and to\nconstrain the planetary and orbital parameters. We combined our new\nmeasurements with results from previous years to determine the periods and\namplitudes of the TTVs. We applied dynamical modelling based on TTV\nmeasurements from the 2018-2023 period to reconstruct the perceived variations.\nThe orbital distances and periods for AU Mic b and c agree with the results\nfrom previous works. However, the values for the planetary radii deviate\nslightly from previous values, which we attribute to the effect of stellar\nspots. AU Mic c showed very strong TTVs, with transits that occurred ~80\nminutes later in 2023 than in 2021. Through dynamical analysis of the system,\nwe found that the observed TTVs can be explained by a third planet with an\norbital period of ~12.6 days and a mass of 0.203+0.022-0.024 M_E. We explored\nthe orbital geometry of the system and found that AU Mic c has a misaligned\nretrograde orbit. Due limited number of observations the exact configuration\nand planetary parameters could not be determined. Further monitoring with\nCHEOPS may improve these results.",

    "abstract": "Today's high-speed switches employ an on-chip shared packet buffer. The\nbuffer is becoming increasingly insufficient as it cannot scale with the\ngrowing switching capacity. Nonetheless, the buffer needs to face highly\nintense bursts and meet stringent performance requirements for datacenter\napplications. This imposes rigorous demand on the Buffer Management (BM)\nscheme, which dynamically allocates the buffer across queues. However, the de\nfacto BM scheme, designed over two decades ago, is ill-suited to meet the\nrequirements of today's network. In this paper, we argue that shallow-buffer\nswitches, intense bursts, along with dynamic traffic call for a highly agile BM\nthat can quickly adjust the buffer allocation as traffic changes. However, the\nagility of the current BM is fundamentally limited by its non-preemptive\nnature. Nonetheless, we find that preemptive BM, considered unrealizable in\nhistory, is now feasible on modern switch chips. We propose Occamy, a\npreemptive BM that can quickly adjust buffer allocation. Occamy utilizes the\nredundant memory bandwidth to actively reclaim and reallocate the\nover-allocated buffer. Testbed experiments and large-scale simulations show\nthat Occamy can improve the end-to-end performance by up to ~55%.",

While existing research has explored\nwhite-box attacks to some extent, the more practical and challenging black-box\nscenarios remain largely underexplored due to their inherent difficulty. In\nthis paper, we take the first step toward designing black-box adversarial\nattacks specifically targeting VLMs in AD. We identify two key challenges for\nachieving effective black-box attacks in this context: the effectiveness across\ndriving reasoning chains in AD systems and the dynamic nature of driving\nscenarios. To address this, we propose Cascading Adversarial Disruption (CAD).\nIt first introduces Decision Chain Disruption, which targets low-level\nreasoning breakdown by generating and injecting deceptive semantics, ensuring\nthe perturbations remain effective across the entire decision-making chain.\nBuilding on this, we present Risky Scene Induction, which addresses dynamic\nadaptation by leveraging a surrogate VLM to understand and construct high-level\nrisky scenarios that are likely to result in critical errors in the current\ndriving contexts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple AD VLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that CAD achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness,\nsignificantly outperforming existing methods (+13.43% on average). Moreover, we\nvalidate its practical applicability through real-world attacks on AD vehicles\npowered by VLMs, where the route completion rate drops by 61.11% and the\nvehicle crashes directly into the obstacle vehicle with adversarial patches.\nFinally, we release CADA dataset, comprising 18,808 adversarial\nvisual-question-answer pairs, to facilitate further evaluation and research in\nthis critical domain.

As the additional\nchallenge in PWM DC AC converters, the fundamental-frequency sinewave component\ninduces the \"major loop loss\" on top of the piecewise high-frequency segments,\nwhich however cannot be modelled on a switching cycle basis by any existing\nmethods. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel fundamental concept,\ninstantaneous core loss, which is the time-domain core loss observed\nexperimentally for the first time in history. Extending the reactive voltage\ncancellation concept, this work presents a method to measure the instantaneous\ncore loss, which only contains real power loss, as a function of time. Based on\nmeasurements in evaluated soft magnetic components, it was discovered that the\ndischarging stage exhibits higher core loss than the charging stage. A\nmodelling approach is then proposed to break down the major loop core loss,\ntypically an average value in the literature, into the time domain to enable\ncycle-by-cycle modelling of core losses in PWM converters.

    "abstract": "We consider an online channel scheduling problem for a single\ntransmitter-receiver pair equipped with $N$ arbitrarily varying wireless\nchannels. The transmission rates of the channels might be non-stationary and\ncould be controlled by an oblivious adversary. At every slot, incoming data\narrives at an infinite-capacity data queue located at the transmitter. A\nscheduler, which is oblivious to the current channel rates, selects one of the\n$N$ channels for transmission. At the end of the slot, the scheduler only gets\nto know the transmission rate of the selected channel. The objective is to\nminimize the queue length regret, defined as the difference between the queue\nlength at some time $T$ achieved by an online policy and the queue length\nobtained by always transmitting over the single best channel in hindsight. We\npropose a weakly adaptive Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithm for minimizing the\nqueue length regret in this setup. Unlike previous works, we do not make any\nstability assumptions about the queue or the arrival process. Hence, our result\nholds even when the queueing process is unstable. Our main observation is that\nthe queue length regret can be upper bounded by the regret of a MAB policy that\ncompetes against the best channel in hindsight uniformly over all sub-intervals\nof $[T]$. As a technical contribution of independent interest, we then propose\na weakly adaptive adversarial MAB policy which achieves\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{N}T^{\\frac{3}{4}})$ regret with high probability, implying the\nsame bound for queue length regret.",

    ],
    "abstract": "The mode-shell correspondence relates the number $I_M$ of gapless modes in\nphase space to a topological \\textit{shell invariant} $\\Ish$ defined on a close\nsurface -- the shell -- surrounding those modes, namely $I_M=I_S$. In part I,\nwe introduced the mode-shell correspondence for zero-modes of chiral symmetric\nHamiltonians (class AIII). In this part II, we extend the correspondence to\narbitrary dimension and to both symmetry classes A and AIII. This allows us to\ninclude, in particular, $1D$-unidirectional edge modes of Chern insulators,\nmassless $2D$-Dirac and $3D$-Weyl cones, within the same formalism. We provide\nan expression of $I_M$ that only depends on the dimension of the dispersion\nrelation of the gapless mode, and does not require a translation invariance.\nThen, we show that the topology of the shell (a circle, a sphere, a torus),\nthat must account for the spreading of the gapless mode in phase space, yields\nspecific expressions of the shell index. Semi-classical expressions of those\nshell indices are also derived and reduce to either Chern or winding numbers\ndepending on the parity of the mode's dimension. In that way, the mode-shell\ncorrespondence provides a unified and systematic topological description of\nboth bulk and boundary gapless modes in any dimension, and in particular\nincludes the bulk-boundary correspondence. We illustrate the generality of the\ntheory by analyzing several models of semimetals and insulators, both on\nlattices and in the continuum, and also discuss weak and higher-order\ntopological phases within this framework. Although this paper is a continuation\nof Part I, the content remains sufficiently independent to be mostly read\nseparately.",

    "abstract": "Surnames often convey implicit markers of social status, wealth, and lineage,\nshaping perceptions in ways that can perpetuate systemic biases and\nintergenerational inequality. This study is the first of its kind to\ninvestigate whether and how surnames influence AI-driven decision-making,\nfocusing on their effects across key areas such as hiring recommendations,\nleadership appointments, and loan approvals. Using 72,000 evaluations of 600\nsurnames from the United States and Thailand, two countries with distinct\nsociohistorical contexts and surname conventions, we classify names into four\ncategories: Rich, Legacy, Normal, and phonetically similar Variant groups. Our\nfindings show that elite surnames consistently increase AI-generated\nperceptions of power, intelligence, and wealth, which in turn influence\nAI-driven decisions in high-stakes contexts. Mediation analysis reveals\nperceived intelligence as a key mechanism through which surname biases\ninfluence AI decision-making process. While providing objective qualifications\nalongside surnames mitigates most of these biases, it does not eliminate them\nentirely, especially in contexts where candidate credentials are low. These\nfindings highlight the need for fairness-aware algorithms and robust policy\nmeasures to prevent AI systems from reinforcing systemic inequalities tied to\nsurnames, an often-overlooked bias compared to more salient characteristics\nsuch as race and gender. Our work calls for a critical reassessment of\nalgorithmic accountability and its broader societal impact, particularly in\nsystems designed to uphold meritocratic principles while counteracting the\nperpetuation of intergenerational privilege.",

However, there are still issues, such as\nfurther improvement of relaxation and decoherence time, stabilization of\nvalley-splitting control, and reduction of the variation caused by the\nroughness of the interface. In this study, new measures are proposed to address\nthese three issues. Instead of confining an electron to the minimum energy\npoint $X_0$ of the conduction band along the band structure $\\Gamma-\\Delta-X$\nin (001) Si crystals, we propose confining an electron to the L point along\n$\\Gamma-\\Lambda-L$ in (111) Si crystals. At the $X_0$ point, the symmetry\ncauses spin-orbit interaction to act on the electron, and the sixfold\ndegeneracy is lifted into a fourfold and a twofold, and the valley-splitting of\nthe twofold conflicts with the two-level system. In the symmetry of the $L$\npoint, substantial spin polarization disappears, facilitating the reduction of\nthe spin-orbit interaction, and the fourfold degeneracy is lifted to threefold\nand single, and the single becomes ground state. The need to increase the\nmagnitude of the valley-splitting is exempt, allowing the electron to be\ncontrolled away from the interface, which is expected to reduce the variation\ncaused by the roughness of the interface. Data on the confinement of an\nelectron to the $L$ point and the control of fourfold degeneracy are needed,\nand it is hoped that prototype silicon spin qubits constructed on (111) Si\ncrystals will be developed and that the proposed device structure will help\nimplement quantum computers based on Si devices.",

Unlike Passive Object\nTracking (POT), which relies on static camera viewpoints to detect and track\nobjects across consecutive frames, Active Object Tracking (AOT) requires a\ncontroller agent to actively adjust its viewpoint to maintain visual contact\nwith a moving target in complex environments. Existing AOT solutions are\npredominantly single-agent-based, which struggle in dynamic and complex\nscenarios due to limited information gathering and processing capabilities,\noften resulting in suboptimal decision-making. Alleviating these limitations\nnecessitates the development of a multi-agent system where different agents\nperform distinct roles and collaborate to enhance learning and robustness in\ndynamic and complex environments. Although some multi-agent approaches exist\nfor AOT, they typically rely on external auxiliary agents, which require\nadditional devices, making them costly. In contrast, we introduce the\nCollaborative System for Active Object Tracking (CSAOT), a method that\nleverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) and a Mixture of\nExperts (MoE) framework to enable multiple agents to operate on a single\ndevice, thereby improving tracking performance and reducing costs.

Here, we present and discuss two different implementations of heliometric\nstereo on two separate instruments, a single detector SHeM and a\nmultiple-detector SHeM. Both implementations show good accuracy (5% and 10%\nrespectively) for recovering the shape of a surface. Additionally, we discuss\nwhere heliometric stereo is most applicable, identify contrast features that\ncan limit its accuracy, and discuss how to mitigate these limitations with\ncareful design and sample choices that be readily implemented on current\ninstruments.",

These covariate effects are often found to be either\ntime-varying, heterogeneous - such as being specific to patients, treatments,\nor subgroups - or exhibit both characteristics simultaneously. While the\nstandard model, the Cox proportional hazards model, allows neither time-varying\nnor heterogeneous effects, several extensions to the Cox model as well as\nalternative modeling frameworks have been introduced. However, no unified\nframework for incorporating heterogeneously time-varying effects of covariates\nhas been proposed yet. Such effects occur when a covariate influences survival\nnot only in a heterogeneous and time-varying manner, but when the\ntime-variation is also heterogeneous. We propose to model such effects by\nintroducing heterogeneously time-varying coefficients to piecewise exponential\nadditive mixed models. We deploy functional random effects, also known as\nfactor smooths, to model such coefficients as the interaction effect of\nheterogeneity and time-variation. Our approach allows for non-linear\ntime-effects due to being based on penalized splines and uses an efficient\nrandom effects basis to model the heterogeneity. Using a penalized basis\nprevents overfitting in case of absence of such effects. In addition, the\npenalization mostly solves the problem of choosing the number of intervals\nwhich is usually present in unregularized piecewise exponential approaches.

The second\ncomponent incorporates a bridge-building technique that bypasses redundant\nintermediate layers, maintaining inference and making up the additional\ncomputational overhead introduced by the dual-branch structure. Experiments on\nvarious benchmarks and datasets showed that our algorithm outperforms the\noriginal HNSW in both accuracy and speed. We evaluated six datasets across\nComputer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), showing recall\nimprovements of 18\\% in NLP, and up to 30\\% in CV tasks while reducing the\nconstruction time by up to 20\\% and maintaining the inference speed. We did not\nobserve any trade-offs in our algorithm. Ablation studies revealed that\nLID-based insertion had the greatest impact on performance, followed by the\ndual-branch structure and bridge-building components.",

Its relic outer lobes are separated by about 3' in\nthe sky, corresponding to ~1 Mpc projected linear size. Inside this large-scale\nstructure, the inner pair of collinear lobes span about 100 kpc. In the\narcsec-resolution radio images of J0028+0035, there is a central radio feature\nthat offers the intriguing possibility of being resolved into a pc-scale, third\npair of innermost lobes. This would make this radio galaxy a rare triple-double\nsource where traces of three distinct episodes of radio activity could be\nobserved. To reveal the compact radio structure of the central component, we\nconducted observation with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometer\nNetwork and the enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network.\nOur 1.66 GHz image with high (~5 milliarcsec) resolution shows a compact\ncentral radio core with no indication of a third, innermost double feature.

Aim: While previous research has explored software\nmetrics (SMs) such as size, complexity, and quality for assessing MSAs, the\npotential of graph-specific metrics like network centrality remains largely\nunexplored. This study investigates whether centrality metrics (CMs) can\nprovide new insights into MSA quality and facilitate the detection of\narchitectural anti-patterns, complementing or extending traditional SMs.\nMethod: We analyzed 24 open-source MSA projects, reconstructing their\narchitectures to study 53 microservices. We measured SMs and CMs for each\nmicroservice and tested their correlation to determine the relationship between\nthese metric types. Results and Conclusion: Among 902 computed metric\ncorrelations, we found weak to moderate correlation in 282 cases. These\nfindings suggest that centrality metrics offer a novel perspective for\nunderstanding MSA properties. Specifically, ratio-based centrality metrics show\npromise for detecting specific anti-patterns, while subgraph centrality needs\nfurther investigation for its applicability in architectural assessments.",

This scenario is\nparticularly relevant in real-world applications where data privacy, storage\nlimitations, or labeling costs are significant concerns. Key challenges in\nSFADA include selecting the most informative samples from the target domain for\nlabeling, effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled target data, and\nadapting the model without relying on source domain information. Additionally,\nexisting methods often struggle with noisy or outlier samples and may require\nimpractical progressive labeling during training. To effectively select more\ninformative samples without frequently requesting human annotations, we propose\nthe Propensity-driven Uncertainty Learning (ProULearn) framework. ProULearn\nutilizes a novel homogeneity propensity estimation mechanism combined with\ncorrelation index calculation to evaluate feature-level relationships. This\napproach enables the identification of representative and challenging samples\nwhile avoiding noisy outliers. Additionally, we develop a central correlation\nloss to refine pseudo-labels and create compact class distributions during\nadaptation. In this way, ProULearn effectively bridges the domain gap and\nmaximizes adaptation performance. The principles of informative sample\nselection underlying ProULearn have broad implications beyond SFADA, offering\nbenefits across various deep learning tasks where identifying key data points\nor features is crucial.

    "abstract": "Integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication has been recognized\nas a key pillar of 6G and beyond networks. In line with AI-native 6G vision,\nexplainability and robustness in AI-driven systems are critical for\nestablishing trust and ensuring reliable performance in diverse and evolving\nenvironments. This paper addresses these challenges by developing a robust and\nexplainable deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment engine (BAE) for\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The\nproposed convolutional neural network (CNN)-based BAE utilizes received signal\nstrength indicator (RSSI) measurements over a set of wide beams to accurately\npredict the best narrow beam for each UE, significantly reducing the overhead\nassociated with exhaustive codebook-based narrow beam sweeping for initial\naccess (IA) and data transmission. To ensure transparency and resilience, the\nDeep k-Nearest Neighbors (DkNN) algorithm is employed to assess the internal\nrepresentations of the network via nearest neighbor approach, providing\nhuman-interpretable explanations and confidence metrics for detecting\nout-of-distribution inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nDL-based BAE exhibits robustness to measurement noise, reduces beam training\noverhead by 75% compared to the exhaustive search while maintaining\nnear-optimal performance in terms of spectral efficiency. Moreover, the\nproposed framework improves outlier detection robustness by up to 5x and offers\nclearer insights into beam prediction decisions compared to traditional\nsoftmax-based classifiers.",

However, in reality, due to\ndifferent abstractions and the large number of models in model hubs, it is not\neasy for users to review model descriptions and example images, choosing which\nmodel best meets their needs. Therefore, it is necessary to describe model\nfunctionality wisely so that future users can efficiently search for the most\nsuitable model for their needs. Efforts to address this issue remain limited.\nIn this paper, we propose Conditional Generative Model Identification (CGI),\nwhich aims to provide an effective way to identify the most suitable model\nusing user-provided example images rather than requiring users to manually\nreview a large number of models with example images. To address this problem,\nwe propose the PromptBased Model Identification (PMI) , which can adequately\ndescribe model functionality and precisely match requirements with\nspecifications. To evaluate PMI approach and promote related research, we\nprovide a benchmark comprising 65 models and 9100 identification tasks.\nExtensive experimental and human evaluation results demonstrate that PMI is\neffective.

Accurate estimations of the energy\nradiated during the prompt phase require taking into account the geometry of\nGRB jets, which remains poorly known.

Our core idea is using the K-means\nquantizer with specified cluster numbers to decouple language and phoneme\ninformation for masked prediction. Specifically, in the language quantization,\nconsidering that the number of languages is significantly different from other\nirrelevant features (e.g., speakers), we assign the cluster number to match the\nnumber of languages, explicitly decoupling shallow layers' language-related\ninformation from irrelevant features. This strategy is also applied to\ndecoupling middle layers' phoneme and word features. In a self-supervised\nscenario, experiments on the CommonVoice dataset demonstrate that DQ-Data2vec\nachieves a relative reduction of 9.51% in phoneme error rate (PER) and 11.58%\nin word error rate (WER) compared to data2vec and UniData2vec.

However, recent research in the SNN domain has mainly focused on\nenhancing accuracy by designing large-scale Transformer structures, which\ntypically rely on substantial computational resources, limiting their\ndeployment on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this challenge, we\npropose a quantized spike-driven Transformer baseline (QSD-Transformer), which\nachieves reduced resource demands by utilizing a low bit-width parameter.\nRegrettably, the QSD-Transformer often suffers from severe performance\ndegradation. In this paper, we first conduct empirical analysis and find that\nthe bimodal distribution of quantized spike-driven self-attention (Q-SDSA)\nleads to spike information distortion (SID) during quantization, causing\nsignificant performance degradation. To mitigate this issue, we take\ninspiration from mutual information entropy and propose a bi-level optimization\nstrategy to rectify the information distribution in Q-SDSA. Specifically, at\nthe lower level, we introduce an information-enhanced LIF to rectify the\ninformation distribution in Q-SDSA. At the upper level, we propose a\nfine-grained distillation scheme for the QSD-Transformer to align the\ndistribution in Q-SDSA with that in the counterpart ANN. By integrating the\nbi-level optimization strategy, the QSD-Transformer can attain enhanced energy\nefficiency without sacrificing its high-performance advantage. For instance,\nwhen compared to the prior SNN benchmark on ImageNet, the QSD-Transformer\nachieves 80.3% top-1 accuracy, accompanied by significant reductions of\n6.0$\\times$ and 8.1$\\times$ in power consumption and model size, respectively.\nCode is available at https://github.com/bollossom/QSD-Transformer.",

For example, when we ask an LLM to recall\nthe line preceding \"O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave\" in the U.S.\nNational Anthem, it often fails to correctly return \"Gave proof through the\nnight that our flag was still there\" - this is due to the reversal curse.

While the reversal curse is often viewed as a limitation, we offer\nevidence of an alternative view: it is not always an obstacle in practice.

In contrast with the\nusual exchange interaction, the $q^2$ term persists at the strong external\nmagnetic field limit. Using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for\nmicromagnetic calculations, we show that the minimum energy configuration of\nthis model exhibits skyrmion properties. Furthermore, this configuration\nremains stable under small linear radially symmetric perturbations, and we\ndemonstrate that the total energy of the system is bounded from below, ensuring\nthat it remains above the vacuum energy. This implies a topologically protected\nconfiguration.

Second, Mamba's unique parallel scan\nfurther amplifies these outliers, leading to uneven and heavy-tailed data\ndistributions. Third, even with the application of the Hadamard transform, the\nvariance across channels in weights and activations still remains inconsistent.\nTo these ends, we propose MambaQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ)\nframework consisting of: 1) Karhunen-Loeve Transformation (KLT) enhanced\nrotation, rendering the rotation matrix adaptable to diverse channel\ndistributions. 2) Smooth-Fused rotation, which equalizes channel variances and\ncan merge additional parameters into model weights.

We then show that a variation of\nthe quantum Cheshire cat experiment and Hardy's paradox are equivalent and\npropose a class of experiments that generalizes both experiments. We show that\nthe weak values of the products of projection operators allow us to get the\nweak value of each projection operator, implying that the weak value of the\nproduct of projection operators includes the entire information about the weak\nvalues in the system. In nature, interactions can only be acted between a pair\nof particles. We show how to realize quantum systems of multiwise interacted\nqubits, i.e., interactions that come in groups of n>2 qubits. In this way, we\nare able to propose unique quantum systems that consist of interacted groups of\nentangled states.

Our work is based on the assumption that\nthe frequency spectrum provides a global perspective on the composition of\nseries across various frequencies and is highly suitable for robust\nrepresentation learning. Specifically, we first convert time series into the\ncomplex frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The\nTransformer architecture is then applied to the frequency spectra to capture\ncross-variate dependencies, with the real and imaginary parts processed\nindependently. However, we observe that the vanilla attention matrix exhibits a\nlow-rank characteristic, thus limiting representation diversity. This could be\nattributed to the inherent sparsity of the frequency domain and the\nstrong-value-focused nature of Softmax in vanilla attention. To address this,\nwe enhance the vanilla attention mechanism by introducing an additional\nlearnable matrix to the original attention matrix, followed by row-wise L1\nnormalization. Theoretical analysis~demonstrates that this enhanced attention\nmechanism improves both feature diversity and gradient flow. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that FreEformer consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models on eighteen real-world benchmarks covering electricity,\ntraffic, weather, healthcare and finance.

Aiming at the shortcomings of the traditional Transformer\nmodel in capturing deep semantic relationships and optimizing computational\ncomplexity, this paper introduces a multi-level attention mechanism and a\ncontrastive learning strategy. The multi-level attention mechanism effectively\nmodels the global semantics and local features in the text by combining global\nattention with local attention; the contrastive learning strategy enhances the\nmodel's ability to distinguish between different categories by constructing\npositive and negative sample pairs while improving the classification effect.\nIn addition, in order to improve the training and inference efficiency of the\nmodel on large-scale text data, this paper designs a lightweight module to\noptimize the feature transformation process and reduce the computational cost.\nExperimental results on the dataset show that the improved Transformer model\noutperforms the comparative models such as BiLSTM, CNN, standard Transformer,\nand BERT in terms of classification accuracy, F1 score, and recall rate,\nshowing stronger semantic representation ability and generalization\nperformance. The method proposed in this paper provides a new idea for\nalgorithm optimization in the field of text classification and has good\napplication potential and practical value.

This approach aims to jointly learn\nthree encoders for processing visual images, locomotion states, and control\nactions by aligning the locomotion states with the fused features of visual\nimages and control actions within a contrastive learning framework. The\ncausation behind this alignment strategy is that the inertial locomotion state\nis the result of taking a certain control action under the current\nlandform/terrain condition perceived by visual sensors. In experiments, we\npre-train the MCRL4OR with a large-scale off-road driving dataset and adopt the\nlearned multimodal representations for various downstream perception tasks in\noff-road driving scenarios.

The major\nchallenge in LLM quantization is that uneven and heavy-tailed data\ndistributions can expand the quantization range, thereby reducing bit precision\nfor most values. Recent methods attempt to eliminate outliers and balance\ninter-channel differences by employing linear transformations; however, they\nremain heuristic and are often overlook optimizing the data distribution across\nthe entire quantization space.In this paper, we introduce Quantization Space\nUtilization Rate (QSUR), a novel metric that effectively assesses the\nquantizability of transformed data by measuring the space utilization of the\ndata in the quantization space. We complement QSUR with mathematical\nderivations that examine the effects and limitations of various\ntransformations, guiding our development of Orthogonal and Scaling\nTransformation-based Quantization (OSTQuant). OSQuant employs a learnable\nequivalent transformation, consisting of an orthogonal transformation and a\nscaling transformation, to optimize the distributions of weights and\nactivations across the entire quantization space. Futhermore, we propose the\nKL-Top loss function, designed to mitigate noise during optimization while\nretaining richer semantic information within the limited calibration data\nimposed by PTQ. OSTQuant outperforms existing work on various LLMs and\nbenchmarks. In the W4-only setting, it retains 99.5\\% of the floating-point\naccuracy.

Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the\nlimitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric\nprediction methods has reached a plateau. In this paper, we introduce an\nInfrastructure-to-Everything (I2X) collaborative prediction scheme. In this\nscheme, roadside units (RSUs) independently forecast the future trajectories of\nall vehicles and transmit these predictions unidirectionally to subscribing\nvehicles. Building on this scheme, we propose I2XTraj, a dedicated\ninfrastructure-based trajectory prediction model. I2XTraj leverages real-time\ntraffic signal states, prior maneuver strategy knowledge, and multi-agent\ninteractions to generate accurate, joint multi-modal trajectory prediction.\nFirst, a continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process\nreal-time traffic signals to guide trajectory proposal generation under varied\nintersection configurations. Second, a driving strategy awareness mechanism\nestimates the joint distribution of maneuver strategies by integrating spatial\npriors of intersection areas with dynamic vehicle states, enabling coverage of\nthe full set of feasible maneuvers. Third, a spatial-temporal-mode attention\nnetwork models multi-agent interactions to refine and adjust joint trajectory\noutputs.Finally, I2XTraj is evaluated on two real-world datasets of signalized\nintersections, the V2X-Seq and the SinD drone dataset.

They exhibit high\ndata efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for\ninteratomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to\nthese models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts\ntwo dense feature vectors with a highly-structured sparse tensor to produce a\ndense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for\ntypical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We\nintroduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides\nsignificant speedups over the best existing open and closed-source\nimplementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully\nmanaging the limited GPU shared memory through static analysis at model\ncompile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor\nproduct into a series of smaller kernels with operands that fit entirely into\nregisters, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that\nmaximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a\nsubsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global\nmemory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide\noptimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel\nidentity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic\nforces.

The broadband X-ray spectrum can be\ninterpreted as a patchy absorber partially covering the primary emission, a\nwarm and hot coronal emission or a relativistically blurred reflection along\nwith the primary emission. The fractional r.m.s has a non-monotonic behavior\nwith energy for segments of lengths 3 and 6 ksecs. For each spectral model, we\nconsider every pair of spectral parameters and fit the predicted r.m.s with the\nobserved ones, to get the pair which provides the best fit. We find that a\nvariation in at least two parameters is required for all spectral\ninterpretations. For both time segments, variations in the covering fraction of\nthe absorber and the primary power law index gives the best result for the\npartial covering model, while a variation in the normalization and spectral\nindex of the warm component gives the best fit in the two corona\ninterpretation. For the reflection model, the best fit parameters are different\nfor the two time segment lengths, and the results suggests that more than two\nparameters are required to explain the data. This, combined with the extreme\nvalues of emissivity index and reflection fraction parameters obtained from the\nspectral analysis, indicates that the blurred reflection model might not be a\nsuitable explanation for the Mrk 335 spectrum.

In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of\ncurrent attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which\nintegrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring\nprocess. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and\ncan be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive\npower of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking\nDistance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors\nfor node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and\nconstraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based\nscoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed\nKAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline\nfunctions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments\non both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show\nthat KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original\ncounterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.",

Ab initio DFT calculations of\nelectronic structure and atomistic simulations of finite-temperature magnetism\nsupported the analysis and interpretation of experimental results. The\nmagnetization measurements at high pressures provided the first direct\nexperimental evidence of the pressure-induced suppression of ferromagnetism.

To solve\nthe new task, we propose a federated multimodal instruction tuning\nframework(Pilot). Our framework integrates two stages of \"adapter on adapter\"\ninto the connector of the vision encoder and the LLM. In stage 1, we extract\ntask-specific features and client-specific features from visual information. In\nstage 2, we build the cross-task Mixture-of-Adapters(CT-MoA) module to perform\ncross-task interaction. Each client can not only capture personalized\ninformation of local data and learn task-related multimodal information, but\nalso learn general knowledge from other tasks. In addition, we introduce an\nadaptive parameter aggregation strategy for text training parameters, which\noptimizes parameter aggregation by calculating weights based on the euclidean\ndistance between parameters, so that parameter aggregation can benefit from\npositive effects to the greatest extent while effectively reducing negative\neffects. Our framework can collaboratively exploit distributed data from\ndifferent local clients to learn cross-task knowledge without being affected by\nthe task heterogeneity during instruction tuning. The effectiveness of our\nmethod is verified in two different cross-task scenarios.",

Our findings reveal that the\nelectrical conductivity and, consequently, the power factor exhibit an\nincreasing trend with expanding ribbon length and width.

Remarkably, the Seebeck\ncoefficient at the Fermi energy corresponding to the maximum power factor\nremains nearly constant across different widths, lengths, temperatures and\ntransport regimes. Furthermore, the thermoelectric figure of merit demonstrates\na positive correlation with both ribbon length and width. In narrow widths and\nlengths around 1000 nm, the power factor and figure of merit exhibit an upward\ntrend with ribbon width. However, with further increases in ribbon width, the\ninfluence of line edge roughness on thermal conductivity diminishes.\nConsequently, the figure of merit decreases due to the rise in thermal\nconductivity.

In the first stage, we\nreplace the standard exponential function with the more numerically stable\nSoftplus activation and introduce a dynamic scale factor based on invariance\nentropy, creating a novel attention mechanism that outperforms conventional\nSoftmax attention.

This enables the model to concentrate more effectively\non relevant tokens and fundamentally improves length extrapolation. When\ncombined, this two-stage approach ensures numerical stability and dramatically\nimproves length extrapolation, maintaining a nearly constant validation loss at\n16$\\times$ the training length while achieving superior results on challenging\nlong-context retrieval tasks and standard downstream benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised landslide extraction aims to identify landslide regions\nfrom remote sensing data using models trained with weak labels, particularly\nimage-level labels. However, it is often challenged by the imprecise boundaries\nof the extracted objects due to the lack of pixel-wise supervision and the\nproperties of landslide objects. To tackle these issues, we propose a simple\nyet effective method by auto-prompting the Segment Anything Model (SAM), i.e.,\nAPSAM. Instead of depending on high-quality class activation maps (CAMs) for\npseudo-labeling or fine-tuning SAM, our method directly yields fine-grained\nsegmentation masks from SAM inference through prompt engineering. Specifically,\nit adaptively generates hybrid prompts from the CAMs obtained by an object\nlocalization network. To provide sufficient information for SAM prompting, an\nadaptive prompt generation (APG) algorithm is designed to fully leverage the\nvisual patterns of CAMs, enabling the efficient generation of pseudo-masks for\nlandslide extraction. These informative prompts are able to identify the extent\nof landslide areas (box prompts) and denote the centers of landslide objects\n(point prompts), guiding SAM in landslide segmentation. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution aerial and satellite datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method, achieving improvements of at least 3.0\\% in F1 score and 3.69\\% in\nIoU compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANN) has been gaining\nattention along with the latest machine learning researches employing ANNs. If\nthe data is too large to fit in memory, it is necessary to search for the most\nsimilar vectors to a given query vector from the data stored in storage\ndevices, not from that in memory. The storage device such as NAND flash memory\nhas larger capacity than the memory device such as DRAM, but they also have\nlarger latency to read data. Therefore, ANN methods for storage require\ncompletely different approaches from conventional in-memory ANN methods. Since\nthe approximation that the time required for search is determined only by the\namount of data fetched from storage holds under reasonable assumptions, our\ngoal is to minimize it while maximizing recall. For partitioning-based ANNs,\nvectors are partitioned into clusters in the index building phase. In the\nsearch phase, some of the clusters are chosen, the vectors in the chosen\nclusters are fetched from storage, and the nearest vector is retrieved from the\nfetched vectors. Thus, the key point is to accurately select the clusters\ncontaining the ground truth nearest neighbor vectors. We accomplish this by\nproposing a method to predict the correct clusters by means of a neural network\nthat is gradually refined by alternating supervised learning and duplicated\ncluster assignment. Compared to state-of-the-art SPANN and an exhaustive method\nusing k-means clustering and linear search, the proposed method achieves 90%\nrecall on SIFT1M with 80% and 58% less data fetched from storage, respectively.",

Nevertheless, current few-shot contrastive learning\napproaches often overlook the semantic similarity discrepancies at different\ngranularities when employing the same modeling approach for different sample\nrelations, which limits the potential of few-shot contrastive learning. In this\npaper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective contrastive learning\napproach, Multi-Grained Relation Contrastive Learning (MGRCL), as a\npre-training feature learning model to boost few-shot learning by meticulously\nmodeling sample relations at different granularities. MGRCL categorizes sample\nrelations into three types: intra-sample relation of the same sample under\ndifferent transformations, intra-class relation of homogenous samples, and\ninter-class relation of inhomogeneous samples. In MGRCL, we design\nTransformation Consistency Learning (TCL) to ensure the rigorous semantic\nconsistency of a sample under different transformations by aligning predictions\nof input pairs. Furthermore, to preserve discriminative information, we employ\nClass Contrastive Learning (CCL) to ensure that a sample is always closer to\nits homogenous samples than its inhomogeneous ones, as homogenous samples share\nsimilar semantic content while inhomogeneous samples have different semantic\ncontent.

The training dataset contains diverse flow\nregimes, with a focus on the wall-parallel plane near the canyon roof, a\ncritical region for pollutant exchange between the outer flow and the canyon\ninterior. The model accurately reproduces key flow features, including mean\nturbulent statistics, two-point correlations, quadrant analysis, and dominant\nflow structures, while demonstrating strong agreement with experimental data in\ncapturing the temporal evolution of flow dynamics. These findings demonstrate\nthe potential of deep learning models to enhance predictive capabilities for\nurban canyon flows, offering a pathway toward improved urban design,\nsustainable environmental management, and more effective pollutant dispersion\nmodeling.",

Applied\ndeformation modifies the alignment and stress states of constituent fibers,\ntuning the nonlinear elastic response of these materials. While it is generally\npresumed that fibers return to their original configurations after deformation\nis released, except when neighboring fibers coalesce or individual fibers\nyield, this reversal process remains largely unexplored. The intricate geometry\nof these matrices leaves an incomplete understanding of whether releasing\ndeformation fully restores the matrix or introduces new microstructural\ndeformation mechanisms. To address this gap, we investigated the evolution of\nmatrix microstructures during the release of an applied deformation. Numerical\nsimulations were performed on quasi-two-dimensional matrices of random fibers\nunder localized tension, with fibers modeled as beams in finite element\nanalysis. After tension release, the matrix exhibited permanent mechanical\nremodeling, with greater remodeling occurring at higher magnitudes of applied\ntension, indicative of the matrix preserving its loading history as mechanical\nmemory. This response was surprising; it occurred despite the absence of\nexplicit plasticity mechanisms, such as activation of inter-fiber cohesion or\nfiber yielding. We attributed the observed remodeling to the gradient in fiber\nalignment that developed within the matrix microstructure under applied\ntension, driving the subsequent changes in matrix properties during the release\nof applied tension.

In contrast, the $J/\\Psi$ meson, owing to its heavy charm quark\ncontent, demonstrating its resilience to thermal effects. We further explore\nthe global spin alignment of these mesons in the event plane frame. For the\n$\\phi$ meson, the averaged $\\rho_{00}$ over the full range of azimuthal angle\nshows weak temperature dependence at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) but\nsignificant suppression at high $p_T$, aligning with experimental observations.\nRotation enhances $\\rho_{00}$ at high $p_T$, a phenomenon attributed to angular\nmomentum transfer via spin-orbit coupling. The $J/\\Psi$ meson, however,\ndisplays insensitivity to temperature and rotation up to $p_T=5$ GeV, with a\nvery small suppression observed at higher $p_T$, likely due to its heavy quark\nnature. Although $\\rho$ meson spin alignment is not yet experimentally\nmeasured, it exhibits behaviour qualitatively similar to the $\\phi$ meson, with\nthermal fluctuations dampening alignment and rotation enhancing it.",

To analyze each YOLO version's architecture, we\nmeticulously examined the relevant academic papers, documentation, and\nscrutinized the source code. The analysis reveals that while each version of\nYOLO has improvements in architecture and feature extraction, certain blocks\nremain unchanged.

While previous research has\nlargely addressed audio disruptions, few studies have dealt with visual\ncorruptions, e.g., lip occlusions or blurred videos, which are also\ndetrimental. To address this real-world challenge, we propose CAV2vec, a novel\nself-supervised speech representation learning framework particularly designed\nto handle audio-visual joint corruption. CAV2vec employs a self-distillation\napproach with a corrupted prediction task, where the student model learns to\npredict clean targets, generated by the teacher model, with corrupted input\nframes. Specifically, we suggest a unimodal multi-task learning, which distills\ncross-modal knowledge and aligns the corrupted modalities, by predicting clean\naudio targets with corrupted videos, and clean video targets with corrupted\naudios. This strategy mitigates the dispersion in the representation space\ncaused by corrupted modalities, leading to more reliable and robust\naudio-visual fusion. Our experiments on robust AVSR benchmarks demonstrate that\nthe corrupted representation learning method significantly enhances recognition\naccuracy across generalized environments involving various types of corruption.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/sungnyun/cav2vec.",

Recent studies have shown that incorporating\nvisual cues in audio signal processing can enhance SE performance. Given that\nhuman speech communication naturally involves audio, visual, and linguistic\nmodalities, it is reasonable to expect additional improvements by integrating\nlinguistic information. However, effectively bridging these modality gaps,\nparticularly during knowledge transfer remains a significant challenge. In this\npaper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework, termed DLAV-SE, which\nleverages a diffusion-based model integrating audio, visual, and linguistic\ninformation for audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE). Within this framework,\nthe linguistic modality is modeled using a pretrained language model (PLM),\nwhich transfers linguistic knowledge to the audio-visual domain through a\ncross-modal knowledge transfer (CMKT) mechanism during training. After\ntraining, the PLM is no longer required at inference, as its knowledge is\nembedded into the AVSE model through the CMKT process. We conduct a series of\nSE experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

The localized active space\nself-consistent field (LASSCF) approximates the complete active space\nself-consistent field (CASSCF) by generating active space-based wave functions\nwithin specific fragments while treating interfragment correlation with\nmean-field approach, hence is computationally less expensive.\nHardware-efficient ansatzes (HEA) offer affordable and shallower circuits, yet\nthey often fail to capture the necessary correlation. Previously,\nJastrow-factor-inspired non-unitary qubit operators were proposed to use with\nHEA for variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) calculations (nuVQE), as they do\nnot increase circuit depths and recover correlation beyond the mean-field level\nfor Hartree-Fock initial states. Here, we explore running nuVQE with LASSCF as\nthe initial state. The method, named LAS-nuVQE, is shown to recover\ninterfragment correlations, reach chemical accuracy with a small number of\ngates (<70) in both H4 and square cyclobutadiene. To further address the\ninherent symmetry-breaking in HEA, we implemented spin-constrained LAS-nuVQE to\nextend the capabilities of HEA further and show spin-pure results for square\ncyclobutadiene. We mitigate the increased measurement overhead of nuVQE via\nPauli grouping and shot-frugal sampling, reducing measurement costs by up to\ntwo orders of magnitude compared to ungrouped operator, and show that one can\nachieve better accuracy with a small number of shots (10^3-4) per one\nexpectation value calculation compared to noiseless simulations with one or two\norders of magnitude more shots. Finally, wall clock time estimates show that,\nwith our measurement mitigation protocols, nuVQE becomes a cheaper and more\naccurate alternative than VQE with HEA.",

Beyond scan algorithms, we have recently developed the binary and\nre-search (BiRS) algorithm, which is more computationally efficient than\nscan-based methods and exhibits superior statistical power. However, the BiRS\nalgorithm is based on two-sample mean test for binary traits, not accounting\nfor multidimensional covariates or handling test statistics for non-binary\noutcomes.

The dBiRS algorithm\naccommodates regression-based statistics, allowing for the adjustment of\ncovariates and the testing of both continuous and binary outcomes. This new\nframework enables parallel computing of block-wise results by aggregation\nthrough a central machine to ensure both detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency, and has theoretical guarantees for controlling family-wise error\nrates and false discovery rates while maintaining the power advantages of the\noriginal algorithm. Applying dBiRS to detect genetic regions associated with\nfluid intelligence and prospective memory using whole-exome sequencing data\nfrom the UK Biobank, we validate previous findings and identify numerous novel\nrare variants near newly implicated genes.

We\nfind that both types of heatwaves are increasing, with oppressive heatwaves\nshowing a faster rate of growth. Importantly, oppressive heatwaves are more\nstrongly correlated with heat-stress-related human deaths than extreme\nheatwaves, indicating they pose a greater health risk. Using climate model\nsimulations, we project a significant increase in the number of oppressive\nheatwave days under future warming scenarios. Under 1.5{\\deg}C global warming,\noppressive heatwaves will increase five-fold by the end of the century\n(2070-2100), relative to the historical period (1975-2005). Under 2{\\deg}C\nwarming, this increase rises to eight-fold, with an almost two-fold increase in\noppressive heatwaves compared to the 1.5{\\deg}C scenario. Extreme heatwave\ndays, in contrast, remain relatively constant. Limiting warming to 1.5{\\deg}C\ncould reduce the likelihood of oppressive and extreme heatwaves by 44% and 25%,\nrespectively, compared to a 2{\\deg}C warming world.

    "abstract": "First-price auctions have recently gained significant traction in digital\nadvertising markets, exemplified by Google's transition from second-price to\nfirst-price auctions. Unlike in second-price auctions, where bidding one's\nprivate valuation is a dominant strategy, determining an optimal bidding\nstrategy in first-price auctions is more complex. From a learning perspective,\nthe learner (a specific bidder) can interact with the environment (other\nbidders, i.e., opponents) sequentially to infer their behaviors. Existing\nresearch often assumes specific environmental conditions and benchmarks\nperformance against the best fixed policy (static benchmark). While this\napproach ensures strong learning guarantees, the static benchmark can deviate\nsignificantly from the optimal strategy in environments with even mild\nnon-stationarity. To address such scenarios, a dynamic benchmark--representing\nthe sum of the highest achievable rewards at each time step--offers a more\nsuitable objective. However, achieving no-regret learning with respect to the\ndynamic benchmark requires additional constraints. By inspecting reward\nfunctions in online first-price auctions, we introduce two metrics to quantify\nthe regularity of the sequence of opponents' highest bids, which serve as\nmeasures of non-stationarity. We provide a minimax-optimal characterization of\nthe dynamic regret for the class of sequences of opponents' highest bids that\nsatisfy either of these regularity constraints. Our main technical tool is the\nOptimistic Mirror Descent (OMD) framework with a novel optimism configuration,\nwhich is well-suited for achieving minimax-optimal dynamic regret rates in this\ncontext. We then use synthetic datasets to validate our theoretical guarantees\nand demonstrate that our methods outperform existing ones.",

Throughout the history of SAR ATR\nresearch, there have been only a number of small datasets, mainly including\ntargets like ships, airplanes, buildings, etc. There is only one vehicle\ndataset MSTAR collected in the 1990s, which has been a valuable source for SAR\nATR.

It marks a substantial advancement in\ndataset scale and diversity, comprising over 190,000 well-annotated samples, 10\ntimes larger than its predecessor, the famous MSTAR. Building such a large\ndataset is a challenging task, and the data collection scheme will be detailed.\nSecondly, we illustrate the value of ATRNet-STAR via extensively evaluating the\nperformance of 15 representative methods with 7 different experimental settings\non challenging classification and detection benchmarks derived from the\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Transformers have become increasingly popular for image super-resolution (SR)\ntasks due to their strong global context modeling capabilities.

Recently, the Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising\nalternative with linear computational complexity, allowing it to avoid window\nmechanisms and maintain a large receptive field. Nevertheless, Mamba faces\nchallenges in handling long-context dependencies when high pixel-level\nprecision is required, as in SR tasks. This is due to its hidden state\nmechanism, which can compress and store a substantial amount of context but\nonly in an approximate manner, leading to inaccuracies that transformers do not\nsuffer from.

This contrasts with signal processing techniques, such as Fourier\nand wavelet analyses, which often employ hierarchical decompositions. Inspired\nby such principles, particularly the idea of signal separation, we introduce a\ndiffusion framework leveraging multi-scale latent factorization. Our framework\nuniquely decomposes the denoising target, typically latent features from a\npretrained Variational Autoencoder, into a low-frequency base signal capturing\ncore structural information and a high-frequency residual signal that\ncontributes finer, high-frequency details like textures. This decomposition\ninto base and residual components directly informs our two-stage image\ngeneration process, which first produces the low-resolution base, followed by\nthe generation of the high-resolution residual. Our proposed architecture\nfacilitates reduced sampling steps during the residual learning stage, owing to\nthe inherent ease of modeling residual information, which confers advantages\nover conventional full-resolution generation techniques. This specific approach\nof decomposing the signal into a base and a residual, conceptually akin to how\nwavelet analysis can separate different frequency bands, yields a more\nstreamlined and intuitive design distinct from generic hierarchical models.

    "abstract": "We study a general class of sequential search problems for selecting multiple\ncandidates from different societal groups under \"ex-ante constraints\" aimed at\nproducing socially desirable outcomes, such as demographic parity, diversity\nquotas, or subsidies for disadvantaged groups. Starting with the canonical\nPandora's box model [Weitzman, 1978] under a single affine constraint on\nselection and inspection probabilities, we show that the optimal constrained\npolicy retains an index-based structure similar to the unconstrained case, but\nmay randomize between two dual-based adjustments that are both easy to compute\nand economically interpretable. We then extend our results to handle multiple\naffine constraints by reducing the problem to a variant of the exact\nCarath\\'eodory problem and providing a novel polynomial-time algorithm to\ngenerate an optimal randomized dual-adjusted index-based policy that satisfies\nall constraints simultaneously. Building on these insights, we consider richer\nsearch processes (e.g., search with rejection and multistage search) modeled by\njoint Markov scheduling (JMS) [Dumitriu et al., 2003; Gittins, 1979]. By\nimposing general affine and convex ex-ante constraints, we develop a\nprimal-dual algorithm that randomizes over a polynomial number of dual-based\nadjustments to the unconstrained JMS Gittins indices, yielding a near-feasible,\nnear-optimal policy. Our approach relies on the key observation that a suitable\nrelaxation of the Lagrange dual function for these constrained problems admits\nindex-based policies akin to those in the unconstrained setting. Using a\nnumerical study, we investigate the implications of imposing various\nconstraints, in particular the utilitarian loss (price of fairness), and\nwhether these constraints induce their intended societally desirable outcomes.",

To address this\nissue, this paper proposes UDC, a novel method that unveils discrete clues to\nbridge consistent textual knowledge and CO signals within a unified semantic\nspace, thereby enriching the representation semantics of rare diseases.\nSpecifically, we focus on addressing two key sub-problems: (1) acquiring\ndistinguishable discrete encodings for precise disease representation and (2)\nachieving semantic alignment between textual knowledge and the CO signals at\nthe code level. For the first sub-problem, we refine the standard vector\nquantized process to include condition awareness.

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is well known to be sample-efficient for solving\nblack-box problems. However, the BO algorithms can sometimes get stuck in\nsuboptimal solutions even with plenty of samples. Intrinsically, such\nsuboptimal problem of BO can attribute to the poor surrogate accuracy of the\ntrained Gaussian process (GP), particularly that in the regions where the\noptimal solutions locate. Hence, we propose to build multiple GP models instead\nof a single GP surrogate to complement each other and thus resolving the\nsuboptimal problem of BO. Nevertheless, according to the bias-variance tradeoff\nequation, the individual prediction errors can increase when increasing the\ndiversity of models, which may lead to even worse overall surrogate accuracy.\nOn the other hand, based on the theory of Rademacher complexity, it has been\nproved that exploiting the agreement of models on unlabeled information can\nhelp to reduce the complexity of the hypothesis space, and therefore achieving\nthe required surrogate accuracy with fewer samples. Such value of model\nagreement has been extensively demonstrated for co-training style algorithms to\nboost model accuracy with a small portion of samples. Inspired by the above, we\npropose a novel BO algorithm labeled as co-learning BO (CLBO), which exploits\nboth model diversity and agreement on unlabeled information to improve the\noverall surrogate accuracy with limited samples, and therefore achieving more\nefficient global optimization. Through tests on five numerical toy problems and\nthree engineering benchmarks, the effectiveness of proposed CLBO has been well\ndemonstrated.",

While\nlow-bit quantization, such as 4-bit techniques, offers a potential solution,\nthese methods often suffer from significant accuracy loss or require\nconsiderable effort for implementation such as reordering, rotation, etc. To\naddress these challenges, we propose QRazor, a simple yet effective\nquantization scheme that enables 4-bit quantization of weights, activations,\nand KV cache in transformer-based LLMs. QRazor operates in two stages: first,\nquantizing data using 8 or 16-bit integers as a basis with absolute max scaling\nto preserve accuracy close to full-precision models, and second, compressing\nthe quantized data to 4-bit using our significant data razoring (SDR)\ntechnique, which retains only the four most salient bits. Without any\nadditional requirment of fine-tuning or additional training, QRazor achieves\nperformance similar or better compared to state-of-the-art in 4-bit\nquantization method, surpassing Smoothquant and QLLM by over 12 points and\nQuarot(RTN) by more than 2.9 points in zero-shot reasoning task accuracy on the\nLLaMA2-7B model.

In this paper, we present Sparse\nIdentification of Nonlinear Dynamics with SHallow REcurrent Decoder networks\n(SINDy-SHRED), a method to jointly solve the sensing and model identification\nproblems with simple implementation, efficient computation, and robust\nperformance. SINDy-SHRED uses Gated Recurrent Units to model the temporal\nsequence of sparse sensor measurements along with a shallow decoder network to\nreconstruct the full spatio-temporal field from the latent state space. Our\nalgorithm introduces a SINDy-based regularization for which the latent space\nprogressively converges to a SINDy-class functional, provided the projection\nremains within the set. In restricting SINDy to a linear model, a Koopman-SHRED\nmodel is generated. SINDy-SHRED (i) learns a symbolic and interpretable\ngenerative model of a parsimonious and low-dimensional latent space for the\ncomplex spatio-temporal dynamics, (ii) discovers new physics models even for\nwell-known physical systems, (iii) achieves provably robust convergence with an\nobserved globally convex loss landscape, and (iv) achieves superior accuracy,\ndata efficiency, and training time, all with fewer model parameters. We conduct\nsystematic experimental studies on PDE data such as turbulent flows, real-world\nsensor measurements for sea surface temperature, and direct video data.

    "abstract": "Optical solitons in multimode nonlinear optical systems offer a unique\nplatform for exploring the interplay of nonlinearity, dispersion, and spatial\nmode coupling, offering insights into complex nonlinear wave phenomena.\nMulti-pass cavities (MPCs) incorporating nonlinear Kerr media serve as\nprototypical systems, enabling high-efficiency supercontinuum generation and\npulse compression. However, stabilizing femtosecond laser pulses in\nsolid-medium-based MPCs (solid MPCs) under strong Kerr nonlinearity remains a\nsignificant challenge due to multimode coupling, which disrupts beam stability.\nIn this work, we address this challenge by investigating the stability of laser\npulses in MPCs using Floquet and perturbation model. We identify novel\nmode-coupling-suppression (MCS) medium lengths, where destructive interference\namong multimode wave components suppresses coupling and facilitates soliton\nstabilization. Under MCS conditions, our simulations demonstrate stable beam\npropagation in solid MPCs with nonlinear phases up to 1.5{\\pi} per pass,\nachieving >13-fold pulse compression with excellent spatio-spectral\nhomogeneity. Our findings offer valuable guidance for designing advanced MPCs\nwith tailored Kerr media.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) using the local data of edge users\ncan enable personalized services and applications. For privacy protection, the\nprevalent solution adopts distributed learning for fine-tuning and integrates\nlow-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce users' computational load. However, as the\nnumber of users increases, numerous users simultaneously communicate with the\nserver, and multiple server-side models concurrently execute on the server,\nleading to significant communication congestion and memory pressure. In this\npaper, we propose a split learning (SL) scheme for fine-tuning LLM in wireless\nnetworks, which involves one cloud server, a small number of edge servers, and\nmultiple users. Specifically, the pre-trained model and LoRA adapters are\ndivided into three parts and deployed across the cloud, edge, and user sides.\nThe training process follows the sequence of user, edge, and cloud, with\nforward and backward propagation achieved by transmitting activation and\ngradient. In each round, all edge servers and an equivalent number of users\ntrain in parallel, and only the LoRA adapters are updated. At the end of each\nround, all edge-side and user-side LoRA adapters are uploaded to the cloud for\naggregation. Extensive simulation demonstrates that the proposed scheme can\nreduce peak memory usage up to 74% compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.",

Galaxies in low mass\nhalos have a wide range of stellar halo properties. Their diversity is much\ngreater at fixed stellar mass than fixed virial mass. In the least massive DM\nhalos capable of supporting galaxy formation, accreted mass fractions are < 10\nper cent, and the typical density profile of accreted stars is similar to that\nof stars formed in situ. In low mass galaxies, the radial scale lengths of\naccreted stellar halos are smaller than those of stellar disks formed in situ,\nbut the accreted component is still diffuse, not bulge-like. At the scale of\ngalaxies like M33, the surface density of accreted stars exceeds that of the in\nsitu component at ~15kpc; the accreted surface density at this radius is\n$3.5\\lesssim \\log_{10} M_\\star/{\\rm M_\\odot} \\mathrm{kpc^{-2}} \\lesssim 6$,\nvarying systematically with virial mass.

Although four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var)\nis widely used, it faces high computational costs in complex nonlinear systems\nand depends on imperfect state-observation mappings. Deep learning (DL) offers\nmore expressive approximators, while integrating DL models into 4D-Var is\nchallenging due to their nonlinearities and lack of theoretical guarantees in\nassimilation results. In this paper, we propose Tensor-Var, a novel framework\nthat integrates kernel conditional mean embedding (CME) with 4D-Var to\nlinearize nonlinear dynamics, achieving convex optimization in a learned\nfeature space. Moreover, our method provides a new perspective for solving\n4D-Var in a linear way, offering theoretical guarantees of consistent\nassimilation results between the original and feature spaces. To handle\nlarge-scale problems, we propose a method to learn deep features using neural\nnetworks within the Tensor-Var framework.

While current VI-ReID methods focus on cross-modality matching,\nreal-world applications often involve mixed galleries containing both V and I\nimages, where state-of-the-art methods show significant performance limitations\ndue to large domain shifts and low discrimination across mixed modalities. This\nis because gallery images from the same modality may have lower domain gaps but\ncorrespond to different identities. This paper introduces a novel mixed-modal\nReID setting, where galleries contain data from both modalities. To address the\ndomain shift among inter-modal and low discrimination capacity in intra-modal\nmatching, we propose the Mixed Modality-Erased and -Related (MixER) method. The\nMixER learning approach disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared\nidentity information through orthogonal decomposition, modality-confusion, and\nID-modality-related objectives. MixER enhances feature robustness across\nmodalities, improving cross-modal and mixed-modal settings performance.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in various\ndownstream tasks, inspiring the development of Speech Understanding Language\nModels (SULMs) to enable comprehensive speech-based interactions. However, most\nadvanced SULMs are developed by the industry, leveraging large-scale datasets\nand computational resources that are not readily available to the academic\ncommunity. Moreover, the lack of transparency in training details creates\nadditional barriers to further innovation. In this study, we present OSUM, an\nOpen Speech Understanding Model designed to explore the potential of training\nSLUMs under constrained academic resources. The OSUM model combines a Whisper\nencoder with a Qwen2 LLM and supports a wide range of speech tasks, including\nspeech recognition (ASR), speech recognition with timestamps (SRWT), vocal\nevent detection (VED), speech emotion recognition (SER), speaking style\nrecognition (SSR), speaker gender classification (SGC), speaker age prediction\n(SAP), and speech-to-text chat (STTC). By employing an ASR+X training strategy,\nOSUM achieves efficient and stable multi-task training by simultaneously\noptimizing ASR alongside target tasks. Beyond delivering strong performance,\nOSUM emphasizes transparency by providing openly available data preparation and\ntraining methodologies, offering valuable insights and practical guidance for\nthe academic community. By doing so, we aim to accelerate research and\ninnovation in advanced SULM technologies.",

Wavelet and\nFourier spectra of observed and modeled light curves show multiple\nquasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) with quasiperiods from less than 0.1 to 9\ndays. Models show that variation in the strength and tilt of the dipole\nmagnetosphere leads to different periodograms, where the period of the star may\ndominate or be hidden. The amplitude of QPOs associated with the stellar period\ncan be smaller than that of other QPOs if the tilt of the dipole magnetosphere\nis small and when the unstable regime is stronger. In models with small\nmagnetospheres, the short-period QPOs associated with rotation of the inner\ndisc dominate and can be mistaken for a stellar period.

    "abstract": "Recent research has revealed that the reported results of an emerging body of\nDL-based techniques for detecting software vulnerabilities are not\nreproducible, either across different datasets or on unseen samples. This paper\naims to provide the foundation for properly evaluating the research in this\ndomain. We do so by analyzing prior work and existing vulnerability datasets\nfor the syntactic and semantic features of code that contribute to\nvulnerability, as well as features that falsely correlate with vulnerability.\nWe provide a novel, uniform representation to capture both sets of features,\nand use this representation to detect the presence of both vulnerability and\nspurious features in code. To this end, we design two types of code\nperturbations: feature preserving perturbations (FPP) ensure that the\nvulnerability feature remains in a given code sample, while feature eliminating\nperturbations (FEP) eliminate the feature from the code sample. These\nperturbations aim to measure the influence of spurious and vulnerability\nfeatures on the predictions of a given vulnerability detection solution. To\nevaluate how the two classes of perturbations influence predictions, we\nconducted a large-scale empirical study on five state-of-the-art DL-based\nvulnerability detectors. Our study shows that, for vulnerability features, only\n~2% of FPPs yield the undesirable effect of a prediction changing among the\nfive detectors on average. However, on average, ~84% of FEPs yield the\nundesirable effect of retaining the vulnerability predictions. For spurious\nfeatures, we observed that FPPs yielded a drop in recall up to 29% for\ngraph-based detectors. We present the reasons underlying these results and\nsuggest strategies for improving DNN-based vulnerability detectors. We provide\nour perturbation-based evaluation framework as a public resource to enable\nindependent future evaluation of vulnerability detectors.",

It was recently demonstrated\nthat the LRC approximation can also be employed in real-time TDDFT to describe\nexciton dynamics. Here, we investigate the numerical stability of the\ntime-dependent LRC approach using a two-dimensional model solid. It is found\nthat the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation with an LRC vector potential becomes\nmore and more prone to instabilities for increasing exciton binding energies.\nThe origin of these instabilities is traced back to time-averaged violations of\nthe zero-force theorem, which leads to a simple and robust numerical\nstabilization scheme.

    "abstract": "The effect of valley splitting on the readout of qubit states is\ntheoretically investigated in a three-quantum-dot (QD) system. A single unit of\nthe three-QD system consists of qubit-QDs and a channel-QD that is connected to\na conventional transistor. The nonlinear source--drain current characteristics\nunder resonant-tunneling effects are used to distinguish different qubit\nstates. Using nonequilibrium Green functions, the current formula for the\nthree-QD system is derived when each QD has two valley energy levels. Two\nvalley states in each QD are considered to be affected by variations in the\nfabrication process. We found that when valley splitting is smaller than Zeeman\nsplitting, the current nonlinearity can improve the readout, provided that the\nnonuniformity of the valley energy levels is small. Conversely, when the valley\nsplitting is larger than the Zeeman splitting, the nonuniformity degraded the\nreadout. In both cases, we showed that there are regions where the measurement\ntime $t_{\\rm meas}$ is much less than the decoherence time $t_{\\rm dec}$ such\nthat $t_{\\rm dec}/t_{\\rm meas}>100$. This suggests that less than 1\\%\nmeasurement error is anticipated, which opens up the possibility for\nimplementing surface codes even in the presence of valley splitting.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the design and analysis of privacy-preserving\ntechniques for group testing and infection status retrieval. Our work is\nmotivated by the need to provide accurate information on the status of disease\nspread among a group of individuals while protecting the privacy of the\ninfection status of any single individual involved. The paper is motivated by\npractical scenarios, such as controlling the spread of infectious diseases,\nwhere individuals might be reluctant to participate in testing if their\noutcomes are not kept confidential.\n  The paper makes the following contributions. First, we present a differential\nprivacy framework for the subset retrieval problem, which focuses on sharing\nthe infection status of individuals with administrators and decision-makers. We\ncharacterize the trade-off between the accuracy of subset retrieval and the\ndegree of privacy guaranteed to the individuals. In particular, we establish\ntight lower and upper bounds on the achievable level of accuracy subject to the\ndifferential privacy constraints. We then formulate the differential privacy\nframework for the noisy group testing problem in which noise is added either\nbefore or after the pooling process. We establish a reduction between the\nprivate subset retrieval and noisy group testing problems and show that the\nconverse and achievability schemes for subset retrieval carry over to\ndifferentially private group testing.",
