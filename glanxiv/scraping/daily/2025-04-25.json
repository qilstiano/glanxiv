    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have demonstrated great generalization capabilities for\ntasks whose training and test sets are drawn from the same distribution.\nNevertheless, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains a challenging task\nthat has received significant attention in recent years. Specifically, OOD\ndetection refers to the detection of instances that do not belong to the\ntraining distribution, while still having good performance on the\nin-distribution task (e.g., classification or object detection). Recent work\nhas focused on generating synthetic outliers and using them to train an outlier\ndetector, generally achieving improved OOD detection than traditional OOD\nmethods. In this regard, outliers can be generated either in feature or pixel\nspace. Feature space driven methods have shown strong performance on both the\nclassification and object detection tasks, at the expense that the\nvisualization of training outliers remains unknown, making further analysis on\nOOD failure modes challenging. On the other hand, pixel space outlier\ngeneration techniques enabled by diffusion models have been used for image\nclassification using, providing improved OOD detection performance and outlier\nvisualization, although their adaption to the object detection task is as yet\nunexplored. We therefore introduce Dream-Box, a method that provides a link to\nobject-wise outlier generation in the pixel space for OOD detection.\nSpecifically, we use diffusion models to generate object-wise outliers that are\nused to train an object detector for an in-distribution task and OOD detection.\nOur method achieves comparable performance to previous traditional methods\nwhile being the first technique to provide concrete visualization of generated\nOOD objects.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the impact of baryonic feedback on the small-scale ($k \\gtrsim\n1\\,h\\,$Mpc$^{-1}$) matter power spectrum is a key astrophysical challenge, and\nessential for interpreting data from upcoming weak-lensing surveys, which\nrequire percent-level accuracy to fully harness their potential. Astrophysical\nprobes, such as the kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, have been\nused to constrain feedback at large scales ($k \\lesssim 5\\,h\\,$Mpc$^{-1}$). The\nsightline-to-sightline variance in the fast radio bursts (FRBs) dispersion\nmeasure (DM) correlates with the strength of baryonic feedback and offers\nunique sensitivity at scales upto $k \\sim 10\\,h\\,$Mpc$^{-1}$. We develop a new\nsimulation-based formalism in which we parameterize the distribution of DM at a\ngiven redshift, $p(\\mathrm{DM}|z)$, as a log-normal with its first two moments\ncomputed analytically in terms of cosmological parameters and the\nfeedback-dependent electron power spectrum $P_\\mathrm{ee}(k, z)$. We find that\nthe log-normal parameterization provides an improved description of the\n$p(\\mathrm{DM}|z)$ distribution observed in hydrodynamical simulations as\ncompared to the standard $F$-parameterization. Our model robustly captures the\nbaryonic feedback effects across a wide range of baryonic feedback\nprescriptions in hydrodynamical simulations, including IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and\nAstrid. Leveraging simulations incorporates the redshift evolution of the DM\nvariance by construction and facilitates the translation of constrained\nfeedback parameters to the suppression of matter power spectrum relative to\ngravity-only simulations. We show that with $10^4$ FRBs, the suppression can be\nconstrained to percent-level precision at large scales and $\\sim 10$\\%\nprecision at scales $k \\gtrsim 10\\,h\\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ with prior-to-posterior\n$1\\sigma$ constraint width ratio $\\gtrsim 20$.",

    "abstract": "This work presents the first finite-time analysis for the last-iterate\nconvergence of average-reward Q-learning with an asynchronous implementation. A\nkey feature of the algorithm we study is the use of adaptive stepsizes, which\nserve as local clocks for each state-action pair. We show that the iterates\ngenerated by this Q-learning algorithm converge at a rate of $O(1/k)$ (in the\nmean-square sense) to the optimal relative Q-function in the span seminorm.\nMoreover, by adding a centering step to the algorithm, we further establish\npointwise mean-square convergence to a centered optimal relative Q-function,\nalso at a rate of $O(1/k)$. To prove these results, we show that adaptive\nstepsizes are necessary, as without them, the algorithm fails to converge to\nthe correct target. In addition, adaptive stepsizes can be interpreted as a\nform of implicit importance sampling that counteracts the effects of\nasynchronous updates.\n  Technically, the use of adaptive stepsizes makes each Q-learning update\ndepend on the entire sample history, introducing strong correlations and making\nthe algorithm a non-Markovian stochastic approximation (SA) scheme. Our\napproach to overcoming this challenge involves (1) a time-inhomogeneous\nMarkovian reformulation of non-Markovian SA, and (2) a combination of\nalmost-sure time-varying bounds, conditioning arguments, and Markov chain\nconcentration inequalities to break the strong correlations between the\nadaptive stepsizes and the iterates. The tools developed in this work are\nlikely to be broadly applicable to the analysis of general SA algorithms with\nadaptive stepsizes.",

Sixteen unstained formalin-fixed\nparaffin-embedded skin excisions were PARS imaged, virtually H&E stained, then\nchemically stained and imaged at 40x. Seven fellowship trained\ndermatopathologists assessed all 32 images in a masked randomized fashion.\nConcordance analysis indicates 95.5% agreement between primary diagnoses\nrendered on PARS versus H&E images (Cohen's k=0.93).

For subtype classification, agreement was near-perfect 91% (k=0.73) for\nSCC and was perfect for BCC. When assessing malignancy confinement (e.g.,\ncancer margins), agreement was 92% between PARS and H&E (k=0.718).

The\ndependent variable is the hourly waiting count in the ED. Seven regression\nmodels were developed to assess the effects of different predictors such as\nweather conditions, hospital census, federal holidays, and football games\nacross different timestamps.\n  Results: Some weather conditions significantly increased ED crowding in the\nBaseline Model, while federal holidays and weekends consistently reduced\nwaiting counts.

Drawing inspiration from biological healing - where the human body\ndetects damage, signals the brain, and activates targeted recovery - this paper\nexplores the concept of self-healing software driven by artificial\nintelligence. We propose a novel framework that mimics this biological model\nsystem observability tools serve as sensory inputs, AI models function as the\ncognitive core for diagnosis and repair, and healing agents apply targeted code\nand test modifications. By combining log analysis, static code inspection, and\nAI-driven generation of patches or test updates, our approach aims to reduce\ndowntime, accelerate debugging, and enhance software resilience. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of this model through case studies and simulations, comparing\nit against traditional manual debugging and recovery workflows.

    "abstract": "The ngVLA science requirements call for continuum image dynamic ranges of 45\ndB and 35 dB at 8 and 27 GHz respectively. In interferometric aperture\nsynthesis imaging, visibility amplitude and phase errors result in errors in\nthe final images, limiting the dynamic range attained. In order to achieve the\nngVLA dynamic range requirements it is necessary to limit the amplitude and\nphase errors to within appropriate levels. The relationship between the number\nof antennas N in an interferometric aperture synthesis array and the error in\nthe constructed image has been previously derived and conventionally adopted to\nbe a scaling of \\approx N. In this short memo, we argue that this relationship\nmay not hold everywhere in an image and derive the relationship in a more\nstringent limit. We derive a more stringent \\sqrt N dependence as opposed to\nthe previous, generally adopted N scaling and compare with existing\nsimulations. This relationship is at the root of allowable amplitude and phase\nerrors arising from practically every corrupting effect, e.g. antenna pointing,\nprimary beam characteristics, tropospheric and ionospheric phase fluctuations\nand polarimetric imperfections, among others. Thus, it is central to ngVLA\ncalibration requirements and strategies. We recommend the adoption of a\nconservative \\sqrt N dependence as the basis to derive the requirements and to\nidentify applicable strategies.",

He also proposed studying the primality of |E(F_{p^l})| / |E(F_p)|,\nin parallel with the primality of (p^l - 1)/(p - 1).\n  Motivated by these problems and earlier work on |E(F_p)|, we study the\ninfinitude of primes p such that |E(F_{p^l})| / |E(F_p)| has a bounded number\nof prime factors for primes l >= 2, considering both CM and non-CM elliptic\ncurves over Q. In the CM case, we focus on the curve y^2 = x^3 - x to address\ngaps in the literature and present a more concrete argument. The result is\nunconditional and applies Huxley's large sieve inequality for the associated CM\nfield. In the non-CM case, analogous results follow under GRH via the effective\nChebotarev density theorem.\n  For the CM curve y^2 = x^3 - x, we further apply a vector sieve to combine\nthe almost prime properties of |E(F_p)| and |E(F_{p^2})| / |E(F_p)|,\nestablishing a lower bound for the number of primes p <= x for which\n|E(F_{p^2})| / 32 is a square-free almost prime.

    "abstract": "Aims: To propose a general sample size framework for developing or updating a\nclinical prediction model using any statistical or machine learning method,\nbased on drawing samples from anticipated posterior distributions and targeting\nassurance in predictive performance.\n  Methods: Users provide a reference model (eg, matching outcome incidence,\npredictor weights and c-statistic of previous models), and a (synthetic)\ndataset reflecting the joint distribution of candidate predictors in the target\npopulation. Then a fully simulation-based approach allows the impact of a\nchosen development sample size and modelling strategy to be examined. This\ngenerates thousands of models and, by applying each to the target population,\nleads to posterior distributions of individual predictions and model\nperformance (degradation) metrics, to inform required sample size. To improve\ncomputation speed for penalised regression, we also propose a one-sample\nBayesian analysis combining shrinkage priors with a likelihood decomposed into\nsample size and Fisher's information.\n  Results: The framework is illustrated when developing pre-eclampsia\nprediction models using logistic regression (unpenalised, uniform shrinkage,\nlasso or ridge) and random forests. We show it encompasses existing sample size\ncalculation criteria whilst providing model assurance probabilities,\ninstability metrics and degradation statistics about calibration,\ndiscrimination, clinical utility, prediction error and fairness. Crucially, the\nrequired sample size depends on the users' key estimands and planned model\ndevelopment or updating approach.\n  Conclusions: The framework generalises existing sample size proposals for\nmodel development by utilising anticipated posterior distributions conditional\non a chosen sample size and development strategy.

We obtain dynamical disk masses for our sample measuring the\nself-gravitating contribution to the gravitational potential. We are able to\nparametrically describe their surface density, and all of them appear\ngravitationally stable. By combining dynamical disk masses with dust continuum\nemission data, we determine an averaged gas-to-dust ratio of approximately 400,\nnot statistically consistent with the standard value of 100, assuming optically\nthin dust emission. In addition, the measurement of the dynamical scale radius\nallows for direct comparison with flux-based radii of gas and dust. This\ncomparison suggests that substructures may influence the size of the dust disk,\nand that CO depletion might reconcile our measurements with thermochemical\nmodels. Finally, with the stellar mass, disk mass, scale radius, and accretion\nrate, and assuming self-similar evolution of the surface density, we constrain\nthe effective $\\alpha_S$ for these systems.

    "abstract": "Starburst galaxies are $\\gamma$-ray sources. Canonically, their emission is\ndriven by hadronic cosmic rays (CRs) interacting with interstellar gas, forming\n$\\gamma$-rays via the decay of neutral pions. Charged pions are also formed in\nthis process. They decay into secondary leptons, including electrons and\nneutrinos. Starburst galaxies are therefore also expected to be neutrino\nsources, and their high-energy $\\gamma$-ray emission may include a secondary\nleptonic component. Leptonic $\\gamma$-rays may also originate from electrons\ndirectly energized by shocks within the interstellar medium of galaxies, or\nfrom pulsars and their surrounding halos. In the Milky Way, pulsars/pulsar\nhalos are the dominant $\\gamma$-ray source class. They are associated with\nstellar remnants or old stellar populations, and are presumably abundant in old\ngalaxies. In this work, we show that the collective high-energy emission from\ngalaxies can account for only a fraction of extragalactic neutrinos, but can\nform a major component of the extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray background. Contrary\nto the traditional view, a substantial fraction of this radiation may originate\nfrom leptonic processes, including from old, quiescent galaxies.",

While the computer\nvision community has built powerful visual 3D perception algorithms, cluttered\nenvironments with heavy occlusions can limit the visibility of objects of\ninterest. However, observed motion of partially occluded objects can imply\nphysical interactions took place, such as contact with a robot or the\nenvironment. These inferred contacts can supplement the visible geometry with\n\"physible geometry,\" which best explains the observed object motion through\nphysics. Vysics uses a vision-based tracking and reconstruction method,\nBundleSDF, to estimate the trajectory and the visible geometry from an RGBD\nvideo, and an odometry-based model learning method, Physics Learning Library\n(PLL), to infer the \"physible\" geometry from the trajectory through implicit\ncontact dynamics optimization. The visible and \"physible\" geometries jointly\nfactor into optimizing a signed distance function (SDF) to represent the object\nshape. Vysics does not require pretraining, nor tactile or force sensors.\nCompared with vision-only methods, Vysics yields object models with higher\ngeometric accuracy and better dynamics prediction in experiments where the\nobject interacts with the robot and the environment under heavy occlusion.\nProject page: https://vysics-vision-and-physics.github.io/",

In solids, these modes may take on a different character than the\nequivalent excitations in particle physics due to the diverse vacuum states\naccessible in condensed matter. However, the Higgs mode in particular is quite\ndifficult to observe experimentally as it decays quickly into the lower-energy\nGoldstone bosons and thus has a negligible lifetime in most systems. In this\nwork, we report evidence for a novel Higgs mode in the multiferroic material\nCuBr${}_2$, which shows up as a coherent oscillation in the time-resolved\nsecond harmonic generation signal upon excitation with a femtosecond light\npulse. Since the spiral spin order in CuBr${}_2$ induces a nonzero electric\ndipole moment in equilibrium, the Higgs mode--which is due to fluctuations in\nthe amplitude of the on-site spin expectation value--is an electromagnon, and\nthus acquires an inversion quantum number of -1. This is in stark contrast to\nthe Higgs boson of particle physics, which has even parity. Moreover, the\nexcitation described here represents an entirely new type of electromagnon,\ndistinct from the traditional electromagnon in linear spin wave theory which is\ndue to the Goldstone mode.",

To compensate for respiration-induced\nanatomical motion, time-resolved CBCT is highly desired to capture the\nspatiotemporal anatomical variations but faces challenges in accuracy and\nefficiency due to substantial optimization needed in image reconstruction and\nmotion modeling. We proposed a fast time-resolved CBCT reconstruction\nframework, based on a dynamic reconstruction and motion estimation method with\nnew reconstructions initialized and conditioned on prior reconstructions in an\nadaptive fashion (DREME-adapt). DREME-adapt reconstructs a time-resolved CBCT\nsequence from a fractional standard CBCT scan while simultaneously generating a\nmachine learning-based motion model that allows single-projection-driven\nintra-treatment CBCT estimation and motion tracking. Via DREME-adapt, a virtual\nfraction is generated from a pre-treatment 4D-CT set of each patient for a\nclean, 'cold-start' reconstruction. For subsequent fractions of the same\npatient, DREME-adapt uses pre-derived motion models and reference CBCTs as\ninitializations to drive a 'warm-start' reconstruction, based on a lower-cost\nrefining strategy. Three strategies: DREME-cs which drops the 'warm-start'\ncomponent, DREME-adapt-vfx which uses a fixed initialization (virtual\nfraction's reconstruction results), and DREME-adapt-pro which initialize\nreconstructions through a progressive daisy chain scheme (virtual fraction for\nfraction 1, fraction 1 for fraction 2, and so on), were evaluated on a digital\nphantom study and a patient study.

Existing few-shot learners assume a class oracle, which\nprovides labeled vertices for a desired class. However, such an oracle is not\navailable in a real-world setting, i.e., when drawing a vertex for labeling it\nis unknown to which class the vertex belongs. Few-shot learners are often\ncombined with prototypical networks, while classical semi-supervised vertex\nclassification uses discriminative models, e.g., Graph Convolutional Networks\n(GCN). In this paper, we train our models by iteratively prompting a human\nannotator with vertices to annotate. We perform three experiments where we\ncontinually relax our assumptions. First, we assume a class oracle, i.e., the\nhuman annotator is provided with an equal number of vertices to label for each\nclass. We denote this as \"Balanced Sampling''. In the subsequent experiment,\n\"Unbalanced Sampling,'' we replace the class oracle with $k$-medoids clustering\nand draw vertices to label from the clusters. In the last experiment, the\n\"Unknown Number of Classes,'' we no longer assumed we knew the number and\ndistribution of classes. Our results show that prototypical models outperform\ndiscriminative models in all experiments when fewer than $20$ samples per class\nare available. While dropping the assumption of the class oracle for the\n\"Unbalanced Sampling'' experiment reduces the performance of the GCN by $9\\%$,\nthe prototypical network loses only $1\\%$ on average.

    "abstract": "Soft robots, distinguished by their inherent compliance and continuum\nstructures, present unique modeling challenges, especially when subjected to\nsignificant external loads such as gravity and payloads. In this study, we\nintroduce an innovative data-driven modeling framework leveraging an Euler\nspiral-inspired shape representations to accurately describe the complex shapes\nof soft continuum actuators. Based on this representation, we develop neural\nnetwork-based forward and inverse models to effectively capture the nonlinear\nbehavior of a fiber-reinforced pneumatic bending actuator. Our forward model\naccurately predicts the actuator's deformation given inputs of pressure and\npayload, while the inverse model reliably estimates payloads from observed\nactuator shapes and known pressure inputs. Comprehensive experimental\nvalidation demonstrates the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed\napproach. Notably, the augmented Euler spiral-based forward model achieves low\naverage positional prediction errors of 3.38%, 2.19%, and 1.93% of the actuator\nlength at the one-third, two-thirds, and tip positions, respectively.\nFurthermore, the inverse model demonstrates precision of estimating payloads\nwith an average error as low as 0.72% across the tested range. These results\nunderscore the potential of our method to significantly enhance the accuracy\nand predictive capabilities of modeling frameworks for soft robotic systems.",

    "abstract": "Background and Context. The increasing integration of large language models\n(LLMs) in computing education presents an emerging challenge in understanding\nhow students use LLMs and craft prompts to solve computational tasks. Prior\nresearch has used both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze\nprompting behavior, but these approaches lack scalability or fail to\neffectively capture the semantic evolution of prompts. Objective. In this\npaper, we investigate whether students prompts can be systematically analyzed\nusing propositional logic constraints. We examine whether this approach can\nidentify patterns in prompt evolution, detect struggling students, and provide\ninsights into effective and ineffective strategies. Method. We introduce\nPrompt2Constraints, a novel method that translates students prompts into\nlogical constraints. The constraints are able to represent the intent of the\nprompts in succinct and quantifiable ways. We used this approach to analyze a\ndataset of 1,872 prompts from 203 students solving introductory programming\ntasks. Findings. We find that while successful and unsuccessful attempts tend\nto use a similar number of constraints overall, when students fail, they often\nmodify their prompts more significantly, shifting problem-solving strategies\nmidway. We also identify points where specific interventions could be most\nhelpful to students for refining their prompts. Implications. This work offers\na new and scalable way to detect students who struggle in solving natural\nlanguage programming tasks. This work could be extended to investigate more\ncomplex tasks and integrated into programming tools to provide real-time\nsupport.",

To this end, the exoALMA Large Program\ntargeted fifteen large protoplanetary disks ranging between ${\\sim}1\\arcsec$\nand ${\\sim}7\\arcsec$ in radius, and mapped the gas and dust distributions.\n$^{12}$CO J=3-2, $^{13}$CO J=3-2 and CS J=7-6 molecular emission was imaged at\nhigh angular (${\\sim}~0\\farcs15$) and spectral (${\\sim}~100~{\\rm m\\,s^{-1}}$)\nresolution, achieving a surface brightness temperature sensitivity of\n${\\sim}1.5$~K over a single channel, while the 330~GHz continuum emission was\nimaged at 90~mas resolution and achieved a point source sensitivity of\n${\\sim}\\,40~\\mu{\\rm Jy~beam^{-1}}$. These observations constitute some of the\ndeepest observations of protoplanetary disks to date.

In this work, we present a novel non-parametric approach for\nmultivariate probability density function (PDF) estimation that utilizes\nminimum description length (MDL)-based binning with quantile cuts.

This paper proposes an original\nand practical delay-based approach, called GeoFINDR, to locate a cloud\ninstance, e.g. a Virtual Machine (VM), over the Internet, based on RIPE Atlas\nlandmarks. First, the assumed threat model and assumptions are more realistic\nthan in existing solutions, e.g. VM-scale localization in multicloud\nenvironments, a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) lying about the VM's location.\nSecond, the originality of the approach lies in four original ideas: (1)\ngeolocalization is performed from the VM, (2) a Greedy algorithm selects a\nfirst set LM_A of distributed audit landmarks in the vicinity of the declared\narea, (3) a sectorization algorithm identifies a set LM_S of other landmarks\nwith distance delay behavior similar to that of the VM to estimate the sector\nof the VM, and (4) the estimated location of the VM is calculated as the\nbarycenter position of the LM_S landmarks. An open source tool is published on\nGitHub and experiments show that localization accuracy can be as high as\n22.1km, under unfavorable conditions where the CSP lies about the location of\nthe VM.",

Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural\nlanguage training data is difficult.

In order\nto improve the dimensional accuracy, thickness distribution, and overall\nformability of conical sheet parts, this study examines the negative TPIF\napproach. A series of experiments were conducted by varying key process\nparameters including tool diameter, vertical step size, forming strategy, and\nlubricant type. The forming process was performed on 0.9 mm thick St12 steel\nsheets using a CNC milling machine equipped with a full die set and a\nspherical-head forming tool. According to the results, increasing the tool\ndiameter reduced material thinning and failure risk by improving thickness\ndistribution and increasing the minimum wall thickness from 0.24 mm to 0.5 mm.\nOn the other hand, sharp features were better defined with smaller tool\ndiameters. The corresponding plastic strain was decreased and the risk of\ntearing was reduced by using a multi-stage forming technique, which also\nimproved strain distribution and decreased thinning. Lubricant type showed\nlimited influence on geometric accuracy or thickness uniformity but had a\nnoticeable effect on surface finish. Overall, this study demonstrates that tool\ngeometry and forming strategy are critical in optimizing the performance of\nnegative TPIF processes.

    "abstract": "Volume 1 of the FCC Feasibility Report presents an overview of the physics\ncase, experimental programme, and detector concepts for the Future Circular\nCollider (FCC). This volume outlines how FCC would address some of the most\nprofound open questions in particle physics, from precision studies of the\nHiggs and EW bosons and of the top quark, to the exploration of physics beyond\nthe Standard Model. The report reviews the experimental opportunities offered\nby the staged implementation of FCC, beginning with an electron-positron\ncollider (FCC-ee), operating at several centre-of-mass energies, followed by a\nhadron collider (FCC-hh). Benchmark examples are given of the expected physics\nperformance, in terms of precision and sensitivity to new phenomena, of each\ncollider stage. Detector requirements and conceptual designs for FCC-ee\nexperiments are discussed, as are the specific demands that the physics\nprogramme imposes on the accelerator in the domains of the calibration of the\ncollision energy, and the interface region between the accelerator and the\ndetector. The report also highlights advances in detector, software and\ncomputing technologies, as well as the theoretical tools /reconstruction\ntechniques that will enable the precision measurements and discovery potential\nof the FCC experimental programme. This volume reflects the outcome of a global\ncollaborative effort involving hundreds of scientists and institutions, aided\nby a dedicated community-building coordination, and provides a targeted\nassessment of the scientific opportunities and experimental foundations of the\nFCC programme.",

    "abstract": "Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4) (pymca: pyrimidine-2-carboxylate) consists of a slightly\ndistorted honeycomb lattice of Cu2+ spins, which shows no long-range magnetic\norder down to 0.6 K. A magnetization study revealed 1/3 and 2/3 plateau phases\n[A. Okutani et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 88, 013703 (2019)], which is not\nexpected for regular honeycomb antiferromagnets. Inelastic neutron scattering\nexperiments were performed using a powder sample to investigate the exchange\ninteractions of this material. The spin excitations from the singlet ground\nstate to the first three triplet states, predicted from the antiferromagnetic\nhexagonal spin cluster interacting with 3.9 meV, were observed. Using the exact\ndiagonalization mothods, the intercluster coupling was estimated from the\nexcitation peak width to be about 20% of the intracluster interaction, which is\nconsistent with the previously reported value. Our exchange path model explains\nthe anisotropic exchange interactions in the distorted honeycomb plane.",

    "abstract": "Volume 3 of the FCC Feasibility Report presents studies related to civil\nengineering, the development of a project implementation scenario, and\nenvironmental and sustainability aspects. The report details the iterative\nimprovements made to the civil engineering concepts since 2018, taking into\naccount subsurface conditions, accelerator and experiment requirements, and\nterritorial considerations. It outlines a technically feasible and economically\nviable civil engineering configuration that serves as the baseline for detailed\nsubsurface investigations, construction design, cost estimation, and project\nimplementation planning. Additionally, the report highlights ongoing subsurface\ninvestigations in key areas to support the development of an improved 3D\nsubsurface model of the region.\n  The report describes development of the project scenario based on the\n'avoid-reduce-compensate' iterative optimisation approach. The reference\nscenario balances optimal physics performance with territorial compatibility,\nimplementation risks, and costs. Environmental field investigations covering\nalmost 600 hectares of terrain - including numerous urban, economic, social,\nand technical aspects - confirmed the project's technical feasibility and\ncontributed to the preparation of essential input documents for the formal\nproject authorisation phase. The summary also highlights the initiation of\npublic dialogue as part of the authorisation process. The results of a\ncomprehensive socio-economic impact assessment, which included significant\nenvironmental effects, are presented. Even under the most conservative and\nstringent conditions, a positive benefit-cost ratio for the FCC-ee is obtained.\nFinally, the report provides a concise summary of the studies conducted to\ndocument the current state of the environment.",

    "abstract": "We present the instrument design and initial results for the Galactic Radio\nExplorer (GReX), an all-sky monitor for exceptionally bright transients in the\nradio sky. This instrument builds on the success of STARE2 to search for fast\nradio bursts (FRBs) from the Milky Way and its satellites. This instrument has\ndeployments across the globe, with wide sky coverage and searching down to\n$32\\,\\mu\\text{s}$ time resolution, enabling the discovery of new super giant\npulses. Presented here are the details of the hardware and software design of\nthe instrument, performance in sensitivity and other key metrics, and\nexperience in building a global-scale, low-cost experiment. We follow this\ndiscussion with experimental results on validation of the sensitivity via\nhydrogen-line measurements. We then update the rate of Galactic FRBs based on\nnon-detection in the time since FRB 200428. Our results suggest FRB-like events\nare even rarer than initially implied by the detection of a MJy burst from SGR\nJ1935+2154 in April 2020.",

    "abstract": "In response to the 2020 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics,\nthe Future Circular Collider (FCC) Feasibility Study was launched as an\ninternational collaboration hosted by CERN. This report describes the FCC\nintegrated programme, which consists of two stages: an electron-positron\ncollider (FCC-ee) in the first phase, serving as a high-luminosity Higgs, top,\nand electroweak factory; followed by a proton-proton collider (FCC-hh) at the\nenergy frontier in the second phase.\n  FCC-ee is designed to operate at four key centre-of-mass energies: the Z\npole, the WW production threshold, the ZH production peak, and the top/anti-top\nproduction threshold - delivering the highest possible luminosities to four\nexperiments. Over 15 years of operation, FCC-ee will produce more than 6\ntrillion Z bosons, 200 million WW pairs, nearly 3 million Higgs bosons, and 2\nmillion top anti-top pairs. Precise energy calibration at the Z pole and WW\nthreshold will be achieved through frequent resonant depolarisation of pilot\nbunches. The sequence of operation modes remains flexible.\n  FCC-hh will operate at a centre-of-mass energy of approximately 85 TeV -\nnearly an order of magnitude higher than the LHC - and is designed to deliver 5\nto 10 times the integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC. Its mass reach for direct\ndiscovery extends to several tens of TeV. In addition to proton-proton\ncollisions, FCC-hh is capable of supporting ion-ion, ion-proton, and\nlepton-hadron collision modes.\n  This second volume of the Feasibility Study Report presents the complete\ndesign of the FCC-ee collider, its operation and staging strategy, the\nfull-energy booster and injector complex, required accelerator technologies,\nsafety concepts, and technical infrastructure. It also includes the design of\nthe FCC-hh hadron collider, development of high-field magnets, hadron injector\noptions, and key technical systems for FCC-hh.",

Surface acoustic wave\n(SAW) resonator-based oscillators offer compact form factors and low phase\nnoise due to their short mechanical wavelengths and high quality (Q) factors.\nHowever, their small footprint makes them vulnerable to environmental\nvariation, resulting in their poor long-term frequency stability. Injection\nlocking is widely used to suppress frequency drift of lasers and oscillators by\nsynchronizing to an ultra-stable reference. Here, we demonstrate injection\nlocking of a 1-GHz SAW phononic crystal oscillator, achieving 40-dB phase noise\nreduction at low offset frequencies. Compared to a free-running SAW oscillator,\nwhich typically exhibits frequency drifts of several hundred hertz over\nminutes, the injection-locked oscillator reduces the frequency deviation to\nbelow 0.35 Hz. We also investigated the locking range and oscillator dynamics\nin the injection pulling region. The demonstrated injection-locked SAW\noscillator could find applications in high-performance portable\ntelecommunications and sensing systems.",

The approach relies on a ridge-type regularization\nfor high-dimensional matrix inversion in the objective function of the GCov.\nThe RGCov estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. We\nprovide the conditions under which it can reach semiparametric efficiency and\ndiscuss the selection of the optimal regularization parameter. We also examine\nthe diagonal GCov estimator, which simplifies the computation of the objective\nfunction. The GCov-based specification test, and the test for nonlinear serial\ndependence (NLSD) are extended to the regularized RGCov specification and RNLSD\ntests with asymptotic Chi-square distributions. Simulation studies show that\nthe RGCov estimator and the regularized tests perform well in the high\ndimensional setting. We apply the RGCov to estimate the mixed causal and\nnoncausal VAR model of stock prices of green energy companies.",

While RQMC can be far more accurate than plain\nMonte Carlo (MC) it remains difficult to get confidence intervals on RQMC\nestimates. We investigate some empirical Bernstein confidence intervals (EBCI)\nand hedged betting confidence intervals (HBCI), both from Waudby-Smith and\nRamdas (2024), when the random variable of interest is subject to known bounds.\nWhen there are $N$ integrand evaluations partitioned into $R$ independent\nreplicates of $n=N/R$ RQMC points, and the RQMC variance is\n$\\Theta(n^{-\\theta})$, then an oracle minimizing the width of a Bennett\nconfidence interval would choose $n =\\Theta(N^{1/(\\theta+1)})$. The resulting\nintervals have a width that is $\\Theta(N^{-\\theta/(\\theta+1)})$. Our empirical\ninvestigations had optimal values of $n$ grow slowly with $N$, HBCI intervals\nthat were usually narrower than the EBCI ones, and optimal values of $n$ for\nHBCI that were equal to or smaller than the ones for the oracle.",

To address the limitations of both methods, we propose a hybrid\nframework that uses semidefinite programming to find a representation of the\nlinear operator, then learns an approximate mapping into and out of the space\nthat the operator propagates.

Analogously, in temporal Fourier optics the\ncomplex temporal spectrum can be manipulated for ultrafast pulse-shaping. We\npresent here a tutorial on the emerging field of spatiotemporal Fourier optics\nwhereby the spatial and temporal spectra are manipulated jointly to produce\nspatiotemporally structured optical fields that display unique propagation\ncharacteristics. In this tutorial, we focus on a subset of the overall class of\nnon-separable spatiotemporally structured fields; namely, cylindrically\nsymmetric fields in which each radial spatial frequency is associated with a\nsingle wavelength. This subset of fields comprises propagation-invariant wave\npackets that travel rigidly in linear media at a tunable group velocity, and\nincludes space-time wave packets and other closely related structured fields.\nWe describe a spatiotemporal Fourier synthesis system capable of preparing\narbitrary optical fields belonging to this subclass.",

Our findings reveal significant\nlimitations in third-party annotations-whether provided by human annotators or\nlarge language models (LLMs)-in faithfully representing authors' private\nstates. However, LLMs outperform human annotators nearly across the board. We\nfurther explore methods to improve third-party annotation quality. We find that\ndemographic similarity between first-party authors and third-party human\nannotators enhances annotation performance. While incorporating first-party\ndemographic information into prompts leads to a marginal but statistically\nsignificant improvement in LLMs' performance.

Combining\ntools from It\\^o calculus and Malliavin calculus, we are able to establish the\nMalliavin differentiability of the solution with sharp moment bounds for the\nMalliavin derivatives. As an easy consequence, we obtain the spatial ergodicity\nof the solution to SNLW that leads to a law of large number result for the\nspatial integrals of the solution over $[-R, R]$ as $R\\to\\infty$. One of the\nmain results of this paper is the obtention of the corresponding Gaussian\nfluctuation with rate of convergence in Wasserstein distance. To achieve this\ngoal, we adapt the discrete Malliavin-Stein bound from Peccati, Sol\\'e, Taqqu,\nand Utzet ({\\it Ann.

Our work\nsubstantially improves our previous results (\\textit{Trans.~Amer.~Math.~Soc.},\n2024) on the linear equation that heavily relied on the explicit chaos\nexpansion of the solution. In current work, we also establish a functional\nversion, an almost sure version of the central limit theorems, and the\n(quantitative) asymptotic independence of spatial integrals from the solution.\nThe asymptotic independence result is established based on an observation of L.\nPimentel (\\textit{Ann.~Probab.}, 2022) and a further adaptation of Tudor's\ngeneralization (\\textit{Trans.~Amer.~Math.~Soc.}, 2025) to the Poisson setting.",

To address these challenges,\nwe propose Proof-of-TBI, a medical diagnosis support system that integrates\nmultiple fine-tuned vision-language models with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning large\nlanguage model (LLM). Our approach fine-tunes multiple vision-language models\nusing a labeled dataset of TBI MRI scans, training them to diagnose TBI\nsymptoms effectively. The predictions from these models are aggregated through\na consensus-based decision-making process. The system evaluates the predictions\nfrom all fine-tuned vision language models using the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, a\nmodel that has demonstrated remarkable reasoning performance, to produce the\nmost accurate final diagnosis. The LLM Agents orchestrates interactions between\nthe vision-language models and the reasoning LLM, managing the final\ndecision-making process with transparency, reliability, and automation. This\nend-to-end decision-making workflow combines the vision-language model\nconsortium with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, enabled by custom prompt\nengineering by the LLM agents. The prototype for the proposed platform was\ndeveloped in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research team in Newport\nNews, Virginia, incorporating five fine-tuned vision-language models.

In addition, the reduced set of labeled data is often\nrandomly sampled, neglecting the selection of more informative samples.

It integrates DeepFA into a co-training setup that\nimplements two cooperative networks to mitigate confirmation bias from\npseudo-labels. The method starts with a reduced set of labeled samples by\nwarming up the networks with supervised CL. Afterward and at regular epoch\nintervals, label propagation is performed on the 2D projections of the\nnetworks' deep features. Next, the most reliable pseudo-labels are exchanged\nbetween networks in a cross-training fashion, while the most meaningful samples\nare annotated and added into the labeled set.

    "abstract": "A semi-analytic model is developed to study the effects of kappa-distributed\nlighter constituents and the associated kappa-modified polarization force on\nthe classical Jeans instability in dust molecular clouds (DMCs). The\nconstitutive electrons and ions are considered to follow a nonthermal\nkappa-velocity distribution law, while the constitutive massive dust grains are\ntreated as the EiBI-gravitating fluids. A linearized quadratic dispersion\nrelation is derived using spherical normal mode analysis. The resulting\ndispersion relation and its corresponding modified instability criteria are\nanalyzed in the hydrodynamic and kinetic regimes. The oscillatory and\npropagating mode characteristics are illustratively analyzed. It is seen that\nthe EiBI gravity introduces a new velocity term in the dispersion relation. In\ncontrast, the nonthermal kappa-distributed constituents significantly enhance\nthe polarization force against their respective Maxwellian counterparts. The\nkappa-modified polarization force and the negative EiBI gravity parameter have\ndestabilizing influences, unlike the positive EiBI parameter. An enhanced\npolarization interaction parameter and a positive EiBI parameter reduce the\nreal normalized frequency. Consequently, the phase velocity exhibits strong\ndispersion, increasing with wavenumber until reaching saturation, after which\nit transitions into a weakly dispersive regime. These findings provide new\ninsights into the formation of smaller astrophysical structures via the\nnon-local Jeans instability in the ultracompact HII regions of dense DMCs.",

In this paper, an analytical\nframework is presented that is based on one-dimensional (1D) finite point\nprocesses, namely the binomial point process (BPP) and the finite homogeneous\nPoisson point process (HPPP), to model the spatial locations of UAV-Base\nStations (UAV-BSs).

Subsequently, coverage probability\nanalysis under the two spatial models is conducted, and exact-form expressions\nare derived. In an attempt to reduce the analytical complexity of the derived\nexpressions, a dominant interferer-based approach is also investigated.\nFinally, the main outcomes of this paper are extensively validated by empirical\ndata collected in an air-to-ground measurement campaign.

One challenge of\nparticular significance to machine learning practitioners is that one bird\nspecies label is applied to each audio recording, but frequently other sounds\nare also captured including other bird species, other animal sounds,\nanthropogenic and other ambient sounds. These non-target bird species sounds\ncan result in dataset labeling discrepancies referred to as label noise. In\nthis work we present a cleaning process consisting of audio preprocessing\nfollowed by dimensionality reduction and unsupervised outlier detection (UOD)\nto reduce the label noise in a dataset derived from Xeno-Canto recordings. We\ninvestigate three neural network dimensionality reduction techniques: two\nflavors of convolutional autoencoders and variational deep embedding (VaDE\n(Jiang, 2017)). While both methods show some degree of effectiveness at\ndetecting outliers for most bird species datasets, we found significant\nvariation in the performance of the methods from one species to the next.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the recent discovery of situations where cosmological\nfluctuations recohere during inflation, we investigate the relationship between\nquantum recoherence (late-time purification after a transient phase of\ndecoherence), adiabaticity, and Markovianity. To that end, we study a simple\nsetup of two linearly-coupled harmonic oscillators, and compute the purity of\none oscillator when the interaction is switched off. We find that there exists\na critical value for the coupling strength below which the purity oscillates\nand above which it decays exponentially. This decay cannot be captured with\nperturbation theory, hence, decoherence is always a non-perturbative\nphenomenon. When the interaction is turned off, the purity either freezes to\nits value prior to the turn-off, or it smoothly goes back to a value very close\nto one (recoherence). This depends on the rate at which the turn-off occurs. We\nthus develop a new adiabatic-expansion scheme and find complete recoherence at\nany finite order in the inverse turn-off time. Therefore, decoherence is always\na non-adiabatic effect. The critical value of the turn-off time above which\nrecoherence takes place is then expressed in terms of the other time scales of\nthe problem. Finally, we show that even though the dynamics of the system is\nnever Markovian, when decoherence takes place, it can always be interpreted as\nresulting from a locally Markovian process. We introduce a new measure of\nMarkovianity dubbed the Bures velocity and use it to optimise Markovian\napproximations.",

To ensure the robustness and consistency of the current\nforward modeling approach from the community, we conducted a systematic\ncomparison of various hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes. Using four\ngrid-based hydrodynamics codes (FARGO3D, Idefix, Athena++, PLUTO) and a\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics code (Phantom), we simulated a protoplanetary\ndisk with an embedded giant planet. We then used two radiative transfer codes\n(mcfost, RADMC-3D) to calculate disk temperatures and create synthetic 12CO\ncubes. Finally, we retrieved the location of the planet from the synthetic\ncubes using DISCMINER. We found strong consistency between the hydrodynamics\ncodes, particularly in the density and velocity perturbations associated with\nplanet-driven spirals. We also found a good agreement between the two radiative\ntransfer codes: the disk temperature in mcfost and RADMC-3D models agrees\nwithin $\\lesssim 3~\\%$ everywhere in the domain. In synthetic $^{12}$CO channel\nmaps, this results in brightness temperature differences within $\\pm1.5$ K in\nall our models. This good agreement ensures consistent retrieval of planet's\nradial/azimuthal location with only a few % of scatter, with velocity\nperturbations varying $\\lesssim 20~\\%$ among the models. Notably, while the\nplanet-opened gap is shallower in the Phantom simulation, we found that this\ndoes not impact the planet location retrieval. In summary, our results\ndemonstrate that any combination of the tested hydrodynamics and radiative\ntransfer codes can be used to reliably model and interpret planet-driven\nkinematic perturbations.",

Second, for the rapid multi-modal fusion of multi-source\nheterogeneous time series, a multi-channel neural network combined with a\nself-attention mechanism is used for dynamic feature extraction. Key feature\nscreening and aggregation are achieved through a differentiable gating network.\nFinally, a collaborative search process combining a genetic algorithm and Monte\nCarlo tree search is proposed to find the ideal intervention strategy,\nachieving global optimization.

    "abstract": "Racial disparities in recidivism remain a persistent challenge within the\ncriminal justice system, increasingly exacerbated by the adoption of\nalgorithmic risk assessment tools. Past works have primarily focused on bias\ninduced by these tools, treating recidivism as a binary outcome. Limited\nattention has been given to non-algorithmic factors (including socioeconomic\nones) in driving racial disparities from a systemic perspective. To that end,\nthis work presents a multi-stage causal framework to investigate the advent and\nextent of disparities by considering time-to-recidivism rather than a simple\nbinary outcome. The framework captures interactions among races, the algorithm,\nand contextual factors. This work introduces the notion of counterfactual\nracial disparity and offers a formal test using survival analysis that can be\nconducted with observational data to assess if differences in recidivism arise\nfrom algorithmic bias, contextual factors, or their interplay. In particular,\nit is formally established that if sufficient statistical evidence for\ndifferences across racial groups is observed, it would support rejecting the\nnull hypothesis that non-algorithmic factors (including socioeconomic ones) do\nnot affect recidivism. An empirical study applying this framework to the COMPAS\ndataset reveals that short-term recidivism patterns do not exhibit racial\ndisparities when controlling for risk scores. However, statistically\nsignificant disparities emerge with longer follow-up periods, particularly for\nlow-risk groups. This suggests that factors beyond algorithmic scores, possibly\nstructural disparities in housing, employment, and social support, may\naccumulate and exacerbate recidivism risks over time. This underscores the need\nfor policy interventions extending beyond algorithmic improvements to address\nbroader influences on recidivism trajectories.",

With the most up-to-date strong\nline calibration based on NIRSpec observations, we find that the MZR shows a\nmetal enhancement of $\\sim0.2$ dex at high mass end in overdense environments.\nHowever, compared to the local Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), our\ngalaxy sample at $z>5$ shows a metal deficiency of $\\sim0.2$ dex relative to\nFMR predictions. We explain the observed trend of FMR with a simple analytical\nmodel, and we favor dilution from intense gas accretion over outflow to explain\nthe metallicity properties at $z>5$. Those high redshift galaxies are likely in\na rapid gas accretion phase when their metal and gas contents are in a\nnon-equilibrium state. According to model predictions, the protocluster members\nare closer to the gas equilibrium state than field galaxies and thus have\nhigher metallicity and are closer to the local FMR. Our results suggest that\nthe accelerated star formation during protocluster assembly likely plays a key\nrole in shaping the observed MZR and FMR, indicating a potentially earlier\nonset of metal enrichment in overdense environments at $z\\approx5-7$.",

One of its assumptions is that of dynamical equilibrium\nwhile the dwarfs are under the influence of Galactic tides. We carry out\ntailored simulations of Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sculptor and Ursa Minor and\nanalyse the accuracy of dark matter density profiles and annihilation rates\n(J-factors) recovered with the Jeans equation, using pyGravSphere. We find that\ntides do not significantly affect the quality of density profile inference when\nusing a bound sample of stars in the 5 simulated dwarfs; however, pyGravSphere\ntends to underestimate the inner densities of dwarf galaxies, which, together\nwith tidal mass loss, leads to an inference of flatter density slopes, although\nall of our dwarfs have cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White haloes. The recovered\nJ-factors are generally underestimated. While the difference with the true\nJ-factor is small, the error bars are often underestimated and must be at least\nof order 0.1 dex to encompass the true J-factor. We also test the accuracy of\nthe Wolf et al. 2010 mass estimator and find that it can be sensitive to\norbital stage and eccentricity. Still, for our sample of dwarf galaxies, the\nestimates agree with the truth within 10%. Consistency of our simulated dwarfs\nwith the mass-concentration relation in LambdaCDM requires a light Milky Way,\nor limited action of tides, which may be in tension with a \"tidal stirring\"\norigin of dwarf spheroidals.",

Here we develop an\nefficient formalism for analyzing the time-dependent response of a star to the\nremoval of a fraction ($\\lesssim 10\\%$) of its mass. This model predicts that\nmass loss results in a decrease in the average density of low-mass ($\\lesssim\n0.7 M_{\\odot}$) stars. Contrarily, higher-mass stars exhibit an increase in\ntheir average density, such that the change is more pronounced for larger mass\nlosses, and stars with masses $\\sim 1.5-2 M_{\\odot}$ experience the largest\nsuch increase. We predict that the final energy of the star post-mass-loss\n(i.e., the ``surviving core'') is effectively given by the binding energy of\nthe original star interior to the radius from which mass is removed, i.e., the\nfinal core energy is agnostic to the process that removes the mass and -- as a\ncorollary -- tidal heating is comparatively insignificant. We find excellent\nagreement between our predictions and one-dimensional Eulerian simulations of a\nstar undergoing mass loss, and three-dimensional Lagrangian simulations of\npartial TDEs. We conclude that 1) partially disrupted stars are not\nsignificantly heated via tidal dissipation, 2) evolved and moderately massive\n($\\gtrsim 1.5 M_{\\odot}$) stars can most readily survive many repeated\nstripping events, and 3) progressively dimmer flares -- observed in some\nrepeating partial TDE candidates -- could be explained by the increase in the\ndensity of the star post-mass-loss.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning holds the promise of equipping robots with versatile\nskills by learning from expert demonstrations. However, policies trained on\nfinite datasets often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution.\nIn this work, we present a unified perspective on the generalization capability\nof imitation learning, grounded in both information theorey and data\ndistribution property. We first show that the generalization gap can be upper\nbounded by (i) the conditional information bottleneck on intermediate\nrepresentations and (ii) the mutual information between the model parameters\nand the training dataset. This characterization provides theoretical guidance\nfor designing effective training strategies in imitation learning, particularly\nin determining whether to freeze, fine-tune, or train large pretrained encoders\n(e.g., vision-language models or vision foundation models) from scratch to\nachieve better generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high\nconditional entropy from input to output induces a flatter likelihood\nlandscape, thereby reducing the upper bound on the generalization gap. In\naddition, it shortens the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) escape time from\nsharp local minima, which may increase the likelihood of reaching global optima\nunder fixed optimization budgets. These insights explain why imitation learning\noften exhibits limited generalization and underscore the importance of not only\nscaling the diversity of input data but also enriching the variability of\noutput labels conditioned on the same input.",

This paper introduces the probabilistic\nrisk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques\nfrom high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new\nchallenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying\npotential risks, estimating likelihood and severity bands, and explicitly\ndocumenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate\ngranularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into\na risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. It\nintroduces three methodological advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis\nprovides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI\nsystem aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk\npathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts\nusing bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3)\nUncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and\nexplicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or\nlimited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods\nby integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for\nlifecycle decisions.

This field offers advantages such as\nhigher sensitivity due to zenith-crossing observations and reduced\ngeostationary radio-frequency interference, but also poses challenges due to\nthe presence of the bright central source. After constructing a wide-field sky\nmodel, we process a single 6-hour night of 3C196 observations using\ndirection-independent and direction-dependent calibration, followed by a\nresidual foreground subtraction with a machine learned Gaussian process\nregression (ML-GPR). A bias correction is necessary to account for signal\nsuppression in the GPR step.

However, it is still unclear how scalable oversight itself scales. To\naddress this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of\nsuccessful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the\nsystem being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game\nbetween capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific Elo\nscores that are a piecewise-linear function of their general intelligence, with\ntwo plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and task saturation. We\nvalidate our framework with a modified version of the game Nim and then apply\nit to four oversight games: Mafia, Debate, Backdoor Code and Wargames. For each\ngame, we find scaling laws that approximate how domain performance depends on\ngeneral AI system capability. We then build on our findings in a theoretical\nstudy of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which trusted models\noversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted models in the\nnext step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and derive\nnumerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of oversight\nlevels to maximize the probability of oversight success.

We performed an experiment to test whether\nbones of endothermic animals, having potentially lost their ability to adapt to\nthermal cycling, exhibit reduced resistance to thermal fatigue compared to\nectothermic animals, which may have retained this adaptive trait due to their\nenvironmental conditions. The change in stiffness were determined using shifts\nin the resonant peaks of the frequency spectrum obtained from Resonant\nUltrasonic Spectroscopy (RUS). To achieve this, samples of compact (cortical)\nand spongy bone tissue were extracted and polished before undergoing a 29-day\nperiod of thermal cycling. The changes in the resonance frequencies were then\nobserved. Changes in resonant frequencies imply corresponding changes in\nelastic constants. The primary findings indicated that bones from ectothermic\nspecies exhibited minimal changes in elastic properties compared to those from\nendothermic species, as evidenced by the smaller shifts in resonant peak\nmagnitudes following thermal cycling.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Neural Operators\n(PODNO) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) dominated by\nhigh-frequency components. Building on the structure of Fourier Neural\nOperators (FNO), PODNO replaces the Fourier transform with (inverse)\northonormal transforms derived from the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)\nmethod to construct the integral kernel. Due to the optimality of POD basis,\nthe PODNO has potential to outperform FNO in both accuracy and computational\nefficiency for high-frequency problems. From analysis point of view, we\nestablished the universality of a generalization of PODNO, termed as\nGeneralized Spectral Operator (GSO). In addition, we evaluate PODNO's\nperformance numerically on dispersive equations such as the Nonlinear\nSchrodinger (NLS) equation and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation.",

To effectively assess the quality of the generated 3D data, there\nis a need for a reliable 3D evaluation tool. Unfortunately, existing 3D\nevaluation metrics often overlook the geometric quality of generated assets or\nmerely rely on black-box multimodal large language models for coarse\nassessment. In this paper, we introduce Eval3D, a fine-grained, interpretable\nevaluation tool that can faithfully evaluate the quality of generated 3D assets\nbased on various distinct yet complementary criteria. Our key observation is\nthat many desired properties of 3D generation, such as semantic and geometric\nconsistency, can be effectively captured by measuring the consistency among\nvarious foundation models and tools. We thus leverage a diverse set of models\nand tools as probes to evaluate the inconsistency of generated 3D assets across\ndifferent aspects.

However, designing such a\nsensor suite involves multiple critical design decisions, such as sensor\nselection, component placement, thermal and power limitations, compute\nrequirements, networking, synchronization, and calibration. While the\nimportance of these key aspects is widely recognized, they are often overlooked\nin academia or retained as proprietary knowledge within large corporations. To\nimprove this situation, we present Boxi, a tightly integrated sensor payload\nthat enables robust autonomy of robots in the wild. This paper discusses the\nimpact of payload design decisions made to optimize algorithmic performance for\ndownstream tasks, specifically focusing on state estimation and mapping. Boxi\nis equipped with a variety of sensors: two LiDARs, 10 RGB cameras including\nhigh-dynamic range, global shutter, and rolling shutter models, an RGB-D\ncamera, 7 inertial measurement units (IMUs) of varying precision, and a dual\nantenna RTK GNSS system. Our analysis shows that time synchronization,\ncalibration, and sensor modality have a crucial impact on the state estimation\nperformance. We frame this analysis in the context of cost considerations and\nenvironment-specific challenges. We also present a mobile sensor suite\n`cookbook` to serve as a comprehensive guideline, highlighting generalizable\nkey design considerations and lessons learned during the development of Boxi.\nFinally, we demonstrate the versatility of Boxi being used in a variety of\napplications in real-world scenarios, contributing to robust autonomy.

These equations have an additional requirement, which is\nthe choice of what defines the tangent direction of the Finsler manifold, since\nthe velocity and momentum are not parallel in general. After choosing the\nmomentum as the Finsler direction and to define the center of mass, we give the\ncomplete equations of motion in 3 spatial dimensions, which we find coincide to\npreviously known equations for Finsler spinoptics, and novel equations in 4\ndimensions for massive and massless dynamical systems.",

While an active attack literature\nexists to evaluate machine learning models or synthetic data release, we\ncurrently lack comparable methods for fixed aggregate statistics, in particular\nwhen only a limited number of statistics are released. We here propose an\ninference attack framework against fixed aggregate statistics and an attribute\ninference attack called DeSIA. We instantiate DeSIA against the U.S. Census\nPPMF dataset and show it to strongly outperform reconstruction-based attacks.\nIn particular, we show DeSIA to be highly effective at identifying vulnerable\nusers, achieving a true positive rate of 0.14 at a false positive rate of\n$10^{-3}$. We then show DeSIA to perform well against users whose attributes\ncannot be verified and when varying the number of aggregate statistics and\nlevel of noise addition. We also perform an extensive ablation study of DeSIA\nand show how DeSIA can be successfully adapted to the membership inference\ntask. Overall, our results show that aggregation alone is not sufficient to\nprotect privacy, even when a relatively small number of aggregates are being\nreleased, and emphasize the need for formal privacy mechanisms and testing\nbefore aggregate statistics are released.",

The MNFs, composed of polyacrylonitrile\n(PAN) embedded with MnFe_2O_4 nanoparticles, were synthesized via\nelectrospinning and exhibited high stability and catalytic efficiency. The\ndegradation process was driven by hydroxyl radical (OH) formation through\nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation on the MNF surface. The results showed that\nTC was first adsorbed onto the MNFs before undergoing oxidation, with treatment\nefficiency increasing with H2O2 concentration up to an optimum point, due to\nincreased OH scavenging by H_2O_2. A heterogeneous dynamic kinetic model (DKM)\nwas developed to describe the degradation mechanism, incorporating reactive\noxygen species (ROS) generation, catalyst surface inactivation, and polymer\nstrip-ping effects. Furthermore, the application of an alternating magnetic\nfield significantly accelerated the reaction rate, likely due to localized\nheating effects. This study highlights the potential of MNFs as a scalable,\nreusable and efficient alternative for antibiotic-contaminated wastewater\ntreatment, offering advantages over conventional homogeneous Fenton processes\nby minimizing iron sludge formation and broadening the operational pH range.",

Recent advances in\nmultiplex imaging technologies have enabled high-resolution profiling of\ncellular phenotypes and their spatial distributions, revealing critical roles\nof tissue structures such as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in shaping\nimmune responses and influencing disease progression. However, existing methods\nfor analyzing spatial tissue structures often rely on hard clustering or\nadjacency-based spatial models, which are limited in capturing the nuanced and\noverlapping nature of cellular communities. To address these challenges, we\ndevelop a novel spatial topic modeling framework for the unsupervised discovery\nof spatial tissue structures in multiplex imaging data.\n  Results: We propose TopSpace, a novel Bayesian spatial topic model that\nintegrates Gaussian processes into latent Dirichlet allocation to flexibly\nmodel spatial dependencies in tissue microenvironments. By leveraging the\nBayesian framework, TopSpace supports multicellular mixed-membership clustering\nand offers key inferential advantages, including robust uncertainty\nquantification and data-driven determination of the number of multicellular\nmicroenvironments. We demonstrate the utility of TopSpace through simulations\nand a case study on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) data.

As we pass\nthrough the branch cut we apply a $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ automorphism to the\nalgebra-valued and group-valued fields of the theory. Two instances of models\nin this class have appeared in the literature and we explain how these fit into\nour general construction. We generalise both to the case of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$-twistings, and for each we construct two further deformations,\nleading to four doubly-deformed models.\n  Mapping the cylinder to a sphere, a novel feature of the construction is that\nthe branch points are at the simple poles corresponding to the ends of the\ncylinder. As a result, the untwisted and twisted models have the same number of\ndegrees of freedom. While twisting does not always lead to inequivalent models,\nwe show that if we use the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ outer automorphism of\n$\\mathfrak{g}^{\\mathbb{C}} = \\mathfrak{sl}(n;\\mathbb{C})$ to twist, then the\nuntwisted and twisted models have different symmetries, hence the latter are\nnew integrable sigma models.",

    "abstract": "Ising machines as hardware solvers of combinatorial optimization problems\n(COPs) can efficiently explore large solution spaces due to their inherent\nparallelism and physics-based dynamics. Many important COP classes such as\nsatisfiability (SAT) assume arbitrary interactions between problem variables,\nwhile most Ising machines only support pairwise (second-order) interactions.\nThis necessitates translation of higher-order interactions to pair-wise, which\ntypically results in extra variables not corresponding to problem variables,\nand a larger problem for the Ising machine to solve than the original problem.\nThis in turn can significantly increase time-to-solution and/or degrade\nsolution accuracy. In this paper, considering a representative CMOS-compatible\nclass of Ising machines, we propose a practical design to enable direct\nhardware support for higher order interactions. By minimizing the overhead of\nproblem translation and mapping, our design leads to up to 4x lower\ntime-to-solution without compromising solution accuracy.",

    "abstract": "High quality wavelength calibration is crucial for science cases like\nradial-velocity studies of exoplanets, the search for a possible variation of\nfundamental constants, and the redshift drift experiment. However, for\nstate-of-the-art spectrographs it has become difficult to verify the wavelength\ncalibration on sky, because no astrophysical source provides spectra with\nsufficiently stable or accurate wavelength information. We therefore propose to\nuse iodine absorption cells to validate the wavelength calibration. Observing a\nbright and featureless star through the iodine cell emulates an astrophysical\ntarget with exactly known spectral features that can be analyzed like any other\nscience target, allowing to verify the wavelength calibration derived from the\ninternal calibration sources and to identify systematics in the data\nprocessing. As demonstration, we temporarily installed an I$_2$ absorption cell\nat ESPRESSO. Employing a full forward modeling approach of the I$_2$ spectrum,\nincluding the instrumental line-spread function, we demonstrate wavelength\ncalibration accuracy at the level of a few m/s. We also show that wavelength\nmeasurements do depend on the geometry of the light-injection into the\nspectrograph fibers. This highlights the importance of probing exactly the same\nlight path as science targets, something not possible with internal calibration\nsources alone. We also demonstrate excellent radial-velocity stability at the\n<20 cm/s level in a full end-to-end fashion, from sky to data product. Our\nstudy therefore showcases the great potential of absorption cells for the\nverification and long-term monitoring of the wavelength calibration as well as\nthe unique insights they can provide.",

    "abstract": "Recently, an exact black hole solution in non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills\ntheory was obtained, and its quasinormal modes were subsequently analyzed using\nthe JWKB approximation \\cite{Gogoi:2024vcx}. However, we demonstrate that this\nanalysis lacks sufficient accuracy when studying modes with $\\ell \\leq n$,\nwhere $\\ell$ is the multipole number and $n$ is the overtone number. To address\nthis, we compute the quasinormal frequencies using the precise Leaver method.\nOur results show that while the fundamental mode deviates only slightly from\nthe Schwarzschild value, the first few overtones exhibit significantly larger\ndeviations, with the discrepancy growing rapidly with the overtone number.\nMoreover, beginning with the second overtone, we observe a striking phenomenon:\nthe real part of the frequency tends to zero quickly as the non-minimal\ncoupling constant increases. This combination of spectral stability in the\nfundamental mode and high sensitivity of the overtones suggests that the\nYang-Mills contribution primarily deforms the metric in the near-horizon\nregion, while the geometry quickly transitions back to a Schwarzschild-like\nform at larger radii. In addition, we compute the grey-body factors and confirm\nthat they represent a more stable characteristic of the geometry, exhibiting a\ncorrespondence with quasinormal modes already at the first multipole. The\nYang-Mills coupling enhances the grey-body factors, further increasing the\ntransmission probability.",

Our notion, dubbed\nboundaried kernelization, is inspired by protrusions and protrusion\nreplacement, which are tools in meta-kernelization [Bodlaender et al. J'ACM\n2016].

    "abstract": "Code smells are indicators of potential design flaws in source code and do\nnot appear alone but in combination with other smells, creating complex\ninteractions. While existing literature classifies these smell interactions\ninto collocated, coupled, and inter-smell relations, however, to the best of\nour knowledge, no research has used the existing knowledge of code smells and\n(or) their relationships with other code smells in the detection of code\nsmells. This gap highlights the need for deeper investigation into how code\nsmells interact with each other and assist in their detection. This would\nimprove the overall comprehension of code smells and how they interact more\neffectively. This study presents a novel taxonomy and a proposed classification\nscheme for the possible code smell interactions considering a specific\nprogramming language as a domain. This paper has dealt with one scenario called\nInter smell detection within the domain. The experiments have been carried out\nusing several popular machine learning (ML) models. Results primarily show the\npresence of code smell interactions namely Inter-smell Detection within domain.\nThese results are compatible with the available facts in the literature\nsuggesting a promising direction for future research in code smell detection.",

Unlike existing methods (e.g., NeRF and 3D Gaussian\nSplatting), which struggle with view-dependent effects, RGS-DR utilizes a 2D\nGaussian surfel representation to accurately estimate geometry and surface\nnormals, an essential property for high-quality inverse rendering. Our approach\nexplicitly models geometric and material properties through learnable\nprimitives rasterized into a deferred shading pipeline, effectively reducing\nrendering artifacts and preserving sharp reflections. By employing a\nmulti-level cube mipmap, RGS-DR accurately approximates environment lighting\nintegrals, facilitating high-quality reconstruction and relighting. A residual\npass with spherical-mipmap-based directional encoding further refines the\nappearance modeling. Experiments demonstrate that RGS-DR achieves high-quality\nreconstruction and rendering quality for shiny objects, often outperforming\nreconstruction-exclusive state-of-the-art methods incapable of relighting.",

We use the weakly two-dimensional nonlinear shallow water equations\n[Ryrie (J.

Fluid Mech.,\nvol. 658, 2010, p. 166)], we solve for the alongshore flow using the method of\ncharacteristics and show that it differs from previous solutions. Since the\ncross-shore solution assumes a constant forward-moving characteristic variable,\n$\\alpha$, we term our solution the `small-$\\theta$, constant-$\\alpha$'\nsolution. We test our solution in large-scale experiments with data from\nfifteen wave cases, including normally incident waves and obliquely incident\nwaves generated using the wall reflection method. We measure water depths and\nfluid velocities using in situ sensors within the surf and swash zones and\ntrack shoreline motion using quantitative imaging. The data show that the basic\nassumptions of the theory (Snell's law of refraction and constant-$\\alpha$) are\nsatisfied and that our solution accurately predicts the swash flow.

    "abstract": "Power systems are currently undergoing a rapid paradigm change in their\noperation. Centralised energy production is being replaced by a number of\nDistributed Generation (DG) units that are placed at different locations and\nvoltage levels in power networks. These distributed units are mostly based on\nrenewable energy technologies, like wind turbines and photovoltaic cells and\nare commonly interfaced to the grid via power electronic converters. These\nsources reduce energy system dependency on conventional generation units based\non fossil fuels. At the same time, this shift introduces technical challenges\nfor the safe and reliable operation of electricity network since DG sources do\nnot inherently provide the grid regulation services of conventional,\ncentralised generation units. Moreover, the increased penetration of renewable\nenergy sources and their converter-based interfaces is creating voltage\ndeviation and voltage stability issues in distribution networks. These issues\nrange from overvoltages during hours of peak renewable generation, reverse\npower flows and sudden voltage drops due to the variable nature of renewable\nenergy production. All of the above jeopardise the reliable operation of the\ndistribution networks that were not originally designed to accommodate for\nthese effects. The objective of this thesis is to propose novel techniques for\nthe accurate assessment of the DG impact on voltage stability in distribution\nnet works and investigate how the control capabilities of converter-based\ninterfaces of DG units can be harnessed to improve stability margins and\noverall system robustness and performance.",

These biases can typically be estimated through\nmeasurements collected over time using, for example, Kalman filters. To avoid\nrecomputation of the entire GP model when better estimates of the inputs used\nin the training data become available, we introduce a technique for updating a\ntrained GP model to incorporate updated estimates of the inputs.

In this setting, the classical singularities are replaced\nby quantum-induced shell-crossing singularities, which are resolved through\nweak solutions such as shock waves. By formulating the dynamics in a\ngeneralized Painlev\\'e--Gullstrand coordinate system, we derive a first-order\npartial differential equation that governs the propagation of the shock\nsurface, while enforcing metric continuity via thin-shell junction conditions.\nTo handle the non-trivial square-root structures and source terms that arise in\nthese equations, we develop a novel numerical scheme capable of simulating\nquantum-corrected spacetime dynamics. Our results show that for small mass\nblack holes near the Planck scale, the shock surface remains timelike and is\nshielded behind both inner and outer horizons. In the long-time limit, the\nshock accumulates the entire mass of the collapsing star. In contrast, for\nlarger black hole masses, the shock surface develops spacelike segments,\nindicating a transition in the effective dynamics driven by quantum effects.\nThe framework also reveals discontinuities in curvature invariants across the\nshock surface, which can be traced back to stress-energy redistributions caused\nby quantum effects. Overall, the proposed computational framework provides a\ngeneral tool for modeling quantum-corrected gravitational collapse and offers\nnew insights into black hole formations, singularity resolution, and the\ninterplay between quantum geometry effects and effective spacetime structures.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a switched systems approach for extending the dwell-time\nof an autonomous agent during GPS-denied operation by leveraging memory\nregressor extension (MRE) techniques. To maintain accurate trajectory tracking\ndespite unknown dynamics and environmental disturbances, the agent periodically\nacquires access to GPS, allowing it to correct accumulated state estimation\nerrors. The motivation for this work arises from the limitations of existing\nswitched system approaches, where increasing estimation errors during\nGPS-denied intervals and overly conservative dwell-time conditions restrict the\noperational efficiency of the agent. By leveraging MRE techniques during\nGPS-available intervals, the developed method refines the estimates of unknown\nsystem parameters, thereby enabling longer and more reliable operation in\nGPS-denied environments. A Lyapunov-based switched-system stability analysis\nestablishes that improved parameter estimates obtained through concurrent\nlearning allow extended operation in GPS-denied intervals without compromising\nclosed-loop system stability. Simulation results validate the theoretical\nfindings, demonstrating dwell-time extensions and enhanced trajectory tracking\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of distributed multi-view representation learning. In\nthis problem, $K$ agents observe each one distinct, possibly statistically\ncorrelated, view and independently extracts from it a suitable representation\nin a manner that a decoder that gets all $K$ representations estimates\ncorrectly the hidden label. In the absence of any explicit coordination between\nthe agents, a central question is: what should each agent extract from its view\nthat is necessary and sufficient for a correct estimation at the decoder? In\nthis paper, we investigate this question from a generalization error\nperspective. First, we establish several generalization bounds in terms of the\nrelative entropy between the distribution of the representations extracted from\ntraining and \"test\" datasets and a data-dependent symmetric prior, i.e., the\nMinimum Description Length (MDL) of the latent variables for all views and\ntraining and test datasets. Then, we use the obtained bounds to devise a\nregularizer; and investigate in depth the question of the selection of a\nsuitable prior. In particular, we show and conduct experiments that illustrate\nthat our data-dependent Gaussian mixture priors with judiciously chosen weights\nlead to good performance. For single-view settings (i.e., $K=1$), our\nexperimental results are shown to outperform existing prior art Variational\nInformation Bottleneck (VIB) and Category-Dependent VIB (CDVIB) approaches.\nInterestingly, we show that a weighted attention mechanism emerges naturally in\nthis setting. Finally, for the multi-view setting, we show that the selection\nof the joint prior as a Gaussians product mixture induces a Gaussian mixture\nmarginal prior for each marginal view and implicitly encourages the agents to\nextract and output redundant features, a finding which is somewhat\ncounter-intuitive.",

    "abstract": "Following AI scaling trends, frontier models continue to grow in size and\ncontinue to be trained on larger datasets. Training these models requires huge\ninvestments in exascale computational resources, which has in turn driven\ndevelopment of distributed deep learning methods. Data parallelism is an\nessential approach to speed up training, but it requires frequent global\ncommunication between workers, which can bottleneck training at the largest\nscales. In this work, we propose a method called Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD\n(PALSGD) to improve the efficiency of data-parallel training. PALSGD is an\nextension of Local SGD (Stich, 2018) and DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023),\ndesigned to further reduce communication frequency by introducing a\npseudo-synchronization mechanism. PALSGD allows the use of longer\nsynchronization intervals compared to standard Local SGD. Despite the reduced\ncommunication frequency, the pseudo-synchronization approach ensures that model\nconsistency is maintained, leading to performance results comparable to those\nachieved with more frequent synchronization. Furthermore, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of PALSGD, establishing its convergence and deriving its\nconvergence rate. This analysis offers insights into the algorithm's behavior\nand performance guarantees. We evaluated PALSGD on image classification and\nlanguage modeling tasks. Our results show that PALSGD achieves better\nperformance in less time compared to existing methods like Distributed Data\nParallel (DDP), and DiLoCo. Notably, PALSGD trains 18.4% faster than DDP on\nImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, 24.4% faster than DDP on TinyStories with\nGPT-Neo125M, and 21.1% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-8M.",

Developing methods\nto automatically detect these biases is crucial for addressing the associated\nchallenges. Recent advancements in visual data analytics have shown promising\nresults in detecting potential biases by analyzing user interaction patterns.\nIn this project, we propose a controlled experiment to extend this approach to\ndetect potentially biased outcomes in code reviews by observing how reviewers\ninteract with the code. We employ the \"spotlight model of attention\", a\ncognitive framework where a reviewer's gaze is tracked to determine their focus\nareas on the review screen. This focus, identified through gaze tracking,\nserves as an indicator of the reviewer's areas of interest or concern. We plan\nto analyze the sequence of gaze focus using advanced sequence modeling\ntechniques, including Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and\nConditional Random Fields (CRF).

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of system identification of partially observed linear\ntime-invariant (LTI) systems. Given input-output data, we provide\nnon-asymptotic guarantees for identifying the system parameters under general\nheavy-tailed noise processes. Unlike previous works that assume Gaussian or\nsub-Gaussian noise, we consider significantly broader noise distributions that\nare required to admit only up to the second moment. For this setting, we\nleverage tools from robust statistics to propose a novel system identification\nalgorithm that exploits the idea of boosting. Despite the much weaker noise\nassumptions, we show that our proposed algorithm achieves sample complexity\nbounds that nearly match those derived under sub-Gaussian noise. In particular,\nwe establish that our bounds retain a logarithmic dependence on the prescribed\nfailure probability. Interestingly, we show that such bounds can be achieved by\nrequiring just a finite fourth moment on the excitatory input process.",

Recent advancements in pre-trained models (PTMs)\nhave significantly advanced the field of CIL, demonstrating superior\nperformance over traditional methods. However, understanding how features\nevolve and are distributed across incremental tasks remains an open challenge.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling feature evolution in\nPTM-based CIL through the lens of neural collapse (NC), a striking phenomenon\nobserved in the final phase of training, which leads to a well-separated,\nequiangular feature space. We explore the connection between NC and CIL\neffectiveness, showing that aligning feature distributions with the NC geometry\nenhances the ability to capture the dynamic behavior of continual learning.\nBased on this insight, we introduce Neural Collapse-inspired Pre-Trained\nModel-based CIL (NCPTM-CIL), a method that dynamically adjusts the feature\nspace to conform to the elegant NC structure, thereby enhancing the continual\nlearning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCPTM-CIL outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets. Notably, when\ninitialized with ViT-B/16-IN1K, NCPTM-CIL surpasses the runner-up method by\n6.73% on VTAB, 1.25% on CIFAR-100, and 2.5% on OmniBenchmark.",

This second source of BE diversity accounts for the local\nroughness of the potential energy landscape of the substrate. Three different\nadsorbate test cases are considered, i.e. NH3, CO and CH4, owing to their\nsignificance in dust icy mantles, and their distinct binding behavior with\nwater ices. The BE distributions for NH3, CO and CH4 have been inferred, with\nconverged statistics. The distribution for NH3 is better represented by a\ndouble Gaussian component profile.

Our\nbenchmark ensures difficulty comprehensiveness, language diversity, and\nhigh-quality translation, making it a highly discriminative multilingual\nmathematical benchmark in the era of reasoning LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation for advanced LLMs and find that even Qwen-3-235B-A22B-Thinking and\nGemini-2.5-pro, achieve only 54.6 and 52.2 benchmark scores, with about 40%\naccuracy under the highest level From a language perspective, our benchmark\nreveals several key challenges of LLMs in multilingual reasoning: (1) Reasoning\nperformance varies widely across languages for current LLMs; (2) Input-output\nlanguage consistency is low in reasoning LLMs and may be correlated with\nperformance; (3) The thinking length differs significantly by language for\ncurrent LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that controlling the output language\nin the instructions has the potential to affect reasoning performance,\nespecially for some low-resource languages, suggesting a promising direction\nfor improving multilingual capabilities in LLMs.",

The Glauber dynamics is a simple Markov\nchain that converges to this distribution and enables efficient sampling. Its\nmixing time--the number of steps needed to approach the stationary\ndistribution--has been widely studied across various graph classes, with most\nprevious work emphasizing the dichotomy between polynomial and exponential\nmixing times, with a particular focus on sparse classes of graphs.\n  Inspired by the modern fine-grained approach to computational complexity, we\ninvestigate subexponential mixing times of the Glauber dynamics on geometric\nintersection graphs, such as disk graphs. We also study parameterized mixing\ntimes by focusing on two structural parameters that can remain small even in\ndense graphs: the tree independence number and the path independence number. We\nshow that Glauber dynamics mixes in polynomial time on graphs with bounded path\nindependence number and in quasi-polynomial time when the tree independence\nnumber is bounded. Moreover, we prove both bounds are tight, revealing a clear\nseparation between the two parameters.\n  This work provides a simple and efficient algorithm for sampling from the\nhard-core model. Unlike classical approaches that rely explicitly on geometric\nrepresentations or on constructing decompositions such as tree decompositions\nor separator trees, our analysis only requires their existence to establish\nmixing time bounds--these structures are not used directly by the algorithm\nitself.",

    "abstract": "Despite the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across\nvarious sectors, cyber security continues to rely on traditional static and\ndynamic analysis tools, hampered by high false positive rates and superficial\ncode comprehension.

This paper explores the\npotential and limitations of LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities, acknowledging\ninherent weaknesses such as hallucinations, limited context length, and\nknowledge cut-offs. Previous attempts employing machine learning models for\nvulnerability detection have proven ineffective due to limited real-world\napplicability, feature engineering challenges, lack of contextual\nunderstanding, and the complexities of training models to keep pace with the\nevolving threat landscape. Therefore, we propose a robust AI-driven approach\nfocused on mitigating these limitations and ensuring the quality and\nreliability of LLM based vulnerability detection. Through innovative\nmethodologies combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and\nMixtureof-Agents (MoA), this research seeks to leverage the strengths of LLMs\nwhile addressing their weaknesses, ultimately paving the way for dependable and\nefficient AI-powered solutions in securing the ever-evolving software\nlandscape.",

Against\nthis background, we describe a method and tool called ContractCheck which\nallows for the consistency analysis of legal contracts, in particular Share\nPurchase Agreements (SPAs). In order to identify the concepts that are relevant\nfor an analysis we define an ontology for SPAs. The analysis is, then, based on\nan encoding of the preconditions for the execution of the clauses of an SPA, as\nwell as on a set of proposed consistency constraints formalized using decidable\nfragments of First-Order Logic (FOL). Based on the ontology for SPAs, textual\nSPAs are first encoded in a structured natural language format that we refer to\nas ``blocks''. ContractCheck interprets these blocks and constraints and\ntranslates them into assertions formulated in FOL. It then invokes a\nSatisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver in order to check the executability\nof a considered contract, either by providing a satisfying model, or by proving\nthe existence of conflicting clauses that prevent the contract from being\nexecuted. We illustrate the application of ContractCheck to concrete SPAs,\nincluding one example of an SPA of realistic size and complexity, and conclude\nby suggesting directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel type of nonlinear solver acceleration for systems of\nnonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that is based on\nonline/adaptive learning. It is applied in the context of multiphase flow in\nporous media. The proposed method rely on four pillars: (i) dimensionless\nnumbers as input parameters for the machine learning model, (ii) simplified\nnumerical model (two-dimensional) for the offline training, (iii) dynamic\ncontrol of a nonlinear solver tuning parameter (numerical relaxation), (iv) and\nonline learning for real-time improvement of the machine learning model. This\nstrategy decreases the number of nonlinear iterations by dynamically modifying\na single global parameter, the relaxation factor, and by adaptively learning\nthe attributes of each numerical model on-the-run. Furthermore, this work\nperforms a sensitivity study in the dimensionless parameters (machine learning\nfeatures), assess the efficacy of various machine learning models, demonstrate\na decrease in nonlinear iterations using our method in more intricate,\nrealistic three-dimensional models, and fully couple a machine learning model\ninto an open-source multiphase flow simulator achieving up to 85\\% reduction in\ncomputational time.",

Most evaluations rely on deterministic metrics that depend on\nstring or n-gram matching, while the reliability of large language model-based\nevaluations for long-form answers remains relatively unexplored. We address\nthis gap by conducting an in-depth study of long-form answer evaluation with\nthe following research questions: (i) To what extent do existing automatic\nevaluation metrics serve as a substitute for human evaluations? (ii) What are\nthe limitations of existing evaluation metrics compared to human evaluations?\n(iii) How can the effectiveness and robustness of existing evaluation methods\nbe improved? We collect 5,236 factoid and non-factoid long-form answers\ngenerated by different large language models and conduct a human evaluation on\n2,079 of them, focusing on correctness and informativeness. Subsequently, we\ninvestigated the performance of automatic evaluation metrics by evaluating\nthese answers, analyzing the consistency between these metrics and human\nevaluations. We find that the style, length of the answers, and the category of\nquestions can bias the automatic evaluation metrics. However, fine-grained\nevaluation helps mitigate this issue on some metrics. Our findings have\nimportant implications for the use of large language models for evaluating\nlong-form question answering.

To do so, we show that the perturbed geodesic equations must\ninclude anharmonic contributions arising from the higher-order expansion of the\neffective potential that cannot be neglected \\emph{a priori}, as commonly done\nin all the approaches pursued so far. More specifically, independently of the\nunderlying spacetime geometry, we find that in the radial sector the\nnon-negligible anharmonic correction is quadratic in the radial displacement,\ni.e. $\\propto \\delta r^2$, and significantly affects the radial epicyclic\nfrequency close to the innermost stable circular orbit. Conversely, polar\noscillations $\\delta \\theta$ remain approximately decoupled from radial ones,\npreserving their independent dynamical behavior. To show the need of anharmonic\ncorrections, we thus carry out Monte Carlo-Markov chain analyses on eight\nneutron star sources of quasi-periodic oscillations. Afterwards, we first work\nout the outcomes of the harmonic approximation in Schwarzschild,\nSchwarzschild--de Sitter, and Kerr spacetimes. Subsequently, we apply the\nanharmonic corrections to them and use it to fit the aforementioned neutron\nstar sources. Our findings indicate that the standard paradigm requires a\nsystematic generalization to include the leading anharmonic corrections that\nappear physically necessary, although still insufficient to fully account for\nthe observed phenomenology of quasi-periodic oscillations.

The control problem is formulated within the\nState-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) framework, enabling the design of\nfeedback laws through state-dependent factorisation. The unconstrained control\nformulation serves as a principled starting point for developing more general\napproaches that incorporate coupling constraints and actuation limits.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust\nphase-locking in both heterogeneous and large-scale oscillator networks,\nhighlighting its potential applications in neuroscience, robotics, and\ndistributed systems.",

    "abstract": "Among the new techniques of Versatile Video Coding (VVC), the quadtree with\nnested multi-type tree (QT+MTT) block structure yields significant coding gains\nby providing more flexible block partitioning patterns. However, the recursive\npartition search in the VVC encoder increases the encoder complexity\nsubstantially. To address this issue, we propose a partition map-based\nalgorithm to pursue fast block partitioning in inter coding. Based on our\nprevious work on partition map-based methods for intra coding, we analyze the\ncharacteristics of VVC inter coding, and thus improve the partition map by\nincorporating an MTT mask for early termination. Next, we develop a neural\nnetwork that uses both spatial and temporal features to predict the partition\nmap. It consists of several special designs including stacked top-down and\nbottom-up processing, quantization parameter modulation layers, and\npartitioning-adaptive warping. Furthermore, we present a dual-threshold\ndecision scheme to achieve a fine-grained trade-off between complexity\nreduction and rate-distortion (RD) performance loss. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average 51.30% encoding time\nsaving with a 2.12% Bjontegaard Delta Bit Rate (BDBR) under the random access\nconfiguration.",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning greatly improves the interpretability and\nproblem-solving abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,\nexisting approaches are focused on text CoT, limiting their ability to leverage\nvisual cues. Visual CoT remains underexplored, and the only work is based on\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) that relies on extensive labeled bounding-box data\nand is hard to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce\nUnsupervised Visual CoT (UV-CoT), a novel framework for image-level CoT\nreasoning via preference optimization. UV-CoT performs preference comparisons\nbetween model-generated bounding boxes (one is preferred and the other is\ndis-preferred), eliminating the need for bounding-box annotations. We get such\npreference data by introducing an automatic data generation pipeline. Given an\nimage, our target MLLM (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B) generates seed bounding boxes using\na template prompt and then answers the question using each bounded region as\ninput. An evaluator MLLM (e.g., OmniLLM-12B) ranks the responses, and these\nrankings serve as supervision to train the target MLLM with UV-CoT by\nminimizing negative log-likelihood losses. By emulating human\nperception--identifying key regions and reasoning based on them--UV-CoT can\nimprove visual comprehension, particularly in spatial reasoning tasks where\ntextual descriptions alone fall short. Our experiments on six datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of UV-CoT, compared to the state-of-the-art textual\nand visual CoT methods. Our zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets shows the\nstrong generalization of UV-CoT. The code is available in\nhttps://github.com/kesenzhao/UV-CoT.",

The false vacuum has\nnon-zero vacuum energy and could drive exponential expansion if not coupled\nwith gravity. Upon decay of the false vacuum, the quintessence field is\nreleased and begins to evolve.

The vanilla\ndefinition and understanding of calibration is, simply put, on all days on\nwhich the rain probability has been predicted to be p, the actual frequency of\nrain days was p. However, the increased attention has led to an immense variety\nof new notions of \"calibration.\" Some of the notions are incomparable, serve\ndifferent purposes, or imply each other. In this work, we provide two accounts\nwhich motivate calibration: self-realization of forecasted properties and\nprecise estimation of incurred losses of the decision makers relying on\nforecasts. We substantiate the former via the reflection principle and the\nlatter by actuarial fairness. For both accounts we formulate prototypical\ndefinitions via properties $\\Gamma$ of outcome distributions, e.g., the mean or\nmedian. The prototypical definition for self-realization, which we call\n$\\Gamma$-calibration, is equivalent to a certain type of swap regret under\ncertain conditions. These implications are strongly connected to the\nomniprediction learning paradigm. The prototypical definition for precise loss\nestimation is a modification of decision calibration adopted from Zhao et al.\n[73]. For binary outcome sets both prototypical definitions coincide under\nappropriate choices of reference properties. For higher-dimensional outcome\nsets, both prototypical definitions can be subsumed by a natural extension of\nthe binary definition, called distribution calibration with respect to a\nproperty. We conclude by commenting on the role of groupings in both accounts\nof calibration often used to obtain multicalibration.

By translating a tilted mirror towards the focus of a\nsingle-beam optical tweezer, the optical trap transitions into an off-axis\nstanding-wave configuration due to interference between the incident and\nreflected beams. Stable potential minima emerge within a finite overlap region\nclose to the surface, with their number, shape, and distance from the surface\ntunable via the incidence angle, waist, and polarization of the incoming beam.\nThis configuration enables deterministic selection of trapping sites as the\nsystem transitions from the single-beam trap to the off-axis standing wave\ntrap. We validate this approach using a $170$ nm diameter silica sphere in a\nsingle-beam trap with a $1.5$ $\\mu$m waist and transitioning it into the second\nor first potential minimum of the standing wave trap, located $1.61$ $\\mu$m or\n$0.55$ $\\mu$m from the surface, respectively.

We find that a nuclear star cluster\n(NSC) effectively captures the ISM gas and promotes formation of a\ncircumnuclear disc (CND) on scales of $\\lesssim 7$ pc. Simultaneously,\ngravitational torques from the NSC reduce CND angular momentum on (sub-)parsec\nscales, circularizing the gas onto the $\\alpha$-accretion disc and promoting\nsustained IMBH growth at $\\sim 0.01$ of the Eddington rate. While in the\ninnermost regions ($\\lesssim 0.5$ pc), star formation is highly suppressed, the\nCND is susceptible to fragmentation, leading to the formation of massive, young\nstars. Interestingly, despite an in-situ SN rate of $0.3~{\\rm Myr}^{-1}$, the\ndense CND persists, sustaining BH accretion and leading to its net spin-up. Our\nstudy demonstrates the complexity of IMBH accretion within a multi-phase ISM,\nand paves the way for next-generation studies where IMBH growth in a fully\ncosmological context can be captured.",

    "abstract": "Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to extract the preference\nfrom the user's historical interactions across various domains. Despite some\nprogress in CDSR, two problems set the barrier for further advancements, i.e.,\noverlap dilemma and transition complexity. The former means existing CDSR\nmethods severely rely on users who own interactions on all domains to learn\ncross-domain item relationships, compromising the practicability. The latter\nrefers to the difficulties in learning the complex transition patterns from the\nmixed behavior sequences. With powerful representation and reasoning abilities,\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are promising to address these two problems by\nbridging the items and capturing the user's preferences from a semantic view.\nTherefore, we propose an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation\nmodel (LLM4CDSR). To obtain the semantic item relationships, we first propose\nan LLM-based unified representation module to represent items. Then, a\ntrainable adapter with contrastive regularization is designed to adapt the CDSR\ntask. Besides, a hierarchical LLMs profiling module is designed to summarize\nuser cross-domain preferences. Finally, these two modules are integrated into\nthe proposed tri-thread framework to derive recommendations. We have conducted\nextensive experiments on three public cross-domain datasets, validating the\neffectiveness of LLM4CDSR. We have released the code online.",

Physiotherapy with active jaw\nexoskeletons seems to be a promising treatment approach. However, there has\nbeen limited progress in this area, with only a few studies published. The lack\nof detailed simulations and biomechanical jaw models in these papers impedes\nthe design and validation of such devices. Thus, this work presents an\nopen-source and extendable jaw model framework to support the development of\njaw exoskeletons for TMD rehabilitation. The framework includes three model\nvariants with varying complexity: a rigid body model with point-on-surface\nconstraints, a rigid body model with mesh geometry constraints, and a hybrid\nmodel combining rigid dynamics with finite element methods. Model customization\nis facilitated through JSON configuration files, requiring minimal programming\nexpertise. The framework was evaluated using experimental kinematic data from a\nsingle participant, with muscle excitations computed via PID controllers tuned\nthrough global optimization. The models successfully reproduced jaw movements\nwithout prior individualization, demonstrating their suitability for\nprototyping and studying exoskeleton behavior. The basic models are ideal for\nrapid prototyping, while the hybrid model provides insights into the effects of\nexoskeletons on the masticatory system. This framework establishes a foundation\nfor advancing jaw exoskeleton development, with future work focusing on\npatient-specific modeling, improved anatomical detail, and tools for\nexoskeleton control and design.

They\narise in many different areas, and are particularly important in optimal\ncontrol of linear quadratic regulators, where they provide the optimal feedback\ncontrol laws. In the context of control of partial differential equations,\nthese Riccati equations are operator-valued. To approximate their solutions,\nboth spatial and temporal discretizations are needed. While the former have\nbeen well analyzed in the literature, there are very few rigorous convergence\nanalyses of time stepping methods applied to DREs, particularly in the\ninfinite-dimensional, operator-valued setting. In view of this, we analyze two\nnumerical time-stepping schemes, the Lie and Strang splitting methods, in such\na setting. The analysis relies on the assumption that the uncontrolled system\nevolves via an operator that generates an analytic semigroup, and that either\nthe initial condition is sufficiently smooth, or the nonlinearity in the DRE is\nsufficiently smoothing. These assumptions are mild, in the sense that they are\nnot enough to even guarantee continuity in operator-norm of the exact solution\nto the DRE. However, they imply certain regularity in a pointwise sense, which\ncan be leveraged to prove convergence in operator-norm with the classical\norders. The results are illustrated by four numerical experiments, where\nconvergence with the expected order is correlated with the relevant assumptions\nbeing fulfilled.

Their ability to enhance\ncoating performance while maintaining process efficiency is systematically\nevaluated, considering practical constraints and industrial feasibility.\nPractical validation trials are conducted to verify the approximate theoretical\nsolutions generated by the algorithms, ensuring their applicability and\nreliability in real-world scenarios. By exploring the performance of these\ndiverse algorithms in an industrial setting, this study offers insights into\ntheir practical applicability, guiding both researchers and practitioners in\nenhancing process efficiency and product quality in the coating industry.",

In this paper, we present an efficient numerical algorithm for\nthe inverse scattering problem of acoustic-elastic interaction with random\nperiodic interfaces. The proposed algorithm combines the Monte Carlo technique\nand the continuation method with respect to the wavenumber, which can\naccurately reconstruct the key statistics of random periodic interfaces from\nthe measured data of the acoustic scattered field. In the implementation of our\nalgorithm, a key two-step strategy is employed: Firstly, the elastic\ndisplacement field below the interface is determined by Tikhonov regularization\nbased on the dynamic interface condition; Secondly, the profile function is\niteratively updated and optimised using the Landweber method according to the\nkinematic interface condition. Such a algorithm does not require a priori\ninformation about the stochastic structures and performs well for both\nstationary Gaussian and non-Gaussian stochastic processes.

Early\nmodels of solar wind acceleration do not account for the fastest, non-transient\nsolar wind speeds observed near-Earth and energy must be deposited into the\nsolar wind after it leaves the Sun. Alfv\\'en wave energy deposition and thermal\npressure gradients are likely candidates and the relative contribution of each\nacceleration mechanism likely depends on the source region. Although solar wind\nspeed is a rough proxy for solar wind source region, it cannot unambiguously\nidentify source region topology.\n  Using near-Sun observations of the solar wind's kinetic energy flux, we\npredict the expected kinetic energy flux near-Earth. This predicted kinetic\nenergy flux corresponds to the range of solar wind speeds observed in the fast\nsolar wind and infer that the solar wind's near-Sun kinetic energy flux is\nsufficient to predict the distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds\nobserved near Earth. Applying a recently developed model of solar wind\nevolution in the inner heliosphere, we suggest that the acceleration required\nto generate this distribution of fastest, non-transient speeds is likely due to\nthe continuous deposition of energy by Alfv\\'en wave forcing during the solar\nwind's propagation through interplanetary space. We infer that the solar wind's\nAlfv\\'enicity can statistically map near-Earth observations to their source\nregions because the Alfv\\'en wave forcing that the solar wind experiences in\ntransit is a consequence of the source region topology.",

    "abstract": "With the surge of large language models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs)--which integrate vision encoders with LLMs for accurate visual\ngrounding--have shown great potential in tasks like generalist agents and\nrobotic control. However, VLMs are typically trained on massive web-scraped\nimages, raising concerns over copyright infringement and privacy violations,\nand making data auditing increasingly urgent. Membership inference (MI), which\ndetermines whether a sample was used in training, has emerged as a key auditing\ntechnique, with promising results on open-source VLMs like LLaVA (AUC > 80%).\nIn this work, we revisit these advances and uncover a critical issue: current\nMI benchmarks suffer from distribution shifts between member and non-member\nimages, introducing shortcut cues that inflate MI performance. We further\nanalyze the nature of these shifts and propose a principled metric based on\noptimal transport to quantify the distribution discrepancy. To evaluate MI in\nrealistic settings, we construct new benchmarks with i.i.d. member and\nnon-member images. Existing MI methods fail under these unbiased conditions,\nperforming only marginally better than chance. Further, we explore the\ntheoretical upper bound of MI by probing the Bayes Optimality within the VLM's\nembedding space and find the irreducible error rate remains high. Despite this\npessimistic outlook, we analyze why MI for VLMs is particularly challenging and\nidentify three practical scenarios--fine-tuning, access to ground-truth texts,\nand set-based inference--where auditing becomes feasible. Our study presents a\nsystematic view of the limits and opportunities of MI for VLMs, providing\nguidance for future efforts in trustworthy data auditing.",

    "abstract": "For deep learning-based image steganography frameworks, in order to ensure\nthe invisibility and recoverability of the information embedding, the loss\nfunction usually contains several losses such as embedding loss, recovery loss\nand steganalysis loss. In previous research works, fixed loss weights are\nusually chosen for training optimization, and this setting is not linked to the\nimportance of the steganography task itself and the training process. In this\npaper, we propose a Two-stage Curriculum Learning loss scheduler (TSCL) for\nbalancing multinomial losses in deep learning image steganography algorithms.\nTSCL consists of two phases: a priori curriculum control and loss dynamics\ncontrol. The first phase firstly focuses the model on learning the information\nembedding of the original image by controlling the loss weights in the\nmulti-party adversarial training; secondly, it makes the model shift its\nlearning focus to improving the decoding accuracy; and finally, it makes the\nmodel learn to generate a steganographic image that is resistant to\nsteganalysis. In the second stage, the learning speed of each training task is\nevaluated by calculating the loss drop of the before and after iteration rounds\nto balance the learning of each task. Experimental results on three large\npublic datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed TSCL\nstrategy improves the quality of steganography, decoding accuracy and security.",

Although this has for a long time been accepted as a\nlaw of nature, prior to Einstein's 1905 theory of special relativity the\npossibility of superluminal motion of electrons was widely discussed by Arnold\nSommerfeld and other physicists. Besides, it is not obvious that special\nrelativity rules out such motion under all circumstances. From approximately\n1965 to 1985 the hypothesis of tachyons moving faster than light was seriously\nentertained by a minority of physicists. This paper reviews the early history\nconcerning superluminal signals and pays particular attention to the ideas\nproposed in the 1920s by the little known Ukrainian physicist Lev Strum\n(Shtrum). As he pointed out in a paper of 1923, within the framework of\nrelativity it is possible for a signal to move superluminally without violating\nthe law of causality. Part of this article is devoted to the personal and\nscientific biography of the undeservedly neglected Strum, whose career was\nheavily and eventually fatally influenced by the political situation in\nStalin's Russia.

However little is known how to construct a fractional quantum\nHall ground-state, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, that exists both\nin crystalline and disordered lattices and is qualitatively different to known\ntopological phases. Here, we propose a general method for building such a\nphase. This is done by coupling quantum wires placed aperiodically in\nreal-space, where the spatial positioning allows us to tune the inter-wire\ncouplings. We call the emergent phase the Fractonic Fractional Quantum Hall\nEffect as it displays a rich interplay of fractional quantum Hall physics with\nfractonic constraints, formed by coupling differently-fractionalised wires into\na globally gapped phase. The ground state has an exponential degeneracy in\nsystem size, a signature of the emergence of fractons. It displays a rich\nphenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to\nmove in one dimension (lineons), multiples of which can then hop between two\nwires (s-lineons) or be free to travel across the system (C-anyons), depending\non the multiplicity. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are\ndirectly determined by the real-space positions of the wires, which can be\ndisordered. Our method provides an analytically solvable pathway to\nnon-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effects and fractonic theories in\ntwo-dimensions, examples of which were lacking.",

While geometric frustration traditionally focuses on\nmagnetic systems, little attention is paid to the \"frustrated\nsuperconductivity\" which could arise when the superconducting interaction\nconflicts with the crystal symmetry. The recently discovered kagome\nsuperconductors provide a particular opportunity for studying this due to the\nfact that the frustrated lattice structure and the interference effect between\nthe three sublattices can facilitate the frustrated superconducting\ninteraction. Here, we propose a theory that supports the frustrated\nsuperconducting state, derived from the on-site $s$-wave superconducting\npairing in conjunction with the nearest-neighbor pairings hoping and the unique\ngeometrical frustrated lattice structure. In this state, whereas the mutual\n$2\\pi/3$ difference of the superconducting pairing phase causes the six-fold\nmodulation of the amplitude and breaks the time-reversal symmetry with $4\\pi$\nphase changes of the superconducting pairing as one following it around the\nFermi surface, it is immune to the impurities without the impurity-induced\nin-gap states and produces the pronounced Hebel-Slichter peak of the nuclear\nspin-lattice relaxation rate below $T_{c}$. Notably, the theory also reveals a\ndisorder-induced superconducting pairing transition from the frustrated\nsuperconducting state to an isotropic $s$-wave superconducting state without\ntraversing the nodal points, recovering and explaining the behavior found in\nexperiment. This study not only serves as a promising proposal to mediate the\ndivergent or seemingly contradictory experimental outcomes regarding\nsuperconducting pairing symmetry, but may also pave the way for advancing\ninvestigations into the frustrated superconducting state.",

Assume that there are $h$ failed nodes\nuniformly distributed in $\\bar{h}$ host racks ( defined as racks containing\nfailed nodes), each rack containing $h/\\bar{h}$ failed nodes where $h$ is\ndivisible by $\\bar{h}$. Then together with its internal helper nodes, each host\nrack downloads recovery data from $\\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its failed\nnodes. The repair bandwidth is defined as the total inter-rack data transfer\nrequired for failures recovery, as the intra-rack communication does not\ncontribute to this cost. The full cooperative repair model requires that each\nhost rack must exchange the data with all the other $\\bar{h}$ host racks during\nthe cooperative repair phase. However, in the partial cooperative repair model,\neach host rack only needs to exchange data with $\\bar{h}-\\delta\\\n(1\\leq\\delta\\leq\\bar{h}-1)$ other host racks, during the cooperative repair\nphase. In this paper, we focus on the rack-aware minimum storage partially\ncooperative regenerating (MSPCR) codes for repairing the $h$ node failures. We\nfirst derive the lower bound on the repair bandwidth for rack-aware MSPCR codes\nusing extremal combinatorics, and then construct two classes of optimal repair\nschemes for rack-aware MSPCR codes with small sub-packetization level.

Given the disturbance\nzonotope, the databased closed-loop dynamics (CLDs) are first characterized\nusing a matrix zonotope (MZ), and refined through several steps to yield a\nconstrained matrix zonotope (CMZ). This refinement is achieved by introducing\nconformal equality constraints that eliminate incompatible disturbance\nrealizations. More precisely, prior knowledge and observed data are used\nseparately to construct CMZ representations of disturbance sequences that\nconform to both data and prior knowledge, and are intersected by the initial MZ\nof the disturbance sequence, producing a refined CMZ. This approach reduces\nconservatism. To further reduce the conservativeness, we unify open-loop\nlearning with closed-loop learning by presenting a novel set-membership\nidentification method that models open-loop dynamics as a CMZ. The prior\nknowledge serves as an initial feasible open-loop model set (FOLMS) of this\nCMZ, which is refined into a posterior set whenever new informative online data\nbecomes available. This posterior FOLMS then adaptively replaces the prior\nknowledge set employed in the disturbance elimination of the closed-loop\nlearning process. The resulting refined parameterized set of CLD is\nsubsequently leveraged to directly and adaptively learn a controller that\nrobustly enforces safety. Toward this goal, we formulate a linear programming\nproblem that guarantees {\\lambda}contractiveness of a polyhedral safe set.

Therefore, in\ncontrast to existing surveys that focus primarily on research aspects, this\npaper considers research, standardization and regulation in a concise way.\nAccordingly, the survey takes into account the interdependencies arising from\nthe triplet of research, standardization and regulation in a forward-looking\nperspective and anticipates and discusses open questions and possible future\ndirections. In this way, the survey ultimately serves to provide researchers\nand safety experts with a compact, holistic perspective that discusses the\ncurrent status, emerging trends, and possible future developments.",

MC involves information transfer via molecules and is\nsupported by well-established theoretical models. However, practically\nachieving reliable, energy-efficient, and bio-compatible communication at these\nscales still remains a challenge. Air-Based Molecular Communication (ABMC) is a\ntype of MC that operates over larger, meter-scale distances and extends even\noutside the human body. Therefore, devices and techniques to realize ABMC are\nreadily accessible, and associated use cases can be very promising in the near\nfuture. Exhaled breath analysis has previously been proposed. It provides a\nnon-invasive approach for health monitoring, leveraging existing commercial\nsensor technologies and reducing deployment barriers. The breath contains a\ndiverse range of molecules and particles that serve as biomarkers linked to\nvarious physiological and pathological conditions. The plethora of proven\nmethods, models, and optimization approaches in MC enable macroscale breath\nanalysis, treating human as the transmitter, the breath as the information\ncarrier, and macroscale sensors as the receiver. Using ABMC to interface with\nthe inherent dynamic networks of cells, tissues, and organs could create a\nnovel Internet of Bio Things (IoBT), a preliminary macroscale stage of the\nIoBNT. This survey extensively reviews exhaled breath modeling and analysis\nthrough the lens of MC, offering insights into theoretical frameworks and\npractical implementations from ABMC, bringing the IoBT a step closer to\nreal-world use.",

However, IPM's flat-ground assumption and loss of contextual\ninformation lead to inaccuracies in reconstructing 3D information, especially\nheight.

    "abstract": "Electron beams accelerated in solar flares and escaping from the Sun along\nopen magnetic field lines can trigger intense radio emissions known as type III\nsolar radio bursts. Utilizing observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP),\nSTEREO-A (STA), Solar Orbiter (SolO), and Wind spacecrafts, the speeds and\naccelerations of type III exciters are derived for simple and isolated type III\nsolar bursts. For the first time, simultaneous four spacecraft observations\nallow to determine positions, and correct the resulting velocities and\naccelerations for the location between the spacecraft and the apparent source.\nWe observe velocities and acceleration to change as $u(r) \\propto r^{-0.37 \\pm\n0.14}$ and $a(r) \\propto r^{-1.71 \\pm 0.20}$ with radial distance from the Sun\n$r$. To explain the electron beam deceleration, we develop a simple gas-dynamic\ndescription of the electron beam moving through plasma with monotonically\ndecreasing density. The model predicts that the beam velocity decreases as\n$u(f)\\propto f^{1/4}(r)$, so the acceleration changes $\\propto r^{-1.58}$ (and\nspeed as $\\propto r^{-0.29}$) for the plasma density profile $n(r)\\propto\nr^{-2.3}$. The deceleration is consistent with the average observation values\ncorrected for the type III source locations. Intriguingly, the observations\nalso show differences in velocity and acceleration of the same type III\nobserved by different spacecrafts. We suggest the difference could be related\nto the additional time delay caused by radio-wave scattering between the\nspacecraft and the source.",

    "abstract": "The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a\ncarefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for\nthe fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the\nslow modes. One common approach is to form a Krylov operator basis $\\{O_m\n\\}_{m\\ge 0}$, and then approximate the dynamics restricted to the 'fast space'\n$\\{O_m \\}_{m\\ge n}$ for $n\\gg 1$. Denoting the fast space Green's function by\n$G_n (z)$, in this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n\n\\to \\infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different\nregions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely\nanalogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix\ntheory (RMT). At finite $z$, we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner\nsemicircle law, the same as the average bulk resolvent for the Gaussian Unitary\nEnsemble. When $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical\nvariables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the\nBessel universality class from RMT. As an application we give a new numerical\nmethod, the spectral bootstrap, for approximating spectral functions from\nLanczos coefficients. Our proof is complex analytic in nature, involving a\nRiemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method,\ncontrolled in the $n\\to\\infty$ limit. This proof technique assumes some\nregularity conditions on the spectral function, and we comment on their\npossible connections to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We are led\nvia steepest-descent to a related Coulomb gas ensemble, and we discuss how a\nrecent conjecture--the 'Operator Growth Hypothesis'--is linked to a confinement\ntransition in this Coulomb gas. We then explain the implications of this\ncriticality for the computational resources required to estimate transport\ncoefficients.",

However, the rare\ntwo-dimensional altermagnets have been reported, making it difficult to meet\nthe requirements for high-performance spintronic devices on account of the\ngrowth big data. Here, we predict a stable monolayer Ti2Se2S with out-of-plane\naltermagnetic ground state and giant valley splitting. The electronic\nproperties of altermagnet Ti2Se2S are highly dependent on the onsite electron\ncorrelation. Through symmetry analysis, we find that the valleys of X and Y\npoints are protected by the mirror Mxy symmetry rather than the time-reversal\nsymmetry. Therefore, the multipiezo effect, including piezovalley and\npiezomagnetism, can be induced by the uniaxial strain. The total valley\nsplitting of monolayer Ti2Se2S can be as high as ~500 meV. Most interestingly,\nthe direction of valley polarization can be effectively tuned by the uniaxial\nstrain, based on this, we have defined logical \"0\", \"+1\", and \"-1\" states for\ndata transmission and storage. In addition, we have designed a schematic\ndiagram for observing the anomalous Hall effect in experimentally.

    "abstract": "The origin of observed planetary systems, including our Solar System, as well\nas their diversity, is still an open question. Streaming instability (SI) is an\nimportant mechanism for the formation of gravitationally bound planetesimals,\nwhich can grow to form planetary embryos and eventually planets. Snow lines in\na protoplanetary disk can assist this process, as they can form pressure maxima\nand promote both dust accumulation and growth. Since the sublimation of a\nvolatile is gradual due to opacity changes, a snow line in a protoplanetary\ndisk is in fact a radially extended \"snow region\" of constant temperature. It\nhas been shown that dust can influence disk viscosity through the adsorption of\ncharged particles, and even a minor perturbation in the gas can trigger the\nexcitation of multiple small-scale Rossby vortices. Here, we investigate the\npossibility of Rossby vortex excitation and rapid planetesimal formation at\ntemperature substructures associated with the snow regions, using global 2D\ngas-dust coupled hydrodynamic simulations that include dust feedback and\nself-gravity. We find that an initial temperature substructure in a\nprotoplanetary disk can seed a rapid cascade of long-lived, self-sustaining\nRossby vortices. The vortices accumulate significant amount of dust and the\nlocal conditions are favorable for SI as well as gravitational collapse.\nHowever, the vortex formation via this mechanism requires sufficient decoupling\nbetween dust and gas, and such conditions may not be met early on when the disk\nis gas-rich, resulting in a delayed onset of vortex formation. The\nself-sustaining Rossby vortices offer exceptionally favorable conditions for\ndust growth and the formation of planetesimals, as well as a possible pathway\nfor the rapid formation of planetary cores.",

    "abstract": "Quantum cloud computing is essential for achieving quantum supremacy by\nutilizing multiple quantum computers connected via an entangling network to\ndeliver high performance for practical applications that require extensive\ncomputational resources. With such a platform, various clients can execute\ntheir quantum jobs (quantum circuits) without needing to manage the quantum\nhardware and pay based on resource usage. Hence, defining optimal quantum\nresource allocation is necessary to avoid overcharging clients and to allow\nquantum cloud providers to maximize resource utilization. Prior work has mainly\nfocused on minimizing communication delays between nodes using multi-objective\ntechniques. Our approach involves analyzing the problem from a game theory\nperspective. We propose a quantum circuit partitioning resource allocation game\nmodel (QC-PRAGM) that minimizes client costs while maximizing resource\nutilization in quantum cloud environments. We extend QC-PRAGM to QC-PRAGM++ to\nmaximize local gates in a partition by selecting the best combinations of\nqubits, thereby minimizing both cost and inter-node communication.\n  We demonstrate analytically that clients are charged appropriately (with a\ntotal cost at most $\\frac{4}{3}$ the optimal cost) while optimizing quantum\ncloud resources. Further, our simulations indicate that our solutions perform\nbetter than traditional ones in terms of the cost per quantum node, total cost,\nmaximum cost, number of partitions, and number of remote gates.",

To\naddress this, we propose an Audio-Visual Generation and Separation model\n(AV-GAS) for generating images from soundscapes (mixed audio containing\nmultiple classes). Our contribution is threefold: First, we propose a new\nchallenge in the audio-visual generation task, which is to generate an image\ngiven a multi-class audio input, and we propose a method that solves this task\nusing an audio-visual separator. Second, we introduce a new audio-visual\nseparation task, which involves generating separate images for each class\npresent in a mixed audio input. Lastly, we propose new evaluation metrics for\nthe audio-visual generation task: Class Representation Score (CRS) and a\nmodified R@K. Our model is trained and evaluated on the VGGSound dataset. We\nshow that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving 7% higher CRS\nand 4% higher R@2* in generating plausible images with mixed audio.",

Heavy-quarks are produced predominantly in\nthe initial hard partonic interactions, allowing them to witness the entire\nevolution process. The charm hadrons are produced in two ways. Firstly, the\nprompt charm hadrons which are formed from the charm quark hadronization which\nare produced directly from the initial hard-scatterings or the decay of other\nexcited charm states. Secondly, the nonprompt charm hadrons which are produced\nfrom the decay of beauty hadrons. The produced charm hadrons then usually decay\nto light-flavor hadrons or leptons via two or three body decay. The\nreconstruction of charm hadrons is challenging due to the large combinatorial\nbackground as well as the difficulty of distinguishing between prompt and\nnon-prompt charm hadrons. In this work, we use machine learning models--XGboost\nand Deep Neural Network--to reconstruct $\\Lambda_c^{+} (udc)$ hadrons via its\nthree body final state decay channel, $\\Lambda_c^{+} \\rightarrow pK^0_s$ and\n$K^0_s \\rightarrow \\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$. Using several experimentally available\nfeatures of the decay daughters, these models can separate signal from\nbackground and identify prompt and nonprompt candidates with nearly 99\\%\naccuracy. This method performs an unbinned track-level reconstruction since the\n$\\Lambda_c$ candidates are tagged directly from their decay daughters.

For MCs,\ncomputing the value is shown to be possible in polynomial time given an oracle\nfor the comparison of succinctly represented integers (CSRI), which is only\nknown to be solvable in polynomial time subject to number-theoretic\nconjectures. Interestingly, distinguishing whether the value is infinite or 0\nis at least as hard as CSRI, while determining if it is one of these two can be\ndone in polynomial time. In MDPs, the optimal value can be computed in\npolynomial space. Further refined complexity results and results on the\ncomplexity of optimal schedulers are presented. The techniques developed for\nMDPs additionally allow to solve the multiplicative variant of the stochastic\nshortest path problem.

Treatment typically involves surgery, followed by\nradiotherapy and chemotherapy, and frequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nscans to monitor disease progression. To assess treatment response,\nradiologists use the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria to\ncategorize the tumor into one of four labels based on imaging and clinical\nfeatures: complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive\ndisease. This assessment is very complex and time-consuming. Since deep\nlearning (DL) has been widely used to tackle classification problems, this work\naimed to implement the first DL pipeline for the classification of RANO\ncriteria based on two consecutive MRI acquisitions. The models were trained and\ntested on the open dataset LUMIERE. Five approaches were tested: 1) subtraction\nof input images, 2) different combinations of modalities, 3) different model\narchitectures, 4) different pretraining tasks, and 5) adding clinical data. The\npipeline that achieved the best performance used a Densenet264 considering only\nT1-weighted, T2-weighted, and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)\nimages as input without any pretraining. A median Balanced Accuracy of 50.96%\nwas achieved. Additionally, explainability methods were applied. Using Saliency\nMaps, the tumor region was often successfully highlighted. In contrast,\nGrad-CAM typically failed to highlight the tumor region, with some exceptions\nobserved in the Complete Response and Progressive Disease classes, where it\neffectively identified the tumor region. These results set a benchmark for\nfuture studies on glioblastoma treatment response assessment based on the RANO\ncriteria while emphasizing the heterogeneity of factors that might play a role\nwhen assessing the tumor's response to treatment.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the limitations of neural operators in learning\nsolutions for a Hughes model, a first-order hyperbolic conservation law system\nfor crowd dynamics. The model couples a Fokker-Planck equation representing\npedestrian density with a Hamilton-Jacobi-type (eikonal) equation. This Hughes\nmodel belongs to the class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems that often exhibit\ncomplex solution structures, including shocks and discontinuities. In this\nstudy, we assess the performance of three state-of-the-art neural operators\n(Fourier Neural Operator, Wavelet Neural Operator, and Multiwavelet Neural\nOperator) in various challenging scenarios. Specifically, we consider (1)\ndiscontinuous and Gaussian initial conditions and (2) diverse boundary\nconditions, while also examining the impact of different numerical schemes.\n  Our results show that these neural operators perform well in easy scenarios\nwith fewer discontinuities in the initial condition, yet they struggle in\ncomplex scenarios with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundary\nconditions, even when trained specifically on such complex samples. The\npredicted solutions often appear smoother, resulting in a reduction in total\nvariation and a loss of important physical features. This smoothing behavior is\nsimilar to issues discussed by Daganzo (1995), where models that introduce\nartificial diffusion were shown to miss essential features such as shock waves\nin hyperbolic systems. These results suggest that current neural operator\narchitectures may introduce unintended regularization effects that limit their\nability to capture transport dynamics governed by discontinuities. They also\nraise concerns about generalizing these methods to traffic applications where\nshock preservation is essential.",

Yet these stars reach the zero age main sequence\n(ZAMS) with a spread in lithium abundance at a given effective temperature that\nis not predicted by standard stellar evolutionary models and which appears to\nbe correlated with rotation. Using a homogeneous dataset provided by the\nGaia-ESO spectroscopic survey, we have followed the evolving photospheric\nlithium content of cohorts of stars destined to be ZAMS late G-, K- and\nM-dwarfs, in clusters at ages of 2-300 Myr. We show that a dispersion in the\nLiI 6708A line strength develops in the lower mass stars after 10-20 Myr on the\nPMS, as soon as Li depletion begins, even in fully convective stars. A model\nbased on a surface starspot coverage varying from star-to-star, leading to a\ndifferential Li-burning rate, can explain this temporal behaviour and its mass\ndependence. However, to fully explain the magnitude of the Li dispersion and\nits correlation with rotation, the spot coverage during Li-burning would need\nto be a factor of two larger on average than measured in ZAMS clusters like the\nPleiades and continue increasing with rotation in PMS stars beyond the usual\n\"saturation limit\" observed for other magnetic activity indicators.",

The utility of VQE is often hindered by the\nlimitations of current quantum hardware, including short qubit coherence times\nand low gate fidelities. These limitations become particularly pronounced when\nVQE is used along with deep quantum circuits, such as those required by the\n\"Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles\" (UCCSD) ansatz, often resulting\nin significant errors. To address these issues, we propose a low-depth ansatz\nbased on parallelized Givens rotations, which can recover substantial\ncorrelation energy while drastically reducing circuit depth and two-qubit gate\ncounts for an arbitrary active space (AS). Also, considering the current\nhardware architectures with low qubit counts, we introduce a systematic way to\nselect molecular orbitals to define active spaces (ASs) that retain significant\nelectron correlation. We validate our approach by computing bond dissociation\nprofiles of water and strongly correlated systems, such as molecular nitrogen\nand oxygen, across various ASs. Noiseless simulations using the new ansatz\nyield ground-state energies comparable to those from the UCCSD ansatz while\nreducing circuit depth by 50-70%. Moreover, in noisy simulations, our approach\nachieves energy error rates an order of magnitude lower than that of UCCSD.\nConsidering the efficiency and practical usage of our ansatz, we hope that it\nbecomes a potential choice for performing quantum chemistry calculations on\nnear-term quantum devices.",

Here, we use the Cluster-Correlation\nExpansion (CCE) to simulate the decoherence of two prototypical molecular\nqubits and quantitatively demonstrate that nuclear spins become the leading\nsource of decoherence only when the electron spin concentration is below 1 mM.\nMoreover, we show that deuterated samples, much easier to achieve than fully\nspin-free environments, could achieve record coherence times of 0.1 ms for an\nelectron spin concentration of 0.1 mM. Alternatively, hydrogen-rich molecular\ncrystals with electron spins concentration below 1 mM can still achieve\ncoherence times of 10 ms through dynamical decoupling, showing that the\npotential of molecular spins for quantum technologies is still untapped.",

To enhance environmental awareness, we integrate Gaussian Process (GP)\nregression into the RL framework, enabling the agent to progressively estimate\na bathymetric depth map from sparse sonar readings. This approach improves\ndecision-making by providing a richer representation of the environment.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate effective sim-to-real transfer, ensuring that\ntrained policies generalize well to real-world aquatic conditions.

We present a novel pitch control algorithm that quantifies\nthe probability of a player gaining possession at any location on the field.\nOur model accounts for the heterogeneity of player speeds by measuring\nperformance during matches and assigning each player a specific top speed. We\nthen compare the pitch control percentages derived from our approach with those\nfrom classical models, which assume uniform top speeds for all players, and\nanalyze the results across different player roles (defenders, midfielders, and\nforwards). Our findings reveal a positive correlation between a player's top\nspeed and their accumulated pitch control, with certain players benefiting more\nfrom this relationship. However, this positive correlation is constrained by\nthe role of the player in the team, with defenders achieving the highest\naccumulated pitch control despite not being the fastest. Furthermore, our\nmethodology supports team-level analysis, identifying which teams gain the\ngreatest advantage from their players' top speeds, and extends to comparisons\nbetween the first and second halves of matches. Our model also enables\nexploration of how changes in top speed may affect pitch control at both the\nindividual and team levels. To facilitate this, we introduce the stamina\nfactor, a parameter that adjusts a player's top speed. We find that the impact\nof the stamina factor on pitch control follows a logarithmic function, with the\nscaling factor quantifying the potential benefits of increased speed.\nInterestingly, the influence of the stamina factor varies significantly by\nplayer position. Overall, our approach provides valuable insights into which\nteams or players could benefit most from improvements in physical performance.",

This advancement makes the\ncurrent work particularly valuable for simulating extreme sea conditions.

    "abstract": "Regular expression matching is of practical importance due to its widespread\nuse in real-world applications. In practical use, regular expressions are often\nused with real-world extensions. Accordingly, the matching problem of regular\nexpressions with real-world extensions has been actively studied in recent\nyears, yielding steady progress. However, backreference, a popular extension\nsupported by most modern programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript\nand others in their standard libraries for string processing, is an exception\nto this positive trend. In fact, it is known that the matching problem of\nregular expressions with backreferences (rewbs) is theoretically hard and the\nexistence of an asymptotically fast matching algorithm for arbitrary rewbs\nseems unlikely. Even among currently known partial solutions, the balance\nbetween efficiency and generality remains unsatisfactory. To bridge this gap,\nwe present an efficient matching algorithm for rewbs of the form $e_0 (e)_1 e_1\n\\backslash 1 e_2$ where $e_0, e, e_1, e_2$ are pure regular expressions, which\nare fundamental and frequently used in practical applications. It runs in\nquadratic time with respect to the input string length, substantially improving\nthe best-known cubic time complexity for these rewbs. Our algorithm combines\nideas from both stringology and automata theory in a novel way. We leverage two\ntechniques from automata theory, injection and summarization, to simultaneously\nexamine matches whose backreferenced substrings are either a fixed\nright-maximal repeat or its extendable prefixes, which are concepts from\nstringology. By further utilizing a subtle property of extendable prefixes, our\nalgorithm correctly decides the matching problem while achieving the\nquadratic-time complexity.",

Traditional dashboards that\ndisplay the results of static analysis security testing often use 2D or 3D\nvisualizations, which tend to lack the spatial details required to effectively\nreveal issues such as the propagation of vulnerabilities across the codebase or\nthe appearance of concurrent vulnerabilities. Additionally, most reporting\nsolutions only treat the analysis results as an artifact that can be reviewed\nor edited asynchronously by developers, limiting real-time, collaborative\nexploration. To the best of our knowledge, no VR-based approach exists for the\nvisualization and interactive exploration of software security vulnerabilities.\nAddressing these challenges, the virtual reality (VR) environment SecCityVR was\ndeveloped as a proof-of-concept implementation that employs the code city\nmetaphor within VR to visualize software security vulnerabilities as colored\nbuilding floors inside the surrounding virtual city. By integrating the\napplication's call graph, vulnerabilities are contextualized within related\nsoftware components. SecCityVR supports multi-user collaboration and\ninteractive exploration. It provides explanations and mitigations for detected\nissues. A user study comparing SecCityVR with the traditional dashboard\nfind-sec-bugs showed the VR approach provided a favorable experience, with\nhigher usability, lower temporal demand, and significantly lower frustration\ndespite having longer task completion times.

As with any camera, the output's quality depends on how well the\ncamera's settings, called biases for event-based cameras, are configured.

With the advent of JWST, atmospheric studies\ncan now put unprecedented constraints on the internal composition of this\npopulation. In this context, the THIRSTEE project aims to investigate the\npopulation properties of sub-Neptunes with a comprehensive and demographic\napproach, providing a homogeneous sample of precisely characterised\nsub-Neptunes across stellar spectral types. We present here the precise\ncharacterisation of the planetary system orbiting one of the THIRSTEE M-dwarf\ntargets, TOI-771 (V = 14.9 mag), known to host one planet, TOI-771 b, which has\nbeen statistically validated using TESS observations. We use TESS, SPECULOOS,\nTRAPPIST and M-Earth photometry together with 31 high-precision ESPRESSO radial\nvelocities to derive the orbital parameters and investigate the internal\ncomposition of TOI-771 b, as well as exploring the presence of additional\ncompanions in the system. We derive precise mass and radius for TOI-771 b, a\nsuper-Earth with R_b = 1.36 +/- 0.10 R_e and M_b = 2.47 +/- 0.32 M_e orbiting\nat 2.3 d. Its composition is consistent with an Earth-like planet, and it adds\nup to the rocky population of sub-Neptunes lying below the density gap\nidentified around M dwarfs. With a 13% precision in mass, a 7% radius\nprecision, and a warm equilibrium temperature of T_eq= 543 K, TOI-771 b is a\nparticularly interesting target for atmospheric characterisation, and it is\nindeed one of the targets under consideration for the Rocky World DDT program.\nAdditionally, we discover the presence of a second, non-transiting planet,\nTOI-771 c, with a period of 7.6 d and a minimum mass of Mp sin(i) = 2.9 +/- 0.4\nM_e.

They are the outermost planets in the solar system with\nintermediate masses/sizes, complex non-polar magnetic fields, strong\natmospheric winds, and not well-understood internal structures. Studying the\ninteriors of Uranus and Neptune is vital for advancing our understanding of\nplanetary formation and evolution as well as for the characterization of\nplanets around other stars. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge\nof the interior and formation of Uranus and Neptune. Both planets are expected\nto be composed of rocks and ices and have H-He atmospheres of the order of 10%\nof their total masses. The rock-to-water ratios in Uranus and Neptune, however,\nare very uncertain. It is also unclear how the different materials are\ndistributed within the interiors and whether distinct layers exist. While often\nUranus and Neptune are viewed as being \"twin planets\" it is in fact unclear how\ndifferent the two planets are from each other, and whether they are indeed\n\"icy\" (water-dominated) planets. After summarizing the current-knowledge of the\ninteriors of Uranus and Neptune, we briefly discuss their magnetic fields and\natmosphere dynamics. We next introduce the challenges in constraining the\nformation paths of Uranus and Neptune: it is still unclear whether the planets\nformed at their current locations, and what the dominating processes that led\nto their formation (accretion rates, size of solids, etc.) were. We also\nmention the possible role of giant impacts shortly after their formation.\nFinally, we suggest that advanced modeling, future observations from space and\nthe ground, lab experiments, and links with exoplanetary science can improve\nour understanding of Uranus and Neptune as a class of astronomical objects\nwhich seems to be very common in our galaxy.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning (TL) for high-dimensional regression (HDR) is an important\nproblem in machine learning, particularly when dealing with limited sample size\nin the target task. However, there currently lacks a method to quantify the\nstatistical significance of the relationship between features and the response\nin TL-HDR settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical inference\nframework for assessing the reliability of feature selection in TL-HDR, called\nPTL-SI (Post-TL Statistical Inference). The core contribution of PTL-SI is its\nability to provide valid $p$-values to features selected in TL-HDR, thereby\nrigorously controlling the false positive rate (FPR) at desired significance\nlevel $\\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). Furthermore, we enhance statistical power by\nincorporating a strategic divide-and-conquer approach into our framework. We\ndemonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed PTL-SI through\nextensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world high-dimensional\ndatasets, confirming its theoretical properties and utility in testing the\nreliability of feature selection in TL scenarios.",

The methods combine the advantages of Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo methods with the nature of continuous time processes in the form of\npiecewise deterministic Markov processes to sample from such distributions.

We perform a comprehensive\nanalysis of the PCEB system TMTS J15530469+4457458 (J1553), discovered by the\nTsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey, to explore its physical\norigin and evolutionary fate. This system is characterized by double-peaked\nBalmer emission lines, and a cross-correlation function is applied to derive\nits radial velocity (RV) from a series of phase-resolved Keck spectra. Analyses\nwith the cross-correlation function suggest that this system is a single-lined\nspectroscopic binary and only one star is optically visible. Further analysis\nthrough Doppler tomography indicates that J1553 is a detached binary without an\naccretion disk. Under such a configuration, the simultaneous light-curve and RV\nfitting reveal that this system contains an unseen WD with mass $M_{\\rm\nA}=0.56\\pm 0.09\\, M_{\\odot}$, and an M4 dwarf with mass $M_{\\rm B}=0.37\\pm\n0.02\\,M_{\\odot}$ and radius $R_{\\rm B}=0.403^{+0.014}_{-0.015}\\,R_{\\odot}$. The\nextra prominent Balmer emission lines seen in the spectra can trace the motion\nof the WD, which are likely formed near the WD surface as a result of wind\naccretion. According to the MESA simulation, J1553 could have evolved from a\nbinary consisting of a 2.0-4.0 ${M}_{\\odot}$ zero-age-main-sequence star and an\nM dwarf with an initial orbital period $P_i\\approx 201-476$ d, and the system\nhas undergone a common-envelope (CE) phase.

Traditional computer vision\ntasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation, focus on concrete\nvisual representations, while intent recognition relies more on implicit visual\nclues. This poses challenges due to the wide variation and subjectivity of such\nclues, compounded by the problem of intra-class variety in conveying abstract\nconcepts, e.g. \"enjoy life\". Existing methods seek to solve the problem by\nmanually designing representative features or building prototypes for each\nclass from global features. However, these methods still struggle to deal with\nthe large visual diversity of each intent category. In this paper, we introduce\na novel approach named Multi-grained Compositional visual Clue Learning (MCCL)\nto address these challenges for image intent recognition. Our method leverages\nthe systematic compositionality of human cognition by breaking down intent\nrecognition into visual clue composition and integrating multi-grained\nfeatures. We adopt class-specific prototypes to alleviate data imbalance. We\ntreat intent recognition as a multi-label classification problem, using a graph\nconvolutional network to infuse prior knowledge through label embedding\ncorrelations.

    "abstract": "This study proposes Auto-Regressive Standardized Precipitation Index (ARSPI)\nas a novel alternative to the traditional Standardized Precipitation Index\n(SPI) for measuring drought by relaxing the assumption of independent and\nidentical rainfall distribution over time. ARSPI utilizes an auto-regressive\nframework to tackle the auto-correlated characteristics of precipitation,\nproviding a more precise depiction of drought dynamics. The proposed model\nintegrates a spike-and-slab log-normal distribution for zero rainfall seasons.\nThe Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach simplifies the SPI\ncomputation using the non-parametric predictive density estimation of total\nrainfall across various time windows from simulated samples. The MCMC\nsimulations further ensure robust estimation of severity, duration, peak and\nreturn period with greater precision. This study also provides a comparison\nbetween the performances of ARSPI and SPI using the precipitation data from the\nColorado River Basin (1893-1991). ARSPI emerges to be more efficient than the\nbenchmark SPI in terms of model fit. ARSPI shows enhanced sensitivity to\nclimatic extremes, making it a valuable tool for hydrological research and\nwater resource management.",

Through comprehensive analysis of\n5,000 researcher profiles across diverse disciplines, we demonstrate that\nexcessive self-citation inflates traditional metrics by 10-20%, potentially\nmisdirecting billions in research funding. Recent studies confirm that\nself-citation patterns exhibit significant gender disparities, with men\nself-citing up to 70% more frequently than women, exacerbating existing\ninequalities in academic recognition.

They have enabled system-level applications in optical\ncommunications, LiDAR, frequency synthesis, low-noise microwave generation, and\nconvolutional processing.

In this work, we overcome thermal limitations and\ndemonstrate deterministic soliton generation in silicon nitride photonic\ncircuits. We trace the thermal effects to copper impurities within waveguides,\noriginating from residual contaminants in CMOS-grade silicon wafers that are\ngettered into silicon nitride during fabrication.

While for\nCoO the easy / hard axis orientation is (111) / [111], for FeO it appears\nreversed and thus emphasises the fundamental importance of (111) as the\ngeometrical driver of the magnetism in the crystals. The identification of the\ncontributions that individual sublattices make to the MCA energy allowed us to\nreveal the decisive role of the electron hopping mechanisms in easy axis\norientation. Considering the MCA and exchange environment with orbital\ndecomposition in CoO and FeO under directional pressure in the (111) plane and\nalong [111] showed a direct interrelation between the ferro- and\nantiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange environment and the energetic\nstability of the easy axis.",

We evaluate CiDiff against several\nbaselines on a novel dataset of 17 906 CI regressions, performing an accuracy\nstudy, a quantitative study and a user-study. Notably, our algorithm reduces\nthe number of lines to inspect by about 60 % in the median case, with\nreasonable overhead compared to the state-of-practice LCS-diff.

Here, the aim was to objectively\ndefine regions of the North Atlantic through systematic comparison of\nclustering methods within the Native Emergent Manifold Interrogation (NEMI)\nframework (Sonnewald, 2023). About 300 million measured salinity, temperature,\nand oxygen, nitrate, phosphate and silicate concentration values served as\ninput for various clustering methods (k-Means, agglomerative Ward, and\nDensity-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)). Uniform\nManifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) emphasised (dis-)similarities in\nthe data while reducing dimensionality. Based on systematic validation of\nclustering methods and their hyperparameters using internal, external and\nrelative validation techniques, results showed that UMAP-DBSCAN best\nrepresented the data. Strikingly, internal validation metrics proved\nsystematically unreliable for comparing clustering methods. To address\nstochastic variability, 100 UMAP-DBSCAN clustering runs were conducted and\naggregated following NEMI, yielding a final set of 321 clusters.\nReproducibility was evaluated via ensemble overlap ($88.81\\pm1.8\\%$) and mean\ngrid cell-wise uncertainty ($15.49\\pm20\\%$). Case studies of the Mediterranean\nSea, deep Atlantic waters and Labrador Sea showed strong agreement with common\nwater mass definitions.

    "abstract": "Deep subspace clustering (DSC) algorithms face several challenges that hinder\ntheir widespread adoption across variois application domains. First, clustering\nquality is typically assessed using only the encoder's output layer,\ndisregarding valuable information present in the intermediate layers. Second,\nmost DSC approaches treat representation learning and subspace clustering as\nindependent tasks, limiting their effectiveness. Third, they assume the\navailability of a held-out dataset for hyperparameter tuning, which is often\nimpractical in real-world scenarios. Fourth, learning termination is commonly\nbased on clustering error monitoring, requiring external labels. Finally, their\nperformance often depends on post-processing techniques that rely on labeled\ndata. To address this limitations, we introduce a novel single-view DSC\napproach that: (i) minimizes a layer-wise self expression loss using a joint\nrepresentation matrix; (ii) optimizes a subspace-structured norm to enhance\nclustering quality; (iii) employs a multi-stage sequential learning framework,\nconsisting of pre-training and fine-tuning, enabling the use of multiple\nregularization terms without hyperparameter tuning; (iv) incorporates a\nrelative error-based self-stopping mechanism to terminate training without\nlabels; and (v) retains a fixed number of leading coefficients in the learned\nrepresentation matrix based on prior knowledge.

    "abstract": "One of the potential sources of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is a\nrotating magnetosphere of a compact object, as suggested by the similarities in\nthe polarization properties of FRBs and radio pulsars. Attempts to measure an\nunderlying period in the times of arrival of repeating FRBs have nevertheless\nbeen unsuccessful. To explain this lack of observed periodicity, it is often\nsuggested that the line of sight towards the source must be sampling active\nparts of the emitting magnetosphere throughout the rotation of the compact\nobject, i.e. has a large duty cycle, as can be the case in a neutron star with\nnear-aligned magnetic and rotation axes. This may lead to apparently aperiodic\nbursts, however the polarization angle of the bursts should be tied to the\nrotational phase from which they occur. This is true for radio pulsars. We\ntherefore propose a new test to identify a possible stable rotation period\nunder the assumptions above, based on a periodogram of the measured\npolarization angle timeseries for repeating FRBs. We show that this test is\nhighly sensitive when the duty cycle is large, where standard time-of-arrival\nperiodicity searches fail. Therefore, we can directly test the hypothesis of\nrepeating FRBs of magnetospheric origin with a stable rotation period. Both\npositive and negative results of the test applied to FRB data will provide\nimportant information.",

    "abstract": "To meet the demand for designing efficient neural networks with appropriate\ntrade-offs between model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) and\ncomputational complexity, the differentiable neural architecture distillation\n(DNAD) algorithm is developed based on two cores, namely search by deleting and\nsearch by imitating. Primarily, to derive neural architectures in a space where\ncells of the same type no longer share the same topology, the super-network\nprogressive shrinking (SNPS) algorithm is developed based on the framework of\ndifferentiable architecture search (DARTS), i.e., search by deleting. Unlike\nconventional DARTS-based approaches which yield neural architectures with\nsimple structures and derive only one architecture during the search procedure,\nSNPS is able to derive a Pareto-optimal set of architectures with flexible\nstructures by forcing the dynamic super-network shrink from a dense structure\nto a sparse one progressively. Furthermore, since knowledge distillation (KD)\nhas shown great effectiveness to train a compact network with the assistance of\nan over-parameterized model, we integrate SNPS with KD to formulate the DNAD\nalgorithm, i.e., search by imitating. By minimizing behavioral differences\nbetween the super-network and teacher network, the over-fitting of one-level\nDARTS is avoided and well-performed neural architectures are derived.\nExperiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification tasks demonstrate that both\nSNPS and DNAD are able to derive a set of architectures which achieve similar\nor lower error rates with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Particularly, DNAD\nachieves the top-1 error rate of 23.7% on ImageNet classification with a model\nof 6.0M parameters and 598M FLOPs, which outperforms most DARTS-based methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a brief review on theoretical and numerical works on\nthree-dimensional acoustic turbulence both in a weakly nonlinear regime, when\nthe amplitudes of sound waves are small, and in the case of strong\nnonlinearity. This review is based on the classical studies on weak acoustic\nturbulence by V.E. Zakharov (1965) and V.E. Zakharov and R.Z. Sagdeev (1970),\non the one hand, and on the other hand, by B.B. Kadomtsev and V.I. Petviashvili\n(1972). Until recently, there were no convincing numerical experiments\nconfirming one or the other point of view. In the works of the authors of this\nreview in 2022 and 2024, strong arguments were found based on direct numerical\nmodeling in favor of both theories. It is shown that the Zakharov-Sagdeev\nspectrum of weak turbulence $\\propto k^{-3/2}$ is realized not only for small\npositive dispersion of sound waves, but also in the case of complete absence of\ndispersion. The calculated turbulence spectra in the weakly nonlinear regime\nhave anisotropic distribution: for small $k$, narrow cones (jets) are formed,\nbroadening in the Fourier space. For weak dispersion, the jets are smoothed\nout, and the turbulence spectrum tends to be isotropic in the region of short\nwavelengths. In the absence of dispersion, the turbulence spectrum is a\ndiscrete set of jets subjected to diffraction divergence. For each individual\njet, nonlinear effects are much weaker than diffraction ones, which prevents\nthe formation of shock waves. Thus, the Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum is realized\ndue to the smallness of nonlinear effects compared to dispersion or\ndiffraction. As the pumping level increases in the non-dispersive regime, when\nnonlinear effects begin to dominate, shock waves are formed. As a result,\nacoustic turbulence passes into a strongly nonlinear state in the form of an\nensemble of random shocks described by the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili spectrum\n$\\propto k^{-2}$.",

    "abstract": "Strong priors are imposed on the search space of Differentiable Architecture\nSearch (DARTS), such that cells of the same type share the same topological\nstructure and each intermediate node retains two operators from distinct nodes.\nWhile these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the\napplicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development\nof automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm\nfrom exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural\nflexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating\nrestrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for\nsuper-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which\nleverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is\npresented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior\nconstraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures\nwithout strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged\nsearch space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks\ndemonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures\nwith competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity\nwithin a single search procedure.",

    "abstract": "In traditional cellular networks, users at the cell edge often suffer from\npoor quality of service (QoS) due to large distance-dependent path loss and\nsevere inter-cell interference.

To balance performance and cost\nefficiency, this article proposes a simplified design called hierarchical\ncell-free (HCF) massive MIMO. The key idea is to reduce the number of APs, thus\nminimizing the scale of the fronthaul network. The antennas from the\ndecommissioned APs are aggregated at a central base station (cBS), which also\nserves as the coordinator for distributed APs. We derive closed-form\nexpressions for uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) for HCF, CF, and\ncellular massive MIMO under pilot contamination and correlated fading channels,\nconsidering the use of multi-antenna APs. Numerical results confirm that the\nhierarchical architecture achieves $95\\%$-likely per-user SE comparable to CF,\nenhancing cell-edge user rates in cellular systems by over 100 times, while\nsignificantly reducing the complexity and cost of the fronthaul network in CF.\nWe develop max-min fairness algorithms for joint power control of the cBS and\nAPs in the downlink, and the users in the uplink. These algorithms not only\nboost fairness and system capacity but also dramatically lower transmission\npower, e.g., achieving over $70\\%$ savings in uplink, particularly beneficial\nfor battery-powered mobile devices.",

    "abstract": "Existing LLM serving strategies can be categorized based on whether prefill\nand decode phases are disaggregated: non-disaggregated (NoDG) or fully\ndisaggregated (FuDG). However, the NoDG strategy leads to strong prefill-decode\ninterference and the FuDG strategy highly relies on high-performance\ninterconnects, making them less cost-effective.\n  We introduce EcoServe, a system that enables cost-effective LLM serving on\nclusters with commodity interconnects. EcoServe is built on the partially\ndisaggregated (PaDG) strategy, applying temporal disaggregation and rolling\nactivation for proactive intra- and inter-instance scheduling. It first\ndisaggregates the prefill and decode phases along the time dimension within a\nsingle instance to mitigate inter-phase interference and enhance throughput.\nNext, it coordinates multiple instances and cyclically activates them to ensure\nthe continuous availability of prefill processing, thereby improving latency.\nThus, EcoServe's basic serving unit is the macro instance, within which\nmultiple instances collaborate. It further integrates an adaptive scheduling\nalgorithm to route requests in a macro instance and a mitosis scaling approach\nto enable fine-grained capacity scaling. Beyond delivering high goodput,\nEcoServe excels in load balancing, hardware cost, parallelism compatibility,\nand even engineering simplicity compared to existing solutions.\n  When serving 30B- and 70B-scale models on a production-level cluster with 32\nNVIDIA L20 GPUs using commodity Ethernet, EcoServe averagely improves goodput\nby 82.49%, 86.17%, 122.76%, and 126.96% over four representative NoDG and FuDG\nsystems.",

In this approach, the\nnonunitary Gutzwiller operator is decomposed into a linear combination of\nunitaries constructed from two-qubit fermionic Givens rotation gates, whose\nrotation angles are dictated by the auxiliary fields. We develop and\nreformulate two complementary methods to perform the sum over these auxiliary\nfields. In the first method, the Gutzwiller wave function is probabilistically\nprepared on the register qubits by projectively postselecting the desired state\nvia measurements of ancilla qubits. We analyze the success rate both\nanalytically and numerically as a function of the Gutzwiller variational\nparameter $g$ for the Fermi-sea and BCS-like trial states at half filling. The\nsuccess rate is found to decay exponentially for small $|g|$, but remains\nfinite in the $|g|\\to\\infty$ limit, with increasing $|g|$.

In\nthis work, we study the reproducibility of the existing sockpuppeting audits of\nTikTok recommender systems, and the generalizability of their findings. In our\nefforts to reproduce the previous works, we find multiple challenges stemming\nfrom social media platform changes and content evolution, but also the research\nworks themselves. These drawbacks limit the audit reproducibility and require\nan extensive effort altogether with inevitable adjustments to the auditing\nmethodology. Our experiments also reveal that these one-shot audit findings\noften hold only in the short term, implying that the reproducibility and\ngeneralizability of the audits heavily depend on the methodological choices and\nthe state of algorithms and content on the platform. This highlights the\nimportance of reproducible audits that allow us to determine how the situation\nchanges in time.",

These molecules exist both in the gas phase and as ices accreted onto\ngrain surfaces. To model these environments, we present Pegasis, a new, fast,\nand extensible three-phase astrochemical code to explore the chemistry of cold\ncores, with an emphasis on the role of diffusive and non-diffusive chemistry in\nshaping their gas and grain chemical compositions. We incorporated the 2024\nKIDA chemical network and compared our results with current astrochemical\nmodels. Using a traditional rate-equation-based approach, we implemented both\ndiffusive and non-diffusive chemistry, coupled with either an inert or\nchemically active ice mantle. We identify crucial reactions that enhance the\nproduction of COMs through non-diffusive mechanisms on the grain surface as\nwell as the mechanisms through which they can accumulate in the gas phase.\nAcross all models with non-diffusive chemistry, we observe a definite\nenhancement in the concentration of COMs on both the grain surface as well as\nin the grain mantle. Finally, our model broadly reproduces the observed\nabundances of multiple gas-phase species in the cold dense core TMC-1 (CP) and\nprovides insights into its chemical age. Our work demonstrates the capabilities\nof Pegasis in exploring a wide range of grain-surface chemical processes and\nmodeling approaches for three-phase chemistry in the ISM, providing robust\nexplanations for observed abundances in TMC-1 (CP). In particular, it\nhighlights the role of non-diffusive chemistry in the production of gas-phase\nCOMs on grain surfaces, which are subsequently chemically desorbed, especially\nwhen the precursors involved in their formation on the surfaces are heavier\nthan atomic hydrogen.",

However, their topological dynamical properties have\nonly recently been revealed. As the structural complexity of the frame\nincreases along with the number of beam members arranged in the two-dimensional\nplane, the vibration modes also increase significantly in number, with\nfrequency ranges of topological states and bulk states overlapped, leading to\nhybrid mode shapes. Therefore, concise theoretical results are necessary to\nguide the identification of topological modes in such planar continuum systems\nwith complex spectra. In this work, within an infinitely long frequency\nspectrum, we obtain analytical expressions for the frequencies of higher-order\ntopological corner states, edge states, and bulk states in kagome frames and\nsquare frames, as well as the criteria of existence of these topological states\nand patterns of their distribution in the spectrum. Additionally, we present\nthe frequency expressions and the existence criterion for topological edge\nstates in quasi-one-dimensional structures such as bridge-like frames, along\nwith an approach to determine the existence of topological edge states based on\nbulk topological invariants. These theoretical results fully demonstrate that\nthe grid-like frames, despite being a large class of continuum systems with\ncomplex spectra, have topological states (including higher-order topological\nstates) that can be accurately characterized through concise analytical\nexpressions.

To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel object detection network Multi-scale Context Aggregation and\nScale-adaptive Fusion YOLO (MASF-YOLO), which is developed based on YOLOv11.\nFirstly, to tackle the difficulty of detecting small objects in UAV images, we\ndesign a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM), which significantly\nimproves the detection accuracy of small objects through parallel multi-scale\nconvolutions and feature fusion. Secondly, to mitigate the interference of\nbackground noise, we propose an Improved Efficient Multi-scale Attention Module\n(IEMA), which enhances the focus on target regions through feature grouping,\nparallel sub-networks, and cross-spatial learning. Thirdly, we introduce a\nDimension-Aware Selective Integration Module (DASI), which further enhances\nmulti-scale feature fusion capabilities by adaptively weighting and fusing\nlow-dimensional features and high-dimensional features. Finally, we conducted\nextensive performance evaluations of our proposed method on the VisDrone2019\ndataset.

For this distinction, we consider two approaches:\none in which a single photon is prepared in a nonlocal state before interacting\nwith the phase plates, and the other in which the single photon remains in a\nlocal state.

This paper empirically evaluates tree boosting\nmethods' performance given different dataset sizes and class distributions,\nfrom perfectly balanced to highly imbalanced. For tabular data, tree-based\nmethods such as XGBoost, stand out in several benchmarks due to detection\nperformance and speed. Therefore, XGBoost and Imbalance-XGBoost are evaluated.\nAfter introducing the motivation to address risk assessment with machine\nlearning, the paper reviews evaluation metrics for detection systems or binary\nclassifiers. It proposes a method for data preparation followed by tree\nboosting methods including hyper-parameter optimization. The method is\nevaluated on private datasets of 1 thousand (K), 10K and 100K samples on\ndistributions with 50, 45, 25, and 5 percent positive samples. As expected, the\ndeveloped method increases its recognition performance as more data is given\nfor training and the F1 score decreases as the data distribution becomes more\nimbalanced, but it is still significantly superior to the baseline of\nprecision-recall determined by the ratio of positives divided by positives and\nnegatives. Sampling to balance the training set does not provide consistent\nimprovement and deteriorates detection. In contrast, classifier hyper-parameter\noptimization improves recognition, but should be applied carefully depending on\ndata volume and distribution.

The\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a highly effective\nmedium for this purpose, and various hyper-polarization protocols have been\ndeveloped. Among these, the pulsed polarization (PulsePol) method has been\nextensively studied due to its robustness against static energy shifts of the\nelectron spin. In this study, we introduce a sequential polarization protocol\nand identify a series of magic and digital sequences for hyper-polarizing\nnuclear spins. Notably, we demonstrate that some of these magic sequences\nexhibit significantly greater robustness compared to the PulsePol protocol in\nthe presence of finite half $\\pi$ pulse duration of the protocol. This enhanced\nrobustness positions our protocol as a more suitable candidate for\nhyper-polarizing nuclear spins species with large gyromagnetic ratios and also\nensures better compatibility with high-efficiency readout techniques at high\nmagnetic fields.

    "abstract": "N$_2^+$ air lasing has attracted considerable attention due to its promising\napplications in remote sensing and the debates surrounding its generation\nmechanisms. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the\nrole of molecular rotation in N$_2^+$ lasing at 391 nm ($B^2 \\Sigma\n_u^+(v''=0)\\rightarrow X^2 \\Sigma _g^+ (v=0)$). By solving the open-system\ndensity matrix and Maxwell-Bloch equations in a rovibronic-state basis, we\nexamine both the formation of the N$_2^+$ gain medium induced by a femtosecond\npump pulse and the subsequent spatial propagation of the seed pulse. During the\npump stage, rotational dynamics are found to significantly modify the\nangle-dependent populations of ionic vibrational-electronic states within tens\nof femtoseconds. Furthermore, ionization-produced rotational coherences\nsubstantially enhance the population inversion between the $X^2 \\Sigma _g^+\n(v=0)$ and $B^2 \\Sigma _u^+(v''=0)$ states. In the seed propagation stage, both\npopulation inversion and rotational coherence are found to contribute to the\nlasing process, with the latter playing a dominant role in amplifying the\nlasing signals. These findings reveal the crucial role of molecular rotation in\nN$_2^+$ air lasing and highlight its potential as a tunable parameter for\ncontrolling lasing dynamics.",

Although measurements of {\\Delta}_SO in hBN-encapsulated\nBLG have been reported, the relatively large experimental variations and\nexisting experimental controversy make it difficult to fully understand the\nphysical origin of {\\Delta}_SO. Here, we report a combined experimental and\ntheoretical study on {\\Delta}_SO in hBN-encapsulated BLG. We use an averaging\nmethod to extract {\\Delta}_SO in gate-defined single quantum dot devices. Under\nD fields as large as 0.57-0.90 V/nm, {\\Delta}_SO=53.4-61.8 {\\mu}eV is obtained\nfrom two devices.

This behavior is confirmed\nby our first-principle calculations, based on which {\\Delta}_SO is found to be\nindependent of D field, regardless of different hBN/BLG/hBN stacking\nconfigurations.

The overhead is modest: the RGS generation slows down\nproportionally with the number of purification rounds, and each round requires\nonly one additional quantum emitter per half-RGS source. However, since the\ngeneration time is negligible compared to the end-to-end communication delay,\nthe total latency remains effectively dominated by communication time, similar\nto frameworks without purification. Our framework enables flexible purification\nscheduling along the connection path, making it compatible with memory-based\nstrategies, a rich body of research on purification scheduling and optimization\nthat was previously thought inapplicable to the RGS scheme.

    "abstract": "The problem of calculating the electron-positively charged particle\ncorrelation energy poses a challenge in the field of quantum chemistry beyond\nthe adiabatic approximation. In this study, a toy model called Exotic Harmonium\nis developed to enhance our understanding of this type of correlation. Since\nthe analytical methods to solve the eigenvalue equation for Exotic Harmonium\nlead to the excited rather than the ground state of the system, we employ the\nvariation method in this study to obtain an approximate ground state wave\nfunction. By considering the asymptotic behavior of the wave function, we\nderive a compact but highly accurate variational wave function. Using this wave\nfunction, we are able to determine various properties of the system, including\nenergy and its components, as well as single-particle densities. Additionally,\nwe extend key concepts and quantities specifically tailored to study electron\ncorrelation in the Harmonium model to the Exotic Harmonium model. For instance,\nthe \"correlation hill\" concept effectively highlights the distinct nature of\nelectron-positively charged particle correlation compared to electron-electron\ncorrelation. Furthermore, we utilize Exotic Harmonium to assess the accuracy of\nfive electron-positively charged particle correlation functionals developed\nwithin the context of the two-component density functional theory. Through a\nregression process, we obtained a compact yet precise analytical form for wave\nfunction which explicitly depends on the two crucial variables: oscillator\nfield frequency and positively charged particle mass. This analytical form\nprovides valuable insights into the behavior of the system. Also, the Exotic\nHarmonium model enables the investigation of electron-positively charged\nparticle correlation in a vast range of particle masses.",

    "abstract": "While it is beneficial to objectively determine whether a subject is\nmeditating, most research in the literature reports good results only in a\nsubject-dependent manner. This study aims to distinguish the modified state of\nconsciousness experienced during Rajyoga meditation from the resting state of\nthe brain in a subject-independent manner using EEG data. Three architectures\nhave been proposed and evaluated: The CSP-LDA Architecture utilizes common\nspatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and linear discriminant analysis\n(LDA) for classification. The CSP-LDA-LSTM Architecture employs CSP for feature\nextraction, LDA for dimensionality reduction, and long short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetworks for classification, modeling the binary classification problem as a\nsequence learning problem. The SVD-NN Architecture uses singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) to select the most relevant components of the EEG signals\nand a shallow neural network (NN) for classification. The CSP-LDA-LSTM\narchitecture gives the best performance with 98.2% accuracy for intra-subject\nclassification. The SVD-NN architecture provides significant performance with\n96.4\\% accuracy for inter-subject classification. This is comparable to the\nbest-reported accuracies in the literature for intra-subject classification.\nBoth architectures are capable of capturing subject-invariant EEG features for\neffectively classifying the meditative state from the resting state. The high\nintra-subject and inter-subject classification accuracies indicate these\nsystems' robustness and their ability to generalize across different subjects.",

Recently, it has been\nreported that an intermetallic HoAgGe exhibits two distinct magnetic structures\nwith the finite magnetic vector $q=(1/3,1/3,0)$: One is the partially ordered\nstate in the intermediate-temperature region, and the other is the kagome spin\nice state in the lowest-temperature region. We theoretically elucidate that the\nformer is characterized by antiferrotoroidal ordering, while the latter is\ncharacterized by ferritoroidal ordering based on the multipole representation\ntheory, which provides an opposite interpretation to previous studies. We also\nshow how antiferrotoroidal and ferritoroidal orderings are microscopically\nformed by quantifying the magnetic toroidal moment activated in a multiorbital\nsystem. As a result, we find that the degree of distortion for the kagome\nstructure plays a significant role in determining the nature of\nantiferrotoroidal and ferritoroidal orderings, which brings about the crossover\nbetween the antiferro-type and the ferri-type distributions of the magnetic\ntoroidal dipole.

R-functions provide normalized distance fields, enabling accurate\nrepresentation of boundary geometries, including non-convex domains, and\nfacilitating various types of boundary conditions.

In particular, the\nproperties of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian used for encoding\nsignificantly influence model performance. Recent encoding methods have\ndemonstrated that the expressive power of learning models can be enhanced by\napplying exponentially large magnetic fields proportional to the number of\nqubits. However, this approach poses a challenge as it requires exponentially\nincreasing magnetic fields, which are impractical for implementation in\nlarge-scale systems. Here, we propose a QCL method that leverages a\nnon-integrable Hamiltonian for encoding, aiming to achieve both enhanced\nexpressive power and practical feasibility. We find that the thermalization\nproperties of non-integrable systems over long timescales, implying that the\nenergy difference has a low probability to be degenerate, lead to an enhanced\nexpressive power for QCL. Since the required magnetic field strength remains\nwithin a practical range, our approach to using the non-integrable system is\nsuitable for large-scale quantum computers.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework\ndubbed as DICE-Talk, following the idea of disentangling identity with emotion,\nand then cooperating emotions with similar characteristics.

    "abstract": "New technologies create opportunities while displacing others. They enhance\nlife by supporting entertainment, education, and social connectivity but also\nreplace humans in productivity and analytical tasks. Adapting to these shifts\nrequires technical adjustments and social readiness. For digital transformation\nto succeed, organizations and their workforce must be psychologically prepared.\nWe are entering the era of Generative AI with tools like ChatGPT, Bing AI, and\nMicrosoft Office Copilot. Understanding public sentiment toward these\ninnovations is crucial for refining technology acceptance models and informing\nmarket strategies. Using the Gartner Hype Cycle and Kubler-Ross Change Curve,\nthis study suggests that generative AI adoption is a dual-stage process. It\nfollows the phases of technology trigger, peak of expectations, trough of\ndisillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity, while\nalso reflecting emotional stages like shock, denial, and integration. The study\nused sentiment and emotion analysis on a large dataset of tweets about\ngenerative AI, translating them into scores to track user responses over time.\nUnlike prior research, which offered a snapshot of sentiment, this study\ncaptures the dynamic evolution of attitudes, linking empirical evidence with\ntheoretical frameworks. It shifts the focus from information seekers to content\ncreators. With the release of generative AI tools, there is a significant gap\nin understanding societal reception and adaptation. Policymakers face\nuncertainty about guiding markets for these changes. This research validates\nthe applicability of the Gartner Hype Cycle and Kubler-Ross Change Curve to\ngenerative AI. It provides insights for businesses in integrating these tools\nand crafting policies to enhance readiness and resilience.",

However, self-converse graphs are\nextremely rare; this paper considers a more general class of oriented graphs\n$\\mathcal{G}_{n}$ (not limited to self-converse graphs), consisting of all\n$n$-vertex oriented graphs $\\Sigma$ such that $2^{-\\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\n\\right \\rfloor }\\det W(\\Sigma)$ is an odd and square-free integer, where\n$W(\\Sigma)=[e,Se,\\dots,S^{n-1}e]$ ($e$ is the all-one vector) is the skew-walk\nmatrix of $\\Sigma$. Given that $\\Sigma$ is cospectral with its converse\n$\\Sigma^{\\rm T}$, there always exists a unique regular rational orthogonal\n$Q_0$ such that $Q_0^{\\rm T}SQ_0=-S$. This study reveals that there exists a\ndeep relationship between the level $\\ell_0$ of $Q_0$ and the number of\ngeneralized cospectral mates of $\\Sigma$. More precisely, we show, among\nothers, that the maximum number of generalized cospectral mates of\n$\\Sigma\\in\\mathcal{G}_{n}$ is at most $2^{t}-1$, where $t$ is the number of\nprime factors of $\\ell_0$. Moreover, some numerical examples are also provided\nto demonstrate that the above upper bound is attainable.

Therefore, estimating this generation\nfrom net load, known as PV disaggregation, is critical. Given privacy concerns\nand the need for large training datasets, federated learning becomes a\npromising approach, but statistical heterogeneity, arising from geographical\nand behavioral variations among prosumers, poses new challenges to PV\ndisaggregation. To overcome these challenges, a privacy-preserving distributed\nPV disaggregation framework is proposed using Personalized Federated Learning\n(PFL). The proposed method employs a two-level framework that combines local\nand global modeling. At the local level, a transformer-based PV disaggregation\nmodel is designed to generate solar irradiance embeddings for representing\nlocal PV conditions. A novel adaptive local aggregation mechanism is adopted to\nmitigate the impact of statistical heterogeneity on the local model, extracting\na portion of global information that benefits the local model. At the global\nlevel, a central server aggregates information uploaded from multiple data\ncenters, preserving privacy while enabling cross-center knowledge sharing.\nExperiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed\nframework, showing improved accuracy and robustness compared to benchmark\nmethods.",

These techniques use inherent defects introduced in quartz crystal\nduring its crystallization in nature. The defect comprises both intrinsic as\nwell as extrinsic defects. These defects give important luminescence properties\nto quartz but are not yet well understood from a theoretical perspective.\nSpecifically, in case of luminescence dosimetry the nature of traps and their\ninvolvement in luminescence production is not exactly known. Thus, present work\nattempts to understand the basic physics of defects and their implication for\nluminescence and ESR techniques via Density Functional Theory (DFT) modelling.\nThe work uses DFT to model the presence of some possible major impurities in\nquartz. Several interesting novel results are obtained that will have\nimplications for ongoing research in Luminescence and ESR methods. The DFT\nmodelling suggested that Oxygen deficiency in quartz crystal results in the\nformation of both electron and hole trapping centres. However, it is observed\nthat these centres can be passivated by the introduction of charge compensating\nOH or H ions. Further, it is found that peroxy defects can be formed in the\npresence of either excess Oxygen or due to the absence of Silicon (Si4+),\nhowever, the nature of the traps formed in both cases is different. Besides\nthese intrinsic defects, Al and Fe are the major impurities which are observed\nas defects in quartz. The modelling of these impurities suggested that\nnegligible change in DOS is observed for Al defect and Fe generally forms a\nrecombination centre or hole trap.

Here we develop modWorm: a modular modeling\nframework for the nematode C. elegans. modWorm allows for construction of a\nmodel as an integrated series of configurable, exchangeable modules each\ndescribing specific biophysical processes across different modalities.\nUtilizing modWorm, we propose a base neuro-mechanical model for C. elegans\nbuilt upon the complete connectome.

We validate the base model by in-silico\ninjection of constant currents into neurons known to be associated with\nlocomotion behaviors and by applying external forces to the body. Applications\nof in-silico neural stimuli experimentally known to modulate locomotion show\nthat the model can recapitulate natural behavioral responses such as forward\nand backward locomotion as well as mid-locomotion responses such as avoidance\nand turns. Furthermore, through in-silico ablation surveys, the model can infer\nnovel neural circuits involved in sensorimotor behaviors.

Detailed numerical integrations show that the orbital elements in the\nbarycentric reference frame are nearly constant, except within the orbit of\nJupiter where the comet or meteoroid shifts to a heliocentric orbit. Here we\nshow that this encounter can be modeled in the barycentric frame analogously to\nhow planetary close encounters are treated in the heliocentric frame, with the\ncomet captured into an elliptic orbit about the Sun as it in turn orbits SSB.\nModeling the encounters as a two-body interaction in the SSB frame gives a\ndifferent insight into the dynamics than offered by secular perturbation\nanalyses, and reveals that a large portion of the stochasticity seen in the\nevolution of the comet's orbit is due to the Sun's state relative to SSB at the\ntime of encounter.

    "abstract": "Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) provides a non-invasive, portable\nimaging modality with significant potential in medical and industrial\napplications. Despite its advantages, EIT encounters two primary challenges:\nthe ill-posed nature of its inverse problem and the spatially variable,\nlocation-dependent sensitivity distribution. Traditional model-based methods\nmitigate ill-posedness through regularization but overlook sensitivity\nvariability, while supervised deep learning approaches require extensive\ntraining data and lack generalization. Recent developments in neural fields\nhave introduced implicit regularization techniques for image reconstruction,\nbut these methods typically neglect the physical principles underlying EIT,\nthus limiting their effectiveness. In this study, we propose PhyNC\n(Physics-driven Neural Compensation), an unsupervised deep learning framework\nthat incorporates the physical principles of EIT. PhyNC addresses both the\nill-posed inverse problem and the sensitivity distribution by dynamically\nallocating neural representational capacity to regions with lower sensitivity,\nensuring accurate and balanced conductivity reconstructions. Extensive\nevaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC\noutperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact\nresistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the\nrobustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be\nadapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges.",

Here, we\ntheoretically and experimentally report that, under gauge fields, non-Hermitian\nsystems with reciprocal couplings and without gain and loss, can nontrivially\ngive rise to an unprecedented nonreciprocal skin effect, featuring helical\nspin-dependent skin accumulations, dubbed as the ``helical spin skin effect\".\nSpecifically, we construct a lattice model with reciprocal dissipative\ncouplings and gauge fields, implemented in circuit metamaterials.

As the gauge field strength is\napplied from $0$ to $\\pi$, we observe the emergence of two distinct spin skin\neffects and their transitions: the hybrid-order and second-order helical spin\nskin effects. Furthermore, we show that these effects can be harnessed to\nrealize helical spin-dependent nonreciprocal transmissions.

Typically,\nmodels deployed on immersive computing devices are static and limited to their\ndefault set of classes. The goal of our research is to provide users and\ndevelopers with the capability to personalize their experience by adding new\naction classes to their device models continually. Importantly, a user should\nbe able to add new classes in a low-shot and efficient manner, while this\nprocess should not require storing or replaying any of user's sensitive\ntraining data. We formalize this problem as privacy-aware few-shot continual\naction recognition. Towards this end, we propose POET: Prompt-Offset Tuning.\nWhile existing prompt tuning approaches have shown great promise for continual\nlearning of image, text, and video modalities; they demand access to\nextensively pretrained transformers. Breaking away from this assumption, POET\ndemonstrates the efficacy of prompt tuning a significantly lightweight\nbackbone, pretrained exclusively on the base class data. We propose a novel\nspatio-temporal learnable prompt offset tuning approach, and are the first to\napply such prompt tuning to Graph Neural Networks. We contribute two new\nbenchmarks for our new problem setting in human action recognition: (i) NTU\nRGB+D dataset for activity recognition, and (ii) SHREC-2017 dataset for hand\ngesture recognition.

While non-parametric state estimation methods, such\nas particle filters, are robust in situations with high ambiguity, they are\nknown to be unsuitable for high-dimensional problems due to the curse of\ndimensionality. To address this issue, we propose a particle update strategy\nthat improves the sampling efficiency by using the gradient information of the\nlikelihood function to guide particles toward its mode. Additionally, we\nintroduce a keyframe-based map representation that represents the global map as\na set of past frames (i.e., keyframes) to mitigate memory consumption. The\nkeyframe poses for each particle are corrected using a simple loop closure\nmethod to maintain trajectory consistency. The combination of gradient\ninformation and keyframe-based map representation significantly enhances\nsampling efficiency and reduces memory usage compared to traditional RBPF\napproaches. To process a large number of particles (e.g., 100,000 particles) in\nreal-time, the proposed framework is designed to fully exploit GPU parallel\nprocessing.

We hypothesize that\nwhile adversarial noise perturbs various regions of an image, edges may remain\nrelatively stable and provide essential structural information for\nclassification. To test this, we conducted a series of experiments using brain\ntumor and COVID datasets. Initially, we trained the models on clean images and\nthen introduced subtle adversarial perturbations, which caused deep learning\nmodels to significantly misclassify the images.

To evaluate the robustness\nof the edge features, we extracted edges from the original/clean images and\ntrained the models exclusively on edge-based representations. When noise was\nintroduced to the images, the edge-based models demonstrated greater resilience\nto adversarial attacks compared to those trained on the original or clean\nimages. These results suggest that while adversarial noise is able to exploit\ncomplex non-edge regions significantly more than edges, the improvement in the\naccuracy after retraining is marginally more in the original data as compared\nto the edges.

    "abstract": "Validating the correctness of network protocol implementations is highly\nchallenging due to the oracle and traceability problems. The former determines\nwhen a protocol implementation can be considered buggy, especially when the\nbugs do not cause any observable symptoms. The latter allows developers to\nunderstand how an implementation violates the protocol specification, thereby\nfacilitating bug fixes. Unlike existing works that rarely take both problems\ninto account, this work considers both and provides an effective solution using\nrecent advances in large language models (LLMs). Our key observation is that\nnetwork protocols are often released with structured specification documents,\na.k.a. RFC documents, which can be systematically translated to formal protocol\nmessage specifications via LLMs. Such specifications, which may contain errors\ndue to the hallucination of LLMs, are used as a quasi-oracle to validate\nprotocol parsers, while the validation results in return gradually refine the\noracle. Since the oracle is derived from the document, any bugs we find in a\nprotocol implementation can be traced back to the document, thus addressing the\ntraceability problem. We have extensively evaluated our approach using nine\nnetwork protocols and their implementations written in C, Python, and Go. The\nresults show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art and has\ndetected 69 bugs, with 36 confirmed. The project also demonstrates the\npotential for fully automating software validation based on natural language\nspecifications, a process previously considered predominantly manual due to the\nneed to understand specification documents and derive expected outputs for test\ninputs.",

Nevertheless, deep learning\nmethods usually rely on large amounts of labeled data. In medical imaging\nresearch, the acquisition of high-quality labels is both expensive and\ndifficult. The introduction of Vision Transformers (ViT) and self-supervised\nlearning provides a pre-training strategy that utilizes abundant unlabeled\ndata, effectively alleviating the label acquisition challenge while broadening\nthe breadth of data utilization. However, ViT's high computational density and\nsubstantial demand for computing power, coupled with the lack of localization\ncharacteristics of its operations on image patches, limit its efficiency and\napplicability in many application scenarios.

However,\ntraditional diagnostic methods and existing monocular image-based deep learning\napproaches often overlook the pathological correlations between the two eyes.\nIn practical medical robotic diagnostic scenarios, paired retinal images\n(binocular fundus images) are frequently required as diagnostic evidence. To\naddress this, we propose DMS-Net-a dual-modal multi-scale siamese network for\nbinocular retinal image classification. The framework employs a weight-sharing\nsiamese ResNet-152 architecture to concurrently extract deep semantic features\nfrom bilateral fundus images. To tackle challenges like indistinct lesion\nboundaries and diffuse pathological distributions, we introduce the OmniPool\nSpatial Integrator Module (OSIM), which achieves multi-resolution feature\naggregation through multi-scale adaptive pooling and spatial attention\nmechanisms. Furthermore, the Calibrated Analogous Semantic Fusion Module\n(CASFM) leverages spatial-semantic recalibration and bidirectional attention\nmechanisms to enhance cross-modal interaction, aggregating modality-agnostic\nrepresentations of fundus structures. To fully exploit the differential\nsemantic information of lesions present in bilateral fundus features, we\nintroduce the Cross-Modal Contrastive Alignment Module (CCAM).

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities\nin social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and\nsocial deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to\ntextual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial\nexpressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate.\nMoreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players'\nidentities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players.\nTo address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a\ntestbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal\ninformation into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal\ntones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to\nrepresent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM\nmodel with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication\nstrategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive\nevaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human\nplayers, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work\npresents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like\nsocial reasoning across multimodal domains.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of malware variants requires robust classification\nmethods to enhance cybersecurity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer\npotential for generating malware descriptions to aid family classification,\ntheir utility is limited by semantic embedding overlaps and misalignment with\nbinary behavioral features. We propose a contrastive fine-tuning (CFT) method\nthat refines LLM embeddings via targeted selection of hard negative samples\nbased on cosine similarity, enabling LLMs to distinguish between closely\nrelated malware families. Our approach combines high-similarity negatives to\nenhance discriminative power and mid-tier negatives to increase embedding\ndiversity, optimizing both precision and generalization. Evaluated on the\nCIC-AndMal-2020 and BODMAS datasets, our refined embeddings are integrated into\na multimodal classifier within a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework\non a few-shot setting. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: our\nmethod achieves 63.15% classification accuracy with as few as 20 samples on\nCIC-AndMal-2020, outperforming baselines by 11--21 percentage points and\nsurpassing prior negative sampling strategies. Ablation studies confirm the\nsuperiority of similarity-based selection over random sampling, with gains of\n10-23%. Additionally, fine-tuned LLMs generate attribute-aware descriptions\nthat generalize to unseen variants, bridging textual and binary feature gaps.\nThis work advances malware classification by enabling nuanced semantic\ndistinctions and provides a scalable framework for adapting LLMs to\ncybersecurity challenges.",

We classify these\nrelationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and\nduplicated.

Therefore, we introduce Context\nOrganizer (CORG), a framework that organizes multiple contexts into\nindependently processed groups.

Context is derived by aggregating and\ninferring from dynamic IoT data, making it highly volatile and posing\nchallenges in maintaining freshness and real-time accessibility. Caching is a\npotential solution, but traditional policies struggle with the transient nature\nof context in IoT (e.g., ensuring real-time access for frequent queries or\nhandling fast-changing data). To address this, we propose the Dynamic Context\nMonitoring Framework (DCMF) to enhance context caching in Context Management\nPlatforms (CMPs) by dynamically evaluating and managing context. DCMF comprises\ntwo core components: the Context Evaluation Engine (CEE) and the Context\nManagement Module (CMM). The CEE calculates the Probability of Access (PoA)\nusing parameters such as Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Context (QoC),\nCost of Context (CoC), timeliness, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs),\nassigning weights to assess access likelihood. Based on this, the CMM applies a\nhybrid Dempster-Shafer approach to manage Context Freshness (CF), updating\nbelief levels and confidence scores to determine whether to cache, evict, or\nrefresh context items. We implemented DCMF in a Context-as-a-Service (CoaaS)\nplatform and evaluated it using real-world smart city data, particularly\ntraffic and roadwork scenarios. Results show DCMF achieves a 12.5% higher cache\nhit rate and reduces cache expiry by up to 60% compared to the m-CAC technique,\nensuring timely delivery of relevant context and reduced latency.

Specifically, the federated adapter stirs\nuniversal knowledge in off-the-shelf medical foundation models to stabilize the\nfederated training process. In addition, we develop two client-tailored\nfederated updating strategies that adaptively decompose the adapter into common\nand individual components, then globally and independently update the parameter\ngroups associated with common client-invariant and individual client-specific\nunits, respectively. They further stabilize the heterogeneous federated\nlearning process and realize optimal client-tailored instead of sub-optimal\nglobal-compromised segmentation models.

To address this issue, this\npaper investigates the power allocation (PA) design for an OFDM-based ISAC\nsystem under random signaling, aiming to reduce the ranging sidelobe level of\nboth periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF) of the\nISAC signal.

These\nresults indicate that the disk warp is potentially driven by secular processes\nlike disk perturbations from intergalactic magnetic fields and a misaligned\ndark halo.

This paper introduces Sky-Drive, a novel\ndistributed multi-agent simulation platform that addresses these limitations\nthrough four key innovations: (a) a distributed architecture for synchronized\nsimulation across multiple terminals; (b) a multi-modal human-in-the-loop\nframework integrating diverse sensors to collect rich behavioral data; (c) a\nhuman-AI collaboration mechanism supporting continuous and adaptive knowledge\nexchange; and (d) a digital twin framework for constructing high-fidelity\nvirtual replicas of real-world transportation environments. Sky-Drive supports\ndiverse applications such as autonomous vehicle-human road users interaction\nmodeling, human-in-the-loop training, socially-aware reinforcement learning,\npersonalized driving development, and customized scenario generation. Future\nextensions will incorporate foundation models for context-aware decision\nsupport and hardware-in-the-loop testing for real-world validation.

As a consequence, total sum of all\npossible exchange coefficients in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ are larger than\nFe$_3$GeTe$_2$, which accounts for higher $T_C$. To validate these findings,\n$T_C$ are computed using both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulation.\nIndeed, higher-order exchange interactions, when properly accounting for the\nnumber of neighbors, confirm the higher $T_C$ of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$.",

    "abstract": "Traditional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, such as IDHEAS-ECA,\nrely on expert judgment and empirical rules that often overlook the cognitive\nunderpinnings of human error. Moreover, conducting human-in-the-loop\nexperiments for advanced nuclear power plants is increasingly impractical due\nto novel interfaces and limited operational data. This study proposes a\ncognitive-mechanistic framework (COGMIF) that enhances the IDHEAS-ECA\nmethodology by integrating an ACT-R-based human digital twin (HDT) with\nTimeGAN-augmented simulation. The ACT-R model simulates operator cognition,\nincluding memory retrieval, goal-directed procedural reasoning, and\nperceptual-motor execution, under high-fidelity scenarios derived from a\nhigh-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) simulator. To overcome the resource\nconstraints of large-scale cognitive modeling, TimeGAN is trained on\nACT-R-generated time-series data to produce high-fidelity synthetic operator\nbehavior datasets. These simulations are then used to drive IDHEAS-ECA\nassessments, enabling scalable, mechanism-informed estimation of human error\nprobabilities (HEPs). Comparative analyses with SPAR-H and sensitivity\nassessments demonstrate the robustness and practical advantages of the proposed\nCOGMIF. Finally, procedural features are mapped onto a Bayesian network to\nquantify the influence of contributing factors, revealing key drivers of\noperational risk. This work offers a credible and computationally efficient\npathway to integrate cognitive theory into industrial HRA practices.",

This approach, referred to as HOSVD-SR 1, integrates modal\ndecomposition techniques with Machine Learning (ML), creating a hybrid model\ngrounded in the underlying physics of the studied phenomena and capable of\nenhancing data dimensionality. The proposed methodology leverages HOSVD, a\nrobust variant of SVD, ideal for high dimensional data, which extracts the\nsingular values and modes (spatial and temporal) associated with each dimension\nof the database in tensor form, reducing noise and addressing challenges\nrelated to turbulent flows. HOSVD is employed to capture the key physical\npatterns from a under-resolved fluid mechanics database. Each spatial mode\nmatrix serves as input for a decoder/autoencoder type neural network trained to\nincrease the dimensionality of the tensor and accurately reconstruct\nexperimental and CFD-like databases. The HOSVD-SR methodology has been tested\non both two- and three-dimensional numerical databases of flow past a circular\ncylinder, as well as an experimental database of circular cylinder wake flows\nunder a turbulent flow regime. HOSVD-SR has successfully addressed both laminar\nand turbulent cases, outperforming a previously proposed SVD-based methodology\nin terms of accuracy.

Our rationales are generated by a language\nmodel to explicitly reason about a user's behavior on the basis of their\nexperiences, personality traits, or beliefs. Our method employs psychological\nscaffolds: structured frameworks such as the Big 5 Personality Traits or Primal\nWorld Beliefs to help ground the generated rationales in existing theories.\nExperiments on public opinion and movie preference prediction tasks demonstrate\nthat language model personas augmented with PB&J rationales consistently\noutperform personas conditioned only on user demographics and / or judgments,\nincluding those that use a model's default chain-of-thought, which is not\ngrounded in psychological theories.

Due to the high cost of annotating CIR triplet datasets,\nzero-shot (ZS) CIR has gained traction as a promising alternative. Existing\nstudies mainly focus on projection-based methods, which map an image to a\nsingle pseudo-word token. However, these methods face three critical\nchallenges: (1) insufficient pseudo-word token representation capacity, (2)\ndiscrepancies between training and inference phases, and (3) reliance on\nlarge-scale synthetic data. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage\nframework where the training is accomplished from mapping to composing. In the\nfirst stage, we enhance image-to-pseudo-word token learning by introducing a\nvisual semantic injection module and a soft text alignment objective, enabling\nthe token to capture richer and fine-grained image information. In the second\nstage, we optimize the text encoder using a small amount of synthetic triplet\ndata, enabling it to effectively extract compositional semantics by combining\npseudo-word tokens with modification text for accurate target image retrieval.\nThe strong visual-to-pseudo mapping established in the first stage provides a\nsolid foundation for the second stage, making our approach compatible with both\nhigh- and low-quality synthetic data, and capable of achieving significant\nperformance gains with only a small amount of synthetic data.
