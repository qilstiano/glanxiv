However, in the field of recommendation\nsystems, due to the structural differences between user behavior data and\nnatural language, LLMs struggle to effectively model the associations between\nuser preferences and items. Although prompt-based methods can generate\nrecommendation results, their inadequate understanding of recommendation tasks\nleads to constrained performance. To address this gap, in this work, we\nconstruct a sufficient instruction tuning dataset, ITDR, which encompasses 7\nsubtasks across two core root tasks--user-item interaction and user-item\nunderstanding. The dataset integrates data from 13 public recommendation\ndatasets and is built using manually crafted standardized templates, comprising\napproximately 200,000 instances. Experimental results demonstrate that ITDR\nsignificantly enhances the performance of mainstream open-source LLMs such as\nGLM-4, Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Instruct and LLaMA-3.2 on recommendation tasks.\nFurthermore, we analyze the correlations between tasks and explore the impact\nof task descriptions and data scale on instruction tuning effectiveness.\nFinally, we perform comparative experiments against closed-source LLMs with\nsubstantial parameters.

    "abstract": "The spotted lanternfly is rapidly establishing itself as a major insect pest\nwith global implications. Despite significant management efforts, its spread\ncontinues in invaded regions, and refined management strategies are required. A\nrecent study introduced a model that generalized the results of empirical\ncontrol efficacy studies by incorporating population dynamics and incomplete\ndelivery. In particular, a generalized population growth formula was derived,\nproviding the minimum proportion of a population that must be treated with a\ngiven control to induce population decline. However, this model could not\naddress the more relevant question of how best to deploy a control to minimize\npopulation growth. Here, we extend this model and formula to address this\nquestion in various settings. When the effect of control is proportional to\neffort, we show that exhaustive sequential deployment of stage-specific\ncontrols, ordered by efficacy, is optimal. When control effects exhibit\ndiminishing returns with effort, we derive a formula for when to switch\ncontrols, providing an effective strategy in situations where management\nresources may vary or be cut at any time. We also use numerical global\noptimization methods to obtain strategies when resources are fixed a priori.\nBoth strategies outperform random deployment, which can result in disastrous\noutcomes. Our results demonstrate that adopting an effective strategy for\ndeploying stage-specific controls is essential for managing the spotted\nlanternfly. However, we found no papers addressing this topic in the lanternfly\nliterature, nor information on whether such strategies are used. Given the\nlimited resources available to combat the lanternfly, it is critical that they\nare used effectively. The approach introduced here, along with other\noptimization methods used in related fields, can contribute to this goal.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we answer a question posed in 1998 by Contreras, Iturriaga,\nPaternain, and Paternain, now known as the contact type conjecture. For a broad\nclass of magnetic systems, we explicitly construct, on any closed manifold, an\ninfinite-dimensional space of exact magnetic systems, which we refer to as\nmagnetic systems of strong geodesic type. For each such system, there exists at\nleast one null-homologous embedded periodic orbit on every energy level, with\nnegative action for energies below the strict Ma\\~n\\'e critical value. As a\nconsequence, the corresponding energy surfaces are not of contact type below\nthis threshold. Thus, for this class of systems, the contact type conjecture\nholds true. Moreover, for these systems, both the strict and the lowest\nMa\\~n\\'e critical values can be computed explicitly, and they coincide whenever\nthe aforementioned periodic magnetic geodesic is contractible, without\nrequiring any additional assumptions on the manifold. Several remarkable\nmultiplicity results also hold, guaranteeing arbitrarily large numbers of\nembedded null-homologous periodic magnetic geodesics on every energy level. We\nillustrate the richness of this class through two types of examples. First, on\nany non-aspherical manifold, there exists a dense subset of the space of\nRiemannian metrics such that, for each such metric, one can construct an\ninfinite-dimensional space of exact magnetic fields yielding magnetic systems\nof strong geodesic type. Second, on any closed contact manifold for which the\nstrong Weinstein conjecture holds, one can construct an infinite-dimensional\nspace of Riemannian metrics such that, for each such metric, the magnetic\nsystem induced by the fixed contact form is of strong geodesic type.",

These activation loops\nare abstracted into cell posets, enabling a compact and causally ordered\nrepresentation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory\ntraces. We introduce the delta-homology analogy, which formalizes memory as a\nset of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A Dirac delta-like memory\ntrace is identified with a nontrivial homology generator on a latent manifold\nof cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible\ntopological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete\na full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be\nsynthesized from local features alone. We interpret these delta-homology\ngenerators as the low-entropy content variable, while the high-entropy context\nvariable is represented dually as a filtration, cohomology class, or sheaf over\nthe same latent space. Inference is recast as a dynamic alignment between\ncontent and context and coherent memory retrieval corresponds to the existence\nof a global section that selects and sustains a topological generator. Memory\nis no longer a static attractor or distributed code, but a cycle-completing,\nstructure-aware inference process.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become increasingly\nintegral to IoT-based environments, enabling realtime visual computing.\nHowever, the limited computational capacity of these devices has motivated the\nadoption of collaborative DNN inference, where the IoT device offloads part of\nthe inference-related computation to a remote server. Such offloading often\nrequires dynamic DNN partitioning information to be exchanged among the\nparticipants over an unsecured network or via relays/hops, leading to novel\nprivacy vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose AdVAR-DNN, an adversarial\nvariational autoencoder (VAE)-based misclassification attack, leveraging\nclassifiers to detect model information and a VAE to generate untraceable\nmanipulated samples, specifically designed to compromise the collaborative\ninference process. AdVAR-DNN attack uses the sensitive information exchange\nvulnerability of collaborative DNN inference and is black-box in nature in\nterms of having no prior knowledge about the DNN model and how it is\npartitioned. Our evaluation using the most popular object classification DNNs\non the CIFAR-100 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of AdVAR-DNN in terms\nof high attack success rate with little to no probability of detection.",

Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due\nto the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning\ntechniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed\nproblems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may\nyield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such\nscenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,\nwe introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which\nestimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes\nrather than a single-point prediction.

We propose a flexible and modular algorithmic framework for\naccelerating Benders decomposition by embedding multi-parametric programming\n(mp) surrogates for optimization subproblems. Our approach leverages the\nOptiGraph abstraction in Plasmo$.$jl to model and decompose graph-structured\nproblems. By solving the subproblems associated with the graph nodes once using\nmp, we can extract explicit piecewise affine mappings for primal and dual\nvariables which replace the expensive subproblem solves with efficient look-ups\nand function evaluations during the iterative Benders process. We formally show\nthe equivalence between classical Benders cuts and those derived from the mp\nsolution and implement this integration in the open-source PlasmoBenders$.$jl\nsoftware package. We apply it to a two-stage stochastic programming problem,\nwhich aims to make optimal capacity expansion decisions under uncertainty in\nproduct demand/prices and availability of raw materials. We evaluate single-cut\nand multi-cut variants of Benders and show that the mp surrogate approach\nachieves substantial speedups in subproblem solve time while preserving the\nconvergence guarantees of Benders.

    "abstract": "This study presents key enhancements in hydrodynamic modeling using the\nstrip-based Morison's equation approach to enable rapid simulations of Floating\nOffshore Wind Turbines (FOWT). The modeling framework employs the relative form\nof the Morison equation, incorporating nonlinear irregular wave kinematics,\nvertical wave stretching, and diffraction corrections based on MacCamy-Fuchs\n(MCF) theory for large-scale, non-slender structures. Wave kinematics are\niteratively applied at dynamically displaced structural nodes to accurately\ncapture fluid-structure interaction. Additionally, a discretization scheme is\nintroduced to improve hydrodynamic load distribution across large horizontal\nstructures of floaters. These enhancements are validated against experimental\ndata from the Floating Offshore Wind and Controls Advanced Laboratory (FOCAL),\nwhich conducted a 1:70 scale test of the IEA-Wind 15MW reference turbine on the\nVolturnUS-S platform. Results demonstrate that the incorporation of nonlinear\nwave kinematics significantly improves low-frequency response accuracy.\nFurthermore, the vertical wave stretching and MCF corrections lead to surge\nresponse predictions that closely align with experimental measurements, while\nthe improved load discretization significantly enhances heave and pitch\nresponse fidelity in wave-dominant frequency ranges.",

    "abstract": "Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is the youngest known core-collapse supernova remnant\n(SNR) in the Galaxy and is perhaps the best-studied SNR in X-rays. Cas A has a\nline-rich spectrum dominated by thermal emission and given its high flux, it is\nan appealing target for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. Cas A was observed\nat two different locations during the Performance Verification phase of the\nXRISM mission, one location in the southeastern part (SE) of the remnant and\none in the northwestern part (NW). This paper serves as an overview of these\nobservations and discusses some of the issues relevant for the analysis of the\ndata. We present maps of the so-called ``spatial-spectral mixing'' effect due\nto the fact that the XRISM point-spread function is larger than a pixel in the\nResolve calorimeter array. We analyze spectra from two bright, on-axis regions\nsuch that the effects of spatial-spectral mixing are minimized. We find that it\nis critical to include redshifts/blueshifts and broadening of the emission\nlines in the two thermal components to achieve a reasonable fit given the high\nspectral resolution of the Resolve calorimeter. We fit the spectra with two\nversions of the AtomDB atomic database (3.0.9 and 3.1.0) and two versions of\nthe SPEX (3.08.00 and 3.08.01*) spectral fitting software. Overall we find good\nagreement between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* for the spectral models\nconsidered in this paper. The most significant difference we found between\nAtomDB 3.0.9 and 3.1.0 and between AtomDB 3.1.0 and SPEX 3.08.01* is the Ni\nabundance, with the new atomic data favoring a considerably lower (up to a\nfactor of 3) Ni abundance. Both regions exhibit significantly enhanced\nabundances compared to Solar values indicating that supernova ejecta dominate\nthe emission in these regions. We find that the abundance ratios of Ti/Fe,\nMn/Fe, \\& Ni/Fe are significantly lower in the NW than the SE.",

We note that the tidal radius of\nthe LMC of this mass is 16.9 kpc, indicating that our measured mass\napproximates the current bound mass of the LMC. Previous measurements of the\nLMC mass based on fitting the observed path of the OCS through the Milky Way\n(MW) halo reported the total mass of the LMC. We show that because the closest\napproach of the LMC to the OCS, where the gravitational perturbation of the\nstream path is the highest, is about 20 kpc, the mass of the LMC outside of 30\nkpc is not constrained and depends entirely on the assumed radial profile at\nlarge radius. Our best-fit total mass varies between $4.5 \\times 10^{10}$ and\n$2.2 \\times 10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$ or more, depending on the presumed radial\nprofile of the LMC. We also show that previous measurements of the mass of the\nLMC that used a particle-spray method to simulate the path of the OCS suffered\nfrom systematic error because they assumed that all particles were stripped\nfrom the dwarf galaxy at the tidal radius; N-body simulations show that\nparticles are actually released from a range of distances from the center of\nmass of the OCS.

However, parameter estimation based\non this model is challenging due to its ill-posed nature, resulting in poor\nreproducibility, particularly at low signal to noise ratios (SNRs) in a clinic\nscenario. Purpose: This study analyzes the uncertainty of IVIM model fitting,\nquantifies parameter collinearity, and introduces a new index with enhanced\nrobustness to enhance clinical applicability of the IVIM model. Study Type:\nProspective. Population: One healthy volunteer. Field Strength/Sequence: 1.5T;\nsingle-shot EPI DWI. Assessment: The probability distributions of estimated\nIVIM parameters were evaluated across a clinically relevant range. Collinearity\namong parameters was assessed and a new metric, the R-index, was proposed.

    "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) ensures the safety and longevity of\nstructures such as aerospace equipment and wind power installations. Developing\na simple, highly flexible, and scalable SHM method that does not depend on\nbaseline models is significant for ensuring the operational integrity of\nadvanced composite structures. In this regard, a hybrid baseline-free damage\ndetection and localization framework incorporating an unsupervised\nKolmogorov-Arnold autoencoder (KAE) and modified probabilistic elliptical\nimaging algorithm (MRAPID) is proposed for damage detection and localization in\ncomposite structures. Specifically, KAE was used to process the guided wave\nsignals (GW) without any prior feature extraction process. The KAE continuously\nlearns and adapts to the baseline model of each structure, learning from the\nresponse characteristics of its undamaged state. Then, the predictions from KAE\nare processed, combined with the MRAPID to generate a damage probability map.\nThe performance of the proposed method for damage detection and localization\nwas verified using the simulated damage data obtained on wind turbine blades\nand the actual damage data obtained on composite flat plates. The results show\nthat the proposed method can effectively detect and localize damage and can\nachieve multiple damage localization. In addition, the method outperforms\nclassical damage detection algorithms and state-of-the-art baseline-free damage\ndetection and localization methods in terms of damage localization accuracy.",

We start from a\ncentralized market clearing that maximizes social welfare under consideration\nof generation costs, consumer utility and consumer carbon costs. We then derive\nan equivalent equilibrium formulation which incorporates a carbon allocation\nproblem and gives rise to a set of carbon-adjusted electricity prices for both\nconsumers and generators.

Further, we\nprove that this new paradigm satisfies the same desirable market properties as\nstandard electricity markets based on locational marginal prices, namely\nrevenue adequacy and individual rationality, and demonstrate that a carbon tax\non generators is equivalent to imposing a uniform carbon cost on consumers.\nUsing a simplified three-bus system and the RTS-GMLC system, we illustrate that\nconsumer-based carbon costs contribute to greener electricity market clearing\nboth through generation redispatch and reductions in demand.",

In the open world\nwhere data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification\n(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting\nunauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its\ndiversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely\nchallenging.

Experiments\nacross diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach\nsimultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly\noutperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and\neffectiveness, with moderate computational overhead.

However, existing mobile\nmodels-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical\ntasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and\nmedical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical\nimaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing\nlightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we\npropose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)\ntailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly\npurposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a\nparameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This\ndesign exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being\nlighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we\nintroduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively\nbalances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of\nmedical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer\nbottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with\ndownsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced\ncomputational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering\ndiverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen\ndatasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and\ngeneralization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/FengheTan9/Mobile-U-ViT.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving (AD) systems relying solely on onboard sensors may fail to\ndetect distant or obstacle hazards, potentially causing preventable collisions;\nhowever, existing transformer-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) approaches,\nwhich mitigate AD sensing limitations, either lack effective multimodal fusion\nand reasoning or struggle to meet real-time performance requirements under\ncomplex, high-dimensional traffic conditions. This paper proposes the Real-time\nEdge-based Autonomous Co-pilot Trajectory planner (REACT), a V2X-integrated\ntrajectory optimization framework for AD based on a fine-tuned lightweight\nVision-Language Model (VLM). REACT integrates infrastructure-provided hazard\nalerts with onboard sensor data, capturing intricate surrounding traffic\ndynamics and vehicle intents through visual embeddings, interpreting precise\nnumerical data from symbolic inputs, and employing contextual reasoning to\ngenerate optimized, safety-oriented trajectories. To ensure robust real-time\ndeployment on edge devices, REACT innovatively employs Residual Trajectory\nFusion (RTF) design and specialized edge-adaptation strategies to reduce model\ncomplexity and improve inference efficiency. Evaluated on the DeepAccident\nbenchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art performance, a 77% collision rate\nreduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality (VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference\nlatency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation studies validate the contribution of\neach input, module, and edge adaptation strategy. These results highlight the\neffectiveness of lightweight VLMs in enabling real-time cooperative planning on\nedge platforms and underscore the potential of language-guided contextual\nreasoning for improving traffic safety and responsiveness.",

First, we\nexperimentally investigate the wetting of a roughened glass surface by a\nviscous droplet of silicone oil, wide and shallow relative to the capillary\nlength $\\ell_c$. The radius of the droplet grows according to a\n$R_\\mathrm{drop}\\sim t^{1/8}$ scaling reminiscent of gravity currents (Lopez,\n1976; Voinov, 1999). The droplet is preceded by a mesoscopic fluid film that\npercolates through the rough substrate, its radius increasing according to\n$R_\\mathrm{film}\\sim t^{3/8}/(\\log t)^{1/2}$. To rationalize these observed\nscalings, we develop a new 'capillary current' model for the spreading of\nshallow droplets with arbitrary radius on both smooth and rough surfaces. We\npropose that, throughout their evolution, capillary currents maintain a\nquasi-equilibrium balance between hydrostatic and curvature pressure, perturbed\nonly by unbalanced contact line forces arising along the droplet's edge. In\naddition to rationalizing our experimental data, our model provides new\nrationale for a number of scalings reported in prior work. In particular, for\ndrops small with respect to $\\ell_c$, it recovers the classic spreading laws of\nTanner (1979) and Hoffman (1975); for drops wide with respect to $\\ell_c$, it\nreveals how millimetric, surface-tension-driven capillary currents exhibit the\nsame spreading behavior as relatively large-scale viscous gravity currents.",

By analogy with quantum\nsystems, these observables are linked by an uncertainty-like constraint:\nalgorithmic determinism ensures structural uniformity, while system-level\nfluctuations introduce irreducible unpredictability. We realize this framework\nconcretely as \\emph{QPP-RNG}, a system-embedded, software-based true random\nnumber generator (TRNG). In QPP-RNG, real-time measurements of sorting time $t$\n-- shaped by CPU pipeline jitter, cache latency, and OS scheduling --\ndynamically reseed the PRNG driving the permutation sequence. Crucially, QSQS\ntransforms initially right-skewed raw distributions of $n_p$ and $t$ into\nnearly uniform outputs after modulo reduction, thanks to internal degeneracies\nthat collapse many distinct states into the same output symbol. Empirical\nresults show that as the repetition factor $m$ increases, output entropy\nconverges toward theoretical maxima: Shannon and min-entropy values approach 8\nbits, chi-squared statistics stabilize near ideal uniformity, and bell curves\nvisually confirm the flattening from skewed to uniform distributions.

    "abstract": "In this work, $\\gamma^{(\\ast)}\\gamma^{(\\ast)}$ interactions in\nelectron-positron collisions are studied across both low- and high-energy\nregimes. The analysis includes contributions from the Vector Meson Dominance\n(VMD) model (via Reggeon exchange), the Quark Parton Model (via box diagrams),\nand the gluonic component (described using the dipole formalism), which becomes\ndominant at high energies. A key feature of the dipole picture is that a photon\ncan fluctuate into a quark-antiquark ($q\\bar{q}$) pair, forming a color dipole.\nThe dipole-dipole cross section is modeled using two different prescriptions.\nWe analyze the impact of these models on several key observables: the total\ncross section for real photons ($\\sigma^{\\gamma \\gamma}$), including heavy\nquark production $\\gamma\\gamma \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}X, b\\bar{b}X$; for virtual\nphotons ($\\sigma^{\\gamma^{\\ast}\\gamma^{\\ast}}$); and the photon structure\nfunction ($F_2^\\gamma$). Both prescriptions express the dipole-dipole\ninteraction in terms of the dipole-proton scattering amplitude, used in Deep\nInelastic Scattering (DIS). This amplitude is obtained by solving the\nBalitsky-Kovchegov (BK) non-linear evolution equation, incorporating running\ncoupling and various models that differ in their treatment of the transition\nbetween the dilute and saturation regimes. These approaches exhibit distinct\nbehaviors in photon-photon interactions at high energies: while one\nprescription describes the photon as a smaller and denser system, the other\ntreats it as a larger and more dilute configuration. Accordingly, they predict\ngreater and lesser hadron production in the final state, respectively, at the\nenergies of future colliders. These characteristics become more significant\nwith increasing photon virtuality.",

This, in turn, can be applied to systematically\nconstruct dynamic feedback linearizations of $\\mathcal{V}$; or to construct\npartial feedback linearizations, when no dynamic feedback linearization exists.\nBecause of these and related applications, this paper makes a detailed study of\nsymmetry reduction for control systems. We show that a key property involved in\nthe symmetry reduction of control systems is that of transversality of Lie\ngroup actions. Generalizing this notion, we provide an analysis of how the\ngeometry of an invariant distribution, and particularly a control system, is\naltered as a consequence of symmetry reduction. This provides important\ninformation toward understanding the unexpectedly frequent occurrence of SFL\nquotients. Specifically, we detail how the integrability properties and ranks\nof various canonical sub-bundles of the quotient object differ from those of\nthe given distribution. As a consequence we are able to classify the SFL\nquotients of $G$-invariant control systems $\\mathcal{V}$ based upon the\ngeometric properties of $\\mathcal{V}$ and the action $G$. Additionally, we\nprove that static feedback linearizability is preserved by symmetry reduction\nand the well-known Sluis-Gardner-Shadwick (S-G-S) test for the static feedback\nlinearization of control systems is extended to Goursat bundles. A generalized\nS-G-S test to identify if $\\mathcal{V}/G$ is a Goursat bundle is also given,\nbased on the Lie algebra of $G$. Finally, we apply all our results to the\nwell-known PVTOL control system and demonstrate that it may be viewed as an\ninvariant control system on a certain 9-dimensional Lie group.",

To construct time windows for a pre-determined route (e.g.,\nprovided by commercial routing software), we introduce two criteria that\nbalance window length and the risk of violation. The service provider can\nallocate different penalties reflecting risk tolerances to each criterion,\nresulting in various time windows with varying levels of service guarantee.\nDepending on the degree of information available about the travel time\ndistribution, we develop two modeling frameworks based on stochastic and\ndistributionally robust optimization. In each setting, we derive closed-form\nsolutions for the optimal time windows, which are functions of risk preferences\nand the sequence of visits. We further investigate fixed-width time windows,\nwhich standardize service intervals, and the use of a policy that allows\nvehicles arriving before the lower bounds to wait rather than incur a penalty.\nNext, we integrate service time window design with routing optimization into a\nunified framework that simultaneously determines optimal routing and time\nwindow allocations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our models on a rich\ncollection of instances from well-known datasets. While a small portion of the\ntime windows designed by the stochastic model was violated in out-of-sample\ntests, the distributionally robust model consistently delivered routes and time\nwindows within the service provider's risk tolerance. Our proposed frameworks\nare readily compatible with existing routing solutions, enabling service\nproviders to design time windows aligned with their risk preferences.

    "abstract": "We present a multi-epoch spectroscopic study of the broad absorption line\n(BAL) quasar J115636.82+085628.9 (z(em) = 2.1077), based on five spectra\nspanning nearly two decades in the observer's frame. This source exhibits\nremarkable variability in both low-ionization (LoBAL: Al III and Mg II) and\nhigh-ionization (HiBAL: C IV and Si IV) absorption features. For the first\ntime, we detect the emergence and subsequent disappearance of LoBAL troughs at\nhigh velocities (~20,000 kms$^{-1}$), coinciding with the strengthening and\nweakening of the corresponding HiBAL absorption. The C IV BAL profile extends\nfrom ~6,700 kms$^{-1}$ to a conservative upper limit of 30,000 kms$^{-1}$ and\nis composed of narrow, variable absorption features embedded within a broad,\nsmooth envelope. Both C IV and Si IV BAL troughs exhibit dramatic equivalent\nwidth (EW) changes, among the most extreme reported to date. Notably, these EW\nvariations are strongly anti-correlated with continuum flux changes inferred\nfrom optical photometric light curves. We interpret this variability as the\nresult of a new absorbing flow transiting into our line of sight, increasing\nthe shielding of a more distant, pre-existing outflow and giving rise to\ntransient LoBAL absorption. This scenario supports a unified picture in which\nLoBAL and HiBAL features arise from similar outflow structures, with observed\ndifferences governed primarily by line-of-sight column densities consistent\nwith previous findings.",

The combination of\ninfrared induced heating with optical readout at visible wavelengths provides\nexcellent spatial resolution while retaining the spectral observations of\nconventional infrared imaging. Most current implementations rely on\nlong-duration illumination periods, to ensure sufficient heating and hence\nlarge signals. However, undesirable processes such as heat-diffusion degrade\nspatial resolution and the interplay between heat-induced refractive index\nchanges and sample expansion adds additional uncertainties. Fundamentally,\nthese issues stem from the difficulties associated with separating\nnon-equilibrium and photoacoustic contributions from purely thermal signals.\nHighly time-resolved observations hold great promise for addressing these\nissues and are imperative for enabling future imaging modalities in this\nexciting temporal window. Here, we provide this much needed insight by\nemploying widefield phototransient holography to phase-resolve optical\nresponses from pico- to tens of nanoseconds following vibrational overtone\nexcitation. We observe rapid transient-induced phase shifts, followed by\nheat-induced coherent expansion and thermalisation dynamics.

    "abstract": "A central goal in the study of heavy-flavour production is to determine the\ninteraction strength between Heavy Quarks (HQs) and the Quark-Gluon Plasma\n(QGP), quantified by the spatial diffusion coefficient $D_s(T)$. Recent lattice\nQCD (lQCD) results with dynamical fermions suggest a remarkably low value of\n$2\\pi T D_s \\approx 1$ at $T=T_c$ for charm quarks - significantly lower than\nboth quenched QCD estimates and most phenomenological models - which typically\nyield $2\\pi T D_s \\approx 3.5 - 5$. This discrepancy raises the question of\nwhether such a small $D_s(T)$, corresponding to a thermalization time\n$\\tau_{th} \\approx 1 - 1.5$ fm/c, is compatible with experimental measurements\nof key observables like the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$, the elliptic\nand triangular flow coefficients $v_2$ and $v_3$ for D mesons. Using an\nevent-by-event Langevin transport framework, we analyze several scenarios and\nhighlight the pivotal role played by the momentum dependence of the drag\ncoefficient $A(p) = \\tau_{th}^{-1}(p)$. Our findings show that a small $2\\pi T\nD_s (p\\rightarrow 0)\\approx 1 - 2$ values can align with experimental data\n\\emph{only} if a significant momentum dependence in $\\tau_{th}(p)=1/A(p)$ is\nincluded, as predicted by T-matrix approaches, or by the extended\nQuasi-Particle Model (QPMp). In contrast, assuming a momentum-independent\n$\\tau_{th} = M_c D_s^{\\text{lQCD}} / T$, it fails to reproduce the observed\nphenomenology. Furthermore, a short thermalization time of $\\tau_{th} \\approx\n1.5$ fm/c implies a loss of sensitivity of the final-state observables to the\ninitial charm-quark momentum distribution up $p_T \\approx M_c$, suggesting a\npossible universal behavior driven by a dynamical attractor.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel fractional-order chemostat model (FOCM) for\noptimizing biological water treatment processes, incorporating memory effects\nthrough the use of Caputo fractional derivative with sliding memory (CFDS).\nTraditional integer-order models fail to capture the time-dependent behaviors\nand memory effects inherent in microbial systems. Our work addresses this\nlimitation by developing a fractional-order framework that represents microbial\ngrowth and substrate degradation dynamics more accurately. The primary\nobjective is to minimize the average pollutant concentration in treated water\nthrough optimal periodic control (OPC) of the dilution rate, subject to\nconstraints on treatment capacity and periodic boundary conditions. Key\ncontributions include: (1) reduction of the 2D fractional-order system to a\ncomputationally tractable 1D fractional differential equation while preserving\nessential dynamics; (2) rigorous proof of the existence and uniqueness of\noptimal periodic solutions using Schauder's fixed-point theorem and convexity\narguments; (3) derivation of bang-bang optimal control (OC) strategies by using\na fractional Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP); and (4) comprehensive\nnumerical simulations demonstrating significant performance improvements over\nsteady-state operation. Our results show that periodic fractional control can\nreduce average substrate concentrations by up to 40% compared to steady-state\noperation, with the fractional order {\\alpha}, the dynamic scaling parameter\n$\\vartheta$, and the sliding memory length L serving as critical factors that\ngovern memory effects, control responsiveness, and switching frequency.

    "abstract": "The evolutionary success of bacteria lies in their ability to form complex\nsurface-associated communities in diverse biophysical settings. However, it\nremains poorly understood how compliance of soft surfaces, measured in terms of\ntheir elastic deformability, impacts the dynamics and self-organization of\nbacterial cells proliferating into colonies. Using experiments and\nbiomechanical modelling, here we study the expansion and self-organization of\nbacterial cells into sessile colonies on soft substrates. The dynamics and\nspatiotemporal structures were captured by visualising growing bacterial\ncolonies on nutrient-rich, soft agarose pads, with elastic modulus in the range\n~0.3 kPA to ~100 kPA by varying the concentration of the agarose in the\nunderlying substrate. Our results show that, at the scale of the colonies,\nsignificant differences emerge in the spreading dynamics and colony geometry as\nthe substrate stiffness is altered: softer substrates promote distinct,\nmultilayered colony structures, and as revealed by fractal analysis of the\ncolony boundaries, they exhibit higher boundary roughness. In contrast,\ncolonies growing on harder substrates first grow up to large monolayers, before\nundergoing the mono-to-multilayer transition (MTMT), showing nearly 300%\nincrease in the overall colony area at MTMT. A simple biomechanical model\ncaptures the role of effective drag forces at different scales, acting on the\ncolonies as they spread on substrates with different stiffness: higher drag in\nsoft substrates drive early verticalisation of the colonies, while lower\neffective drag delays the MTMT, resulting in larger colony areas. Based on the\nresults and biomechanical insights, a comprehensive data-backed numerical model\nis currently being developed.

Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is\navailable, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating\nthe model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly\ndelayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate\nthe automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing\nsetups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution\nbetween the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or\nthe task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye\ntracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts\nsolving iris PAD visual task.",

    "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications have gained attention as a key\ntechnology for high-capacity wireless systems, owing to the wide available\nbandwidth. However, mmWave signals suffer from their inherent characteristics\nsuch as severe path loss, poor scattering, and limited diffraction, which\nnecessitate the use of large antenna arrays and directional beamforming,\ntypically implemented through massive MIMO architectures. Accurate channel\nestimation is critical in such systems, but its computational complexity\nincreases proportionally with the number of antennas. This may become a\nsignificant burden in mmWave systems where channels exhibit rapid fluctuations\nand require frequent updates. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity\nchannel denoiser based on Bayesian binary hypothesis testing and beamspace\nsparsity. By modeling each sparse beamspace component as a mixture of signal\nand noise under a Bernoulli-complex Gaussian prior, we formulate a likelihood\nratio test to detect signal-relevant elements. Then, a hard-thresholding rule\nis applied to suppress noise-dominant components in the noisy channel vector.\nDespite its extremely low computational complexity, the proposed method\nachieves channel estimation accuracy that is comparable to that of complex\niterative or learning-based approaches. This effectiveness is supported by both\ntheoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, suggesting that the method can\nbe a viable option for mmWave systems with strict resource constraints.",

During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement\nlearning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based\npenalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a\nreasonable range.

These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase\ncomputation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and\na decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This\nstructure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.\n  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by\ndeveloping a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM\ninference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and\ndynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.\nGuided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)\nscheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild\nconditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as\nserving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design\nthe SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements\nto prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and\nreorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the\nTime To First Token (TTFT) delays.\n  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model\non an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU.

We test a non-empirical\napproach to understanding and optimizing nuclear physics ANNs by adapting a\ncriticality analysis based on renormalization group flows in terms of the\nhyperparameters for weight/bias initialization, training rates, and the ratio\nof depth to width. This treatment utilizes the statistical properties of neural\nnetwork initialization to find a generating functional for network outputs at\nany layer, allowing for a path integral formulation of the ANN outputs as a\nEuclidean statistical field theory.

While lag-1\nautocorrelation gradually grows as the threshold is approached, PE shows a\nsteep decrease that captures the emergence of nonlinear correlations and thus,\nit allows a clearer identification of the threshold.",

Gas is preferentially transported from small\nto large bubbles, resulting in a gradual decrease of the number of bubbles and\nan increase in the average bubble size. Coarsening foams are expected to\napproach a scaling state at late times in which their statistical properties\nare invariant. Understanding of coarsening in foams with a moderate liquid\ncontent has been improved by recent experiments. However, a model predicting\nthe observed bubble-size distribution in the scaling state, as a function of\nthe liquid fraction $\\phi$, has not yet been developed. To this end, we propose\na three-dimensional mean-field bubble growth law for foams without inter-bubble\nadhesion, validated against bubble-scale simulations, and use it to derive a\nprediction of the scaling-state bubble-size distribution for any $\\phi$ from\nzero up to the unjamming transition $\\phi_\\text{c} \\approx 36\\%$. We verify\nthat the derived scaling state is approached from a variety of initial\nconditions using mean-field simulations implementing the proposed growth law.\nComparing our predicted bubble-size distribution with previous simulations and\nexperimental results, we likewise find a large population of small bubbles when\n$\\phi > 0$, but there are qualitative differences from prior results which we\nattribute to the absence of rattlers, i.e. bubbles not pressed into contact\nwith their neighbours, in our model.",

A popular explanation is the\ntwo-infall scenario, which postulates that two periods of substantial accretion\nrates dominate the assembly history of the Galaxy. Thanks to recent advances in\nstellar age measurements, we can now compare this model to more direct\nmeasurements of the Galaxy's evolutionary timescales across the disk.

First, our models generically predict a\nmassive and long-lasting dilution event, but the data show that stellar\nmetallicity is remarkably constant across much of the lifetime of the disk.\nThis apparent age-independence places considerable restrictions upon the\ntwo-infall parameter space. Second, most local metal-rich stars in APOGEE have\nintermediate ages, yet our models predict these stars should either be very old\nor very young. Some of these issues can be mitigated, but not completely\nresolved, by pre-enriching the accreted gas to low metallicity.

    "abstract": "Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating\nquantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical\nhardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one\ncan ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of\nHaar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove\nthe hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed\nstates, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen\net al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states\nthat a $o(\\sqrt{M})\\times o(\\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\\times M$ circular\northogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex\nGaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\\to\\infty$. This is the first\nrigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant\nregime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a\nmaximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the\nconventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143\n(2013)].",

The\n$Z_\\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion model reduces the QCD axion mass naturally, by\ninvoking a discrete $Z_\\mathcal{N}$ symmetry through which the axion field is\ncoupled to $\\mathcal{N}$ copies of the Standard Model. Before the QCD phase\ntransition at temperature $T_{\\rm QCD}$, the $Z_\\mathcal{N}$ potential has a\nminimum at misalignment angle $\\theta=\\pi$. At $T_{\\rm QCD}$, $\\theta =\\pi$\nbecomes a maximum; the axion potential becomes exponentially suppressed and\ndevelops $\\mathcal{N}$ minima -- only one of which actually solves the strong\nCP problem. Before $T_{\\rm QCD}$, $\\theta$ relaxes towards $\\pi$. After $T_{\\rm\nQCD}$, the axion field starts from around the hilltop and may have sufficient\nkinetic energy to overcome the newly suppressed potential barriers. Such a\nfield evolution leads to nonlinear effects via the self-interactions near the\nhilltop, which can cause the exponential growth of fluctuations and\nbackreaction on the coherent motion. This behavior can influence the relic\ndensity of the field and the minimum in which it settles. We conduct the first\nlattice simulations of the $Z_{\\mathcal{N}}$ QCD axion using ${\\mathcal\nC}$osmo${\\mathcal L}$attice to accurately calculate dark matter abundances and\nfind nonlinear dynamics reduce the abundance by up to a factor of two.

The origin of these features is yet unclear because\ntheir peculiar properties are a challenge for our current understanding of\nastrophysical sources for diffuse radio emission. In this work we test the\nfeasibility of major mergers in galaxy groups as a possible formation channel\nfor ORCs. By modeling the assembly of a massive galaxy group with a final\nvirial mass of $M_{200}\\sim 10^{13}\\, \\rm M_\\odot$ in a magnetohydrodynamic\nzoom-in simulation with on-the-fly cosmic ray treatment, we are able to derive\nthe X-ray and radio properties of the system self-consistently and compare them\nto observations. We show that the X-ray properties for the simulated system are\nagreeing with characteristics of observed galaxy groups in the regarded mass\nrange, legitimating the comparison between the radio properties of the\nsimulated halo and those of observed ORCs. A major merger between two galaxies\nin the simulation is triggering a series of strong shocks in the circumgalactic\nmedium, which in unison are forming a ring if the line of sight is\nperpendicular to the merger axis. The shock is rapidly expanding in radial\ndirection and quickly reaches the virial radius of the halo. This formation\nchannel can hence readily explain the morphology and large extent of ORCs.\nHowever, the inferred radio luminosity of these features is lower than for\nobserved counterparts, while the degree of polarization seems to be\nsystematically overpredicted by the simulation. Fossil cosmic ray populations\nfrom AGN and stellar feedback might be necessary to explain the full extent of\nthe radio properties of ORCs, since diffusive shock acceleration was the only\nsource term for non-thermal electrons considered in this work.",

Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental\nconfigurations.

We demonstrate that the\nchiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic\nquadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for\nboth types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to\nenhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal,\nbut does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt\nin the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a\nmagnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into\nweak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial\ndirectional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external\nmagnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing\nthe experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be\ntuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful\nalternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering\nefficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the\npractical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural\nconstraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static\nlength allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths\ncripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant\ncomputational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length\nconstraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap\nwith their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient\nand capable generation.",

Typically, proportionality is captured\nby variants of the Justified Representation axiom, which say that cohesive\ngroups of at least $\\ell\\cdot\\frac{n}{k}$ voters (where $n$ is the total number\nof voters and $k$ is the desired number of winners) deserve $\\ell$\nrepresentatives. The quantity $\\frac{n}{k}$ is known as the Hare quota in the\nsocial choice literature. Another -- more demanding -- choice of quota is the\nDroop quota, defined as $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{k+1}\\rfloor+1$. This quota is often\nused in multiwinner voting with ranked ballots: in algorithms such as Single\nTransferable Voting, and in proportionality axioms, such as Droop's\nProportionality Criterion. A few authors have considered it in the context of\napproval ballots, but the existing analysis is far from comprehensive. The\ncontribution of our work is a systematic study of JR-style axioms (and voting\nrules that satisfy them) defined using the Droop quota instead of the Hare\nquota. For each of the standard JR axioms (namely, JR, PJR, EJR, FPJR, FJR,\nPJR+ and EJR+), we identify a voting rule that satisfies the Droop version of\nthis axiom. In some cases, it suffices to consider known rules (modifying the\ncorresponding Hare proof, sometimes quite substantially), and in other cases it\nis necessary to modify the rules from prior work. Each axiom is more difficult\nto satisfy when defined using the Droop quota, so our results expand the\nfrontier of satisfiable proportionality axioms. We complement our theoretical\nresults with an experimental study, showing that for many probabilistic models\nof voter approvals, Droop JR/EJR+ are considerably more demanding than standard\n(Hare) JR/EJR+.",

The combination of\nuniform soliton interactions and the compatibility of our Ising machine with\nhigh-speed data interconnects enables rapid and precise solutions of complex\nSAT problems. Indeed, the soliton properties bound the tradeoff of optical\npower and time use by the machine at approximately 10 mW and 1 $\\mu$s for a\nsingle feedback step.

The comet exhibits increasing\ndust activity and reddening colors during the observation period, with no\nvisible tail detected, likely due to viewing geometry and low dust production.\nDust mass loss rates are estimated between 0.3 and 4.2 kg s^-1, consistent with\nweakly active distant comets. Spectral colors are similar to those of outer\nSolar System comets and differ from previously reported values for 3I/ATLAS.\nThe morphological and photometric properties of 3I/ATLAS are consistent with a\nweakly active comet of outer Solar System origin, despite its interstellar\nprovenance. Continued monitoring around perihelion is necessary to track\nchanges in activity, color, which will provide insights into the evolution of\ninterstellar materials under solar radiation.",

To alleviate memory pressure, activation recomputation and data\ncompression have been proposed as two major strategies. However, both\napproaches have limitations: recomputation introduces significant training\noverhead, while compression can lead to accuracy degradation and computational\ninefficiency when applied naively. In this paper, we propose Adacc, the first\nadaptive memory optimization framework that unifies activation recomputation\nand data compression to improve training efficiency for LLMs while preserving\nmodel accuracy. Unlike existing methods that apply static, rule-based\nstrategies or rely solely on one technique, Adacc makes fine-grained,\ntensor-level decisions, dynamically selecting between recomputation, retention,\nand compression based on tensor characteristics and runtime hardware\nconstraints.\n  Adacc tackles three key challenges: (1) it introduces layer-specific\ncompression algorithms that mitigate accuracy loss by accounting for outliers\nin LLM activations; (2) it employs a MILP-based scheduling policy to globally\noptimize memory strategies across layers; and (3) it integrates an adaptive\npolicy evolution mechanism to update strategies during training in response to\nchanging data distributions. Experimental results show that Adacc improves\ntraining throughput by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to state-of-the-art frameworks,\nwhile maintaining accuracy comparable to the baseline.",

Recent studies show that the electrical conductivity of\nliquid with a bulk silicate Earth composition exceeds 10000 S/m at basal magma\nocean conditions, potentially surprising the threshold for dynamo activity.\nOver most of its history however, the basal magma ocean is more enriched in\niron than the bulk silicate Earth, due to iron's incompatibility in the mineral\nassemblages of the lower mantle. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics\ncalculations, we examine how iron content affects the silicate dynamo\nhypothesis. We investigate how the electrical conductivity of silicate liquid\nchanges with iron enrichment, at pressures and temperatures relevant for\nEarth's basal magma ocean. We also compute the electronic contribution to the\nthermal conductivity , to evaluate convective instability of basal magma\noceans.

Distinct failure behaviors emerge under subaerial and subaqueous\nconditions due to the coupled effects of mechanical deformation, interparticle\nfriction, and fluid interactions. This study employs three-dimensional coupled\nComputational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) simulations to\ninvestigate the collapse and runout dynamics of dense and loose granular\nassemblies across these settings. Parametric analyses reveal that pore pressure\nevolution plays a central role in governing failure mechanisms: dense\nassemblies stabilize through dilation, while loose assemblies undergo rapid\ncompaction and fluidization, particularly under subaqueous conditions.\nSpatiotemporal analyses of coarse-grained fields further highlight\nstrain-rate-dependent behavior driven by evolving porosity and effective\nstress. Both environments exhibit rate-strengthening behavior that scales with\nthe inertial number (In) and viscous number (Iv), though driven by distinct\nmechanisms: subaerial systems are dominated by interparticle contact networks,\nwhereas subaqueous systems are influenced by fluid drag, pore-pressure buildup,\nand lubrication. An analytical solution for excess pore pressure is compared\nwith breaching-induced pressure distributions from CFD-DEM simulations, using\ninput parameters derived from numerical triaxial DEM tests. The model captures\nfluid-particle coupling effectively, reproducing comparable excess pore\npressures at steady state, while early-time discrepancies underscore the\ncomplexities of transient interactions. These findings advance the\nunderstanding of failure mechanics in saturated granular media and support the\ndevelopment of physics-based models for mitigating hazards associated with\nsubaqueous granular flows.",

However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring\nsemantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the\naudio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and\nspatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the\nsemantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded\nspatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful\ninformation can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators\nderived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or\nfrequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the\nfirst framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to\ngenerate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes\nthe generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We\nmeticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing\nspatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts\n(VSLs).

As a result, rod-like bacteria including E.\ncoli can elongate many times their original length without increasing their\nwidth. The swimming behavior of these filamentous bacteria through small\nchannels may provide insights into how antibiotic-resistant bacteria swim to\nchannel walls. Such swimming behaviors in settings like hospital tubing may\nfacilitate adhesion, biofilm formation and infection. Despite the importance of\nunderstanding the behavior of bacteria not killed by antibiotics, the swimming\nof filamentous bacteria in external flows has not received much attention. We\nstudy the swimming of stressed, filamentous E. coli. In quiescence, highly\nelongated E. coli swim with a sinusoidal undulation, suggesting rigid body\nrotation of the long, slightly segmented cell bodies. In low Reynolds number\npressure-driven flows through a microchannel, undulation becomes irregular and\nmay stop and start within a particular bacteria trajectory. We refer to this\nbehavior in flow as `wiggling.' Rigid body rotation persists in flow, appearing\nas a high frequency change in body orientation on top of a slower frequency of\nreorientation. Chiral reorientation can explain the slower reorientation. We\nquantify swimming in two flow rates and observe both rheotaxis and preferential\norientation of bacteria bodies. We find that the faster flow constrains\nwiggling bacteria trajectories and orientations more than slower flow does.\nInterestingly, not all bacteria in flow wiggle. Populations of `non-wiggling'\nfilamentous E. coli follow streamlines, without preferential orientation,\nflowing faster than wigglers. Non-wigglers do not behave like chiral rods\npropelled by flagellar bundles, but like rigid rods. Differentiating these\npopulations may have important implications for understanding motility loss.",

PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation,\nand exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion.\nLyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling,\nshifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with\nsignificant baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{b\\chi} \\gtrsim 0.8\n\\sigma_{b\\chi}$, where $\\sigma_{b\\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming\nvelocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally\nunstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH's wake.

    "abstract": "Evaluation plays a crucial role in the development of ranking algorithms on\nsearch and recommender systems. It enables online platforms to create\nuser-friendly features that drive commercial success in a steady and effective\nmanner. The online environment is particularly conducive to applying causal\ninference techniques, such as randomized controlled experiments (known as A/B\ntest), which are often more challenging to implement in fields like medicine\nand public policy. However, businesses face unique challenges when it comes to\neffective A/B test. Specifically, achieving sufficient statistical power for\nconversion-based metrics can be time-consuming, especially for significant\npurchases like booking accommodations. While offline evaluations are quicker\nand more cost-effective, they often lack accuracy and are inadequate for\nselecting candidates for A/B test. To address these challenges, we developed\ninterleaving and counterfactual evaluation methods to facilitate rapid online\nassessments for identifying the most promising candidates for A/B tests. Our\napproach not only increased the sensitivity of experiments by a factor of up to\n100 (depending on the approach and metrics) compared to traditional A/B testing\nbut also streamlined the experimental process. The practical insights gained\nfrom usage in production can also benefit organizations with similar interests.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic\nsuper-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and\nper-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing\napplications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This\npaper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first\nSR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,\nsegmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo\ndropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results\n(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This\nnovel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide\nfield-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The\nmodular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or\npost-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression\nand sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its\nperformance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone\nbased datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance\nevaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial\nMaritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training\ndata, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.",

In this paper, we explore the\nchallenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our main\nquestion is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as\nreliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's\nvisual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we\nintroduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a\nstate-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and\nimpostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable\nspatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal\nattention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial\ngestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable\nmeaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%.

DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%\nreduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%\ndrop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set.

Here we propose an agentic RAG\nframework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,\niteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia.org, and\ndynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 25 LLMs spanning\ndiverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms\n(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104\nexpert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and\nExtendedQA datasets.

The greatest gains occurred in\nsmall-scale models, while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated\nminimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced\nhallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of\ncases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned\nmodels showed gains from agentic retrieval (e.g., MedGemma-27B), indicating\nthat retrieval remains beneficial despite embedded domain knowledge.

However, because of their exponential scaling, grid-based methods\nsuffer from computational limitations. In addition, stochastic latent variables\nin the model can make the computation of the likelihood function intractable.\nThese limitations can be overcome by modern generative deep learning methods\nthat offer flexible and powerful tools for modeling high-dimensional posterior\ndistributions and fast inference from learned data. We present a normalizing\nflow approach for the inference of cluster age, mass, and reddening from Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) broadband photometry. In particular, we explore our\nnetwork's behavior on an inference problem that has been analyzed in previous\nworks. We used the SED modeling code CIGALE to create a dataset of synthetic\nphotometric observations for $5 \\times 10^6$ mock star clusters. Subsequently,\nthis data set was used to train a coupling-based flow in the form of a\nconditional invertible neural network (cINN) to predict posterior probability\ndistributions for cluster age, mass, and reddening from photometric\nobservations. We predicted cluster parameters for the 'Physics at High Angular\nresolution in Nearby GalaxieS' (PHANGS) Data Release 3 catalog. To evaluate the\ncapabilities of the network, we compared our results to the publicly available\nPHANGS estimates and found that the estimates agree reasonably well. We\ndemonstrate that normalizing flow methods can be a viable tool for the\ninference of cluster parameters, and argue that this approach is especially\nuseful when latent variables make the computation of the likelihood intractable\nand in scenarios that require efficient density estimation.",

These mechanisms permit complete or partial overlaps with different\ndata on the overlapping portions. IPv4, IPv6, and TCP reassembly policies,\ni.e., the data chunk preferences that depend on the overlap types, differ\nacross protocol implementations. This leads to vulnerabilities, as NIDSes may\ninterpret the packet differently from the monitored host OSes. Some NIDSes,\nsuch as Suricata or Snort, can be configured so that their policies are\nconsistent with the monitored OSes. The first contribution of the paper is\nPYROLYSE, an audit tool that exhaustively tests and describes the reassembly\npolicies of various IP and TCP implementation types. This tool ensures that\nimplementations reassemble overlapping chunk sequences without errors. The\nsecond contribution is the analysis of PYROLYSE artifacts. We first show that\nthe reassembly policies are much more diverse than previously thought. Indeed,\nby testing all the overlap possibilities for n <= 3 test case chunks and\ndifferent testing scenarios, we observe from 14 to 20 different behaviors out\nof 23 tested implementations depending on the protocol. Second, we report eight\nerrors impacting one OS, two NIDSes, and two embedded stacks, which can lead to\nsecurity issues such as NIDS pattern-matching bypass or DoS attacks. A CVE was\nassigned to a NIDS error. Finally, we show that implemented IP and TCP policies\nobtained through chunk pair testing are usually inconsistent with the observed\ntriplet reassemblies. Therefore, contrarily to what they currently do, NIDSes\nor other network traffic analysis tools should not apply n = 2 pair policies\nwhen the number of overlapping chunks exceeds two.",

    "abstract": "Existing variance reduction techniques used in stochastic simulations for\nrare event analysis still require a substantial number of model evaluations to\nestimate small failure probabilities. In the context of complex, nonlinear\nfinite element modeling environments, this can become computationally\nchallenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To\naddress this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with\nadaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating\nuncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a\nhigh-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a\ndeep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly\ncorrelated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to\nbalance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand\nassociated with the development of the low-fidelity model. By integrating the\nlow-fidelity outputs with additional high-fidelity results, an unbiased\nestimate of the strata-wise failure probabilities is obtained using a\nmulti-fidelity Monte Carlo framework. The overall probability of failure is\nthen computed using the total probability theorem. Application to a full-scale\nhigh-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation demonstrates\nthat the proposed scheme can accurately estimate exceedance probability curves\nfor nonlinear responses of interest, while achieving significant computational\nsavings compared to single-fidelity variance reduction approaches.",

    "abstract": "Growing excitement around deploying AI across various domains calls for a\ncareful assessment of how human decision-makers interact with AI-powered\nsystems. In particular, it is essential to understand when decision-makers\nvoluntarily choose to consult AI tools, which we term decision-maker adoption.\nWe interviewed experts across four domains -- medicine, law, journalism, and\nthe public sector -- to explore current AI use cases and perceptions of\nadoption. From these interviews, we identify key factors that shape\ndecision-maker adoption of AI tools: the decision-maker's background,\nperceptions of the AI, consequences for the decision-maker, and perceived\nimplications for other stakeholders. We translate these factors into an AI\nadoption sheet to analyze how decision-makers approach adoption choices through\ncomparative, cross-domain case studies, highlighting how our factors help\nexplain inter-domain differences in adoption. Our findings offer practical\nguidance for supporting the responsible and context-aware deployment of AI by\nbetter accounting for the decision-maker's perspective.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language\nqueries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging\ntheir relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent\nKGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on\nGNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation\nstrategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly\nperform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive\nMCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search\nwith adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR\nemploys a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based\nplanner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search\nspace. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight\nTransformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by\njointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,\nenabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop\nreasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,\nDAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically\ngenerates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing\nthe scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning\ntrajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled\nsource graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant\nrepresentations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property\nprediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely\non the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world\nscenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely\nimpairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain\nshifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label\nRefinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain\nadaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e.,\nsemantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the\nfeature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge\ndomain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch\nselects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,\nenabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels\nmay still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to\nthe noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware\nregularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to\nmitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of\nsource overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains\nof up to 12.7% in accuracy.",

Aims:\nThis study compares the internal quality attributes of LLM-generated and\nhuman-written code. Method: Our empirical study integrates datasets of coding\ntasks, three LLM configurations (zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning), and\nSonarQube to assess software quality. The dataset comprises Python code\nsolutions across three difficulty levels: introductory, interview, and\ncompetition. We analyzed key code quality metrics, including maintainability\nand reliability, and the estimated effort required to resolve code issues.\nResults: Our analysis shows that LLM-generated code has fewer bugs and requires\nless effort to fix them overall. Interestingly, fine-tuned models reduced the\nprevalence of high-severity issues, such as blocker and critical bugs, and\nshifted them to lower-severity categories, but decreased the model's\nperformance.

We find that this simple model is able to reproduce the\ngeneral qualitative features of the evolution of the magnetic field spectrum as\nseen from magnetized cosmological simulations.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate how the entropy of a neuron cell\ncan be measured using membrane ion current signals, which were recorded from\nneurons in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The sample entropy and\nthe Scalogram entropy were used as entropy measurement methods. It is well\nknown that the entropy increases in the direction of the movement of the system\ntowards the equilibrium. Therefore, in the process of the electrical activity\nof a living cell, the entropy is expected to reach a maximum at the moment when\nthe membrane potential reaches the 'Nernst equilibrium potential' (or ionic\nequilibrium) of the ions. However, it was observed that the entropy values\nobtained by traditional calculations did not reach the peak at the equilibrium\nstate of the ions. Therefore, two modifications to these measurement methods\nwere proposed to adjust the entropy value to the maximum at the equilibrium\npotential of the ions. As a result of these proposed modifications, the entropy\nvalues were observed to peak around the equilibrium potential of the ions.\nThese refined approaches were successfully validated using the Logistic map.\nAdditionally, the entropy results were compared with Lyapunov exponents. The\nresults show that the behaviour of living cells can be analysed using entropy\nmeasurements. The results also suggest that the method could be used to detect\ndifferences in the behaviour of tumour and normal cells, or the effects of\ndrugs on cells.",

However, applying these methods to populations with neuromotor gait\ndeficits, such as post-stroke hemiparesis, is challenging. This is due not only\nto high population heterogeneity and gait variability but also to a lack of\npost-stroke gait datasets to train accurate models. Despite these challenges,\ndata-driven methods offer a promising avenue for control, potentially allowing\nexoskeletons to function safely and effectively in unstructured community\nsettings. This work presents a first step towards enabling adaptive\nplantarflexion and dorsiflexion assistance from data-driven torque estimation\nduring post-stroke walking. We trained a multi-task Temporal Convolutional\nNetwork (TCN) using collected data from four post-stroke participants walking\non a treadmill ($R^2$ of $0.74 \\pm 0.13$).

The role of the Sagittarius in driving or contributing to this\ndisequilibrium has been extensively investigated. Most of these studies,\nhowever, assume an initially near-equilibrium disc. It was also hypothesized\nthat the passage of Sagittarius could have increased the star-forming activity\nin the Solar Neighbourhood. We check whether galaxies that have undergone\ncosmological evolution are affected by interactions analogous to those between\nthe Sagittarius and the Milky Way. We use the high-resolution simulation TNG50\nto look for pairs similar to the Milky Way and Sagittarius. We search within\nredshift z=1-0 for discs from the MW/M31 sample that interacted with a\nsatellite more massive than 10 billion Msun, had a pericenter smaller than 50\nkpc, and was on an approximately polar orbit. We exclude cases where, within 1\nGyr of the pericenter, a similar interaction occurred. In 90 percent of cases,\na passage of the Sagittarius analogue had no significant effect on either the\nvertical velocity field of the disc or the star formation history. A response\nin vertical stellar kinematics can be found mostly in cold discs and mildly\ncorrelates with the strength of interactions. For star formation, the studied\ninteractions had an effect only when little to no star formation was ongoing\nprior to the interaction, often due to previously disturbed star-forming discs,\ne.g., from AGN activity. Our results indicate that stellar discs in TNG50 are\nfrequently vertically perturbed preceding pericenter passages of Sagittarius\nanalogues. Future studies using other simulations and extragalactic surveys\nwill help establish whether vertical disequilibrium is a common feature of disc\ngalaxies or an artifact of the specific setup studied.",

Next, we apply the NSGA-III algorithm to optimize the network\ntopology, aiming to balance communication efficiency, global connectivity, and\nmission success rate. Experiments demonstrate that compared to traditional\nmethods like K-Shell, our SurBi-Ranking method identifies critical nodes and\nedges with greater accuracy, as deliberate attacks on these components cause\nmore significant connectivity degradation. Furthermore, our optimization\napproach, when prioritizing SurBi-Ranked critical components under attack,\nreduces the natural connectivity degradation by around 30%, achieves higher\nmission success rates, and incurs lower communication reconfiguration costs,\nensuring sustained connectivity and mission effectiveness across multi-phase\noperations.",

    "abstract": "Deflection of light along the optical path is a major source of image\ndegradation for ground-based telescopes. Methods have been developed to measure\nupper atmospheric seeing based on models of the turbulence in the atmosphere,\nbut due to boundary conditions, transmission within telescope enclosures is\nmore complex. The Multi-beam Optical Seeing Sensor (MOSS) directly measures the\ncomponent of the image quality degradation from inhomogeneity of the index of\nrefraction within the telescope dome. MOSS outputs four near-parallel beams of\nlight that travel along the optical path and are imaged by the telescope's\ndetector, landing like starlight on the telescope's focal plane. By using a\nstrobed light source, we can 'freeze' the instantaneous index variations\ntransverse to the optical path. This system captures both 'dome' and 'mirror'\nseeing. Through plotting the standard deviation of differential motion between\npairs of beams, MOSS enables characterization of the length scale of turbulence\nwithin the dome. The temporal coherence of temperature gradients can be probed\nwith different pulse lengths, and the spatial coherence by comparing pairs at\ndifferent separations across the aperture of the telescope. Optical path\nturbulence measurements, alongside other telemetry metrics, will guide thermal\nand airflow management to optimize image quality. A MOSS prototype was\ninstalled in the 1.2 meter Auxiliary Telescope (AuxTel) at the Vera C. Rubin\nObservatory in Chile, and preliminary data constrain the optical path\nturbulence with a lower bound of 1.4 arcseconds. The optical path turbulence\nvaried throughout the night of observing.",

At PAN 2025, the shared task challenges\nparticipants to detect style switches at the most fine-grained level:\nindividual sentences. The task spans three datasets, each designed with\ncontrolled and increasing thematic variety within documents. We propose to\naddress this problem by modeling the content of each problem instance - that\nis, a series of sentences - as a whole, using a Sequential Sentence Pair\nClassifier (SSPC). The architecture leverages a pre-trained language model\n(PLM) to obtain representations of individual sentences, which are then fed\ninto a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to contextualize them within the document.\nThe BiLSTM-produced vectors of adjacent sentences are concatenated and passed\nto a multi-layer perceptron for prediction per adjacency. Building on the work\nof previous PAN participants classical text segmentation, the approach is\nrelatively conservative and lightweight. Nevertheless, it proves effective in\nleveraging contextual information and addressing what is arguably the most\nchallenging aspect of this year's shared task: the notorious problem of\n\"stylistically shallow\", short sentences that are prevalent in the proposed\nbenchmark data.

We detect dependence on the magnitude gap in both halo\nproperties. The dependence is the strongest in the ICG luminosity range of\n$10^{10.3}<L_\\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\\odot]\\leq 10^{10.7}$, where halos with smaller\ngaps have higher masses and lower concentrations. When $10^{10.7}\n<L_c[h^{-2}L_\\odot] \\leq 10^{11.1}$, however, no significant gap dependence is\ndetected. In the range of $10^{9.9}<L_\\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\\odot] \\leq\n10^{10.3}$, a disordering of the gap dependence is marginally observable. We\ncompare the observational results with predictions by two lightcone catalogs\nbuilt from the Illustris TNG300 and the Millennium simulations. The gap\ndependence in the two mock samples show overall consistency with observations,\nbut neither matches them in all $L_\\mathrm{c}$ bins to a quantitative level. We\nalso compare the significance of the gap dependence on halo mass and\nconcentration and find that our measurement prefers gap dependence in both\nparameters, while the halo mass dependence is preferred over the concentration\nif only one of the two dependencies is allowed.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is essential for identifying anomalies\nin evolving graphs across domains such as finance, traffic, and social\nnetworks. Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown\npromising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and\ngeneralize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to\ncapture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous\nemergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge\ngeneralist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve\ntemporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a\nDGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,\nevolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal\nego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively\nupdated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new\ndomain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with\ndynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally,\nDP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised\nadaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from different\ndomains.",

Granger\ncausality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time\nseries. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag\nassumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex\nsystems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses\nthis limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time\nlags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal\ninteractions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.\nFor example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region\nwith a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we\nformalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a\nnovel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling\nfrequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC,\ndemonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference\npipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our\nframework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time\nseries data.

To address these challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns\ncontinuous latent trajectories from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy\nsurvival prediction. TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation\n(NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled\ndata, forming continuous latent trajectories.

The V-3d atoms with the Kagome\nlattice contribute maximum to the transport properties, exhibits flat bands\nnear the EF while being protected under SOC and U+SOC. Herein, we report the\nvulnerability of the Yb-4f states under SOC and U+SOC. Furthurmore, The Fermi\nsurface is found to comprise of quasi-2D cylindrical sheets centered at the\nGamma-point, along with smaller pockets near the Brillouin zone boundaries,\nwhich under combined U+SOC, a small spherical pocket emerges and the\ncylindrical sheet exhibits slight deformations. The dHvA frequencies reach as\nhigh as 70 kilotesla, which increase with tilt angle, exhibiting a nearly\nparabolic trend as expected for cylindrical orbits, while a low-frequency\nbranch remains below 1 kT. Only the U+SOC case shows noticeable modification in\nboth the Fermi surface and the dHvA oscillation. Crucially, the $Z_2$ invariant\ncalculation identifies YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ as a strong topological metal ($r_0 = 1$).\nThese findings not only advance our understanding of the underlying quantum\nphenomena in rare-earth Kagome systems, but also establish YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ as a\ncompelling and promising platform for exploring intertwined topology and\nelectron correlations in kagome lattices, thereby offering valuable insights\nfor engineering quantum phases in layered materials.",

    "abstract": "Standpoint extensions of knowledge representation formalisms have been\nrecently introduced as a means to incorporate multi-perspective modelling and\nreasoning through modal operators that attribute pieces of knowledge to\nspecific entities or agents. In these extensions, the integration between\nconceptual modelling and perspective annotations can vary in strength, with\nmonodic standpoint extensions offering a well-balanced approach. They allow for\nadvanced modelling features, such as the expression of rigid concepts, while\nmaintaining desirable reasoning complexity.\n  We consider the extension of C2--the counting two-variable fragment of\nfirst-order logic--by monodic standpoints. At the heart of our work is a\npolynomial-time translation of formulas in this extended formalism into\nstandard, standpoint-free C2, a result that relies on intricate model-theoretic\narguments. Thanks to this translation, the satisfiability problem remains at\nthe same complexity level: NExpTime-complete, as in plain C2. Since our\nformalism subsumes monodic S5 over C2, this result also marks a substantial\nadvancement in the study of first-order modal logics.\n  From a practical standpoint, this means that highly expressive description\nlogics such as SHOIQBs and SROIQBs--which underpin the widely adopted OWL 1 and\nOWL 2 ontology languages standardised by the W3C--can be extended with monodic\nstandpoints without increasing the standard reasoning complexity.\n  We further prove that NExpTime-hardness arises even in significantly less\nexpressive description logics, as long as they include both nominals and\nmonodic standpoints. Moreover, we show that if the monodicity restriction is\nrelaxed even slightly in the presence of inverse roles, functionality, and\nnominals, the satisfiability problem becomes undecidable.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for\nbiomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary\nfeature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often\npresumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can\nyield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To\nvalidate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and\nrigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for\ntime-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal\n(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,\n2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian\ninference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline\nacross all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming\nthe synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.\nConversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further\nimprovement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational\nredundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.\nThis research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in\nbiomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't\nabout the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent\ncomplementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic\nfeature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, \"Complementary Feature\nDomains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning,\" presents a mathematically\nquantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating\nthat optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic\ninformation-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for\nStructural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their\nintegration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted\nto enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale\ndeployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited\ngeneralisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address\nthese limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework\nbased on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage\nlocalisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to\nhave the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source\nand target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling\neffective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about\ndimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained\nCNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed\nMPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different\ncomposite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess\ndomains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a\nsubstantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.\nHence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and\nstatistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.",

It involves collecting voltage measurements from\nelectrodes placed on the patient's thorax, which are then used to reconstruct\nimpedance images. This study investigates how incorporating anatomical\ninformation from CT data into the widely used GREIT reconstruction algorithm\naffects EIT images and improves their interpretability. Approach: Based on\nclinically motivated lung state scenarios, we simulated EIT measurements to\nassess how the GREIT parameters influence the result of EIT image\nreconstruction, particularly with respect to noise performance and image\naccuracy. We introduce quality measures that allow us to perform a quantitative\nassessment of reconstruction quality. Anatomical features from CT data were\nincluded by customizing background conductivity and GREIT training target\ndistribution. Main results: Our analysis confirmed that unphysiological\nbackground conductivity assumptions can lead to misleading EIT images, whereas\nphysiological values, although more accurate, come with higher noise\nsensitivity. By increasing the number of GREIT training targets inside the lung\nand adapting the respective weighting radius, we significantly improved the\nanatomical accuracy of the EIT images. When applied to clinical EIT data from a\nrepresentative ARDS patient, these adjustments in the reconstruction setup\nsubstantially enhanced the interpretability of the resulting EIT images.\nSignificance: Integrating CT-based anatomical data in the GREIT reconstruction\nsignificantly enhances the clinical applicability of EIT in lung monitoring.\nThe improved interpretability of EIT images facilitates better-informed\nclinical decisions and the individualized adjustment of ventilation strategies\nfor critically ill patients.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates projection-based Reduced-Order Models (ROMs)\nformulated in the frequency domain, employing a space-time basis constructed\nwith Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition to efficiently represent dominant\nspatio-temporal coherent structures. Although frequency domain formulations are\nwell suited to capturing time-periodic solutions, such as unstable periodic\norbits, this study focusses on modelling statistically stationary flows by\ncomputing long-time solutions that approximate their underlying statistics. In\ncontrast to traditional ROMs based solely on spatial modes, a space-time\nformulation achieves simultaneous reduction in both space and time. This is\naccomplished by Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations onto the\nbasis using a space-time inner product, yielding a quadratic algebraic system\nof equations in the unknown amplitude coefficients. Solutions of the ROM are\nobtained by identifying amplitude coefficients that minimise an objective\nfunction corresponding to the sum of the squares of the residuals of the\nalgebraic system across all frequencies and modes, quantifying the aggregate\nviolation of momentum conservation within the reduced subspace. A robust\ngradient-based optimisation algorithm is employed to identify the minima of\nthis objective function. The method is demonstrated for chaotic flow in a\ntwo-dimensional lid-driven cavity at $Re=20{,}000$, where solutions with\nextended temporal periods approximately fifteen times the dominant shear layer\ntime scale are sought. Even without employing closure models to represent the\ntruncated spatio-temporal triadic interactions, multiple ROM solutions are\nfound that successfully reproduce the dominant dynamical flow features and\npredict the statistical distribution of turbulent quantities with good\nfidelity, although they tend to overpredict energy at spatio-temporal scales\nnear the truncation boundary.",

    "abstract": "While AI excels at generating text, audio, images, and videos, creating\ninteractive audio-visual content such as video games remains challenging.\nCurrent LLMs can generate JavaScript games and animations, but lack automated\nevaluation metrics and struggle with complex content that normally requires\nteams of humans working for many months (multi-shot, multi-agents) using assets\nmade by artists. To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a\nmulti-agent system.\n  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using\nAudio-Visual Recordings (AVRs). An omni-modal model (processing text, video,\nand audio) compares the AVRs of two contents, with a text model reviewing\nevaluations to determine superiority. We show that AVR-Eval properly identifies\ngood from broken or mismatched content.\n  We built AVR-Agent, a multi-agent system generating JavaScript code from a\nbank of multimedia assets (audio, images, 3D models). The coding agent selects\nrelevant assets, generates multiple initial codes, uses AVR-Eval to identify\nthe best version, and iteratively improves it through omni-modal agent feedback\nfrom the AVR.\n  We run experiments on games and animations with AVR-Eval (win rate of content\nA against B). We find that content generated by AVR-Agent has a significantly\nhigher win rate against content made through one-shot generation. However,\nmodels struggle to leverage custom assets and AVR feedback effectively, showing\nno higher win rate. This reveals a critical gap: while humans benefit from\nhigh-quality assets and audio-visual feedback, current coding models do not\nseem to utilize these resources as effectively, highlighting fundamental\ndifferences between human and machine content creation approaches.",

With the\ngrowing use of Large Language Models (LLM) as AI modeling assistants, more\nautomation will be involved in generating diagrams. This necessitates the\nadvancement of automatic model correctness evaluation tools. Such a tool can be\nused to evaluate both manually and AI automatically generated models; to\nprovide feedback to system engineers, and enable AI assistants to self-evaluate\nand self-enhance their generated models.\n  In this paper, we propose MCeT, the first fully automated tool to evaluate\nthe correctness of a behavioral model, sequence diagrams in particular, against\nits corresponding requirements text and produce a list of issues that the model\nhas. We utilize LLMs for the correctness evaluation tasks as they have shown\noutstanding natural language understanding ability. However, we show that\ndirectly asking an LLM to compare a diagram to requirements finds less than 35%\nof issues that experienced engineers can find. We propose to supplement the\ndirect check with a fine-grained, multi-perspective approach; we split the\ndiagram into atomic, non-divisible interactions, and split the requirements\ntext into atomic, self-contained items. We compare the diagram with atomic\nrequirements and each diagram-atom with the requirements. We also propose a\nself-consistency checking approach that combines perspectives to mitigate LLM\nhallucinated issues. Our combined approach improves upon the precision of the\ndirect approach from 0.58 to 0.81 in a dataset of real requirements.

However, this\nshift introduces new challenges in managing CPU resources efficiently under\nstrict real-time constraints. In particular, the interplay between\nlatency-sensitive RAN workloads and general-purpose Operating System (OS)\nschedulers often leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary energy\nconsumption. This work proposes a lightweight, programmable distributed\napplication (dApp) deployed at the Distributed Unit (DU) level to dynamically\norchestrate CPU usage.

Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to\nproprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications.\nFully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN\nstack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving\nenergy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a\ncommercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without\ncompromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of\nlow-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks",

We also include texts from domain-specific\ncontinued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all\nparameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG\ntext detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential\nvulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our\nown classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)\noptimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While\nBCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL\ntest set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock\ndeployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay\ndataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by\n50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our\nresults indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to\nthe test set. Our experiments highlight several areas of improvement for AIG\ntext detectors.",

    "abstract": "Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in\nfinancial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional\nanalysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering\nvaluable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)\ncan enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial\nanalysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid\nevolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing\nknowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports\nfurther hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these\nchallenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce\nthe Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph\n(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational\ntriples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates\nreal-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven\nextraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured\nand accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a\nTwo-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the\nretrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and\nprecise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG\nachieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs\nby 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.",

We provide a\ncomprehensive set of mathematical tools which can be used to construct\ndisintegrations and apply these to find densities of disintegrations on\ndifferentiable manifolds. Using our results, we provide a disturbingly simple\nexample in which the restricted density and the disintegration density\ndrastically disagree. Motivated by applications in approximate Bayesian\ninference and Bayesian inverse problems, we further study the modes of\ndisintegrations. We show that the recently introduced notion of a \"conditional\nmode\" does not coincide in general with the modes of the conditional measure\nobtained through disintegration, but rather the modes of the restricted\nmeasure. We also discuss the implications of the discrepancy between the two\nmeasures in practice, advocating for the utility of both approaches depending\non the modelling context.",

To this end, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint\noptimization problem (USBJOP) to comprehensively consider the association\nbetween UAV-SIMs and users, the locations of UAV-SIMs, and the phase shifts of\nUAV-SIMs, aiming to maximize the network capacity. Due to the non-convexity and\nNP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization problems,\nwhich are the association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem\n(AUUOP), the UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and the UAV-SIM phase\nshifts optimization problem (USPSOP). Then, these three sub-optimization\nproblems are solved by an alternating optimization (AO) strategy.

IMF\ncharacterization in a large number of star-forming regions (SFRs) is essential\nfor constraining these processes. We aim to identify and spectroscopically\nconfirm very low-mass members of the Corona Australis (CrA) SFR to refine its\nsubstellar census, determine its low-mass IMF, and compare it to other\nclusters. Using deep I-band photometry from SuprimeCam/Subaru and data from the\nVISTA Hemisphere Survey, we identified low-mass BD candidates in CrA. We\nsubsequently obtained NIR spectra of 173 of these candidates with KMOS/VLT, as\nwell as optical spectra for 8 kinematic candidate members using FLOYDS/LCO. The\nkinematic candidates are confirmed as low-mass stellar members with spectral\ntypes M1 to M5. In contrast, all 173 BD candidates observed with KMOS are\nidentified as contaminants. Although the follow-up yielded no new substellar\nmembers, it places strong constraints on the number of undetected substellar\nobjects in the region. Combined with literature data, this enables us to derive\nthe substellar IMF, which is consistent with a single power-law slope of alpha\n= 0.95+-0.06 in the range 0.01-1 MSun or alpha = 0.33+-0.19 in the range\n0.01-0.1 MSun. The star-to-BD ratio in CrA is about 2. We also provide updated\nIMFs and star-to-BD ratios for Lupus3 and ChaI from the SONYC survey,\nreflecting revised distances from Gaia. Finally, we estimate surface densities\nand median FUV fluxes for 6 SFRs and clusters and compare their substellar\npopulations as a function of environmental properties. The IMF and star-to-BD\nratio show no clear dependence on stellar density or ionizing flux from the\nmassive stars. A combined effect - where one factor enhances and the other\nsuppresses BD formation - also appears unlikely. (Abridged)",

In\nthis contribution, a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called\nGHTM (Graph-Based Hybrid Topic Model) is proposed. This model represents input\nvectors of documents as nodes in the graph, which GCN uses to produce\nsemantically rich embeddings.

To address these limitations, this paper devises a novel\nselective fixed-filter scheme based on a delayless subband structure. In the\noff-line training stage, subband control filters are pre-trained for different\nfrequency ranges and stored in a dedicated sub-filter database.

However, for\nlarge-scale online service systems that receive a tremendous amount of\nfeedback, it remains a challenging task to identify severe issues from user\nfeedback. Aims: To develop a better feedback-based issue detection approach, it\nis crucial first to gain a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics\nof user feedback in real production systems. Method: In this paper, we conduct\nan empirical study on 50,378,766 user feedback items from six real-world\nservices in a one-billion-user online service system. We first study what users\nprovide in their feedback. We then examine whether certain features of feedback\nitems can be good indicators of severe issues. Finally, we investigate whether\nadopting machine learning techniques to analyze user feedback is reasonable.\nResults: Our results show that a large proportion of user feedback provides\nirrelevant information about system issues. As a result, it is crucial to\nfilter out issue-irrelevant information when processing user feedback.\nMoreover, we find severe issues that cannot be easily detected based solely on\nuser feedback characteristics. Finally, we find that the distributions of the\nfeedback topics in different time intervals are similar. This confirms that\ndesigning machine learning-based approaches is a viable direction for better\nanalyzing user feedback.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing\nsmoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between\npairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by\nextreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth\ndiscontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous\nmotion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and\nfail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion\nfields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We\nobserve that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion\nsub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion\npatterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in\ntwo-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first\ndevise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier\nprobability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion\nfield into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.\nNext, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each\nsub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a\ncustomized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous\nmotion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational\nentanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this\nminimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in\nrelative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization.

Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known\nas external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into\ntwo types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I\nmodel-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image\nfilters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly\nand introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems\nlike Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a\nU-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)\nearly denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)\ncross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image\nregions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW\ndetection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising\nsteps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong\noperates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting\nfor full image generation.

Despite the progress in extending\nVIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant\nshortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural\nomission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction\nframework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement.

Simulating HAT is challenging due to\nthe need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus,\nneither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable.\nMachine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy\nsurfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to\ngeneralize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions\nin proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection.\nHere, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large\ndatasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural\nnetwork architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT\nPESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE\nconsistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction,\nachieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT\nbarrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into\nlarge-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted\nbarriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in\npeptides.

    "abstract": "Multimodal AI models have achieved impressive performance in tasks that\nrequire integrating information from multiple modalities, such as vision and\nlanguage. However, their \"black-box\" nature poses a major barrier to deployment\nin high-stakes applications where interpretability and trustworthiness are\nessential. How to explain cross-modal interactions in multimodal AI models\nremains a major challenge. While existing model explanation methods, such as\nattention map and Grad-CAM, offer coarse insights into cross-modal\nrelationships, they cannot precisely quantify the synergistic effects between\nmodalities, and are limited to open-source models with accessible internal\nweights. Here we introduce MultiSHAP, a model-agnostic interpretability\nframework that leverages the Shapley Interaction Index to attribute multimodal\npredictions to pairwise interactions between fine-grained visual and textual\nelements (such as image patches and text tokens), while being applicable to\nboth open- and closed-source models. Our approach provides: (1) instance-level\nexplanations that reveal synergistic and suppressive cross-modal effects for\nindividual samples - \"why the model makes a specific prediction on this input\",\nand (2) dataset-level explanation that uncovers generalizable interaction\npatterns across samples - \"how the model integrates information across\nmodalities\". Experiments on public multimodal benchmarks confirm that MultiSHAP\nfaithfully captures cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, while real-world case\nstudies demonstrate its practical utility. Our framework is extensible beyond\ntwo modalities, offering a general solution for interpreting complex multimodal\nAI models.",

This effect is of considerable interest for the efficient\nintegration of antiferromagnetic materials into the fields of superconducting\nspintronics and electronics. A key element of this proximity effect is the Neel\ntriplet correlations, initially predicted for S/AF heterostructures with\ncheckerboard G-type antiferromagnetic ordering. However, various forms of\nantiferromagnetic ordering exist, and an important open question concerns the\ngeneralization of these results to such cases. In this paper, we develop a\ntheory of the proximity effect in S/AF heterostructures with arbitrary\ntwo-sublattice antiferromagnetic ordering, aiming to clarify which\nantiferromagnets are capable of inducing triplet correlations and what\nstructure these correlations may exhibit. We show that, in S/AF\nheterostructures with collinear compensated antiferromagnets, the dominant\nsuperconducting triplet correlations are of the checkerboard Neel type, as\noriginally predicted for G-type antiferromagnets. In contrast, layered Neel\ntriplet correlations, although potentially generated by layered\nantiferromagnets, are significantly weaker.

To solve such problems\nusing Ising machines (IMs) - specialized analog or digital devices designed to\nsolve COPs efficiently - these multi-valued integers must be encoded using\nbinary spin variables. A common approach is one-hot encoding, where each\nvariable is represented by a group of spins constrained so that exactly one\nspin is in the \"up\" state. However, this encoding introduces energy barriers:\nchanging an integer's value requires flipping two spins and passing through an\ninvalid intermediate state.

We propose a higher-order Ising formulation for Max-3-Cut,\nwhich is the smallest fundamental COP with multi-valued integer variables. Our\nformulation preserves valid configurations under single-spin updates. The\nresulting energy landscapes are smoother, and we show that this remains true\neven when the binary variables are relaxed to continuous values, making it\nwell-suited for analog IMs as well. Benchmarking on such an IM, we find that\nthe higher-order formulation leads to significantly faster solutions than the\nIsing baseline.

These\ntheories, together with their novel decomposition structure, arise from\nquotienting the Bryant--Salamon spin bundle over the 3-sphere by special finite\nsubgroups acting simultaneously on both the fiber and base. We show that these\ngauge theories admit both inner and outer automorphisms, enabling sequences of\ngauge theory breaking. In particular, outer automorphisms extend the\ndecomposition structure to theories with $\\mathfrak{so}(2N+1)$,\n$\\mathfrak{sp}(2N)$, $\\mathfrak{f}_{4}$, and $\\mathfrak{g}_{2}$ gauge algebras.\nFor these theories, including both simply-laced and non-simply-laced cases, we\nanalyze their $p$-form symmetries, including $(-1)$-form symmetries, derive the\ncorresponding SymTFTs, and identify the M-theoretic origin of their symmetry\ntopological operators and defects. Finally, we demonstrate that these gauge\ntheories exhibit modified instanton sums and higher 4-group structures, and we\nderive the associated topological sector directly from M-theory.",

To do so, we use an optimization\napproach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly\nwithout specific network architectures.

In the case of SN 2009ib, the\nlate-time high-resolution imaging reveals that the progenitor candidate is in\nfact a blend of multiple unresolved stars. Subsequent difference imaging shows\nno significant change in brightness at the SN's position even years after the\nexplosion. These findings indicate that the flux from the previously identified\nsource is dominated by unresolved field stars, with little to no contribution\nfrom the genuine progenitor. In the case of SN 2012ec, a comparison of\npre-explosion and late-time images reveals that the progenitor candidate faded\nby about 0.6 mag in the F814W band seven years after the explosion, confirming\nthe disappearance of the progenitor.",

    "abstract": "Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions\nof anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately\ndetermine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.\nDespite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To\naddress this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,\nLlama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this\nfundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we\ninvestigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers\nplaced on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers\nprovide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical\nimages compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest\nthat, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on\nactual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading\nto incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we\nintroduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,\ndesigned to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative\npositions in medical images.",

Our\nLUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural\ndetails in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We\nfurther build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for\nlow-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.\nExperimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach for video color grading.

With the development of deep learning\ntechnologies, adopting pre-trained models for this task has become mainstream.\nConsidering the retrieval efficiency, most of the previous approaches adopt a\ndual-encoder for this task, which encodes the description and code snippet into\nrepresentation vectors, respectively. However, the model structure of the\ndual-encoder tends to limit the model's performance, since it lacks the\ninteraction between the code snippet and description at the bottom layer of the\nmodel during training. To improve the model's effectiveness while preserving\nits efficiency, we propose a framework, which adopts Self-AdaPtive Model\nDistillation for Efficient CodE Retrieval, named SPENCER. SPENCER first adopts\nthe dual-encoder to narrow the search space and then adopts the cross-encoder\nto improve accuracy. To improve the efficiency of SPENCER, we propose a novel\nmodel distillation technique, which can greatly reduce the inference time of\nthe dual-encoder while maintaining the overall performance. We also propose a\nteaching assistant selection strategy for our model distillation, which can\nadaptively select the suitable teaching assistant models for different\npre-trained models during the model distillation to ensure the model\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the combination of\ndual-encoder and cross-encoder improves overall performance compared to solely\ndual-encoder-based models for code retrieval. Besides, our model distillation\ntechnique retains over 98% of the overall performance while reducing the\ninference time of the dual-encoder by 70%.",

An issue of both practical and\ntheoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a\nstatic relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The\npresent contribution aims at providing an answer within the frame of\ntraditional hypothesis testing. Briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of\nlinking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve\nsuch a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph, by i)\ncomparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a\nsuitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative)\nedge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of\nconcordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an\ninformation-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation\nof Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time\nseries that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while\nrandomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our\nmethod by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of\nneurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not\n- and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the\ncase, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject\nvariability than the complementary, positive subgraph.

    "abstract": "Problem definition: Quick response, a strategy widely adopted to mitigate\noverproduction in the retail industry, is now at the center of a critical\ndebate. Recent research reveals a counter-intuitive paradox: while quick\nresponse systems reduce waste from unsold finished goods, they may incentivize\nfirms to procure more raw materials, potentially increasing total system waste.\nAdditionally, existing models that guide quick response strategies rely on the\nassumption of a known demand distribution. In practice, demand patterns are\ncomplex and ambiguous, and historical data is often scarce, leaving managers\nwithout a reliable framework to determine quick response policies under\ndata-driven settings. Methodology: We develop a distributionally robust quick\nresponse model to address demand uncertainty, building policies that are robust\neven with limited data. We further integrate a novel waste-to-consumption ratio\nconstraint into this framework, empowering firms to explicitly control the\nenvironmental impact of quick response systems. Results: Numerical experiments\nshow that policies optimized for a specific demand assumption suffer severe\nperformance degradation when the real demand pattern changes even slightly. In\ncontrast, our data-driven DRO approach consistently delivers robust and\nsuperior performance across a wide range of complex demand distributions.\nMoreover, we find that the constrained quick response model resolves the\ncentral paradox: it can achieve higher profits with verifiably less total waste\nthan a traditional, non-flexible alternative. Managerial implications: Our\nresearch resolves the `quick response or not' debate by showing that the\nquestion is not whether to use quick response, but how to manage it. By\nincorporating socially responsible metrics as constraints, the quick response\nsystem delivers a `win-win' outcome for both profitability and the environment.",

To address this, we propose a\ntwo-stage integrated framework for enhanced mineral detection in the Cuprite\nmining district. In the first stage, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nfor each spectral band and apply a phase-locked thresholding technique to\ndiscard low-SNR bands, effectively removing redundancy and suppressing\nbackground noise. Savitzky-Golay filtering is then employed for spectral\nsmoothing, serving a dual role first to stabilize trends during band selection,\nand second to preserve fine-grained spectral features during preprocessing. In\nthe second stage, the refined HSI data is reintroduced into the model, where\nKMeans clustering is used to extract 12 endmember spectra (W1 custom), followed\nby non negative least squares (NNLS) for abundance unmixing. The resulting\nendmembers are quantitatively compared with laboratory spectra (W1 raw) using\ncosine similarity and RMSE metrics. Experimental results confirm that our\nproposed pipeline improves unmixing accuracy and enhances the detection of weak\nmineral zones.

This systematic literature review (SLR) maps the formal foundations of\nprogramming paradigms. Our objective is twofold: (1) to assess the state of the\nart of classification formalisms and their limitations, and (2) to identify the\nconceptual primitives and mathematical frameworks for a more powerful,\nreconstructive approach.\n  Based on a synthesis of 74 primary studies, we find that existing taxonomies\nlack conceptual granularity, a unified formal basis, and struggle with hybrid\nlanguages. In response, our analysis reveals a strong convergence toward a\ncompositional reconstruction of paradigms. This approach identifies a minimal\nset of orthogonal, atomic primitives and leverages mathematical frameworks,\npredominantly Type theory, Category theory and Unifying Theories of Programming\n(UTP), to formally guarantee their compositional properties.\n  We conclude that the literature reflects a significant intellectual shift\naway from classification towards these promising formal, reconstructive\nframeworks.

Consequently, in\nsome studies, the same stimuli are presented multiple times to each participant\nto increase the number of trials available for use in model training. However,\nwhen a decoding model is trained and subsequently evaluated on responses to the\nsame stimuli, stimulus identity becomes a confounder for accuracy. We term this\nthe repeated-stimulus confound. We identify a susceptible dataset, and 16\npublications which report model performance based on evaluation procedures\naffected by the confound. We conducted experiments using models from the\naffected studies to investigate the likely extent to which results in the\nliterature have been misreported. Our findings suggest that the decoding\naccuracies of these models were overestimated by between 4.46-7.42%.

The confound not only\nresults in optimistic estimates of decoding performance, but undermines the\nvalidity of several claims made within the affected publications.

To address these limitations, we propose an\nefficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary\nfeature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD.

The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across\ndisparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer\nfusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP\nbottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing\nfiner-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby\nincreasing local feature diversity and representation capacity.

This approach\neliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across\nmultiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large\nlanguage models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves\noptimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining\ncomparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with\nRoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and\n0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat\nshows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,\nrespectively. These empirical results also verify that the generalization of\nLoRA is closely related to sharpness, which is omitted by previous methods.",

However, this text encoding\nprocess is separated from the anomaly detection training objective in the graph\ndomain, making it difficult to ensure that the extracted textual features focus\non GAD-relevant information, seriously constraining the detection capability.\nHow to seamlessly integrate raw text and graph topology to unleash the vast\npotential of cross-modal data in TAGs for anomaly detection poses a challenging\nissue. This paper presents a novel end-to-end paradigm for text-attributed\ngraph anomaly detection, named CMUCL.

    "abstract": "The natural combination of intricate topological structures and rich textual\ninformation in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) opens up a novel perspective for\ngraph anomaly detection (GAD). However, existing GAD methods primarily focus on\ndesigning complex optimization objectives within the graph domain, overlooking\nthe complementary value of the textual modality, whose features are often\nencoded by shallow embedding techniques, such as bag-of-words or skip-gram, so\nthat semantic context related to anomalies may be missed. To unleash the\nenormous potential of textual modality, large language models (LLMs) have\nemerged as promising alternatives due to their strong semantic understanding\nand reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, their application to TAG anomaly\ndetection remains nascent, and they struggle to encode high-order structural\ninformation inherent in graphs due to input length constraints. For\nhigh-quality anomaly detection in TAGs, we propose CoLL, a novel framework that\ncombines LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage their complementary\nstrengths. CoLL employs multi-LLM collaboration for evidence-augmented\ngeneration to capture anomaly-relevant contexts while delivering human-readable\nrationales for detected anomalies. Moreover, CoLL integrates a GNN equipped\nwith a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse textual features with evidence while\npreserving high-order topological information. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of CoLL, achieving an average improvement of 13.37%\nin AP. This study opens a new avenue for incorporating LLMs in advancing GAD.",

Further improvements planed for future\nobservatories are placing even more demanding constraints on tolerable stray\nlight power.

Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as\nAgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond\nonly when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems\nlack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution\nshifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime\nenforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.\nPro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a\nDiscrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it\nanticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe\nstates, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted\nrisk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity\nchecks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability\nwhile approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard\nextensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and\nautonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early\non up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes\n(e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to\n80.4% task completion.

Our findings indicate that conventional ECG devices,\nwhich are limited to low sampling rates due to resource constraints or outdated\nguidelines, can be used to reliably collect SKNA if muscle artifact\ncontamination is minimal.",

    "abstract": "We present SAMSA 2.0, an interactive segmentation framework for hyperspectral\nmedical imaging that introduces spectral angle prompting to guide the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) using spectral similarity alongside spatial cues. This\nearly fusion of spectral information enables more accurate and robust\nsegmentation across diverse spectral datasets. Without retraining, SAMSA 2.0\nachieves up to +3.8% higher Dice scores compared to RGB-only models and up to\n+3.1% over prior spectral fusion methods. Our approach enhances few-shot and\nzero-shot performance, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging\nlow-data and noisy scenarios common in clinical imaging.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in control of prosthetic hands have focused on increasing\nautonomy through the use of cameras and other sensory inputs. These systems aim\nto reduce the cognitive load on the user by automatically controlling certain\ndegrees of freedom. In robotics, imitation learning has emerged as a promising\napproach for learning grasping and complex manipulation tasks while simplifying\ndata collection. Its application to the control of prosthetic hands remains,\nhowever, largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could enhance dexterity\nrestoration and enable prosthetic devices to operate in more unconstrained\nscenarios, where tasks are learned from demonstrations rather than relying on\nmanually annotated sequences. To this end, we present HannesImitationPolicy, an\nimitation learning-based method to control the Hannes prosthetic hand, enabling\nobject grasping in unstructured environments. Moreover, we introduce the\nHannesImitationDataset comprising grasping demonstrations in table, shelf, and\nhuman-to-prosthesis handover scenarios. We leverage such data to train a single\ndiffusion policy and deploy it on the prosthetic hand to predict the wrist\norientation and hand closure for grasping. Experimental evaluation demonstrates\nsuccessful grasps across diverse objects and conditions. Finally, we show that\nthe policy outperforms a segmentation-based visual servo controller in\nunstructured scenarios.

To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Veli (Reference-free Variational Estimation via Latent\nInference), an unsupervised Bayesian model that leverages variational inference\nto correct LCS readings without requiring co-location with reference stations,\neliminating a major deployment barrier. Specifically, Veli constructs a\ndisentangled representation of the LCS readings, effectively separating the\ntrue pollutant reading from the sensor noise. To build our model and address\nthe lack of standardized benchmarks in AQ monitoring, we also introduce the Air\nQuality Sensor Data Repository (AQ-SDR).

For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around\nthe Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted\nby recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for\nthe transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is\nfound to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a\nhole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions.

We investigate this problem through a large-scale numerical\nanalysis of 300 structurally-uniform circuits across 10, 12, and 14 qubits.\nDespite their macroscopic uniformity, we find that each ensemble universally\nbifurcates into distinct robust and fragile classes. We solve the puzzle of\nthis emergent bifurcation, demonstrating that its origin is not structural, but\nis instead encoded in the statistical properties of the gate rotation\nparameters. Fragile circuits consistently exhibit a universal signature of\n``statistical brittleness,'' characterized by low parameter variability and a\nscarcity of small-angle gates. We uncover the underlying physical mechanism for\nthis phenomenon: Paradoxical Importance where smaller-angle gates are\ncounter-intuitively more critical to the circuit's function, an effect most\npronounced in fragile circuits. This reliance on fine-tuning explains why\nstatistically brittle circuits are uniquely vulnerable to failure under\ncompression.

We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework\nthat, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to\nmulti-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT\nmodel, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group\nIsolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)\nRegion-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To\ncomprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three\nmetrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout\ncontrol; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background\nconsistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing\nmulti-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all\nsettings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results\ndemonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background\npreservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any\ntraining or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By\ninheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling\nseamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new\ntraining-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation\nmodels continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale\naccordingly. Our implementation is available at:\nhttps://github.com/Suchenl/LAMIC.",

    "abstract": "The tabular form constitutes the standard way of representing data in\nrelational database systems and spreadsheets. But, similarly to other forms,\ntabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious\nperformance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the\nmost effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the\nunder-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed\nGAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the\nreal data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover,\nthe class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical\nvariables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less\neffective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a\nconditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially,\nctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input\nsamples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a\nnovel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes\nboth cluster and class mis-predictions. In this way, ctdGAN is trained to\ngenerate samples in subspaces that resemble those of the original data\ndistribution. We also introduce several other improvements, including a simple,\nyet effective cluster-wise scaling technique that captures multiple feature\nmodes without affecting data dimensionality.

This generalizes the Krengel effect\nabout the absence of universal estimates for the rate of convergence in\nBirkhoff's ergodic theorem. The proof uses a weakened version of Rokhlin's\nlemma for ergodic $Z^n$-actions. It ensures the existence of the required\nsequence of asymptotically almost invariant sets with given measures. A feature\nof the construction of such a sequence is that the choice of the next almost\ninvariant set depends on the original function and on the choice of the\nprevious invariant sets. A significant deviation of the ergodic averages from\nthe mean of a positive function can be uniformly realized over extremely large\ntime intervals. The deviation can be greater than a positive constant and\ndiffer little from it on arbitrary long time intervals.

However, these receivers detect\nonly signal amplitude, losing critical phase information. While reference\nsignals generated by a local oscillator (LO) can assist in phase recovery,\nexisting modulation schemes designed for conventional systems perform poorly\nwith this quantum detection mechanism. This paper introduces a breakthrough\nLO-aware adaptive modulation (LOAM) scheme specifically developed for RA\nreceivers that dynamically adapts to complex fading channel coefficients. LOAM\nmaximizes the minimum amplitude difference between constellation points,\nensuring optimal detection performance. The innovation employs an adaptive\nco-linear constellation architecture aligned with the combined phase of\nreference signal and channel coefficient. For strong reference signals, LOAM\ngenerates symmetric constellation points centered at origin; for weak signals,\nit adopts non-symmetric distributions. The paper mathematically derives the\nthreshold governing these operational regimes. Simulation results reveal the\ntransformative impact of LOAM, demonstrating performance gains exceeding 45 dB\nover conventional modulation schemes, including quadrature amplitude modulation\n(QAM), phase-shift keying (PSK), and pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM).",

    "abstract": "Silicon spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots leverage established\nsemiconductor infrastructure and offer a scalable path toward transformative\nquantum technologies. Holes spins in silicon offer compact all-electrical\ncontrol, whilst retaining all the salient features of a quantum dot qubit\narchitecture. However, silicon hole spin qubits are not as advanced as\nelectrons, due to increased susceptibility to disorder and more complex spin\nphysics. Here we demonstrate single-qubit gate fidelities up to 99.8% and a\ntwo-qubit gate quality factor of 240, indicating a physical fidelity limit of\n99.7%. These results represent the highest performance reported in natural\nsilicon to date, made possible by fast qubit control, exchange pulsing, and\nindustrial-grade fabrication. Notably, we achieve these results in a\nnear-identical device as used for highly reproducible, high-fidelity electron\nspin qubits. With isotopic purification and device-level optimisations in the\nfuture, our hole spin qubits are poised to unlock a new operation regime for\nquantum CMOS architectures.",

We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and\nmitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias\ntypes. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect\nbiased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive\nalternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a\nCLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the\noriginal model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,\nAutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple\ninteracting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25\nbias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur\nsimultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and\nreduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the\nvisual fidelity of the original model.",

To address these challenges, we propose\nTopology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time\nadaptation framework designed specifically for TSS.

This\napproach has since been extended to utilize integer arithmetic, offering lower\ncomputational cost compared to floating-point-based implementations.

The design\nconsists of a two-stage concave-convex pair, where optical aberrations are\ncancelled within each stage and between them, in a manner similar to that of a\ndouble-Gauss lens. The light rays pass through the central aperture in each\nmirror with acceptable obscuration. The numerical aperture (NA) is 0.5 and 0.7\nfor Hyper-NA. It has a circular exposure field with a diameter of 26 mm. The\nresidual radial distortion is rather high at a few microns at the field rim,\nand the scan motion causes image blurring. Thus, we need to revert to the\nstepper design, and the field becomes smaller, i.e. 18 mm x 18 mm square.\nHowever, this brings an important benefit: we can remove the scanning mechanism\nfrom the photomask side. It is important to note that both the wafer and the\nphotomask remain stationary during the EUV exposure. This guarantees superior\noverlay control and results in enhanced productivity. This approach serves to\nsimplify the system and reduce electrical consumption also. Illumination will\nbe provided through two rectangular scan-mirrors located in front of the mask,\nproviding dual line scan field, which matches with off-axis illumination\nenhancing the resolution and bypasses the central obscurations.",

To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach\nthat uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional\ninpainting technique designed for HOI.

This improves the accuracy and realism of the\ngenerated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental\nresults show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in\nHOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like\nunderstanding of dynamic environments.

Mamba, as an emerging state space model with\ninherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable\nfor processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features.

The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot\nmaintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of\nseverely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the\nhidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the\nunderstanding of instance objects.

DTS module maintains the continuity of\nthe internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to\ndynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and\nproviding dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the\ninterference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information\nflow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based\nhidden state weakening mechanism.

    "abstract": "Loop invariants are essential for proving the correctness of programs with\nloops. Developing loop invariants is challenging, and fully automatic synthesis\ncannot be guaranteed for arbitrary programs. Some approaches have been proposed\nto synthesize loop invariants using symbolic techniques and more recently using\nneural approaches. These approaches are able to correctly synthesize loop\ninvariants only for subsets of standard benchmarks. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether modern, reasoning-optimized large language models can do\nbetter. We integrate OpenAI's O1, O1-mini, and O3-mini into a tightly coupled\ngenerate-and-check pipeline with the Z3 SMT solver, using solver\ncounterexamples to iteratively guide invariant refinement. We use Code2Inv\nbenchmark, which provides C programs along with their formal preconditions and\npostconditions. On this benchmark of 133 tasks, our framework achieves 100%\ncoverage (133 out of 133), outperforming the previous best of 107 out of 133,\nwhile requiring only 1-2 model proposals per instance and 14-55 seconds of\nwall-clock time. These results demonstrate that LLMs possess latent logical\nreasoning capabilities which can help automate loop invariant synthesis. While\nour experiments target C-specific programs, this approach should be\ngeneralizable to other imperative languages.",

    "abstract": "Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while\nmaintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the\nuse of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and\nreconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as\nin existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting\nmodels to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry\nresults. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a\ncritical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a\ndiscriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the\nextended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of\nadversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical\ndiscriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a\nspecialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global\nfeatures of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function\nenhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and\nglobally coherent outpainted scenes.

To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it\nis crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects\nreal-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test\ngeneration benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination\nand structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the\nvalidity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these\nlimited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to\ncontamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural\nsimplicity.\n  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new\nbenchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from\nreal-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation\nprocess that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case\ncontamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides\na more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation\ncapabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT\nwith leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization\nversus reasoning in test generation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that\nULT is significantly more challenging. For example, test cases generated by\nLLMs only achieve 41.32\\%, 45.10\\%, 30.22\\%, and 40.21\\% for accuracy,\nstatement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all\nLLMs, respectively.

Given that more massive\ngiants retain more surface lithium, increasing mass by accreting circumstellar\nmatter could be a channel to enrich lithium. We evaluate this process in the\ncurrent work. Using MESA, we construct a model of matter accretion, including\nmass loss, that evolves a star from the main sequence turnoff to the red giant\nbranch tip. The mean accretion rate is estimated from the upper limit of the\naccreted mass and the evolutionary time of the star during this period, and a\ngrid of accretion rates is constructed. We separately consider their effects on\nthe lithium enhancement of giants, both in terms of the mass and the\ncomposition of accretion. Accreting matter with higher lithium abundances has a\npromoting effect on the lithium enhancement of giants. The accreted matter with\nexcess lithium alleviates the dilution of lithium in the convective envelope\nduring the first dredge-up. The added mass results in lower temperatures at the\nbottom of the convective envelope, which likewise weakens the depletion of\nsurface lithium. Weak accretion of circumstellar matter is a possible route to\nlithium enhancement for giants, and it predicts an upper limit on the lithium\nabundance of $\\rm \\sim 2.5\\,dex$. However, the mass increment it requires poses\na potential challenge to real astrophysical environments.

Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the\ncreation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from\nconventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve\nartist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke\npatterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style\nproperties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,\nleading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a\n`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks\ndesigned to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The\nstylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the\nstylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses\nencountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.\nTo this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for\ndrawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be\neffective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate\nwhen occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides\nocclusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,\nensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF\noperates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving\n2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.",

    "abstract": "Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) form a broad class of combinatorial\nproblems, which can be formulated as homomorphism problems between relational\nstructures. The CSP dichotomy theorem classifies all such problems over finite\ndomains into two categories: NP-complete and polynomial-time, see Zhuk (2017),\nBulatov (2017). Polynomial-time CSPs can be further subdivided into smaller\nsubclasses. Mal'tsev CSPs are defined by the property that every relation in\nthe problem is invariant under a Mal'tsev operation, a ternary operation $\\mu$\nsatisfying $\\mu(x, y, y) = \\mu(y, y, x) = x$ for all $x, y$. Bulatov and Dalmau\nproved that Mal'tsev CSPs are solvable in polynomial time, presenting an\nalgorithm for such CSPs (2006). The negation of an unsatisfiable CSP instance\ncan be expressed as a propositional tautology. We formalize the algorithm for\nMal'tsev CSPs within bounded arithmetic $V^1$, which captures polynomial-time\nreasoning and corresponds to the extended Frege proof system. We show that\n$V^1$ proves the soundness of Mal'tsev algorithm, implying that tautologies\nexpressing the non-existence of a solution for unsatisfiable instances of\nMal'tsev CSPs admit short extended Frege proofs. In addition, with small\nadjustments, we achieved an analogous result for Dalmau's algorithm that solves\ngeneralized majority-minority CSPs -- a common generalization of near-unanimity\noperations and Mal'tsev operations.",

This paper delves into a previously\noverlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly\nconveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.\nCorrespondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the\nbiased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To\naddress this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive\ndecouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the\nvisual modality into the foreground and background representation via\nexploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these\ndecoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the\nhand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal\nalignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual\npull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,\ndirecting the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the\nregion-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT\nthrough few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient\nlearning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.\nOur code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.",

Under the setting of online convex optimization, several\nalgorithms have been successfully developed to minimize the adaptive regret.\nHowever, existing algorithms lack universality in the sense that they can only\nhandle one type of convex functions and need apriori knowledge of parameters,\nwhich hinders their application in real-world scenarios. To address this\nlimitation, this paper investigates universal algorithms with dual adaptivity,\nwhich automatically adapt to the property of functions (convex, exponentially\nconcave, or strongly convex), as well as the nature of environments (stationary\nor changing). Specifically, we propose a meta-expert framework for dual\nadaptive algorithms, where multiple experts are created dynamically and\naggregated by a meta-algorithm. The meta-algorithm is required to yield a\nsecond-order bound, which can accommodate unknown function types. We further\nincorporate the technique of sleeping experts to capture the changing\nenvironments. For the construction of experts, we introduce two strategies\n(increasing the number of experts or enhancing the capabilities of experts) to\nachieve universality. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithms are able\nto minimize the adaptive regret for multiple types of convex functions\nsimultaneously, and also allow the type of functions to switch between rounds.\nMoreover, we extend our meta-expert framework to online composite optimization,\nand develop a universal algorithm for minimizing the adaptive regret of\ncomposite functions.",

Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures\nand lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal\nasynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex\nmodules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by\nlimited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity\nfor adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal\nperformance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in\nhandling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose\nthe first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It\nintegrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based\nHand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt\nstrategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip\nRecognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand\nPrompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip\nfeatures during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction\nPhoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from\nphoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through\nsemantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS\ndataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a\nmixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nCued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods.

The\ndominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical\ninefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to\nleverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To\novercome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal\nmultimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic\ncomponents.

Building on this strong foundation, our second\ncomponent, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process\nby leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging\nnegatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our\ncomprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot\nperformance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the\nfine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8\npoints on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our\nself-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance\nwithout the contrative pre-training.

Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear\nself-attention models.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nin multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is\namplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective\nones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus\non the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the\nmodel has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which\nleverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of\nthe gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as\nthe criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We\nvalidate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream\ndatasets.

Next, we analyze the\ninherent relationship between the power scaling at the BS and the amplification\nscaling at the active IRS. It is shown that the active IRS always amplifies the\nsignal using the maximum amplification gain under practical system settings.\nFinally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed AO-based algorithms and the benefits of active IRS-enabled ISAC\ncompared to its passive IRSs counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise in improving reasoning in\nvision-language models (VLMs), but it often produces explanations that are\nlinguistically fluent yet lack grounding in visual content. We observe that\nsuch hallucinations arise in part from the absence of an explicit verification\nmechanism during multi-step reasoning. To address this, we propose\n\\textbf{CoRGI}(\\textbf{C}hain \\textbf{o}f \\textbf{R}easoning with\n\\textbf{G}rounded \\textbf{I}nsights), a modular framework that introduces\nvisual verification into the reasoning process. CoRGI follows a three-stage\npipeline: it first generates a textual reasoning chain, then extracts\nsupporting visual evidence for each reasoning step via a dedicated module\n(VEVM), and finally synthesizes the textual rationale with visual evidence to\ngenerate a grounded, verified answer. The framework can be integrated with\nexisting VLMs without end-to-end retraining. We evaluate CoRGI on the VCR\nbenchmark and find that it improves reasoning performance on two representative\nopen-source VLM backbones, Qwen-2.5VL and LLaVA-1.6. Ablation studies confirm\nthe contribution of each step in the verification module, and human evaluations\nsuggest that CoRGI leads to more factual and helpful explanations. We also\nexamine alternative designs for the visual verification step and discuss\npotential limitations of post-hoc verification frameworks. These findings\nhighlight the importance of grounding intermediate reasoning steps in visual\nevidence to enhance the robustness of multimodal reasoning.",

Traditional detection systems typically focus on\nidentifying malicious activity in binary terms (benign or malicious) without\naccounting for the progression of an attack. However, effective response\nstrategies depend on accurate inference of the attack's current stage, as\ncountermeasures must be tailored to whether an adversary is in the early\nreconnaissance phase or actively conducting exploitation or exfiltration. This\nwork addresses the problem of attack stage inference under uncertainty, with a\nfocus on robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs.

Preliminary experiments in a\nsimulated environment demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately infer\nthe stage of an attack with calibrated confidence while effectively detecting\nOOD inputs, which may indicate changes in the attackers' tactics.

In this\npaper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment\neffectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level\nvision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to\ndifferentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical\nstructure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling\nmethod to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging\nVQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This\nprocess amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in\nabnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of\nabnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures\nthe diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate\nalignment with the diagnostic report.

However, the generalization-based methods do not\ngeneralize well on views that were unseen during training, while the\nreconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the\nlimited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel\nneural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume\nrendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.\nFirstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the\nneural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by\ninsufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and\nsmoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an\nuncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in\nareas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry\ndetails for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce\nhigh-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with\nsmall overlapping views.

This paper proposes a\nnovel time optimization policy (TOP), to train a standing manipulation control\nmodel that ensures balance, precision, and time efficiency simultaneously, with\nthe idea of adjusting the time trajectory of upper-body motions but not only\nstrengthening the disturbance resistance of the lower-body.

This paper proposes a novel framework called Boundary-based\nOut-Of-Distribution data generation (BOOD), which synthesizes high-quality OOD\nfeatures and generates human-compatible outlier images using diffusion models.\nBOOD first learns a text-conditioned latent feature space from the ID dataset,\nselects ID features closest to the decision boundary, and perturbs them to\ncross the decision boundary to form OOD features. These synthetic OOD features\nare then decoded into images in pixel space by a diffusion model. Compared to\nprevious works, BOOD provides a more training efficient strategy for\nsynthesizing informative OOD features, facilitating clearer distinctions\nbetween ID and OOD data. Extensive experimental results on common benchmarks\ndemonstrate that BOOD surpasses the state-of-the-art method significantly,\nachieving a 29.64% decrease in average FPR95 (40.31% vs. 10.67%) and a 7.27%\nimprovement in average AUROC (90.15% vs. 97.42%) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.",

    "abstract": "Popular matchings provide a model of matching under preferences in which a\nsolution corresponds to a Condorcet winner in voting systems. In a bipartite\ngraph in which the vertices have preferences over their neighbours, a matching\nis defined to be popular if it does not lose in a majority vote against any\nmatching. In this paper, we study the following three primary problems: only\nthe vertices on one side have preferences; a generalization of this problem\nallowing ties in the preferences; and the vertices on both sides have\npreferences. A principal issue in the algorithmic aspects of popular matchings\nis how to determine the popularity of a matching, because it requires\nexponential time if the definition is simply applied. In the literature, we\nhave the following two types of characterizations: a graph-structural\ncharacterization; and an optimization-based characterization described by\nmaximum-weight matchings. The graph-structural characterizations are\nspecifically designed for each problem and provide a combinatorial structure of\nthe popular matchings. The optimization-based characterizations work in the\nsame manner for all problems, while they do not reveal the structure of the\npopular matchings. A main contribution of this paper is to provide a direct\nconnection of the above two types of characterizations for all of the three\nproblems. Specifically, we prove that each characterization can be derived from\nthe other, without relying on the fact that they characterize popular\nmatchings. Our proofs offer a comprehensive understanding of the equivalence of\nthe two types of characterizations, and suggest a new interpretation of the\ngraph-structural characterization in terms of the dual optimal solution for the\nmaximum-weight matching problem.",

Of particular interest are phase-change oxides,\nwhich allow for control over the metal-to-insulator transition. Here, we report\nX-ray nano-diffraction structural imaging of micro-devices fabricated with the\narchetypal phase-change material vanadium sesquioxide (V$_2$O$_3$). The devices\ncontain a Ga ion-irradiated region where the metal-to-insulator transition\ncritical temperature is lowered, a useful feature for controlling neuron-like\nspiking behavior. Results show that strain, induced by crystal lattice mismatch\nbetween the pristine and irradiated material, leads to a suppression of the\nmetal-to-insulator-transition. Suppression occurs within the irradiated region\nor along its edges, depending on the defect-distribution and the size of the\nregion. The observed self-straining effect could extend to other phase-change\noxides and dominate as device dimensions are reduced and become too small to\ndissipate strain within the irradiated region.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in tackling\nagent-oriented tasks. Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges\nwhen deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent\nparadigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate\naction execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring\nlong-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner\nand executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in\nagent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised\nfine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion\ntrajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted\nwith novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an\nadaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize\nhigh-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon\ndecision-making. Based on the proposed paradigm, we further put forward\nPilotRL, a global planning-guided training framework for LLM agents driven by\nprogressive reinforcement learning. We first develop the model's ability to\nfollow explicit guidance from global plans when addressing agent tasks.\nSubsequently, based on this foundation, we focus on optimizing the quality of\ngenerated plans. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's planning\nand execution coordination.

While offering\nflexible connectivity and intelligent applications across various domains, IoT\nservice providers must gather vast amounts of sensitive data from users, which\nnonetheless concomitantly raises concerns about privacy breaches. Federated\nlearning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized training paradigm to\ntackle this challenge. This work focuses on enhancing the aggregation\nefficiency of distributed local models by introducing over-the-air computation\ninto the FL framework. Due to radio resource scarcity in large-scale networks,\nonly a subset of users can participate in each training round. This highlights\nthe need for effective user scheduling and model transmission strategies to\noptimize communication efficiency and inference accuracy. To address this, we\npropose an integrated approach to user scheduling and receive beam steering,\nsubject to constraints on the number of selected users and transmit power.\nLeveraging the difference-of-convex technique, we decompose the primal\nnon-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems, yielding an iterative\nsolution. While effective, the computational load of the iterative method\nhampers its practical implementation. To overcome this, we further propose a\nlow-complexity user scheduling policy based on characteristic analysis of the\nwireless channel to directly determine the user subset without iteration.\nExtensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms\nof aggregation error and learning performance over existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;\nhowever, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain\nshift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA\nachieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various\nunlabeled ratios in the target domain data.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of visual sensors in smart home environments, particularly\nthrough wearable devices like smart glasses, introduces profound privacy\nchallenges. Existing privacy controls are often static and coarse-grained,\nfailing to accommodate the dynamic and socially nuanced nature of home\nenvironments. This paper investigates the viability of using Large Language\nModels (LLMs) as the core of a dynamic and adaptive privacy policy engine. We\npropose a conceptual framework where visual data is classified using a\nmulti-dimensional schema that considers data sensitivity, spatial context, and\nsocial presence. An LLM then reasons over this contextual information to\nenforce fine-grained privacy rules, such as selective object obfuscation, in\nreal-time. Through a comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art Vision Language\nModels (including GPT-4o and the Qwen-VL series) in simulated home settings ,\nour findings show the feasibility of this approach. The LLM-based engine\nachieved a top machine-evaluated appropriateness score of 3.99 out of 5, and\nthe policies generated by the models received a top human-evaluated score of\n4.00 out of 5.",

    "abstract": "Non-Markovian effects are often significant when the system-environment\ncoupling is not weak. Indeed, we find the non-Markovianity to be negligible for\na single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing via interaction with a\nharmonic oscillator environment. In this paper, we examine a natural extension,\nnamely a pure dephasing model where a collection of two-level systems interacts\nwith a common environment. We obtain analytically the dynamics of the\ncollection of the two-level systems, and then take a partial trace over all the\ntwo-level systems except one. This remaining single two-level system is shown\nto display markedly non-Markovian dynamics, even in the weak system-environment\ncoupling regime. This is due to the indirect interaction between two-level\nsystems induced by their interaction with the common environment. In fact, this\nindirect interaction can not only increase the non-Markovianity by orders of\nmagnitude, but also display qualitatively different characteristics. For\ninstance, for a single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing, the dynamics\nare Markovian for Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments. This is markedly not the\ncase when we consider multiple two-level systems. We also show that the\nnon-Markovianity increases as we increase the number of two-level systems.\nThese findings provide insights into controlling decoherence in multi-qubit\nquantum systems and have implications for quantum technologies where\nnon-Markovianity can be a resource rather than a limitation.",

    "abstract": "Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the\npre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image\ngeneration. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent\ntrade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject\nfidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text\neditability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free\nguidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output\ntoward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target\ndistribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these\nlimitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method\nleveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,\nour method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model\nthrough weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during\ninference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance\nscales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space\nwithout additional computational overhead.

    "abstract": "We introduce a U-net model for 360{\\deg} acoustic source localization\nformulated as a spherical semantic segmentation task. Rather than regressing\ndiscrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio\nmaps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using\ndelay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate\nsignals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A\nmodified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps,\nlearns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class\nimbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed\nenergy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to\ndifferent microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The\nsegmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated\nregions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world\nopen-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360{\\deg} video\nand flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show\nthat U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular\nprecision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond\ntraditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the role of isospin asymmetry of the $NN$ effective\ninteraction in the context of $NA$ elastic scattering. To this purpose we\nrepresent the {\\it in-medium} $g$ matrix as an admixture of isospin-symmetric\nnuclear matter and pure neutron matter solutions of Brueckner-Hartree-Fock\nequations for infinite nuclear matter, denoted as $g[\\rho,\\beta]$. We use the\nArgonne $v_{18}$ bare potential to represent the $NN$ interaction in free\nspace, due to its ability to describe the $NN$ scattering amplitudes up to 350\nMeV. The density-dependent isospin-asymmetric $g$ matrices are then used to\ncalculate optical model potentials for elastic nucleon scattering off\nclosed-shell nuclei. For this aim, we make use of the Arellano-Bauge $\\delta\ng$-folding approach suited for an explicit treatment of nonlocal density\nmatrices. This approach allows to account for the local isospin-asymmetry and\ndensity dependence of the {\\it in-medium} $NN$ interaction. The resulting\noptical potentials are nonlocal since the entire nonlocal structure of the $g$\nmatrix is retained. We observe that including the isospin asymmetry in the $g$\nmatrix allows for a reasonable description of differential cross-sections at\nnucleon beam energies between 40 and 200 MeV. In the case of proton scattering\nat energies below $\\sim$65 MeV, at momentum transfers $q$ below $\\sim$1\nfm$^{-1}$, the inclusion of neutronic-matter $g$ matrices yields better\nagreement with the data as compared to the case when symmetric nuclear matter\n$g$ matrices are used. These results provide evidence that the\nisospin-asymmetry in the $NN$ effective interaction yield non-negligible\neffects in nucleon scattering off isospin-asymmetric targets at beam energies\nbelow 65 MeV.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying the entangling capability of quantum operations is a fundamental\ntask in quantum information science. Traditionally, this capability is measured\nby the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated\nwhen a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states.\nHowever, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of\nentanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric --\nentangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement\ngenerated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted\nnature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework\nthat yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis reveals a\nfundamental and previously unexplored physics: enhancing entangling capability\ninevitably increases sensitivity, or bias, toward specific input states. By\nanalyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical\nEP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of\nentanglement generation can significantly differ depending on physical\nimplementation. Extending our framework to a class of generalized\ncontrolled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary\ndimensions, we (re)affirm the inherent trade-off between the entangling\nstrength and uniformity. Moreover, we uncover a subtle\ndimension-parity-dependent behavior in entanglement generation, which EP alone\nfails to detect. These findings highlight EPD as an indispensable diagnostic\ntool -- one that, alongside EP, provides a deeper and more complete\ncharacterization of the entangling structure.",

The HHG\naccompanying this process should contain information on the nonequilibrium\nelectronic-state dynamics along the oscillating field - an aspect that remains\nunresolved to date. Here, we show that an intense mid-infrared (MIR) pulse\ninduces a Mott insulator-metal transition in a one-dimensional cuprate,\nSr2CuO3, the evolution of which is reflected by the spectral features of HHs.\nWhen the electric-field amplitude exceeds 6 MV/cm, carriers are efficiently\ngenerated and each harmonic frequency decreases from odd multiples of the MIR\nfrequency. Dynamical mean-field theory indicates that these redshifts originate\nfrom a series of electronic-structure reconstructions in each electric-field\ncycle during the melting of the Mott-insulator state, which modifies the\nradiation phase from carrier recombination cycle-by-cycle.

    "abstract": "The human ability to learn rules and solve problems has been a central\nconcern of cognitive science research since the field's earliest days. But we\ndo not just follow rules and solve problems given to us by others: we modify\nthose rules, create new problems, and set new goals and tasks for ourselves and\nothers. Arguably, even more than rule following and problem solving, human\nintelligence is about creatively breaking and stretching the rules, changing\nthe game, and inventing new problems worth thinking about. Creating a good rule\nor a good problem depends not just on the ideas one can think up but on how one\nevaluates such proposals. Here, we study invention through the lens of game\ndesign. We focus particularly on the early stages of novice, \"everyday\" game\ncreation, where the stakes are low. We draw on a dataset of over 450 human\ncreated games, created by participants who saw an initial seed set of\ntwo-player grid-based strategy games. We consider two different cognitive\nmechanisms that may be at work during the early processes of intuitive game\ninvention: an associative proposal based on previous games one has seen and\ncompute-bounded model-based evaluation that an everyday game creator may use to\nrefine their initial draft proposals. In our preliminary work, we conduct a\nmodel-based analysis of how people invented new games based on prior experience\nand find that generated games are best described by a model which incorporates\nmodel-based estimates of game quality at a population level. Our work points to\nhow human invention is based not only on what people propose, but how they\nevaluate and offers a computational toolkit to scale empirical studies of\nmodel-based simulation in open-ended human innovation.",

Compared to traditional\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs transmit information through discrete\nspike signals, which substantially reduces computational energy consumption\nthrough their sparse encoding approach. However, the multi-timestep computation\nmodel significantly increases inference latency and energy, limiting the\napplicability of SNNs in edge computing scenarios. We propose a single-timestep\nSNN, which enhances accuracy and reduces computational energy consumption in a\nsingle timestep by optimizing spike generation and temporal parameters.

Active cyber deception is a\npromising strategy to thwart RW and limiting its propagation by misleading it\nwith false information and revealing its true behaviors. Furthermore, RW often\nacts as a communication conduit between attackers and defenders, allowing\ndeception to return false data to attackers and deplete their resources. This\npaper introduces ranDecepter, a novel approach that combines active cyber\ndeception with real-time analysis to enhance defenses against RW attacks. The\nranDecepter identifies RW in real-time and isolates it within a deceptive\nenvironment, autonomously identifying critical elements in the RW code to\ncreate a loop mechanism. By repeatedly restarting the malware and transmitting\ncounterfeit encryption information and secret keys to the attacker, it forces\nthe attacker to store these fabricated details for each victim, thereby\ndepleting their resources. Our comprehensive evaluation of ranDecepter,\nconducted using 1,134 real-world malware samples and twelve benign\napplications, demonstrates a remarkable 100% accuracy in RW identification,\nwith no false positives and minimal impact on response times.

To resolve these issues, we apply a combination of hybrid\nHeyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, many-body\nperturbation theory (MBPT) via quasiparticle $G_0W_0$, and DFT+$U$,\nsignificantly improving the accuracy of the band structure over previous\nstudies. A Bayesian optimization framework is used to refine key parameters,\nincluding the inverse screening length ($\\mu$) and Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange\nfraction ($\\alpha$) in HSE-based XC functionals, as well as the Hubbard $U$\nparameters in DFT+$U$, leading to significantly improved band structure\npredictions.

    "abstract": "This study presents a methodology to treat performance-based seismic design\nas an inverse engineering problem, where design parameters are directly derived\nto achieve specific performance objectives. By implementing explainable machine\nlearning models, this methodology directly maps design variables and\nperformance metrics, tackling computational inefficiencies of performance-based\ndesign. The resultant machine learning model is integrated as an evaluation\nfunction into a genetic optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem.\nThe developed methodology is then applied to two different inventories of steel\nand concrete moment frames in Los Angeles and Charleston to obtain sectional\nproperties of frame members that minimize expected annualized seismic loss in\nterms of repair costs. The results show high accuracy of the surrogate models\n(e.g., R2> 90%) across a diverse set of building types, geometries, seismic\ndesign, and site hazard, where the optimization algorithm could identify the\noptimum values of members' properties for a fixed set of geometric variables,\nconsistent with engineering principles.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge\ncomputing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train\nartificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome\nthe communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,\ndecentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)\ncommunication, has been extensively explored in the research community.\nAlthough researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model\nconvergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost\nalong with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These\ncosts are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each\ntraining round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.\nFurthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments\naffects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity\ndegrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the\ndesign of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose\nHat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated\nlearning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated\nas a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the\ngoal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy\nconsumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a\ntwo-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication\ntopologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance\nand energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware\nmodel aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data\nheterogeneity.",

However, their diagnostic\nreliability in complex clinical scenarios remains limited. This study aims to\nenhance LLMs' diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning ability. Method: We\npropose an Etiology-Aware Attention Steering Framework to integrate structured\nclinical reasoning into LLM-based diagnosis. Specifically, we first construct\nClinical Reasoning Scaffolding (CRS) based on authoritative clinical guidelines\nfor three representative acute abdominal emergencies: acute appendicitis, acute\npancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis. Next, we develop the Etiology-Aware Head\nIdentification algorithm to pinpoint attention heads crucial for the model's\netiology reasoning. To ensure reliable clinical reasoning alignment, we\nintroduce the Reasoning-Guided Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning that embeds\netiological reasoning cues into input representations and steers the selected\nEtiology-Aware Heads toward critical information through a Reasoning-Guided\nLoss function. Result: On the Consistent Diagnosis Cohort, our framework\nimproves average diagnostic accuracy by 15.65% and boosts the average Reasoning\nFocus Score by 31.6% over baselines. External validation on the Discrepant\nDiagnosis Cohort further confirms its effectiveness in enhancing diagnostic\naccuracy.

More\ninterestingly, the X-ray afterglow light curve is composed of a plateau\nemission smoothly connected with a $\\sim t^{-2}$ segment overlapping some\nflares followed by an extremely steep decay. By analysing the light curves of\nboth prompt emission and X-ray afterglow, no high-confidence-level\nquasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are found in the light curves of the\nprompt emission (e.g., BAT and GBM), but it is found that a QPO signal at\n$\\sim$ 50 s above 6$\\sigma$ confidence level indeed exist in the X-ray\nafterglow. Here, we propose that a supra-massive magnetar as the central engine\nof GRB 220711B with precession motion is a good interpretation of the features\nof the X-ray emission. The initial plateau emission and followed decay segment,\nas well as the extremely steep-decay segment, are consistent with the physical\nprocess of supra-massive magnetar spin-down and then collapse into black hole.\nMoreover, the QPO signal in the X-ray emission can be explained as an effect of\nthe precession motion of the magnetar. If this is the case, one can derive\nvarious magnetar parameters such as the initial period ($P_{{\\rm{0}}}$) and\nsurface magnetic field strength ($B_{{\\rm{p}}}$) within a pseudo-redshift range\nof [1.08, 4.27].

    "abstract": "Learning-based approaches, notably Reinforcement Learning (RL), have shown\npromise for solving optimal control tasks without explicit system models.\nHowever, these approaches are often sample-inefficient, sensitive to reward\ndesign and hyperparameters, and prone to poor generalization, especially under\ninput constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce the neural\nco-state projection regulator (NCPR), a model-free learning-based optimal\ncontrol framework that is grounded in Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) and\ncapable of solving quadratic regulator problems in nonlinear control-affine\nsystems with input constraints. In this framework, a neural network (NN) is\ntrained in a self-supervised setting to take the current state of the system as\ninput and predict a finite-horizon trajectory of projected co-states (i.e., the\nco-state weighted by the system's input gain). Subsequently, only the first\nelement of the NN's prediction is extracted to solve a lightweight quadratic\nprogram (QP). This workflow is executed in a feedback control setting, allowing\nreal-time computation of control actions that satisfy both input constraints\nand first-order optimality conditions.\n  We test the proposed learning-based model-free quadratic regulator on (1) a\nunicycle model robot reference tracking problem and (2) a pendulum swing-up\ntask. For comparison, reinforcement learning is used on both tasks; and for\ncontext, a model-based controller is used in the unicycle model example.

Such a low-frequency QPO likely signals the precession of\na relativistic jet launched from a GRB hyper-accreting black hole central\nengine. The energy injection signature from the \\textbf{late} X-ray\nobservations (from $5\\times 10^2s\\sim 1\\times10^4s$) is consistent with the\nprecession hypothesis. The prompt $\\gamma$-ray light curve does not show any\nQPO signature, suggesting that the X-ray flaring emission in the early\nafterglow phase and prompt emission likely originate from different accretion\nprocessess, indicating that the progenitor stars of GRBs have a core-envelope\nstructure with a stratified angular momentum distribution and the late-time\naccretion disk likely has a misalignment with respect to the rotation axis of\nthe black hole. Such a misalignment is not expected in a canonical collapsar\nmodel. As a result, the QPO signature in GRB 220711B may reveal a new formation\nchannel of long GRBs, possibly a stellar-merger-induced core collapse, with the\norbital angular momentum of the binary misaligned with the spin axis of the\ncollapsing star.",

In this paper, we propose a factor-augmented quantile\nregression (FAQR) framework to address these challenges simultaneously within a\nunified framework. The proposed FAQR combines the robustness of quantile\nregression and the ability of factor analysis to effectively capture\ndependencies among high-dimensional covariates, and also provides a framework\nto capture dense effects (through common factors) and sparse effects (through\nidiosyncratic components) of the covariates. To overcome the lack of smoothness\nof the quantile loss function, convolution smoothing is introduced, which not\nonly improves computational efficiency but also eases theoretical derivation.\nTheoretical analysis establishes the accuracy of factor selection and\nconsistency in parameter estimation under mild regularity conditions.\nFurthermore, we develop a Bootstrap-based diagnostic procedure to assess the\nadequacy of the factor model. Simulation experiments verify the rationality of\nFAQR in different noise scenarios such as normal and $t_2$ distributions.",

    "abstract": "Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a basic technology in\nintelligent wireless communication systems. It is important for tasks such as\nspectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent\nyears, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC. However,\nmainstream methods still face two key problems. First, they often use\ntime-frequency images instead of raw signals. This causes loss of key\nmodulation features and reduces adaptability to different communication\nconditions. Second, most methods rely on supervised learning. This needs a\nlarge amount of labeled data, which is hard to get in real-world environments.\nTo solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called\nRIS-MAE. RIS-MAE uses masked autoencoders to learn signal features from\nunlabeled data. It takes raw IQ sequences as input. By applying random masking\nand reconstruction, it captures important time-domain features such as\namplitude, phase, etc. This helps the model learn useful and transferable\nrepresentations. RIS-MAE is tested on four datasets. The results show that it\nperforms better than existing methods in few-shot and cross-domain tasks.\nNotably, it achieves high classification accuracy on previously unseen datasets\nwith only a small number of fine-tuning samples, confirming its generalization\nability and potential for real-world deployment.",

The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems\nfrom the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog\nrepresentations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring\nrobustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized\n(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image\ntransmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding\n(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic\nfeature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete\nlatent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission\ninstead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we\ndevelop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically\noptimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during\ntraining process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a\nuniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to\nstabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook\nupdates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase\nshift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard.

Therefore, this paper\ninvestigates this fundamental channel estimation problem for FIM assisted\nmillimeter-wave communication systems. First, we develop model-based frameworks\nthat structure the problem as either function approximation using interpolation\nand kernel methods or as a sparse signal recovery problem that leverages the\ninherent angular sparsity of millimeter-wave channels. To further advance the\nestimation capability beyond explicit assumptions in model-based channel\nestimation frameworks, we propose a deep learning-based framework using a\nFourier neural operator (FNO). By parameterizing a global convolution operator\nin the Fourier domain, we design an efficient FNO architecture to learn the\ncontinuous operator that maps FIM shapes to channel responses with\nmesh-independent properties. Furthermore, we exploit a hierarchical FNO (H-FNO)\narchitecture to efficiently capture the multi-scale features across a hierarchy\nof spatial resolutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed H-FNO\nsignificantly outperforms the model-based benchmarks in estimation accuracy and\npilot efficiency. In particular, the interpretability analysis show that the\nproposed H-FNO learns an anisotropic spatial filter adapted to the physical\ngeometry of FIM and is capable of accurately reconstructing the non-linear\nchannel response across the continuous deformation space.",

However,\nsettings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in\nparticular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to\nstem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship\nwith the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and\nexperimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory\nfootprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss\nsetting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory\nconsumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing\nsolutions for non-smoothed losses.",

However,\ntraditional methods of comprehensively verifying quantum devices, such as\nquantum process tomography, face significant limitations because of the\nexponential growth in computational resources. These limitations arise from\ntreating the system as a black box and ignoring its design structure.\nConsequently, new testing methods must be developed considering the design\nstructure. In this paper, we investigate the structure of computations on the\nhardware, focusing on the layered interruptible quantum circuit model and\ndesigning a scalable algorithm to verify it comprehensively. Specifically, for\na given quantum hardware that claims to process an unknown $n$ qubit $d$ layer\ncircuit via a finite set of quantum gates, our method completely reconstructs\nthe circuits within a time complexity of $O(d^2 t \\log (n/\\delta))$,\nguaranteeing success with a probability of at least $1-\\delta$. Here, $t$\nrepresents the maximum execution time for each circuit layer.

Specifically, we explore structural dynamics by incorporating\ngraph-theoretic metrics--namely, the number of connected components--to\nquantify changes in prey school organization. Two quantitative indicators,\nfirst split time and final component count, are introduced to assess the timing\nand extent of group disintegration. Sensitivity analyses are performed on key\nparameters to evaluate their influence on group stability under nearest attack\nand center attack strategies. We independently examine the effect of\nenvironmental noise on fish school cohesion. Simulation results show that\nparameter changes impact fish school fragmentation differently under the two\npredation strategies. High environmental noise also makes it difficult for the\nschool to stay cohesive. This framework provides a structured and quantitative\nbasis for assessing how fish schools respond to different predation strategies\nand environmental noise levels.",

    "abstract": "Any population of artificial radio broadcasts in a galaxy contributes to its\nintegrated radio luminosity. If this radio emission is bright enough, inhabited\ngalaxies themselves form a cosmic population of artificial radio galaxies. We\ncan detect these broadcasts individually or set constraints from their\ncollective emission. Using the formalism in Paper I and II, I set bounds on the\nartificial radio galaxy population using both of these methodologies. Measured\nradio source counts set limits on radio broadcasts across the radio spectrum,\nincluding the first Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) constraints\nat ~250 GHz. I compare these with commensal limits from background galaxies in\nthe fields of large SETI surveys. The field limits are more powerful, but\ngenerally only over a limited luminosity range and for frequencies with\ndedicated SETI surveys. The limits are weaker when broadcasts clump into\ndiscrete hosts that are themselves extremely rare. I find that the abundance of\nKardashev Type III radio broadcast populations is less than one in 10^17 stars,\nabout one in a million large galaxies. I also examine limits for a power-law\ndistribution in broadcast luminosity.",

    "abstract": "Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution\nof low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail\ninformation. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in\ndealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global\ncontextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global\ndependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are\nquadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution\ndepth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba\n(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core\ninnovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling\ncapabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color\nimage. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and\nthe Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature\nextraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of\nthe state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the\nmodel adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the\nhigh-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the\nsuper-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream\nmethods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model\nparameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness\nof the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task\nof large-scale depth map super-resolution.",

These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question.

This work uses Jones calculus and vector\nfield simulations, including interactions with dielectric surfaces to show that\nthe secondary polarization is fully coherent with the input field, but it does\nnot interfere with it due to orthogonality. A key consequence of the coherence\nsecondary polarization is that the process of creating a dark hole in the\nprimary polarization tends to also significantly mitigate the intensity\ncorresponding to the secondary polarization, called the \\emph{secondary\nintensity}, in the dark hole region. This reduction of the secondary intensity\nmay lead to relaxed polarization design requirements in future coronagraphs.\nAdditionally, if the contrast is sufficient to make the secondary intensity\nnon-negligible, modulation schemes to separate the planet from the instrumental\nlight need to account for the modulation of the secondary intensity.",

Therefore, we\nproposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates\nvesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in\ntime-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA\ndetection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to\nderive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention\nblock to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary\nbranch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth\nsegmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same\ndatabase. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it\nexternally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm\nsegmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate =\n1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,\nleading to a significant increase in user demand for LLM services. However,\ncloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable\nresponsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually\ndeployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data\nprivacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications.\nGiven the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical\nissue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an\nappropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable\nquality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously\naddress the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and\nthe dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet\nthese challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM\nservices. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic\nstate abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a\nheterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an\naction impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent\nin maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on\nboth Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm\nsignificantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared\nto existing baselines.",

Research suggests that correcting partisan\nmisperceptions by informing people about the actual views of outparty members\nmay reduce one's own expressed support for political extremism, including\npartisan violence and anti-democratic actions. The present study investigated\nhow correction effects depend on different representations of outparty views\ncommunicated through data visualizations. We conducted an experiment with U.S.\nbased participants from Prolific (N=239 Democrats, N=244 Republicans).\nParticipants made predictions about support for political violence and\nundemocratic practices among members of their political outparty. They were\nthen presented with data from an earlier survey on the actual views of outparty\nmembers. Some participants viewed only the average response (Mean-Only\ncondition), while other groups were shown visual representations of the range\nof views from 75% of the outparty (Mean+Interval condition) or the full\ndistribution of responses (Mean+Points condition). Compared to a control group\nthat was not informed about outparty views, we observed the strongest\ncorrection effects among participants in the Mean-only and Mean+Points\ncondition, while correction effects were weaker in the Mean+Interval condition.\nIn addition, participants who observed the full distribution of out-party views\n(Mean+Points condition) were most accurate at later recalling the degree of\nsupport among the outparty.

This paper presents recent developments of our Monte Carlo simulation,\nMAGTHOMSCATT, which tracks the complex electric field vector for each photon\nduring its transport. Our analysis encompasses the anisotropy and polarization\ncharacteristics of X-ray emission for field strengths ranging from non-magnetic\nto extremely magnetized regimes that are germane to magnetars. In the very low\nfield domain, we reproduced the numerical solution to the radiative transfer\nequation for non-magnetic Thomson scattering, and provided analytical fits for\nthe angular dependence of the intensity and the polarization degree. These fits\ncan be useful for studies of millisecond pulsars and magnetic white dwarfs. By\nimplementing a refined injection protocol, we show that, in the magnetar\nregime, the simulated intensity and polarization pulse profiles of emission\nfrom extended surface regions becomes invariant with respect to the ratio of\nphoton ($\\omega$) and electron cyclotron ($\\omega_{\\rm B}$) frequencies once\n$\\omega / \\omega_{\\rm B} \\lesssim 0.01$.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a new generation of the Keynesian Intertemporal Synthesis\n(KIS) Model, a macroeconomic framework designed to reconcile the empirical\nstrengths of the Post-Keynesian (PK) and New Keynesian (NK) traditions. The\ncentral innovation of this work is the abandonment of the traditional\nCobb-Douglas production function in favor of a Constant Elasticity of\nSubstitution (CES) specification. This modification is directly motivated by\nthe compelling evidence from the meta-analysis by Gechert et al. (2021), which\nemphatically rejects the hypothesis of a unit elasticity of substitution\nbetween capital and labor. We integrate this finding with the conclusions from\na wide range of meta-analyses on the state-dependent heterogeneity of fiscal\nmultipliers (Gechert and Rannenberg, 2018), the productivity of public capital\n(Bom and Ligthart, 2014), the effectiveness hierarchy of spending instruments\n(Gechert, 2015), and the empirical failure of Ricardian Equivalence (Stanley,\n1998). The resulting KIS-CES model, while based on intertemporal optimization,\nincorporates household heterogeneity, non-standard preferences that value\nwealth and penalize debt, and a monetary policy constrained by the zero lower\nbound. The mathematical derivations reveal that the elasticity of substitution,\ncalibrated to an empirically plausible value of $\\sigma < 1$, becomes a key\nparameter that modulates income distribution and magnifies the crowding-in\neffect of public investment. The model generates an endogenous MPC, a nonlinear\nfiscal multiplier that increases dramatically in crises, and a multiplier for\npublic investment that is structurally higher than that for consumption, thus\noffering a unified, rigorous, and, above all, empirically disciplined\ntheoretical framework.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new formulation of structural causal models for extremes,\ncalled the extremal structural causal model (eSCM). Unlike conventional\nstructural causal models, where randomness is governed by a probability\ndistribution, eSCMs use an exponent measure--an infinite-mass law that\nnaturally arises in the analysis of multivariate extremes. Central to this\nframework are activation variables, which abstract the single-big-jump\nprinciple, along with additional randomization that enriches the class of eSCM\nlaws. This formulation encompasses all possible laws of directed graphical\nmodels under the recently introduced notion of extremal conditional\nindependence. We also identify an inherent asymmetry in eSCMs under natural\nassumptions, enabling the identifiability of causal directions, a central\nchallenge in causal inference. Finally, we propose a method that utilizes this\ncausal asymmetry and demonstrate its effectiveness in both simulated and real\ndatasets.",
