ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities,\nis regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging\napplications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate\nboth sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified\nplatform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate\nfrequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However,\nintegrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly\noptimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant\ncomputational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or\noptimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques,\nDL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced\ncomputational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating\nunder limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time\nsystems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal\nsolutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including\nwaveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data\ndemodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these\nadvantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC\nsystem design.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in\nenergy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high\ninference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse\nevent-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in\nthe brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing.\nIntegrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced\ncapabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs.\nThis work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here,\nwe revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and\npropose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize\ncomputational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning\ntechnique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively\nlowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning\nminimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps\nrequired for different layers. By combining these approaches with other\ncompression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs\nto jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and\nknowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our\nproposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark\ndemonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations\nand inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time,\nlow-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more\npractical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.",

The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be\nreduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of\nview, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect\nTLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of\nsatisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational\ncomplexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are\nexpressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language\nsatisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately.\nHence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational\ncomplexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs'\nability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs,\nwe conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability\nproblems.",

    "abstract": "Punishment as a mechanism for promoting cooperation has been studied\nextensively for more than two decades, but its effectiveness remains a matter\nof dispute. Here, we examine how punishment's impact varies across cooperative\nsettings through a large-scale integrative experiment. We vary 14 parameters\nthat characterize public goods games, sampling 360 experimental conditions and\ncollecting 147,618 decisions from 7,100 participants. Our results reveal\nstriking heterogeneity in punishment effectiveness: while punishment\nconsistently increases contributions, its impact on payoffs (i.e., efficiency)\nranges from dramatically enhancing welfare (up to 43% improvement) to severely\nundermining it (up to 44% reduction) depending on the cooperative context. To\ncharacterize these patterns, we developed models that outperformed human\nforecasters (laypeople and domain experts) in predicting punishment outcomes in\nnew experiments. Communication emerged as the most predictive feature, followed\nby contribution framing (opt-out vs. opt-in), contribution type (variable vs.\nall-or-nothing), game length (number of rounds), peer outcome visibility\n(whether participants can see others' earnings), and the availability of a\nreward mechanism. Interestingly, however, most of these features interact to\ninfluence punishment effectiveness rather than operating independently. For\nexample, the extent to which longer games increase the effectiveness of\npunishment depends on whether groups can communicate. Together, our results\nrefocus the debate over punishment from whether or not it \"works\" to the\nspecific conditions under which it does and does not work. More broadly, our\nstudy demonstrates how integrative experiments can be combined with machine\nlearning to uncover generalizable patterns, potentially involving interactions\nbetween multiple features, and help generate novel explanations in complex\nsocial phenomena.",

Two themes\nare examined. First, we show that the stress-tensor sector of boundary\ncorrelators encodes information about black hole singularities. By resumming\ncontributions from the stress-tensor and its composites, we uncover\nbranch-point singularities in complex time, corresponding to bulk geodesics\nthat cross the horizon, reflect off the singularity, and return to the\nboundary. We further clarify the role of double-trace operators in restoring\nanalyticity and the KMS condition, and establish a map between bulk geodesics\nand OPE sectors of the thermal correlator. Second, we study thermal\nstress-tensor correlators in CFTs with pure gravity duals. Through holographic\ncalculations in Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we identify a robust\nuniversal behaviour - near the lightcone the correlators are described by three\nuniversal functions. The bulk Lagrangian only affects the arguments of these\nfunctions through corrections to the cubic stress-tensor couplings and the\nthermal stress-tensor one-point function. We relate this behaviour to causality\nconstraints such as the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), showing that\nANEC saturation makes the correlator temperature-independent. Overall, our\nresults demonstrate that thermal correlators - especially their stress-tensor\nsector - serve as sensitive probes of black hole interiors, causality, and\nuniversality in holographic CFTs.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive analytical formulation for deriving a\nclosed-form optimal strategy for agents operating within a social network,\nmodeled through a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE). Each\nagent aims to minimize a personal dynamic cost functional that accounts for\ndeviations from the collective opinions of others, their own past beliefs, and\nis influenced by randomness and inherent opinion rigidity, often described as\nstubbornness. To tackle this, we develop a novel methodology rooted in a\nFeynman-type path integral framework, incorporating a specially designed\nintegrating factor to obtain explicit feedback control laws. This approach\nprovides a tractable and insightful solution to the control problem in a\nsetting shaped by both memory and noise. As part of our analysis, we adopt a\nmodified form of the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model to more accurately\ncapture the influence of prior beliefs and social interactions, enabling the\nexplicit derivation of the optimal strategy. Comparative simulations further\nillustrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our method across different\nnetwork structures, highlighting its potential relevance to understanding\nopinion evolution and influence strategies in complex social systems.",

This also\nenables L-free inference via offline caches. (2) Multi-scale quantization:\nattention heads are partitioned into groups, each with its own small codebook,\nwhich reduces quantization error while keeping cache size fixed.

Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of\nlandfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous\nharm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in\nidentifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.\nDespite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for\nillegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns.

As we trained\nseveral models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be\nprone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.\nTherefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general\nfeatures from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,\nMobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and\nvalidate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less\noverfitting.

    "abstract": "Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful technique for reconstructing\nhigh-resolution material parameters from seismic or ultrasound data. The\nconventional least-squares (\\(L^{2}\\)) misfit suffers from pronounced\nnon-convexity that leads to \\emph{cycle skipping}. Optimal-transport misfits,\nsuch as the Wasserstein distance, alleviate this issue; however, their use\nrequires artificially converting the wavefields into probability measures, a\npreprocessing step that can modify critical amplitude and phase information of\ntime-dependent wave data. We propose the \\emph{HV metric}, a transport-based\ndistance that acts naturally on signed signals, as an alternative metric for\nthe \\(L^{2}\\) and Wasserstein objectives in time-domain FWI. After reviewing\nthe metric's definition and its relationship to optimal transport, we derive\nclosed-form expressions for the Fr\\'echet derivative and Hessian of the map \\(f\n\\mapsto d_{\\text{HV}}^2(f,g)\\), enabling efficient adjoint-state\nimplementations. A spectral analysis of the Hessian shows that, by tuning the\nhyperparameters \\((\\kappa,\\lambda,\\epsilon)\\), the HV misfit seamlessly\ninterpolates between \\(L^{2}\\), \\(H^{-1}\\), and \\(H^{-2}\\) norms, offering a\ntunable trade-off between the local point-wise matching and the global\ntransport-based matching. Synthetic experiments on the Marmousi and BP\nbenchmark models demonstrate that the HV metric-based objective function yields\nfaster convergence and superior tolerance to poor initial models compared to\nboth \\(L^{2}\\) and Wasserstein misfits.

    "abstract": "Traditional user profiling techniques rely on browsing history or purchase\nrecords to identify users' willingness to pay. This enables sellers to offer\npersonalized prices to profiled users while charging only a uniform price to\nnon-profiled users. However, the emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies\nhas caused users to actively avoid on-site data tracking. Today, major online\nsellers have turned to public platforms such as online social networks to\nbetter track users' profiles from their product-related discussions. This paper\npresents the first analytical study on how users should best manage their\nsocial activities against potential personalized pricing, and how a seller\nshould strategically adjust her pricing scheme to facilitate user profiling in\nsocial networks. We formulate a dynamic Bayesian game played between the seller\nand users under asymmetric information. The key challenge of analyzing this\ngame comes from the double couplings between the seller and the users as well\nas among the users. Furthermore, the equilibrium analysis needs to ensure\nconsistency between users' revealed information and the seller's belief under\nrandom user profiling. We address these challenges by alternately applying\nbackward and forward induction, and successfully characterize the unique\nperfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in closed form. Our analysis reveals that as\nthe accuracy of profiling technology improves, the seller tends to raise the\nequilibrium uniform price to motivate users' increased social activities and\nfacilitate user profiling. However, this results in most users being worse off\nafter the informed consent policy is imposed to ensure users' awareness of data\naccess and profiling practices by potential sellers. This finding suggests that\nrecent regulatory evolution towards enhancing users' privacy awareness may have\nunintended consequences of reducing users' payoffs.",

    "abstract": "The paper thoroughly analyses the significant cracking on the newly\nrefurbished masonry bridge pier in Lovosice. The cracks of width up to 15 mm\nappeared shortly after the reconstruction of the bridge and were the subject of\na detailed assessment. First, a monitoring system was mounted to analyse the\nbehaviour during the year and the dependency on the temperature. Next, a dive\ninspection was done in order to evaluate the conditions under the water. The\nnext step was to make a diagnostics survey, based on the drilling, endoscopic\ntests and water pressure tests. Based on the results, several detailed\nnumerical models were created in order to analyse the pier behaviour and\nconduct a parametric study to investigate various factors, leading to the\ndefects. The numerical models covered the complex geometry of the pier,\nconsisting of the inner poor concrete core and outer shell from sandstone\nmasonry blocks. The above-described procedure revealed the causes of the\ndefects and also recommended the proper strengthening of the pier.",

In this paper,\nwe present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease\nclassification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid\non-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field\ndeployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,\nincluding four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse\nfield conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we\ncombined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and\nmore representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers\nthe best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device\ndiagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,\nand an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we\nfine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,\nEdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning\nand Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to\nSugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and\ncomputation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We\nintegrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based\nexplanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse\nbenchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool\nfor sugarcane disease classification.

In this work, we theoretically investigate a\nflux-tunable electromechanical system consisting of a fluxonium qubit coupled\nto a suspended mechanical resonator. The coupling arises from the\nmotion-induced modulation of magnetic flux through the fluxonium loop, enabling\nboth transverse and longitudinal electromechanical interac- tions that are\ntunable via external magnetic fields. By optimizing the design parameters of\nthe fluxonium qubit, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving strong\nresonant single-photon coupling near the flux-frustration point. We analyze the\nsystem dynamics across different coupling regimes, identifying signatures of\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in the longitudinal regime and\nmode splitting in the transverse regime. Additionally, we show that\nground-state preparation of both subsystems is possible through sideband\ncooling of the mechanical resonator.

In\nparticular, there is a need to understand how systems incorporate human values,\nhow humans can identify these values within systems, and how to minimize the\nrisks of harm or unintended consequences. In this paper, we highlight the need\nto rethink how we frame value alignment and assert that value alignment should\nmove beyond static and singular conceptions of values. We argue that AI systems\nshould implement long-term reasoning and remain adaptable to evolving values.\nFurthermore, value alignment requires more theories to address the full\nspectrum of human values. Since values often vary among individuals or groups,\nmulti-agent systems provide the right framework for navigating pluralism,\nconflict, and inter-agent reasoning about values. We identify the challenges\nassociated with value alignment and indicate directions for advancing value\nalignment research. In addition, we broadly discuss diverse perspectives of\nvalue alignment, from design methodologies to practical applications.",

We analyze publicly available data from the collaboration of the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors, focusing on events with accurate sky\nlocalization using all three detectors. This allows us to separate the circular\npolarization modes and measure their amplitudes. Out of 15 well-localized\nevents, 7 show a dominant right-handed mode and 8 a left-handed one. This small\ndifference is consistent with statistical fluctuations. A Bayesian analysis\nshows that the probability $ p_R $ of a right-handed signal follows a\n$Beta(8,9)$ distribution, with no strong evidence for asymmetry. We also\nestimate how many future events would be needed to detect a small asymmetry\nlike $p_R = 7 / 15$ with high confidence. To reach 2$\\sigma$ or 3$\\sigma$\nsignificance, about 900 to 2000 well-localized events would be required. These\nnumbers could be reached in upcoming observation runs.

    "abstract": "Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to\ngenerate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.\nPrevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with\ndense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain\n(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our\ndesign, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding\nboxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are\nthen passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts\nto generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the\nsystem purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with\nGRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and\npoints (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation\nmodels, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive\nannotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains\nreasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained\nsegmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test\nsets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to\n54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust\ngeneralization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors\ncan be learned via RL from weak spatial cues.

A detailed look at the distribution of 2- and 3-${\\mathrm\n\\mu}$m band depths suggests additional sources of variability, such as\ndifferent water-ice grain sizes. In addition, we report an apparent transition\nin the carbon dioxide band depth at diameters of roughly 300-500 km, with\nlarger objects showing systematically weaker absorptions, although selection\neffects within the sample do not allow us to confidently distinguish between a\nsize-dependent phenomenon and a correlation with dynamical class.

    "abstract": "Proponents of Condorcet voting face the question of what to do in the rare\ncase when no Condorcet winner exists. Recent work provides compelling arguments\nfor the rule that should be applied in three-candidate elections, but already\nwith four candidates, many rules appear reasonable. In this paper, we consider\na recent proposal of a simple Condorcet voting method for Final Four political\nelections. Our question is what normative principles could support this simple\nform of Condorcet voting. When there is no Condorcet winner, one natural\nprinciple is to pick the candidate who is closest to being a Condorcet winner.\nYet there are multiple plausible ways to define closeness, leading to different\nresults. Here we take the following approach: identify a relatively\nuncontroversial sufficient condition for one candidate to be closer than\nanother to being a Condorcet winner; then use other principles to help settle\nwho wins in cases when that condition alone does not. We prove that our\nprinciples uniquely characterize the simple Condorcet voting method for Final\nFour elections. This analysis also points to a new way of extending the method\nto elections with five or more candidates that is simpler than an extension\npreviously considered. The new proposal is to elect the candidate with the most\nhead-to-head wins, and if multiple candidates tie for the most wins, then elect\nthe one who has the smallest head-to-head loss. We provide additional\nprinciples sufficient to characterize this simple method for Final Five\nelections.",

The governing equations are nonlinear in both velocity\nand pressure and are subject to nonstandard boundary conditions. Specifically,\nwe impose the no-slip condition along with a Clarke subdifferential relation\nbetween pressure and the normal velocity components. For the stationary case,\nwe establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions using a\nsurjectivity theorem for pseudomonotone operators. The existence of weak\nsolutions to the non-stationary hemivariational inequality is established via a\nlimiting process applied to a temporally semi-discrete scheme, where the time\nderivative is approximated using the backward Euler method-commonly referred to\nas the Rothe method. It is demonstrated that the discrete problem admits\nsolutions, which possess a weakly convergent subsequence as the time step tends\nto zero, and that any such weak limit satisfies the original hemivariational\ninequality. A novel outcome of this paper is that the existence results\nobtained in this work is applicable to 3D non-stationary Navier-Stokes\nequations also.

    "abstract": "Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare\ndata in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence\nsolutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies\noften focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive\nperformance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an\ninterpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the\nrich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More\nspecifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three\nhierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We\nfirst leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among\nmedical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.\nBuilding on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework\nthat captures contextualized representations across three levels, while\nincorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic\nsimilarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,\nwe evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant\ntasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction\nof length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The\nresults demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and\ninterpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,\nProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to\naid in healthcare prediction.",

    "abstract": "The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in\ncomputer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable\nsuccess across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains\nconfined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its\nability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To\naddress this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates\nViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach\nto enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this\nframework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its\nself-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent\nspace, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.\nProximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent\nbundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving\nglobal feature alignment and optimization.

Both guns use nanotip emitters and\naccelerate electrons through the electric field of the THz wave. SLRGs employ a\nreflective structure to superimpose the initial and subsequent half-cycles of\nthe THz electric field, enhancing the field amplitude and acceleration\nefficiency. Experiments have demonstrated that SLRGs achieve higher\nacceleration efficiency than single-layer nonreflective guns (SLNRGs) for\nidentical THz input energies. This constitutes direct experimental verification\nof the efficacy of the reflective structure. Theoretically, SLRGs operating in\nsingle-feed mode can match the acceleration efficiency of dual-feed SLNRGs\nwhile reducing operational complexity. DLRGs demonstrate THz-driven cascaded\nelectron acceleration through precise scanning of the delay between two\nincident THz beams. This represents a direct experimental demonstration of\ncascaded acceleration in THz-driven electron sources. The experimental results\nof DLRGs align closely with the results of electron dynamics predicted by\nsimulations.

However, current\nbenchmarks for unlearning in recommender systems -- most notably CURE4Rec --\nfail to reflect real-world operational demands. They focus narrowly on\ncollaborative filtering, overlook tasks like session-based and next-basket\nrecommendation, simulate unrealistically large unlearning requests, and ignore\ncritical efficiency constraints. In this paper, we propose a set of design\ndesiderata and research questions to guide the development of a more realistic\nbenchmark for unlearning in recommender systems, with the goal of gathering\nfeedback from the research community. Our benchmark proposal spans multiple\nrecommendation tasks, includes domain-specific unlearning scenarios, and\nseveral unlearning algorithms -- including ones adapted from a recent NeurIPS\nunlearning competition. Furthermore, we argue for an unlearning setup that\nreflects the sequential, time-sensitive nature of real-world deletion requests.\nWe also present a preliminary experiment in a next-basket recommendation\nsetting based on our proposed desiderata and find that unlearning also works\nfor sequential recommendation models, exposed to many small unlearning\nrequests. In this case, we observe that a modification of a custom-designed\nunlearning algorithm for recommender systems outperforms general unlearning\nalgorithms significantly, and that unlearning can be executed with a latency of\nonly several seconds.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed\na context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent\ncoordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While\neffective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical\nlimitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to\ndegraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited\ninter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt\nconcatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information\nloss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS\nbuilt on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol.\nUnlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent\ncollaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results,\nidentify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm\nreduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and\nminimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable and\ncost-efficient execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved\n52.73% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the\nstrongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63%) by +9.09% under identical LLM\nsettings. Our implementation is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Anemoi.",

We recover the infinite $U$ and Kondo limit actions from our approach\nand show that the Kondo resonance already develops in the normal state when the\nslave boson has yet to condense.

    "abstract": "We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons\nwith rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax\noperators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes\nHamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations\nis generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave\nlimit includes the coupled Schr\\\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma\nphysics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap\nsupports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step\nstructure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on\nthe opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary\nsolutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin\n\\textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are\ncreated from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from\nnormal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions\ncomes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer\nfunctions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank\nholomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of\n\\textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic\nmulti-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.",

To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided\nDiffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity\ncontrollable video generation.

This unique design, featuring\na dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness\nits powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external\nspatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key\nmetrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control\nand overall consistency.",

    "abstract": "Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape\nthe player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative\nengagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological\nbreakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have\nsignificantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true\nphotorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a\nmajor challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance.

To this end, we\npropose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative\nNetwork framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image\ntranslation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that\ntransform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.\nThis enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time\ninference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach\nachieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired\nIm2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also\nindicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced\nby directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to\ntranslate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of\nreal-world images.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce\nTabResFlow, a Normalizing Spline Flow model designed specifically for\nunivariate tabular regression, where commonly used simple flow networks like\nRealNVP and Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) are unsuitable. TabResFlow\nconsists of three key components: (1) An MLP encoder for each numerical\nfeature. (2) A fully connected ResNet backbone for expressive feature\nextraction. (3) A conditional spline-based normalizing flow for flexible and\ntractable density estimation. We evaluate TabResFlow on nine public benchmark\ndatasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses existing probabilistic\nregression models on likelihood scores. Our results demonstrate 9.64%\nimprovement compared to the strongest probabilistic regression model\n(TreeFlow), and on average 5.6 times speed-up in inference time compared to the\nstrongest deep learning alternative (NodeFlow). Additionally, we validate the\npractical applicability of TabResFlow in a real-world used car price prediction\ntask under selective regression. To measure performance in this setting, we\nintroduce a novel Area Under Risk Coverage (AURC) metric and show that\nTabResFlow achieves superior results across this metric.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of rigid rotation on the spontaneous breaking of\nU(1) symmetry in a Bose gas, which is described by a self-interacting complex\nscalar field Lagrangian. Rigid rotation is introduced through a specific metric\nthat explicitly depends on the angular velocity $\\Omega$. We begin by\ndetermining the free propagator for this model at finite temperature $T$ and\nchemical potential $\\mu$. Using this propagator, we calculate the thermodynamic\npotential in terms of an energy dispersion relation $\\epsilon_{k}$. It is found\nthat in both the U(1) symmetric phase and the symmetry-broken phase, two energy\nbranches emerge. In the symmetry-broken phase, they are identified with a\nmassive phonon and a massless roton mode. Notably, rotation does not alter\n$\\epsilon_{k}$ at low momentum. Setting $\\mu=0$, we use the total thermodynamic\npotential, which includes classical, thermal, vacuum, and nonperturbative ring\ncontributions, to explore how the condensate depends on $T$ and $\\Omega$. We\nfirst focus on the classical and thermal parts of the thermodynamic potential\nand find that the critical temperature of the U(1) phase transition scales as\n$\\Omega^{1/3}$. By identifying the (pseudo-)Goldstone and non-Goldstone modes\nof this model with $\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ mesons, we calculate the $T$ and $\\Omega$\ndependence of masses $m_{\\pi}$ and $m_{\\sigma}$. We demonstrate that the\nGoldstone theorem holds only when the one-loop (thermal) corrections to\n$m_{\\sigma}$ and $m_{\\pi}$ are taken into account. We further explore the $T$\nand $\\Omega$ dependence of the condensate, determine the $\\sigma$ dissociation\ntemperatures for fixed $\\Omega$, and compare them with the critical temperature\nof the phase transition. Additionally, we emphasize the role played by the\nnonperturbative ring potential, especially in altering the order of the phase\ntransition with and without rotation.",

By fitting elliptical NFW models with mass priors from the RedMaPPer\ncluster richness-mass relation, considering the priors helps us break the\nmass-concentration degeneracy and tighten constraints on other parameters. The\nderived concentration-mass relation exhibits a slightly steeper slope than\ntraditional weak-lensing power-law or upturn models, and agrees more closely\nwith the results from strong lensing selected halos. More massive and\nlower-redshift clusters tend to have lower concentrations and appear more\nspherical. The halo ellipticity distribution is characterized by\ne=1-b/a=0.530+/-0.168, with a mean of <e>=0.505+/-0.007. We also detect a\nbimodal distribution in the offsets between optical centers and mass centroids:\nsome halos are well-aligned with their brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), while\nothers show significant displacements. These results highlight the power of 2D\nweak-lensing modeling in probing halo morphology and in providing key inputs\nfor understanding and modeling systematic effects in stacked lensing analyses.",

Particularly, some geomagnetic storms might be induced by solar\nfilament eruptions originating from unexpected surface source regions because\nof non-radial ejection. The non-radial ejection of filaments has received\nwidespread attention but remains inconclusive. We select two eruptive\nfilaments, both of which are supported by flux ropes, as indicated by the hot\nchannel structures seen in the 94 {\\AA} images and the hook-shaped brightenings\nwhere the filament material falls back. We measure the three-dimensional\nejection trajectory of the eruptive filaments by integrating the simultaneous\nobservations from SDO and STEREO. Furthermore, we calculate the distribution of\nthe poloidal field along the ejection path and compare it to the ejection\nacceleration. It is revealed that the reinforcement of the poloidal magnetic\nfield may lead to the suppression of the acceleration, with the acceleration\nresuming its increase only when the poloidal field diminishes to a certain\nlevel. Additionally, we compute the spatial distribution of the poloidal field\nin various directions and find that the poloidal magnetic field above the\nfilaments is asymmetric. For both investigated events, the filaments appear to\neject towards the side where the poloidal magnetic field is weaker, indicating\nthat the eruptive filaments tend to propagate along the side with weaker\nstrapping force.

    "abstract": "As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming\nincreasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing\npath velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking.\nThe primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory\nplanning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves\nmaintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory,\nparticularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based\nrapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above\nchallenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time\nefficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance\nframework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned\ntrajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal\nsmoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the\nproposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path\nadheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to\nmaintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility\nof the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time\nefficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other\niteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the\nproposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle,\ndemonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.",

Existing approaches based\non reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to\nextract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization\nacross object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains\n(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep\nCNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic\nfeature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,\nespecially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)\ncompresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding\ndiscriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification.

At larger\n$z$ the bumpy spectra can provide a tenfold increase (relative to $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel) in the masses of individual black holes without requiring\nsuper-Eddington accretion or heavy seeds. The nucleation of SMBHs starts at\n$z\\sim 13$, which is earlier than in the standard $\\Lambda$CMD model.",

The\nsensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers\ntheir generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)\nmodel, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed\nrepresentations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model\nincorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages\nthese representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby\nenhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level\nvideo analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the\nprobabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.\nExperiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),\ncross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.",

    "abstract": "Studies of nuclear fission over recent decades have led to a well-defined\nmapping of neutron and proton shell effects across the nuclear chart,\nparticularly within the valley of stability. These shell effects play a crucial\nrole in driving the asymmetric splitting of fissioning nuclei, as reflected in\nfission yields that are strongly influenced by spherical and deformed shell\nclosures. In the actinide region, the existence of two primary fission modes,\nstandard I and standard II, has been well-established. These fission modes are\nassociated with the proton (neutron) shells at $Z=52$ ($N=82$) and $Z=56$\n($N=88$), respectively. Recently, a new proton shell around $Z=36$ has been\nfound for the lighter fission fragments of pre-actinide nuclei. This discovery\ndemonstrates that as we expand fission studies towards more exotic regions of\nthe nuclear chart, new shell structures emerge. In this proposal, we aim to\nexplore for the first time the most neutron-deficient isotopes of Th, Ac, and\nRa. This region offers a unique opportunity to investigate stabilization\neffects around the spherical neutron shell $N=50$. To achieve this, we plan to\nuse a primary beam of $^{238}$U at 1~GeV/u together with the Fragment Separator\n(FRS) to produce secondary beams of $^{213-216}$Th, $^{209-214}$Ac and\n$^{207-213}$Ra. For the investigation of the fission process, we will use the\nexperimental methodology successfully applied in the S415, S438, and S455\nexperiments, being a continuation of those studies. Fission will be induced by\nelectromagnetic-excitation (Coulex) reactions in inverse kinematics on an\nactive target composed of Pb and C foils. The resulting fission fragments,\ntogether with emitted neutrons, will be measured using the R$^3$B experimental\nsetup, which allows for complete kinematic measurements.",

One of the crucial factors turns out to be\nthe cushioning effect of the gas surrounding the droplet. This fact, together\nwith the observation that almost all of the relevant literature was done in\nair, triggers the question what would happen when the liquid was a boiling\nliquid, i.e., a liquid in thermal equilibrium with its own vapor, as is the\ncase during transport of cryogenic liquids such as liquid hydrogen. To\ninvestigate precisely this question, we experimentally generate droplets in\nthermodynamical equilibrium with their own vapor, even before impact, such that\nminute energy exchanges of the droplet with its surroundings can trigger phase\nchange. Using a frustrated total internal reflection (TIR) setup, we make the\nexciting observation that depending on the impact speed and vapor conditions,\nthe entrapment of vapor can be completely suppressed under boiling liquid\nconditions. We create a simplified model based on scaling arguments and perform\nnumerical simulations considering both the compressible and condensable\nproperties of the vapor layer that are in very good agreement with our\nexperimental findings. Our results can be of great consequence to the pressures\nexerted during droplet impact and on an industrial scale may help better\nunderstand the loads experienced during sloshing wave impact inside cryogenic\nliquid containers.",

In\nparticular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions\nthat negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when\nthe style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel\nsampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an\northogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original\npositive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts\nwhile maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet\nplausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which\nrelies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,\nDOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To\ncontrol the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a\ntriangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process\nis most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on\nthe state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both\ncontent clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and\nchallenging writing styles.",

We further analyze architectural\ntrends both structurally and chronologically, establish a unified benchmark\nwith consistent training settings, and evaluate methods in terms of denoising\nquality, surface fidelity, point distribution, and computational efficiency.\nFinally, we discuss open challenges and outline directions for future research\nin this rapidly evolving field.",

While analytical methods like the Kabsch algorithm provide an exact,\nclosed-form solution for minimizing the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)\nbetween two sets of corresponding atoms, their application is limited to this\nspecific metric. The rise of deep learning and automatic differentiation\nframeworks offers a new, more flexible paradigm for such optimization problems.\nWe present Lie-RMSD, a novel, fully differentiable framework for protein\nstructural alignment. Our method represents the rigid-body transformation\n(rotation and translation) as a 6-dimensional vector in the Lie algebra se(3)\nof the special Euclidean group SE(3). This representation allows the RMSD to be\nformulated as a loss function that can be directly minimized by modern\ngradient-based optimizers. We benchmarked our framework by aligning two\nallosteric conformations of Adenylate Kinase (PDB IDs: 4AKE and 1AKE). We\ndemonstrate that a suite of standard optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Sophia)\ncan robustly converge to the global minimum, achieving precision effectively\nidentical to the analytical Kabsch algorithm.

Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize\nperformance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy\nfor efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient\ndual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features\na noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at\ntraining time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the\nnoise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.\nMulti-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),\nand Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature\nrepresentation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale\nsegmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss\nfunction to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA\nsegmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.\nEDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse\ndataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while\nsignificantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%.

    "abstract": "The $\\Lambda$CDM model faces significant challenges, including an incomplete\nunderstanding of the dark sector and persistent tensions in the Hubble constant\nand the clustering amplitude. To address these issues, we propose a general\ndisformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a\nfield-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions\nincluding conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals\nthat a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early\nDark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble\nfriction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological\nconstant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and\neventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark\nenergy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on\nfinely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a\nconsequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter,\noffering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions.\nThis framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature\nspectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for\nthe observed low-$\\ell$ anomaly.

This study investigates the role of LTC in a temporally adaptive\nfeedforward SNN applied to static image, dynamic image, and biosignal\ntime-series classification. Presented experiments demonstrate that LTCs\ncritically affect inference accuracy, synaptic weight distributions, and firing\ndynamics. For static and dynamic images, intermediate LTCs yield higher\naccuracy and compact, centered weight histograms, reflecting stable feature\nencoding. In time-series tasks, optimal LTCs enhance temporal feature retention\nand result in broader weight sparsity, allowing for tolerance of LTC\nvariations. The provided results show that inference accuracy peaks at specific\nLTC ranges, with significant degradation beyond this optimal band due to\nover-integration or excessive forgetting. Firing rate analysis reveals a strong\ninterplay between LTC, network depth, and energy efficiency, underscoring the\nimportance of balanced spiking activity. These findings reveal that\ntask-specific LTC tuning is essential for efficient spike coding and robust\nlearning.

Each Lorentz matrix has a pair of reciprocal Schmidt\ncoefficients (which are real), and a unit coefficient, which is its own\nreciprocal.

Unlike traditional PINNs that require\ndomain decomposition and penalty terms for multi-material problems, KANs'\ntrainable B-spline activation functions provide inherent piecewise function\ncharacteristics that naturally accommodate material property discontinuities.\nConsequently, this approach requires only a single KAN to achieve accurate\napproximation across the entire computational domain without subdomain\npartitioning and interface continuity constraints. Numerical validation\ndemonstrates PIKAN's accuracy and robustness for multi-material elasticity\nproblems. The method maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing\ncomputational complexity compared to domain decomposition approaches. Results\nconfirm PIKAN's unique advantages in solving multi-material problems and its\nsignificant potential for electronic packaging structure analysis.

    "abstract": "The high Weissenberg number problem has been a persistent challenge in the\nnumerical simulation of viscoelastic fluid flows. This paper presents an\nimproved lattice Boltzmann method for solving viscoelastic flow problems at\nhigh Weissenberg numbers. The proposed approach employs two independent\ntwo-relaxation-time regularized lattice Boltzmann models to solve the\nhydrodynamic field and conformation tensor field of viscoelastic fluid flows,\nrespectively. The viscoelastic stress computed from the conformation tensor is\ndirectly embedded into the hydrodynamic field using a newly proposed local\nvelocity discretization scheme, thereby avoiding spatial gradient calculations.\nThe constitutive equations are treated as convection-diffusion equations and\nsolved using an improved convection-diffusion model specifically designed for\nthis purpose, incorporating a novel auxiliary source term that eliminates the\nneed for spatial and temporal derivative computations. Additionally, a\nconservative non-equilibrium bounce-back (CNEBB) scheme is proposed for\nimplementing solid wall boundary conditions in the constitutive equations. The\nrobustness of the present algorithm is validated through a series of benchmark\nproblems. The simplified four-roll mill problem demonstrates that the method\neffectively improves numerical accuracy and stability in bulk regions\ncontaining stress singularities. The Poiseuille flow problem validates the\naccuracy of the current algorithm with the CNEBB boundary scheme at extremely\nhigh Weissenberg numbers (tested up to Wi = 10,000). The flow past a circular\ncylinder problem confirms the superior stability and applicability of the\nalgorithm for complex curved boundary problems compared to other existing\ncommon schemes.",

This approach can 1)\nmitigate the effects of population oscillation, a common issue in many MOEAs,\nand 2) allow for the use of smaller, more practical population sizes. In this\npaper, we analytically show that the archive can even further help MOEAs\nthrough reusing its solutions during the process of new solution generation. We\nfirst prove that using a small population size alongside an archive (without\nincorporating archived solutions in the generation process) may fail on certain\nproblems, as the population may remove previously discovered but promising\nsolutions. We then prove that reusing archive solutions can overcome this\nlimitation, resulting in at least a polynomial speedup on the expected running\ntime. Our analysis focuses on the well-established SMS-EMOA algorithm applied\nto the commonly studied OneJumpZeroJump problem as well as one of its variants.\nWe also show that reusing archive solutions can be better than using a large\npopulation size directly.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but\nsuffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While\nrecent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal\nextrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the\nfailure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this\nproblem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework\nthat fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools\nwith empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative\napproximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian\ncharacteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially\ntheoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We\nfurther introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability\nwhile preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nHiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding\nbaseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video\ngeneration, and super-resolution tasks.

Existing approaches, such\nas Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool use, aim to address these\nissues by incorporating external knowledge. Yet, they rely on additional models\nor services, resulting in complex pipelines, potential error propagation, and\noften requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper,\nwe present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge\nwithout depending on retrievers or auxiliary models.

Triples from a\nKnowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a\nprefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external\nknowledge, the LLM generates facts with constrained generation which allows\nonly sequences of tokens that form an existing fact.

However, the process of RIS beamforming (or passive beamforming)\ncontrol is associated with multiple latency-inducing factors. As a result, by\nthe time the beamforming is effectively updated, the channel conditions may\nhave already changed. For example, the low update rate of localization systems\nbecomes a critical limitation, as a mobile UE's position may change\nsignificantly between two consecutive measurements. To address this issue, this\nwork proposes a practical and scalable physics-based solution that is effective\nacross a wide range of UE movement models. Specifically, we propose a kinematic\nobserver and predictor to enable proactive RIS control. From low-rate position\nestimates provided by a localizer, the kinematic observer infers the UE's speed\nand acceleration. These motion parameters are then used by a predictor to\nestimate the UE's future positions at a higher rate, allowing the RIS to adjust\npromptly and compensate for inherent delays in both the RIS control and\nlocalization systems.

Theoretically, we establish a generalization\nerror bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,\nthereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.\nPractically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to\nidentify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients\nacross all source domains.

Yet, in simulations of galaxy\nevolution, modeling these outflows in their multi-phase nature and over the\nrelevant timescales is an unsolved problem. We present a subgrid model for\nsimulating multiphase galactic outflows in efficient, comparatively\nlow-resolution simulations, designed for application in future cosmological\nsimulations. The cold phase (T = 10000 K) is treated as pressureless, and its\ninteraction with the hot phase is captured through source terms representing\ndrag and mixing. These terms are obtained using analytic drag and mixing terms\nfor single clouds and convolving them with a cloud mass distribution consistent\nwith high-resolution simulations. Applied to a setup resembling the starburst\ngalaxy M82, the model reproduces the velocity, density, and mass outflow rates\nof high-resolution simulations that resolve individual cold clouds. Cold\noutflows emerge naturally from interactions between the hot wind and cold\ninterstellar clouds, with drag and mixing both contributing to the\nacceleration. Varying the mixing strength strongly affects outflow properties:\nstronger mixing enhances mass transfer from hot to cold gas, reduces the hot\nphase velocity, and accelerates the cold phase, while also influencing the\norigin and composition of the cold outflow. Weak mixing produces cold gas\nmostly from preexisting interstellar clouds, whereas stronger mixing leads to\nsubstantial cold gas formation from the hot phase. This framework enables\nefficient simulations of multiphase galactic outflows while retaining key\nmulti-component features of the outflow dynamics.",

The\nmain innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that\napplies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning\ndesign to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density\nlevels.

However, the\ntrustworthiness challenges posed by these black-box models have become\nincreasingly evident in recent years. To alleviate this problem, this paper\nproposes a novel Knowledge-guided Probing approach called KnowProb in a\npost-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand\nimplicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the\nsurface level content of the text. We provide six potential explanations\nderived from the underlying content of the given text, including three\nknowledge-based understanding and three association-based reasoning. In\nexperiments, we validate that current small-scale (or large-scale) PLMs only\nlearn a single distribution of representation, and still face significant\nchallenges in capturing the hidden knowledge behind a given text. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective for identifying the\nlimitations of existing black-box models from multiple probing perspectives,\nwhich facilitates researchers to promote the study of detecting black-box\nmodels in an explainable way.",

Although powerful, the high brilliance\nrequired currently constrains the method to 3rd and 4th generation synchrotron\nsources and long scanning times. An alternative approach is to use a broadband\nillumination in combination with an energy resolving detector.

This approach\npromises to unlock the full power of the radiation source and provide spectral\nimaging at a higher rate and in a single acquisition.

The massive galaxies in our sample\nexhibit rapid stellar mass assembly, forming 50\\% of their mass between $3 \\leq\nz \\leq 9$. The highest inferred formation redshifts are compatible with\nelevated star formation efficiencies ($\\epsilon$) at early epochs.\nNon-parametric SFHs generally imply an earlier and slower mass assembly\ncompared to parametric forms, highlighting the sensitivity of inferred\nformation timescales to the chosen SFH model, particularly for galaxies at $z <\n2$.

PSI multiplies three independently calibrated components: geometric\ncluster quality (S), alignment to labeled categories (Q), and open-vocabulary\nsemantic distinctness via CLIP (D). On a pretrained ResNet-50 evaluated with\nTiny-ImageNet images, PSI identifies neurons whose activation sets split into\ncoherent, nameable prototypes, and reveals strong depth trends: later layers\nexhibit substantially higher PSI than earlier layers. We validate our approach\nwith robustness checks (varying hyperparameters, random seeds, and\ncross-encoder text heads), breadth analyses (comparing class-only vs.\nopen-vocabulary concepts), and causal patch-swap interventions. In particular,\naligned patch replacements increase target-neuron activation significantly more\nthan non-aligned, random, shuffled-position, or ablate-elsewhere controls.

Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma\npersists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet\nthe exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of\nLLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be\nexplored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded\nReinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework\ndesigned to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning.\nSpecifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit\nscaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics\nare provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse\nhigh-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time,\nencouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2)\nverifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain\nrobust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL\non general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding\nreasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL\nsignificantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500,\nsurpassing GPT-4.1.

However, most existing\nplanners tend to fix their policy after supervised training, leading to\nconsistent but rigid driving behaviors. This limits their ability to reflect\nhuman preferences or adapt to dynamic, instruction-driven demands. In this\nwork, we propose a diffusion-based multi-head trajectory planner(M-diffusion\nplanner). During the early training stage, all output heads share weights to\nlearn to generate high-quality trajectories. Leveraging the probabilistic\nnature of diffusion models, we then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) to fine-tune the pre-trained model for diverse policy-specific\nbehaviors. At inference time, we incorporate a large language model (LLM) to\nguide strategy selection, enabling dynamic, instruction-aware planning without\nswitching models. Closed-loop simulation demonstrates that our post-trained\nplanner retains strong planning capability while achieving state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance on the nuPlan val14 benchmark. Open-loop results further\nshow that the generated trajectories exhibit clear diversity, effectively\nsatisfying multi-modal driving behavior requirements.

    "abstract": "Optimizing the stability and control performance of complex networks often\nhinges on effectively identifying critical nodes for targeted intervention. Due\nto their inherent complexity and high dimensionality, large-scale energy flow\nnetworks, prevalent in domains like power grids, transportation, and financial\nsystems, present unique challenges in selecting optimal nodes for resource\nallocation. While numerous centrality measurements, such as Katz centrality,\neigenvector centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and\nPageRank, have been proposed to evaluate node importance, the impact of\ndifferent centrality metrics on stability outcomes remains inadequately\nunderstood. Moreover, networks manifest diverse structural\ncharacteristics-including small-world, scale-free, and random graph\nproperties-which further complicates the optimization problem. This paper\nsystematically investigates how various node centrality measurements influence\ncontrol stability across representative complex network structures. A unified\nenergy-flow dynamical model is developed, and performance metrics such as the\nL1 norm are employed to quantify the network stability implications of\nemploying different centrality metrics. Extensive numerical simulations over\nstatistically generated network ensembles reveal significant variances in\nstability outcomes, highlighting the crucial role of centrality selection. The\nfindings underscore the sensitivity of energy-flow stability to seemingly minor\nchanges in topological node rankings, providing practical insights for\nenhancing control efficiency and robustness in real-world networked systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the higher regularity and convergence of solutions\nof anisotropic Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with additive colored noise and\nwhite noise on two-dimensional torus $\\mathbb T^2$. Under the conditions that\nthe external force $f(\\textbf{x})$ belongs to the phase space $ H$ and the\nnoise intensity function $h(\\textbf{x})$ satisfies $\\|\\nabla h\\|_{L^\\infty}\n\\leq \\sqrt{\\pi\\delta} \\frac{\\nu \\lambda_1}{2}$, it was proved that the random\nanisotropic NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^2)$-random attractor whose\n(box-counting) fractal dimension in $H^2$ is finite. This was achieved by\nestablishing, first, an $H^2$ bounded absorbing set and, second, an\n$(H,H^2)$-smoothing effect of the system which lifts the compactness and\nfinite-dimensionality of the attractor in $H$ to that in $H^2$. Since the force\n$f$ belongs only to $H$, the $H^2$-regularity of solutions as well as the\n$H^2$-bounded absorbing set was constructed by an indirect approach of\nestimating the $H^2$-distance between the solution of the random anisotropic NS\nequations and that of the corresponding deterministic anisotropic NS equations.\nWhen the external force $f(\\textbf{x})$ belongs to $H^2$ and the noise\nintensity function $h(\\textbf{x})$ satisfies the Assumption 2, it was proved\nthat the random anisotropic NS equations possess a tempered $(H,H^3)$-random\nattractor whose (box-counting) fractal dimension in $H^3$ is finite. Finally,\nwe prove the upper semi-continuity of random attractors and the convergence of\nsolutions of (8.3) as $\\delta\\rightarrow0$ in the spaces $(H,H)$, $(H,H^1)$,\n$(H^1,H^2)$ and $(H^2,H^3)$, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves\ntraining a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and\nadversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we\nbuild on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a\nmethod designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is\nmotivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often\ndisproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,\nleaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts\nthe focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,\nneuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively\ndisrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for\ntransferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41\ndiverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates\nthat surpass existing baselines by over 14\\% in cross-model and 4\\% in\ncross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking\ncapabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates\nwithin just 10 queries.

A promising direction is to build\nsemantic representations of investment themes from textual data. However,\ndespite their power, general-purpose LLM embedding models are not well-suited\nto capture the nuanced characteristics of financial assets, since the semantic\nrepresentation of investment assets may differ fundamentally from that of\ngeneral financial text. To address this, we introduce THEME, a framework that\nfine-tunes embeddings using hierarchical contrastive learning. THEME aligns\nthemes and their constituent stocks using their hierarchical relationship, and\nsubsequently refines these embeddings by incorporating stock returns. This\nprocess yields representations effective for retrieving thematically aligned\nassets with strong return potential. Empirical results demonstrate that THEME\nexcels in two key areas. For thematic asset retrieval, it significantly\noutperforms leading large language models. Furthermore, its constructed\nportfolios demonstrate compelling performance.

    "abstract": "Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual\nrecognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for\nlearning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and\nvariants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich\ncomplementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional\nfeature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to\nreconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal\nclassification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the\nMulti-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that\nintegrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.\nSpecifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet\nBackbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement\nRouting (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature\nrepresentations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and\nglobal contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these\nmulti-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,\nequipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.\nFinally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by\nidentifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the\nsimple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the\nmost coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps\nachieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently\nsurpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with\nconfigurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)\nto a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in\nadvancing feature representation learning.",

To systematically\ndiagnose and mitigate this risk, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500\nmental health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses,\nevaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence,\nand Fostering Overdependence.

When multiple forecasting\nmethods are available, an alternative to method selection is forecast\ncombination. In this paper, we consider the combination of a large pool of VaR\nand ES forecasts. As there have been few studies in this area, we implement a\nvariety of new combining methods.

As a complement to the previously proposed performance-based weighted\ncombinations, we use regularised estimation to limit the risk of overfitting\ndue to the large number of weights. By viewing the forecasts of VaR and ES from\neach method as the bounds of an interval forecast, we are able to apply\ninterval forecast combining methods from the decision analysis literature.\nThese include different forms of trimmed mean, and a probability averaging\nmethod that involves a mixture of the probability distributions inferred from\nthe VaR and ES forecasts.

While AI models have shown promise in this\ndomain, they face key limitations, including computational inefficiency, the\ninterpretability challenges of spiking neural networks (SNNs), and the\ncomplexity and convergence instability of hyper-heuristic reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based hyperparameter optimization. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel framework that integrates a Cortical Spiking Network with\nPopulation Coding (CSNPC) and a Reinforcement-Guided Hyper-Heuristic Optimizer\nfor Spiking Systems (RHOSS). The CSNPC, a biologically inspired SNN, employs\npopulation coding for robust classification, while RHOSS uses Q-learning to\ndynamically select low-level heuristics for hyperparameter optimization under\nfairness and recall constraints.

Since\nthere are many ways to segment a group of letters, this constitutes a\ncomputational operation that has to be solved by the reading brain, many times\nper minute, in order to achieve the recognition of words in text necessary for\nreading. We hypothesized that providing segmentation information in the text\nitself could help the reading process by reducing its computational cost.

We ran a\nseries of pre-registered lexical decision experiments with 192 participants\nthat tested five types of visual segmentations: outlines, spacing, connections,\nunderlines and color. The evidence indicates that, even with a moderate amount\nof training, these visual interventions always slow down word identification,\nbut each to a different extent. These findings are important because they\nindicate that, at least for typical adult readers with a moderate amount of\nspecific training in these visual interventions, accelerating the lexical\ndecision task is unlikely. The results also offer an empirical measurement of\nthe cost of a common set of visual manipulations of text, which can be useful\nfor practitioners seeking to visualize alongside or within text without\nimpacting reading performance.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we establish a mathematical theory on statement and validation\nof the hypersonic similarity law within the framework of Radon measure\nsolutions of steady compressible Euler equations. We consider two scenarios:\n(1) two-dimensional steady non-isentropic compressible Euler flows past an\ninfinitely long slender curved wedge; (2) three-dimensional steady\nnon-isentropic compressible Euler flows past an infinitely long axisymmetric\ncone.\n  It turns out that, for the hypersonic flow passing through a slender body\nwith tiny slenderness $\\tau$, if the parameter $K\\doteq M_{\\infty}\\tau$ is\nfixed, by taking $\\tau \\to 0$ (i.e., the Mach number of the upcoming flow\n$M_{\\infty} \\to \\infty$), the flow field structures (after scaling) no longer\ndepend on the body's shape and the Mach number $M_{\\infty}$ independently, but\nonly on $K$ and adiabatic index $\\gamma$ of the polytropic gas. Mathematically,\nfor non-isentropic Euler flows, we find a new system of hypersonic\nsmall-disturbance equations to describe steady compressible hypersonic flows\npassing slender bodies. We demonstrate that as $ \\tau \\to0$, under suitable\nnon-dimensional scalings, the Radon measure solutions of the original problems\nof hypersonic flow passing bodies converge to those of corresponding hypersonic\nsmall-disturbance problems. The explicit forms of the Radon measure solutions\nderived for the two scenarios effectively simplify the convergence analysis.",

    "abstract": "Indoor localization is a long-standing challenge in mobile computing, with\nsignificant implications for enabling location-aware and intelligent\napplications within smart environments such as homes, offices, and retail\nspaces. As AI assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Nest become\nincreasingly pervasive, microphone-equipped devices are emerging as key\ncomponents of everyday life and home automation. This paper introduces a\npassive, infrastructure-light system for localizing human speakers using speech\nsignals captured by two or more spatially distributed smart devices. The\nproposed approach, GCC+, extends the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase\nTransform (GCC-PHAT) method to estimate the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of audio\nsignals at each device and applies robust triangulation techniques to infer the\nspeaker's two-dimensional position. To further improve temporal resolution and\nlocalization accuracy, feature-space expansion and subsample interpolation\ntechniques are employed for precise Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)\nestimation. The system operates without requiring hardware modifications, prior\ncalibration, explicit user cooperation, or knowledge of the speaker's signal\ncontent, thereby offering a highly practical solution for real-world\ndeployment. Experimental evaluation in a real-world home environment yields a\nmedian AoA estimation error of 2.2 degrees and a median localization error of\n1.25 m, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of audio-based\nlocalization for enabling context-aware, privacy-preserving ambient\nintelligence.",

A Weibull accelerated failure time (AFT) model with interaction terms\nfor treatment-by-age and treatment-by-log tumor size was used to capture\nsubgroup-specific treatment effects. The estimated main effect of high-dose DES\nindicated a time ratio of 0.582 (95% CI: [0.306, 1.110]), reflecting reduced\nsurvival at the reference levels of age and tumor size. However,\ninteraction-adjusted ITEs revealed marked effect modification: younger patients\n(e.g., age 50 years) had over fourfold expected survival gains (time ratio\n4.09), whereas older patients (e.g., age 80 years) experienced reduced benefit\n(time ratio 0.71). Similarly, patients with larger tumors (log size $\\sim$4.25,\n$\\sim$70 $cm^2$) derived a stronger benefit (time ratio 1.89) than those with\nsmaller tumors.

The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based\nclosures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these\nmodels. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training\ninputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs\noutside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic\nturbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ\nbetween three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based\nmethods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and\nStochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the\nexact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of\n$2.14 \\cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \\cdot 10^{-4}$.\nNext, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying\nout-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the\nbest in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the\nout-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and\nDE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE\nperforms the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We\nobserve that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP > DE > SV I >\nMCD.

    "abstract": "Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the\nloss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing\nclearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to\nincorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack\neffective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,\nwe propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,\ndesigned to handle multiple degradations through global and local text\nperception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a\nglobal feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract\noverall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting\ngeneralization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,\nthe local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to\nconcentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,\nthereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to\nconstrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network\nlearning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby\npromoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art\nmethods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks.

Existing robustness methods often diverge between\nsmall-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on\nlabor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose\na unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates\nmodel stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex\nperturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping\nDistortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing\ninput-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner.

D 100,\n045024 (2019), we develop a method to uncover the hidden thermal properties of\nthe inertial Feynman propagator in Minkowski spacetime in a causally consistent\nmanner. This, in turn, enables a coherent interpretation based on\nfuture-directed propagation. In this method, the Fourier transform is\nimplemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum\nfluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons\ncan be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined\nto a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past\nhorizon and their absorption at the future horizon. Furthermore, we find that\nthe ratio of emission and absorption processes reproduces the characteristic\nBoltzmann factor of a thermal ensemble. We first apply this analysis to the\nright Rindler wedge, recovering the well-known Unruh temperature, $T =\na/(2\\pi)$. We then extend the analysis to a causal diamond of length $2\\alpha$,\nperforming a meticulous analysis of the near-horizon geometry and thereby\nobtaining the temperature associated with the thermal behavior of the Minkowski\nvacuum as perceived by an observer with finite lifetime $2\\alpha$. Our results\ndemonstrate that thermality can emerge directly from causal structure,\nindependently of acceleration or gravity, with causal diamonds encoding\nintrinsic thermodynamic behavior in quantum field theory.",

    "abstract": "Predictive processing and active inference posit that the brain is a system\nperforming Bayesian inference on the environment. By virtue of this, a\nprominent interpretation of predictive processing states that the generative\nmodel (a POMDP) encoded by the brain synchronises with the generative process\n(another POMDP) representing the environment while trying to explain what\nhidden properties of the world generated its sensory input. In this view, the\nbrain is thought to become a copy of the environment. This claim has however\nbeen disputed, stressing the fact that a structural copy, or isomorphism as it\nis at times invoked to be, is not an accurate description of this process since\nthe environment is necessarily more complex than the brain, and what matters is\nnot the capacity to exactly recapitulate the veridical causal structure of the\nworld. In this work, we make parts of this counterargument formal by using\nideas from the theory of coalgebras, an abstract mathematical framework for\ndynamical systems that brings together work from automata theory, concurrency\ntheory, probabilistic processes and other fields. To do so, we cast generative\nmodel and process, in the form of POMDPs, as coalgebras, and use maps between\nthem to describe a form of consistency that goes beyond mere structural\nsimilarity, giving the necessary mathematical background to describe how\ndifferent processes can be seen as behaviourally, rather than structurally,\nequivalent, i.e. how they can be seen as emitting the same observations, and\nthus minimise prediction error, over time without strict assumptions about\nstructural similarity. In particular, we will introduce three standard notions\nof equivalence from the literature on coalgebras, evaluating them in the\ncontext of predictive processing and identifying the one closest to claims made\nby proponents of this framework.",

First, our method is an unsupervised\nlearning approach that requires no training data, which is crucial for\nlarge-scale map data where obtaining labeled training samples is challenging.\nSecond, we introduce pseudo coordinates that capture the relative spatial\nlayout of nodes within each map, which enhances feature discriminability and\nenables scale-invariant learning.

At\nthe implementation level, to handle large-scale maps, we develop a tile-based\npost-processing pipeline with overlapping regions and majority voting, which\nenables parallel processing while preserving boundary coherence. Experiments on\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy in matching tasks, surpassing existing methods by a large margin,\nparticularly in high-noise and large-scale scenarios.

    "abstract": "Large and Transformer-based language models perform outstandingly in various\ndownstream tasks. However, there is limited understanding regarding how these\nmodels internalize linguistic knowledge, so various linguistic benchmarks have\nrecently been proposed to facilitate syntactic evaluation of language models\nacross languages. This paper introduces QFrCoLA (Quebec-French Corpus of\nLinguistic Acceptability Judgments), a normative binary acceptability judgments\ndataset comprising 25,153 in-domain and 2,675 out-of-domain sentences. Our\nstudy leverages the QFrCoLA dataset and seven other linguistic binary\nacceptability judgment corpora to benchmark seven language models. The results\ndemonstrate that, on average, fine-tuned Transformer-based LM are strong\nbaselines for most languages and that zero-shot binary classification large\nlanguage models perform poorly on the task. However, for the QFrCoLA benchmark,\non average, a fine-tuned Transformer-based LM outperformed other methods\ntested. It also shows that pre-trained cross-lingual LLMs selected for our\nexperimentation do not seem to have acquired linguistic judgment capabilities\nduring their pre-training for Quebec French. Finally, our experiment results on\nQFrCoLA show that our dataset, built from examples that illustrate linguistic\nnorms rather than speakers' feelings, is similar to linguistic acceptability\njudgment; it is a challenging dataset that can benchmark LM on their linguistic\njudgment capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and\nanalyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity,\ndiseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \\&\ndevelopment is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to\ncomputationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell\nmulti-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics\nfusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn\ncomprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary\nmulti-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four\ndownstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over\nexisting peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight\nstate-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell\nsubtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell\nsubpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously,\nscI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental\ntrajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In\naddition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two\nsubpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely\ndistinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize\ncross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data\nand learns discriminative cellular representations to support various\ndownstream analysis tasks.",

    "abstract": "We study an information engine operating in an active bath, where a Brownian\nparticle confined in a harmonic trap undergoes feedback-driven displacement\ncycles. Unlike thermal environments, active baths exhibit temporally correlated\nfluctuations, introducing memory effects that challenge conventional feedback\nstrategies. Extending the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to account for\nsuch memory, we analyze a feedback protocol that periodically shifts the\npotential minimum based on noisy measurements of the particle's position. We\nshow that conventional feedback schemes, optimized for memoryless thermal\nbaths, can degrade performance in active media due to the disruption of\nbath-particle memory by abrupt resetting. To overcome this degradation, we\nintroduce a class of memory-preserving feedback protocols that partially retain\nthe covariance between the particle's displacement and active noise, thereby\nexploiting the temporal persistence of active fluctuations. Through asymptotic\nanalysis, we show how the feedback gain -- which quantifies the strength of\npositional shifts -- nontrivially shapes the engine's work and power profiles.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that in active media, intermediate gains\noutperform full-shift resetting. Our results reveal the critical interplay\nbetween bath memory, measurement noise, and feedback gain, offering guiding\nprinciples for designing high-performance information engines in nonequilibrium\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Curable hydrogels have tunable properties that make them well-suited for\napplications in drug delivery, cell therapies, and 3D bioprinting. Advances in\nmicrofluidic droplet generation enable rapid fabrication of polymer-filled\ndroplets. UV-curable polymers offer a clear path toward using fluidic\ngeneration to produce monodisperse microgels with uniform properties. In flow,\npolymer concentration and UV exposure both control the degree of crosslinking.\nHigh UV intensity is often used to ensure complete gelation and avoid\ncomplications that may arise from partial curing. Optical microscopy can assess\ndroplet and particle sizes in flow. However, optimizing formulations for\nmechanical properties usually requires removal of generated material and\nexternal measurement outside of flow. In this study, we couple droplet\ngeneration, microgel fabrication, and mechanics assessment within a single\nfluidic device. We make and measure soft polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA)\nmicrogels by curing polymer-filled water drops in mineral oil. Crosslinking is\ntuned by varying UV dosage, allowing us to study how gelation degree influences\nmicrogel properties. Within the device, we use shape deformation in flow to\nmeasure the restoring stress of both droplets and particles. Our results\nsuggest that PEGDA droplets gel from the inside out. If gelation is incomplete,\na particle resides within a fluid drop. Independent measurements outside of\nflow corroborate this observation. Crosslinking PEGDA-filled droplets in a\npendant drop geometry, with dye, suggests the persistence of an aqueous shell\naround the gel. Similarly, microparticles in PEGDA-filled drops undergoing\ngelation exhibit diffusive arrest near the drop center, while maintaining\nmobility in an outer region. Together, these results suggest the importance of\nconsidering the extent of gelation when fabricating microgels using fluidics.",

Using multiple\nreasoning paths per query alleviates this problem, but treating each path\nidentically is suboptimal as paths vary widely in quality and suitability\nacross tasks and models.

Finally, cooperative peer teaching enables students to mutually distill\ndiverse insights, addressing knowledge gaps and biases toward specific\nreasoning styles.

We designed\nTriagerX to address these limitations. First, to assess token semantics more\nreliably, we leverage a dual-transformer architecture. Unlike current\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines that employ a single transformer\narchitecture, TriagerX collects recommendations from two transformers with each\noffering recommendations via its last three layers. This setup generates a\nrobust content-based ranking of candidate developers. TriagerX then refines\nthis ranking by employing a novel interaction-based ranking methodology, which\nconsiders developers' historical interactions with similar fixed bugs. Across\nfive datasets, TriagerX surpasses all nine transformer-based methods, including\nSOTA baselines, often improving Top-1 and Top-3 developer recommendation\naccuracy by over 10%.

Such flows\nfeature quasi-periodic magnetic flux eruptions, power jet-like magnetic tower\noutflows, and consequently alter the predominant contribution to angular\nmomentum transfer inside the circumbinary disk.

    "abstract": "Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large\nhomogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause\nlimited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,\nwe introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework\nthat performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an\ninitial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures\n(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control\nnodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable\nposition, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to\nlocal deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation\nthen blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich\nnodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing\ninterpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while\npreserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient\nregions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal\nin textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term\nloss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.\nExperiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration\nerror from 6.2\\,px to ~2.4\\,px and increases the AUC at 25\\,px from 0.770 to\n0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods.

    "abstract": "Code editors provide essential services that help developers understand,\nnavigate, and modify programs. However, these services often fail in the\npresence of syntax errors. Existing syntax error recovery techniques, like\npanic mode and multi-option repairs, are either too coarse, e.g. in deleting\nlarge swathes of code, or lead to a proliferation of possible completions. This\npaper introduces $\\texttt{tylr}$, a parser and editor generator that completes\narbitrarily malformed code by inserting obligations, which generalize holes to\ncover missing operands, operators, mixfix keywords, and sort transitions.\n$\\texttt{tylr}$ is backed by a novel theory of tile-based parsing, which\nextends operator-precedence parsing in two ways. First, traditional token\nprecedence comparisons are replaced by a notion of grammar walks, which form\nthe basis for generating obligations. Second, a distinct \"molding\" system based\non grammar zippers expand grammar expressivity by allowing the system to\ndisambiguate between possible parses and completions based on an obligation\nminimization criterion. In addition to serving as a novel approach to error\ncorrection, $\\texttt{tylr}$'s design enables the development of an editor that\nvisually materializes obligations to the human user, serving as a novel hybrid\nbetween a text editor and a structure editor. We introduce $\\texttt{tylr}$ by\nexample, then formalize its key ideas. Finally, we conduct a human subjects\nstudy to evaluate the extent to which an editor like $\\texttt{tylr}$ that\nmaterializes syntactic obligations might be usable and useful, finding both\npoints of positivity and interesting new avenues for future work.",

    "abstract": "Sycophancy, or overly agreeable or flattering behavior, is a documented issue\nin large language models (LLMs), and is critical to understand in the context\nof human/AI collaboration. Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by\nmeasuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric\ncharacterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in\nscenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian\nframework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when\npresented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and\nirrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In\ncomparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive\nbehavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not\nhave a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination\nof open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing\nsycophancy. We also experiment with multiple methods for eliciting probability\njudgments from LLMs. We hypothesize that probing LLMs for sycophancy will cause\ndeviations in LLMs' predicted posteriors that will lead to increased Bayesian\nerror. Our findings indicate that: 1) LLMs are not Bayesian rational, 2)\nprobing for sycophancy results in significant increases to the predicted\nposterior in favor of the steered outcome, 3) sycophancy sometimes results in\nincreased Bayesian error, and in a small number of cases actually decreases\nerror, and 4) changes in Bayesian error due to sycophancy are not strongly\ncorrelated in Brier score, suggesting that studying the impact of sycophancy on\nground truth alone does not fully capture errors in reasoning due to\nsycophancy.",

Diffusion models have been widely\nadopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal\naction distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps\nat inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their\npracticality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In\nthis work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive\nalter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion\naction decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling\nthrough an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We\nintegrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO\nbenchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its\ndiffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving\nsubstantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a\npromising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without\ncompromising performance.",
