This interplay of\nresolution, noise, and the dynamic range of the sensor and their impact on the\neventual quality of acquired imagery is a fundamental concept in photography.\nIn this paper, we propose spatially-varying gain and binning to enhance the\nnoise performance and dynamic range of image sensors. First, we show that by\nvarying gain spatially to local scene brightness, the read noise can be made\nnegligible, and the dynamic range of a sensor is expanded by an order of\nmagnitude. Second, we propose a simple analysis to find a binning size that\nbest balances resolution and noise for a given light level; this analysis\npredicts a spatially-varying binning strategy, again based on local scene\nbrightness, to effectively increase the overall signal-to-noise ratio. %\nwithout sacrificing resolution. We discuss analog and digital binning modes\nand, perhaps surprisingly, show that digital binning outperforms its analog\ncounterparts when a larger gain is allowed.

However, this conventional formulation cannot detect\nsideswipe collisions. A two-dimensional extension, $\\text{TTC}_{\\text{2D}}$,\nhas been proposed in the literature to address lateral interactions. However,\nthis formulation assumes both vehicles have the same heading and that their\nheadings remain unchanged during the manoeuvre, in addition to the constant\nspeed and heading assumptions in the prediction horizon. Moreover, its use for\narticulated vehicles like a tractor-semitrailer remains unclear. This paper\nproposes three enhanced versions of $\\text{TTC}_{\\text{2D}}$ to overcome these\nlimitations. The first incorporates the vehicle heading to account for\ndirectional differences. The standard assumption of constant speed and heading\nin the prediction horizon holds. The second adapts the formulation for\narticulated vehicles, and the third allows for constant acceleration, relaxing\nthe constant speed assumption in the prediction horizon. All versions are\nevaluated in simulated cut-in scenarios, covering both sideswipe and rear-end\ncollisions, using the CARLA simulation environment with a tractor-semitrailer\nmodel.

However, since dynamic scenes regularly change over\ntime, a key challenge is to ensure that different generated views be consistent\nwith the underlying 3D motions. Prior work learns such consistency by training\non multiple views, but the generated scene regions often interpolate between\ntraining views and fail to generate perpetual views. To address this issue, we\npropose DynamicVoyager, which reformulates dynamic scene generation as a scene\noutpainting problem with new dynamic content. As 2D outpainting models struggle\nat generating 3D consistent motions from a single 2D view, we enrich 2D pixels\nwith information from their 3D rays that facilitates learning of 3D motion\nconsistency. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to a\ndynamic point cloud using the estimated video depths. We then render a partial\nvideo of the point cloud from a novel view and outpaint the missing regions\nusing ray information (e.g., the distance from a ray to the point cloud) to\ngenerate 3D consistent motions. Next, we use the outpainted video to update the\npoint cloud, which is used for outpainting the scene from future novel views.\nMoreover, we can control the generated content with the input text prompt.\nExperiments show that our model can generate perpetual scenes with consistent\nmotions along fly-through cameras.

An\nimportant question is whether the structure of different networks, together\nwith the particular selection of input and output nodes, is such that it favors\nthe passing or blocking of such signals. For a given network and a given choice\nof the input and output nodes, the H2-norm provides a natural and general\nquantification of the extent to which input signals-whether deterministic or\nstochastic, periodic or arbitrary-are amplified.

This passing behavior culminates\nin directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), for which we analytically show that\namplification depends on the number and length of input-output pathways, which\nis consistent with the well-known tendency of naturally emerging networks to\napproximate DAG structures.

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges developers face in the use of continuous\nintegration (CI) and deployment pipelines is the occurrence of intermittent job\nfailures, which result from unexpected non-deterministic issues (e.g., flaky\ntests or infrastructure problems) rather than regular code-related errors such\nas bugs. Prior studies developed machine learning (ML) models trained on large\ndatasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or\nregular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on\nnon-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job\nfailures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not\nan explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In\nfact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1\nopen-source projects reveals that, on average, 32% of intermittent job failures\nare mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper introduces\na novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using few-shot learning\n(FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model using a few number of\nmanually labeled log examples to generate rich embeddings, which are then used\nto train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based approach achieves 70-88% F1-score with\nonly 12 shots in all projects, outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective\n(34-52% F1-score) in 4 projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance\nof data quality over quantity and provides a more efficient and practical\nframework for the detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.",

    "abstract": "Several mobile agents, modelled as deterministic automata, navigate in an\ninfinite line in synchronous rounds. All agents start in the same round. In\neach round, an agent can move to one of the two neighboring nodes, or stay\nidle. Agents have distinct labels which are integers from the set $\\{1,\\dots,\nL\\}$. They start in teams, and all agents in a team have the same starting\nnode. The adversary decides the compositions of teams, and their starting\nnodes. Whenever an agent enters a node, it sees the entry port number and the\nstates of all collocated agents; this information forms the input of the agent\non the basis of which it transits to the next state and decides the current\naction. The aim is for all agents to gather at the same node and stop.\nGathering is feasible, if this task can be accomplished for any decisions of\nthe adversary, and its time is the worst-case number of rounds from the start\ntill gathering.\n  We consider the feasibility and time complexity of gathering teams of agents,\nand give a complete solution of this problem. It turns out that both\nfeasibility and complexity of gathering depend on the sizes of teams. We first\nconcentrate on the case when all teams have the same size $x$. For the oriented\nline, gathering is impossible if $x=1$, and it can be accomplished in time\n$O(D)$, for $x>1$, where $D$ is the distance between the starting nodes of the\nmost distant teams. This complexity is of course optimal. For the unoriented\nline, the situation is different. For $x=1$, gathering is also impossible, but\nfor $x=2$, the optimal time of gathering is $\\Theta(D\\log L)$, and for $x\\geq\n3$, the optimal time of gathering is $\\Theta(D)$. In the case when there are\nteams of different sizes, we show that gathering is always possible in time\n$O(D)$, even for the unoriented line. This complexity is of course optimal.",

One of the key ingredients is augmenting the observed data\n$\\{(Y_i,X_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$ with uniformly sampled values $\\tau_i$ for $1\\leq i\\leq\nn$ which serve as training data for quantile function estimation. Using the\nfact that the location parameter $\\mu$ in a $\\tau$-tilted asymmetric Laplace\ndistribution corresponds to the $\\tau^{th}$ quantile, we build a check-loss\nlikelihood targeting $\\mu$ as the parameter of interest. We equip the\ncheck-loss likelihood parametrized by $\\mu=f(X,\\tau)$ with a BART prior on\n$f(\\cdot)$, allowing the conditional quantile function to vary both in $X$ and\n$\\tau$. The posterior distribution over $\\mu(\\tau,X)$ can be then distilled for\nestimation of the {\\em entire quantile function} as well as for assessing\nuncertainty through the variation of posterior draws. Simulation-based\npredictive inference is immediately available through inverse transform\nsampling using the learned quantile function. The sum-of-trees structure over\nthe conditional quantile function enables flexible distribution-free regression\nwith theoretical guarantees.

The inclusion of the\nscalar field results in an explicit breaking of the conformal symmetry in the\ndual field theory. In such systems, the Hawking temperature of the black hole\ncorresponds to the plasma temperature in the dual field theory.

There\nare several computational methods that have been proposed over the past 15\nyears that replace intractable analytical marginalization by numerical\nintegration, typically using different flavours of importance sampling (IS).\nSuch methods include particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, sequential Monte Carlo\nsquared (SMC$^2$), IS$^2$, nested particle filters, and others. In this paper,\nwe investigate the role of the dimension of the nuisance variables in the error\nbounds achieved by nested IS methods in Bayesian inference. We prove that,\nunder suitable regularity assumptions on the model, the approximation errors\nincrease at a polynomial (rather than exponential) rate w.r.t. the dimension of\nthe nuisance variables. Our analysis relies on tools from functional analysis\nand measure theory, and it includes the case of polynomials of degree zero,\nwhere the approximation error remains uniformly bounded, even as the dimension\nof the nuisance variables grows without bound. We also show how the general\nanalysis can be applied to specific classes of models, including linear and\nGaussian settings, models with bounded observation functions, and others.

    "abstract": "Breathing is a spontaneous but controllable body function that can be used\nfor hands-free interaction. Our work introduces \"iBreath\", a novel system to\ndetect breathing gestures similar to clicks using bio-impedance. We evaluated\niBreath's accuracy and user experience using two lab studies (n=34). Our\nresults show high detection accuracy (F1-scores > 95.2%). Furthermore, the\nusers found the gestures easy to use and comfortable. Thus, we developed eight\npractical guidelines for the future development of breathing gestures. For\nexample, designers can train users on new gestures within just 50 seconds (five\ntrials), and achieve robust performance with both user-dependent and\nuser-independent models trained on data from 21 participants, each yielding\naccuracies above 90%. Users preferred single clicks and disliked triple clicks.\nThe median gesture duration is 3.5-5.3 seconds. Our work provides solid ground\nfor researchers to experiment with creating breathing gestures and\ninteractions.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces HyperSumm-RL, a hypertext-aware summarization and\ninteraction analysis framework designed to investigate human perceptions of\nsocial robot leadership through long-form dialogue. The system utilizes a\nstructured Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow that combines\ntransformer-based long dialogue summarization, leadership style modeling, and\nuser response analysis, enabling scalable evaluation of social robots in\ncomplex human-robot interaction (HRI) settings. Unlike prior work that focuses\non static or task-oriented HRI, HyperSumm-RL captures and hypertextually\norganizes dynamic conversational exchanges into navigable, semantically rich\nrepresentations which allows researchers to trace interaction threads, identify\ninfluence cues, and analyze leadership framing over time. The contributions of\nthis study are threefold: (1) we present a novel infrastructure for summarizing\nand linking long, multi-turn dialogues using leadership-style taxonomies; (2)\nwe propose an interactive hypertext model that supports relational navigation\nacross conversational themes, participant responses, and robot behavior modes;\nand (3) we demonstrate the utility of this system in interpreting participant\ntrust, engagement, and expectation shifts during social robot leadership\nscenarios. The findings reveal how hypertextual workflows can augment HRI\nresearch by enabling transparent, interpretable, and semantically grounded\nanalysis of emergent social dynamics.",

This limits their\naccessibility to delicate or constrained anatomical regions. Achieving\nreal-time, high-resolution endomicroscopy using compact, low-cost hardware at\nthe hundred-micron scale remains an unsolved challenge. Optical fibers offer a\npromising route toward miniaturization by providing sub-millimeter-scale\nimaging channels; however, existing fiber-based methods typically rely on\nraster scanning or multicore bundles, which limit the resolution and imaging\nspeed. In this work, we overcome these limitations by integrating dual-comb\ninterferometry with compressive ghost imaging and advanced computational\nreconstruction. Our technique, hyperspectral dual-comb compressive imaging,\nutilizes optical frequency combs to generate wavelength-multiplexed speckle\npatterns that are delivered through a single-core fiber and detected by a\nsingle-pixel photodetector. This parallel speckle illumination and detection\nenable snapshot compression and acquisition of image information using\nzero-dimensional hardware, completely eliminating the need for both spatial and\nspectral scanning. To decode these highly compressed signals, we develop a\ntransformer-based deep learning model capable of rapid, high-fidelity image\nreconstruction at extremely low sampling ratios. This approach significantly\noutperforms classical ghost imaging methods in both speed and accuracy,\nachieving video-rate imaging with a dramatically simplified optical front-end.\nOur results represent a major advance toward minimally invasive, cost-effective\nendomicroscopy and provide a generalizable platform for optical sensing in\napplications where hardware constraints are critical.",

    "abstract": "We study adaptive two-sided assortment optimization for revenue maximization\nin choice-based matching platforms. The platform has two sides of agents, an\ninitiating side, and a responding side. The decision-maker sequentially selects\nagents from the initiating side, shows each an assortment of agents from the\nresponding side, and observes their choices. After processing all initiating\nagents, the responding agents are shown assortments and make their selections.\nA match occurs when two agents mutually select each other, generating\npair-dependent revenue. Choices follow Multinomial Logit (MNL) models. This\nsetting generalizes prior work focused on maximizing the number of matches\nunder submodular demand assumptions, which do not hold in our\nrevenue-maximization context. Our main contribution is the design of\npolynomial-time approximation algorithms with constant-factor guarantees. In\nparticular, for general pairwise revenues, we develop a randomized algorithm\nthat achieves a $(\\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon)$-approximation in expectation for any\n$\\epsilon > 0$. The algorithm is static and provides guarantees under various\nagent arrival settings, including fixed order, simultaneous processing, and\nadaptive selection. When revenues are uniform across all pairs involving any\ngiven responding-side agent, the guarantee improves to $(1 - \\frac{1}{e} -\n\\epsilon)$. In structural settings where responding-side agents share a common\nrevenue-based ranking, we design a simpler adaptive deterministic algorithm\nachieving a $\\frac{1}{2}$-approximation. Our approach leverages novel linear\nprogramming relaxations, correlation gap arguments, and structural properties\nof the revenue functions.",

This results in notable processing delays for real-time image\nrendering, which greatly affects the user experience. Additionally, VR devices\nsuch as head-mounted displays (HMDs) are intricately linked to human visual\nbehavior, leveraging knowledge from perception and cognition to improve user\nexperience. These insights have spurred the development of foveated rendering,\na technique that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution based on the user's\ngaze direction. The resultant solution, known as gaze-tracked foveated\nrendering, significantly reduces the computational burden of the rendering\nprocess.\n  Although gaze-tracked foveated rendering can reduce rendering costs, the\ncomputational overhead of the gaze tracking process itself can sometimes\noutweigh the rendering savings, leading to increased processing latency. To\naddress this issue, we propose an efficient rendering framework\ncalled~\\textit{A3FR}, designed to minimize the latency of gaze-tracked foveated\nrendering via the parallelization of gaze tracking and foveated rendering\nprocesses. For the rendering algorithm, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting, a\nstate-of-the-art neural rendering technique. Evaluation results demonstrate\nthat A3FR can reduce end-to-end rendering latency by up to $2\\times$ while\nmaintaining visual quality.",

    "abstract": "The Kagome lattice is a 2D network of corner sharing triangles found in\nseveral rare earth materials resulting in a complicated and often frustrated\nmagnetic system. In the last decades, modifications of the motif, such as\nbreathing Kagome, asymmetric Kagome, and twisted Kagome were brought into the\nlimelight. In particular, the latter has lower symmetry than the original\nKagome and thus allows implementations of an \"Ising-local\" Hamiltonian, leading\nto a 2D spin ice. One such material implementation, HoAgGe, was recently\nreported to have an exceptionally rich phase diagram and is a strongly\nfrustrated 2D spin-ice material with a twisted-Kagome geometry. In the presence\nof an external magnetic field the compound exhibits step-like magnetization\nplateaus at simple fractions of the saturation magnetization. It is believed\nthat this phenomenon results from strong single-site anisotropy, which in\nHoAgGe was found to be in-plane and along a high-symmetry direction. Previous\nMonte Carlo simulations with empirical exchange parameters explain some, but\nnot all experimental observations. In this work we present (a) first-principle\ncalculations of the crucial model parameters and (b) direct energy minimization\nvia a Reduced-Configuration-Space search, as well as Monte-Carlo simulations of\nthe field-dependent phase diagram. We find that for HoAgGe the calculated\nexchange parameters are very different from the earlier suggested empirical\nones, and describe the phase diagram much more accurately. This is likely\nbecause the first-principles parameters are, in addition to geometrically, also\nparametrically frustrated.",

We inspect four classes of prompting\nstrategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and\nevaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For\neach prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a\nfrontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models\n(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language\nmodels fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone\naccounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning\nyields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and\nnarrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional\nexperiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance\nin 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track.

    "abstract": "This article presents and validates an ideal, four-stage workflow for the\nhigh-accuracy transcription and analysis of challenging medieval legal\ndocuments. The process begins with a specialized Handwritten Text Recognition\n(HTR) model, itself created using a novel \"Clean Ground Truth\" curation method\nwhere a Large Language Model (LLM) refines the training data. This HTR model\nprovides a robust baseline transcription (Stage 1). In Stage 2, this baseline\nis fed, along with the original document image, to an LLM for multimodal\npost-correction, grounding the LLM's analysis and improving accuracy. The\ncorrected, abbreviated text is then expanded into full, scholarly Latin using a\nprompt-guided LLM (Stage 3). A final LLM pass performs Named-Entity Correction\n(NEC), regularizing proper nouns and generating plausible alternatives for\nambiguous readings (Stage 4). We validate this workflow through detailed case\nstudies, achieving Word Error Rates (WER) in the range of 2-7% against\nscholarly ground truths. The results demonstrate that this hybrid, multi-stage\napproach effectively automates the most laborious aspects of transcription\nwhile producing a high-quality, analyzable output, representing a powerful and\npractical solution for the current technological landscape.",

Traditional\nalgorithms explore search spaces vertex-by-vertex from empty mappings, leading\nto extensive early-stage exploration with limited pruning opportunities. We\nintroduce HiPerMotif, a novel hybrid parallel algorithm that fundamentally\nshifts the search initialization strategy. After structurally reordering the\npattern graph to prioritize high-degree vertices, HiPerMotif systematically\nidentifies all possible mappings for the first edge (vertices 0,1) in the\ntarget graph, validates these edge candidates using efficient vertex and edge\nvalidators, and injects the validated partial mappings as states at depth 2.\nThe algorithm then continues with traditional vertex-by-vertex exploration from\nthese pre-validated starting points, effectively pruning the expensive early\nsearch tree branches while enabling natural parallelization over edge\ncandidates. Our contributions include the edge-centric initialization paradigm\nwith state injection, a structural reordering strategy achieving up to 5x\nspeedup, rapid edge and vertex validators for attribute-rich graphs, and\nefficient parallel enumeration over target graph edges. Implemented in the\nopen-source Arachne framework, HiPerMotif achieves up to 66x speedup over\nstate-of-the-art baselines (VF2-PS, VF3P, Glasgow) on diverse datasets where\nbaselines successfully complete execution. Additionally, HiPerMotif\nsuccessfully processes massive datasets such as the H01 connectome with 147\nmillion edges, which existing methods cannot handle due to memory constraints.\nComprehensive evaluation across synthetic and real-world graphs demonstrates\nHiPerMotif's scalability, enabling advanced analysis in computational\nneuroscience and beyond.",

In\nmulti-factor biometrics (MFB), multiple biometric modalities, e.g.,\nphysiological and behavioral, are integrated to mitigate the limitations\ninherent in single-factor biometrics. The main challenge in MFB lies in\nidentifying novel behavioral techniques capable of meeting critical criteria,\nincluding high accuracy, high usability, non-invasiveness, resilience against\nspoofing attacks, and low use of computational resources. Despite ongoing\nadvancements, current behavioral biometric techniques often fall short of\nfulfilling one or more of these requirements. In this work, we propose\nBlowPrint, a novel behavioral biometric technique that allows us to\nauthenticate users based on their phone blowing behaviors. In brief, we assume\nthat the way users blow on a phone screen can produce distinctive acoustic\npatterns, which can serve as a unique biometric identifier for effective user\nauthentication. It can also be seamlessly integrated with physiological\ntechniques, such as facial recognition, to enhance its robustness and security.\nTo assess BlowPrint's effectiveness, we conduct an empirical study involving 50\nparticipants from whom we collect blow-acoustic and facial feature data.\nSubsequently, we compute the similarity scores of the two modalities using\nvarious similarity algorithms and combine them through score-level fusion.\nFinally, we compute the accuracy using a machine learning-based classifier. As\na result, the proposed method demonstrates an accuracy of 99.35% for blow\nacoustics, 99.96% for facial recognition, and 99.82% for the combined approach.\nThe experimental results demonstrate BlowPrint's high effectiveness in terms of\nauthentication accuracy, spoofing attack resilience, usability,\nnon-invasiveness, and other aspects.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent\nfollows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research\nproblem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to\nviewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that\nalter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized\nscenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View\nInvariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the\nrobustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL\nemploys a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant\nfeatures. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the\nWaypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a\nview-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student\nmodel. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these\ncomponents, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical\nresults show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on\nV2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets\nR2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE\nsetting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often\nstill improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method\nalso achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to\nother map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the\nstandard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training\nmethod.",

Its common\nsolution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a\nsubstitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers\nare trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted\nteachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's\nattention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This\nhinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit\nDFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,\ninspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness\non OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups\naccording to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and\nused for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as\nOOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.\nCode is released at https://github.com/tmllab/2025_ICML_ATEsc.",

    "abstract": "Although the lightweight Vision Transformer has significantly advanced image\nsuper-resolution (SR), it faces the inherent challenge of a limited receptive\nfield due to the window-based self-attention modeling. The quadratic\ncomputational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a\nlarge window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low\ncomputational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the\nproposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information\naccess and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global\nanchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL\nleverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor\nprompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used\nto provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token\nconnections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention\nand window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional\nglobal prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different\ngranularities for adaptive local refinement. In this way, the proposed CPB\neffectively combines global priors and local details, significantly enlarging\nthe receptive field while maintaining the low computational costs of our\nPromptSR. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method,\nwhich outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods in quantitative,\nqualitative, and complexity evaluations.

It capitalises\non the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion\nmodel and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson\nprocesses as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the\nproposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly\nintroduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process\nwith Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification\n(GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme\nthat efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning\n(including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class\nwith the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle\npermitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after\ndeleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic\nand real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other\nstate-of-the-art tracking algorithms.

    "abstract": "Our research addresses the overlooked security concerns related to data\npoisoning in continual learning (CL). Data poisoning - the intentional\nmanipulation of training data to affect the predictions of machine learning\nmodels - was recently shown to be a threat to CL training stability. While\nexisting literature predominantly addresses scenario-dependent attacks, we\npropose to focus on a more simple and realistic single-task poison (STP)\nthreats. In contrast to previously proposed poisoning settings, in STP\nadversaries lack knowledge and access to the model, as well as to both previous\nand future tasks. During an attack, they only have access to the current task\nwithin the data stream. Our study demonstrates that even within these stringent\nconditions, adversaries can compromise model performance using standard image\ncorruptions. We show that STP attacks are able to strongly disrupt the whole\ncontinual training process: decreasing both the stability (its performance on\npast tasks) and plasticity (capacity to adapt to new tasks) of the algorithm.\nFinally, we propose a high-level defense framework for CL along with a poison\ntask detection method based on task vectors.

To address this, we present the first statistically\ngrounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training.

Understanding of the processes associated\nwith the thermalization dynamics are of fundamental importance in analyzing and\ncontrolling such complex systems. In this work, we utilize a one-dimensional\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice as the simplest topological model to investigate\nthe thermalization process of multiband systems in both topologically trivial\nand nontrivial regimes. Specifically, we identify that thermalization develops\nin three stages: (i) out-of-equilibrium dynamics, (ii) prethermal stage and\n(iii) final thermalization. Each individual band constitutes a subsystem that\nprethermalizes to the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution predicted from its power and\ninternal energy. We find that this leads to a continuously varying\nprethermalization that eventually relaxes to the final thermal state (a\ndynamically evolving prethermal state). The presence of topological edge states\ncan accelerate the thermalization process, although prethermal states exist\nboth in the topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. Factors such as\nbandgap width, temperature and nonlinearity that can influence the\nthermalization dynamics are examined in detail.

    "abstract": "Fast-track procedures play an important role in the context of conditional\nregistration of health products, such as conditional approval processes and\nlisting processes for digital health applications. Fast-track procedures offer\nthe potential for earlier patient access to innovative products. They involve\ntwo registration steps. The applicants can apply first for conditional\nregistration. A successful conditional registration provides a limited funding\nor approval period and time to prepare the application for permanent\nregistration, which is the second step of the registration process. For\nconditional registration, typically, products have to fulfil only a part of the\nrequirements necessary for permanent registration. There is interest in valid\nand efficient study designs for fast-track procedures. This will be addressed\nin this paper. A motivating example of the paper is the German fast-track\nregistration process of digital health applications (DiGA) for reimbursement by\nstatutory health insurances. The main focus of the paper is the systematic\ninvestigation of the utility of adaptive designs in the context of fast-track\nregistration processes. The paper also covers a careful discussion of the\ndifferent requirements found in the guidelines and their consequences. We\ndemonstrate that the use of adaptive designs in the context of fast-track\nprocesses like the DiGA registration process is, in most cases, much more\nefficient than the current standard of two separate studies. The results\npresented in this paper are based on numerical calculations supported by\nmathematical arguments.",

In\nthis paper, we seek to understand this interplay in a simple setting by\nstudying the overall behavior of a one-dimensional periodic medium governed by\nstrain gradient elasticity at the microstructural scale. We find that the\noverall behavior is not described by a strain gradient elasticity. In other\nwords, strain gradient theories are not invariant under averaging at this\nscale.

This paper introduces a\nnovel approach to investigate this conjecture by generalizing the concept of\nZernike moments through the lens of harmonic analysis and spectral geometry.\nOur core idea involves defining a ``characteristic form'' $\\eta_Z$ for a Hodge\ncycle $Z$ within a K\\\"ahler variety $X$, and expanding this form in terms of\nthe eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $Z$. We hypothesize that\nfor algebraic Hodge cycles, the coefficients of this spectral expansion (termed\n``spectral fingerprints'') will exhibit specific algebraic patterns, such as\nbeing rational numbers, algebraic numbers, or algebraic functions of moduli\nparameters. We illustrate the computational methodology with a simplified ``toy\nmodel'' using a characteristic function on a torus, demonstrating how such\ncoefficients can indeed be rational in a controlled setting. We then outline a\nconceptual framework for applying this approach to more complex scenarios,\nspecifically K3 surfaces, by leveraging the theory of variations of Hodge\nstructures and moduli spaces to define ``dynamic characteristic forms'' and\nanalyze the algebraic nature of their coefficients.

    "abstract": "Conjunctive Searchable Symmetric Encryption (CSSE) enables secure conjunctive\nsearches over encrypted data. While leakage-abuse attacks (LAAs) against\nsingle-keyword SSE have been extensively studied, their extension to\nconjunctive queries faces a critical challenge: the combinatorial explosion of\ncandidate keyword combinations, leading to enormous time and space overhead for\nattacks. In this paper, we reveal a fundamental vulnerability in\nstate-of-the-art CSSE schemes: s-term leakage, where the keyword with the\nminimal document frequency in a query leaks distinct patterns. We propose\nS-Leak, the first passive attack framework that progressively recovers\nconjunctive queries by exploiting s-term leakage and global leakage. Our key\ninnovation lies in a three-stage approach: identifying the s-term of queries,\npruning low-probability keyword conjunctions, and reconstructing full queries.\nWe propose novel metrics to better assess attacks in conjunctive query\nscenarios. Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nattack is effective in diverse CSSE configurations. When considering 161,700\nconjunctive keyword queries, our attack achieves a 95.15% accuracy in\nrecovering at least one keyword, 82.57% for at least two, 58% for all three\nkeywords, and maintains efficacy against defenses such as SEAL padding and CLRZ\nobfuscation. Our work exposes the underestimated risks of s-term leakage in\npractical SSE deployments and calls for a redesign of leakage models for\nmulti-keyword search scenarios.",

In this study, we employed\nhigh-pressure X-ray absorption spectroscopy coupled to the diamond anvil cell\nto investigate in detail local structural changes around Ge in glassy $GeO_{2}$\nup to 158 GPa. We conducted four independent runs, both with and without\npressure-transmitting media. Up to 30 GPa, we observed no significant influence\nof the pressure medium on the pressure dependence of the $Ge-O$ bond length\n($<R_{Ge-O}>$). Between 10 and 30 GPa, the evolution of $<R_{Ge-O}>$ shows\nsubstantial variability across our experiments and previous works. The measured\nvalues lie close to those reported for crystalline polymorphs, including the\nrutile- and $CaCl_{2}$-type phase of $GeO_{2}$. This finding suggests that the\namorphous structure possesses considerable flexibility to transition among\ndifferent atomic configurations. From 30 GPa to 158 GPa, our results for both\n$<R_{Ge-O}>$ and the non-bonded cation-cation distance $<R_{Ge...Ge}>$\ndemonstrate that edge-sharing octahedra remain the main structural motives in\nglassy $GeO_{2}$. Up to 100 GPa, compaction proceeds primarily via distortions\nof octahedral $O-Ge-O$ bond angles accompanied by octahedral bond shortening.\nAbove 100 GPa, octahedral distortion becomes the prevailing mechanism. Compared\nto its crystalline analogues ($\\alpha-PbO_{2}$ and pyrite-like phase), glassy\n$GeO_{2}$ exhibits a slightly less efficient compaction mechanism, likely due\nto kinetic constraints that inhibit reconstructive lattice rearrangements.",

    "abstract": "The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across\ndiverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated\ntrajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space\ncan result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's\nperformance. Recent approaches, such as $\\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this\nlimitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods\nrequire training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency\nand prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned\nby the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world\nmodeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient\nMaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent\nstate with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent\nspace and improve the agent performance.

    "abstract": "Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future\nmotion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed\nsequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two\nchallenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the\nvarying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action\ncharacteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some\nactions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and\ninconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition\nAction Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems\nabove. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with\nthe novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on\nmultiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action\ncharacteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain\nactions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further\npropose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments\non four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently\noutperforms the previous state-of-the-art.

Despite significant\nadvancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains\n(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains\n(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain\ngeneralization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose\ndeep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection\non various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly\nfocusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial\nto achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For\nsome domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis\nrelying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in\neach modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this\nfusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of\nmisinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization\nmodel via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation\ndetection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We\ninvolve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a\nshared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal\nlearning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core\nfeatures of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through\ncross-modal guided denoising.

Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of\nspecific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly\nrendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions\n(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to\nfind model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then\nminimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure.

We construct a\ntight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy\ndispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by\nshort-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH)\ncounterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the\nlocalized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the\nimpurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI\nquasiparticle localized at moir\\'e lattice center closely follows the anyon\nWannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite\nof the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around\nthe impurity potential for the $\\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar\nto that of the $\\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length\non the moir\\'e lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough\nestimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the\nimpurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as\nexpected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI\nquasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of\nfractional statistics. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top\nvalence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI\nquasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around\na quasiparticle.

    "abstract": "Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is fundamental to affective computing and\nhuman-computer interaction, yet existing models struggle to generalize across\ndiverse acoustic conditions. While Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining\n(CLAP) provides strong multimodal alignment, it lacks dedicated mechanisms for\ncapturing emotional cues, making it suboptimal for SER. To address this, we\npropose CLEP-DG, a framework that enhances CLAP's robustness in emotion\nrecognition. First, we fine-tune CLAP to obtain CLEP, adapting it on\nlarge-scale emotional speech datasets to better encode emotion-relevant\nfeatures. Then, we introduce Acoustic Context Prompt Tuning (ACPT), a\ntext-driven augmentation strategy that optimizes learnable prompt vectors to\nmodel diverse acoustic environments without additional labeled audio. Finally,\nleveraging cross-modal transferability, we train a classifier on text-derived\nembeddings and apply it to the audio encoder during inference, mitigating\ndomain shifts between textual supervision and audio-based emotion recognition.\nExperiments across five benchmark datasets show that CLEP-DG outperforms prior\nCLAP-based approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both\nsupervised and domain generalization settings.",

These observations\npresent a significant multiphysics modeling challenge but also offer a unique\nopportunity to probe the nature of gravity and the strong nuclear interaction\nunder extreme conditions. The landmark detection of GW170817 provided essential\nconstraints on the properties of non-rotating neutron stars (NSs), including\ntheir maximum mass (M_{max}) and radius distribution, thereby informing the\nequation of state (EOS) of cold, dense nuclear matter. While the inspiral phase\nof such events has been extensively studied, the post-merger signal holds even\ngreater potential to reveal the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities,\nparticularly in scenarios involving a transition to deconfined quark matter.\nMotivated by the recent gravitational wave event GW190814 (2.5-2.67 M_{\\odot}),\nwe revisit the modeling of high-mass compact stars to investigate their\ninternal structure via a generalized polytropic EOS. This framework\nincorporates a modified energy density profile and is coupled with the TOV\nequations. We explore mass-radius (M-R) relationships within both GR and the\nminimal geometric deformation (MGD) approach.

Using the language\nof rewriting theory, one can characterise Gr\\\"obner bases in terms of\nconfluence of the induced rewriting system.

    "abstract": "Estimation and inference of treatment effects under unconfounded treatment\nassignments often suffer from bias and the `curse of dimensionality' due to the\nnonparametric estimation of nuisance parameters for high-dimensional\nconfounders. Although debiased state-of-the-art methods have been proposed for\nbinary treatments under particular treatment models, they can be unstable for\nsmall sample sizes. Moreover, directly extending them to general treatment\nmodels can lead to computational complexity. We propose a balanced neural\nnetworks weighting method for general treatment models, which leverages deep\nneural networks to alleviate the curse of dimensionality while retaining\noptimal covariate balance through calibration, thereby achieving debiased and\nrobust estimation. Our method accommodates a wide range of treatment models,\nincluding average, quantile, distributional, and asymmetric least squares\ntreatment effects, for discrete, continuous, and mixed treatments. Under\nregularity conditions, we show that our estimator achieves rate double\nrobustness and $\\sqrt{N}$-asymptotic normality, and its asymptotic variance\nachieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. We further develop a statistical\ninference procedure based on weighted bootstrap, which avoids estimating the\nefficient influence/score functions. Simulation results reveal that the\nproposed method consistently outperforms existing alternatives, especially when\nthe sample size is small. Applications to the 401(k) dataset and the Mother's\nSignificant Features dataset further illustrate the practical value of the\nmethod for estimating both average and quantile treatment effects under binary\nand continuous treatments, respectively.",

In particular, advances of\nexperimental techniques such as cold-atoms measurements allow the simulation of\nparadigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the\nFermi-Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the\nbehavior of the specific heat as function of density. In this work, we perform\nDeterminant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model to analyze the\nspecific heat as the filling, interaction and temperature of the system is\nchanged. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a\nthree-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between\nthem. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential\ncontributions to the specific heat. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic\ncontribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat\nbehavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion\ncoefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atoms\nexperiments. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the\nthermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of\nsign.

    "abstract": "We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to\nreconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of\nmulti-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean,\nmacro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic\nmicro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural\nnetwork. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing\naverage stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or\nFinite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local\nstress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the\ndefinition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical\nconstraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state\nand employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary\nconditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated\nconsidering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying\ngeometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves\nsignificant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it\nparticularly attractive for large-scale applications.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of General Relativity (GR) in 1915 revolutionized our\nunderstanding of gravity, but over time, its limitations in explaining\nphenomena like dark energy, dark matter, and quantum gravity have motivated\nalternative theories. Early modifications, such as Weyl's 1919 proposal,\nfocused on adding higher-order terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. GR's\nnon-renormalizability further strengthened the case for extending it. A central\ntheme of modern gravity research is modifying the geometric structure, often by\nchanging the gravitational Lagrangian. This leads to theories such as\nteleparallel and symmetric teleparallel gravity, utilizing torsion or\nnon-Levi-Civita connections, with differential geometry providing the essential\nframework.\n  This thesis explores several modified gravity models. Chapter 1 introduces\nnecessary mathematical tools. Chapter 2 develops a novel parametrization of the\ndeceleration parameter, constrained using MCMC and observational data, and\napplies it to f(Q) gravity. Chapter 3 embeds the LambdaCDM model into f(Q,\nL\\_m) gravity with non-minimal coupling, producing analytic solutions and\nmatching observations through cosmographic analysis. Chapter 4 considers\nBianchi-I spacetime in f(R, L\\_m) gravity with observational constraints to\nmeasure anisotropy. Chapter 5 presents wormhole solutions in f(Q, T) gravity\nwith conformal symmetries. Chapter 6 explores wormholes in f(R, L\\_m) with\nnon-commutative geometry, analyzing shape functions, energy conditions, and\nstability.

Instead, each buyer reports and commits to a bid\ndistribution in the ex-ante stage, which the auctioneer uses as input to the\nmechanism. Buyers strategically decide the reported distributions to maximize\nex-ante utility, potentially deviating from their value distributions. As shown\nin previous work, classical prior-dependent mechanisms such as the Myerson\nauction fail to elicit truthful value distributions at the ex-ante stage,\ndespite satisfying Bayesian incentive compatibility at the interim stage. We\nstudy the design of ex-ante incentive compatible mechanisms, and aim to\nmaximize revenue in a prior-independent approximation framework. We introduce a\nfamily of threshold-augmented mechanisms, which ensures ex-ante incentive\ncompatibility while boosting revenue through ex-ante thresholds. Based on these\nmechanisms, we construct the Peer-Max Mechanism, which achieves an either-or\napproximation guarantee for general non-identical distributions. Specifically,\nfor any value distributions, its expected revenue either achieves a constant\nfraction of the optimal social welfare, or surpasses the second-price revenue\nby a constant fraction, where the constants depend on the number of buyers and\na tunable parameter. We also provide an upper bound on the revenue achievable\nby any ex-ante incentive compatible mechanism, matching our lower bound up to a\nconstant factor. Finally, we extend our approach to a setting where multiple\nunits of identical items are sold to buyers with multi-unit demands.",

We consider both Navier-Stokes generated turbulent\nfields as well as artificially generated homogeneous isotropic stochastic\nfields. We use Fourier pseudospectral direct numerical simulations to study the\nmixing dynamics of two non-reacting species of different density ratios. We use\nthe Atwood number to create a denser mixture and a lighter mixture. We show\nthat in the absence of stirring, a denser mixture homogenizes faster than the\nlighter mixture. The direction of the density gradient causes the interface\nacross which the molecular diffusion occurs to expand outward for the denser\nmixture and inward for the lighter mixture. The stirring process, which\nenhances the diffusion process, increases the rate of homogenization in both\nmixing methods under study. We define a new mixing metric for studying the\nmixing evolution of active scalars, which indicates that a denser inhomogeneity\nin a lighter mixture spreads faster but homogenizes slower. For low Mach number\nturbulence, there is a negligible coupling between the density gradients and\nthe velocity field responsible for stirring. The post-stirring behavior of\nactive scalars is found to be similar to passive scalars, where the scalar\nenergy spectra decay exponentially and exhibit self-similarity. The turbulence\nfields generated by solving the Navier-Stokes equation homogenize both the\nmixtures faster than the synthetic cases.

Currently, second-generation Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors can\nonly measure the BNS merger rate density history at low redshifts ($z$ $\\sim$\n0.1). Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) may trace the BNS merger to higher\nredshifts ($z$ $\\sim$ 3). However, not all BNS mergers result in sGRBs, and it\nis not certain that all sGRBs originate from BNS mergers. In this study, we\nsimultaneously utilize simulated BNS merger GW signals detected by the advanced\nLIGO design and sGRB signals detected by {\\it Fermi}/GBM to constrain the BNS\nmerger rate density history up to $z$ $\\sim$ 3. The results indicate that with\n$\\sim$ 8 GWs and 571 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured with an\naccuracy of about 50\\% through $z=0$ to $z=1$. The ratio of the jet opening\nangle-corrected sGRB event rate density to the BNS merger rate density, denoted\nas $\\eta$, can be constrained to a relative uncertainty of 45\\%. With $\\sim$ 21\nGWs and 761 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured to approximately\n35\\% and 40\\% at $z=0$ and $z=1$, respectively. Meanwhile, $\\eta$ can be\nconstrained to a relative uncertainty of 28\\%. Additionally, in our\nparameterized simulation, we find that at least approximately $\\sim$550 sGRBs\nare needed to constrain the characteristic delay time in the star formation\nrate model, given a relative error of 50\\% in the estimated redshift.",

    "abstract": "Habitat assessment at local scales -- critical for enhancing biodiversity and\nguiding conservation priorities -- often relies on expert field survey that can\nbe costly, motivating the exploration of AI-driven tools to automate and refine\nthis process. While most AI-driven habitat mapping depends on remote sensing,\nit is often constrained by sensor availability, weather, and coarse resolution.\nIn contrast, ground-level imagery captures essential structural and\ncompositional cues invisible from above and remains underexplored for robust,\nfine-grained habitat classification. This study addresses this gap by applying\nstate-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to ground-level habitat\nimagery. Leveraging data from the UK Countryside Survey covering 18 broad\nhabitat types, we evaluate two families of models -- convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) -- under both supervised and\nsupervised contrastive learning paradigms. Our results demonstrate that ViTs\nconsistently outperform state-of-the-art CNN baselines on key classification\nmetrics (Top-3 accuracy = 91\\%, MCC = 0.66) and offer more interpretable scene\nunderstanding tailored to ground-level images. Moreover, supervised contrastive\nlearning significantly reduces misclassification rates among visually similar\nhabitats (e.g., Improved vs. Neutral Grassland), driven by a more\ndiscriminative embedding space. Finally, our best model performs on par with\nexperienced ecological experts in habitat classification from images,\nunderscoring the promise of expert-level automated assessment. By integrating\nadvanced AI with ecological expertise, this research establishes a scalable,\ncost-effective framework for ground-level habitat monitoring to accelerate\nbiodiversity conservation and inform land-use decisions at the national scale.",

Their existence raises many questions\nabout their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline\nin number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from $z=6$ to $z=3$. In this\nstudy, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate\ndescendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a\nblue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude\nselection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at $z<4$, surrounded by young,\nblue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single\nS\\'ersic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using\na stellar-only model. These \"post-LRD\" candidates show LRD-like features with\n$M_\\ast \\sim 10^{10} \\ M_\\odot $, central densities ($ \\Sigma_\\ast \\sim 10^{11}\n\\ M_\\odot \\ \\text{kpc}^{-2}$ ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but\nwith an added extended component. Their number density at $z = 3 \\pm 0.5$ ( $\n\\sim 10^{-4.15} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-3} $) matches that of LRDs at $5 < z < 7$ ,\nsupporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent\nincrease in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from $\\sim 250$ pc at $ z =\n5 $ to $\\sim 600$ pc at $ z = 3 $-suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile,\nthe core remains red and compact, but the V-shape fades as the outskirts grow.\nThese findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire\nan extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may\nexplain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower\nredshift.",

Small vascular branches are often overlooked due to\ntheir low contrast\n  compared to surrounding tissues, leading to incomplete vessel segmentation.\nFurthermore, the\n  complex vascular topology prevents the model from accurately capturing and\nreconstructing vascular\n  structure, resulting in incorrect topology, such as breakpoints at the\nbifurcation of the vascular tree.\n  To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel vessel segmentation\nframework called PASC Net.

    "abstract": "Domain Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing (DGFAS) methods effectively capture\ndomain-invariant features by aligning the directions (weights) of local\ndecision boundaries across domains. However, the bias terms associated with\nthese boundaries remain misaligned, leading to inconsistent classification\nthresholds and degraded performance on unseen target domains. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel DGFAS framework that jointly aligns weights and\nbiases through Feature Orthogonal Decomposition (FOD) and Group-wise Scaling\nRisk Minimization (GS-RM). Specifically, GS-RM facilitates bias alignment by\nbalancing group-wise losses across multiple domains. FOD employs the\nGram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to decompose the feature space\nexplicitly into domain-invariant and domain-specific subspaces. By enforcing\northogonality between domain-specific and domain-invariant features during\ntraining using domain labels, FOD ensures effective weight alignment across\ndomains without negatively impacting bias alignment. Additionally, we introduce\nExpected Calibration Error (ECE) as a novel evaluation metric for\nquantitatively assessing the effectiveness of our method in aligning bias terms\nacross domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nour approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently improving\naccuracy, reducing bias misalignment, and enhancing generalization stability on\nunseen target domains.",

    "abstract": "Code readability is one of the main aspects of code quality, influenced by\nvarious properties like identifier names, comments, code structure, and\nadherence to standards. However, measuring this attribute poses challenges in\nboth industry and academia. While static analysis tools assess attributes such\nas code smells and comment percentage, code reviews introduce an element of\nsubjectivity. This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nevaluate code quality attributes related to its readability in a standardized,\nreproducible, and consistent manner. We conducted a quasi-experiment study to\nmeasure the effects of code changes on Large Language Model (LLM)s\ninterpretation regarding its readability quality attribute. Nine LLMs were\ntested, undergoing three interventions: removing comments, replacing identifier\nnames with obscure names, and refactoring to remove code smells. Each\nintervention involved 10 batch analyses per LLM, collecting data on response\nvariability. We compared the results with a known reference model and tool. The\nresults showed that all LLMs were sensitive to the interventions, with\nagreement with the reference classifier being high for the original and\nrefactored code scenarios. The LLMs demonstrated a strong semantic sensitivity\nthat the reference model did not fully capture. A thematic analysis of the LLMs\nreasoning confirmed their evaluations directly reflected the nature of each\nintervention. The models also exhibited response variability, with 9.37% to\n14.58% of executions showing a standard deviation greater than zero, indicating\nresponse oscillation, though this did not always compromise the statistical\nsignificance of the results. LLMs demonstrated potential for evaluating\nsemantic quality aspects, such as coherence between identifier names, comments,\nand documentation with code purpose.",

In this work, we\nexplore the potential of synthetic data from driving world models to enhance\nthe diversity of labeled data for robustifying BEV segmentation. Yet, our\npreliminary findings reveal that generation noise in synthetic data compromises\nefficient BEV model learning. To fully harness the potential of synthetic data\nfrom world models, this paper proposes NRSeg, a noise-resilient learning\nframework for BEV semantic segmentation. Specifically, a Perspective-Geometry\nConsistency Metric (PGCM) is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the guidance\ncapability of generated data for model learning. This metric originates from\nthe alignment measure between the perspective road mask of generated data and\nthe mask projected from the BEV labels. Moreover, a Bi-Distribution Parallel\nPrediction (BiDPP) is designed to enhance the inherent robustness of the model,\nwhere the learning process is constrained through parallel prediction of\nmultinomial and Dirichlet distributions. The former efficiently predicts\nsemantic probabilities, whereas the latter adopts evidential deep learning to\nrealize uncertainty quantification.

Current CDR research concentrates on\ntransferring cold-start users' information from the auxiliary domain to the\ntarget domain. However, these systems face two main issues: the\nunderutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain\nalignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target\ndomain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space\ndistribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal\ndata and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC). We first\nemploy a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features\nand leverage a large language model to uncover user features using prompt\nlearning without fine-tuning. Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion\nmodule to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This\napproach involves learning feature distribution from side users and\nunderstanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping\nusers. Subsequently, the trained diffusion module is used to generate feature\nvectors for cold-start users in the target domain, enabling the completion of\ncross-domain recommendation tasks.

To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce\nanswers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.\nUncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality\nof LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among\nthese methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown\nparticular promise, as these internal representations encode information\nrelevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this\npaper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often\nstruggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To\naddress this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with\nhidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances\nout-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most\ninformative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,\nenables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The\nexperiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features\ngenerally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain\nscenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when\nretaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic\nfeatures does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using\nthe full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some\nspecific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features\nrelative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why\nthe results are inconclusive.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality malware datasets that\nsupport advanced analysis techniques, particularly machine learning and agentic\nAI frameworks. Existing datasets often lack diversity, comprehensive labelling,\nand the complexity necessary for effective machine learning and agent-based AI\ntraining. To fill this gap, we developed a systematic approach for generating a\ndataset that combines automated malware execution in controlled virtual\nenvironments with dynamic monitoring tools. The resulting dataset comprises\nclean and infected memory snapshots across multiple malware families and\noperating systems, capturing detailed behavioural and environmental features.\nKey design decisions include applying ethical and legal compliance, thorough\nvalidation using both automated and manual methods, and comprehensive\ndocumentation to ensure replicability and integrity. The dataset's distinctive\nfeatures enable modelling system states and transitions, facilitating RL-based\nmalware detection and response strategies. This resource is significant for\nadvancing adaptive cybersecurity defences and digital forensic research. Its\nscope supports diverse malware scenarios and offers potential for broader\napplications in incident response and automated threat mitigation.",

However, finding\na stable dynamical system entails solving an optimization problem with bilinear\nmatrix inequality (BMI) constraints, a non-convex problem which, depending on\nthe number of scalar constraints and variables, demands significant\ncomputational resources and is susceptible to numerical issues such as\nfloating-point errors.

    "abstract": "The powerful jets of blazars have been historically considered as likely\nsites of high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration. However, particulars of the\nlaunched jet and the locations of leptonic and hadronic jet loading remain\nunclear. In the case when leptonic and hadronic particle injection occur\njointly, a temporal correlation between synchrotron radiation and neutrino\nproduction is expected. We use a first catalog of millimeter (mm) wavelength\nblazar light curves from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope for a time-dependent\ncorrelation with twelve years of muon neutrino events from the IceCube South\nPole Neutrino Observatory. Such mm emission is known to trace activity of the\nbright jet base, which is often self-absorbed at lower frequencies and\npotentially gamma-ray opaque. We perform an analysis of the population, as well\nas analyses of individual, selected sources. We do not observe a significant\nsignal from the stacked population. TXS 0506+056 is found as the most\nsignificant, individual source, though this detection is not globally\nsignificant in our analysis of selected AGN. Our results suggest that the\nmajority of mm-bright blazars are neutrino dim. In general, it is possible that\nmany blazars have lighter, leptonic jets, or that only selected blazars provide\nexceptional conditions for neutrino production.",

    "abstract": "Fault detection is crucial to ensure the reliability of navigation systems.\nHowever, mainstream fault detection methods are developed based on Gaussian\nassumptions on nominal errors, while current attempts at non-Gaussian fault\ndetection are either heuristic or lack rigorous statistical properties. The\nperformance and reliability of these methods are challenged in real-world\napplications. This paper proposes the jackknife detector, a fault detection\nmethod tailored for linearized pseudorange-based positioning systems under\nnon-Gaussian nominal errors. Specifically, by leveraging the jackknife\ntechnique, a test statistic is derived as a linear combination of measurement\nerrors, eliminating the need for restrictive distributional assumptions while\nmaintaining computational efficiency. A hypothesis test with the Bonferroni\ncorrection is then constructed to detect potential faults in measurements.\nTheoretical analysis proves the equivalence between the jackknife detector and\nthe solution separation (SS) detector, while revealing the former's superior\ncomputational efficiency. Through a worldwide simulation and a real-world\nsatellite clock anomaly detection experiment--both involving non-Gaussian\nnominal errors--the proposed jackknife detector demonstrates equivalent\ndetection performance to the SS detector but achieves a fourfold improvement in\ncomputational efficiency. These results highlight the jackknife detector's\nsubstantial potential for real-time applications requiring robust and efficient\nfault detection in non-Gaussian noise environments.",

This approach revealed that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling introduces a mixed\nterm that links the Einstein tensor to the kinetic terms, along with an\nadditional kinetic term associated with the box operator, echoing\ncharacteristics of Horndeski-like theories. Our findings confirm a violation of\nthe weak equivalence principle, as the geodesic equation incorporates an extra\nterm that, in the non-relativistic limit, leads to a modified Newtonian\nequation.

    "abstract": "We introduce an efficient and elegant combination generator for producing all\ncombinations of size less than or equal to K, designed for exhaustive\ngeneration and combinatorial optimization tasks. This generator can be\nimplemented to achieve what we define as optimal efficiency: constant amortized\ntime, optimal cache utilization, embarrassingly parallel execution, and a\nrecursive structure compatible with pruning-based search. These properties are\ndifficult to satisfy simultaneously in existing generators. For example,\nclassical Gray code or lexicographic generators are typically list-based and\nsequentially defined, making them difficult to vectorized, inefficient in cache\nusage, and inherently hard to parallelize. Generators based on unranking\nmethods, while easy to parallelize, are non-recursive. These limitations reduce\ntheir applicability in our target applications, where both computational\nefficiency and recursion are crucial. We adapt Bird's algebra of\nprogramming-style calculation to derive our algorithms, a formalism for\ndeveloping correct-by-construction programs from specifications. As a result,\nall generators in this paper are first formulated in their clearest\nspecification, and efficient definitions are derived constructively through\nequational reasoning, resulting in concise and elegant divide-and-conquer\ndefinitions. Beyond presenting a combination generator, we extend our approach\nto construct generators for K-permutations, nested combinations of\ncombinations, and nested permutation-combination structures.

    "abstract": "This work analyzes a fully discrete mixed finite element method in a Banach\nspace framework for solving nonstationary coupled fluid flow problems modeled\nby the Brinkman-Forchheimer equations, with applications to reverse osmosis.\nThe model couples unsteady $p$-type convective Brinkman-Forchheimer and\ntransport equations with nonlinear boundary conditions across a semi-permeable\nmembrane. A mixed formulation is used for the fluid equation\n(pseudostress-velocity) and for the transport equation (concentration, its\ngradient, and a Lagrange multiplier from the membrane condition). The\ncontinuous problem is reformulated in Banach spaces as a fixed-point problem,\nenabling a well-posedness analysis via differential-algebraic system theory.\nSpatial discretization employs lowest-order Raviart-Thomas elements for fluxes\nand piecewise constants for primal variables, while linear elements are used\nfor the Lagrange multiplier. A fully discrete Galerkin scheme with backward\nEuler time-stepping is proposed. Its well-posedness and stability are proven\nusing a fixed-point argument, and optimal convergence rates are established.\nNumerical results confirm the theoretical error estimates and demonstrate the\nmethod's effectiveness.",

Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation\ncan be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation\nacross multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate\neffectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from\npassive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a\nThree Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of\ntraining and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding\nself-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness,\nenhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks.\nThrough a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative\nmeta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to\n63\\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention,\ndespite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. We\nargue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge\nfoundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure\nLLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.",

This paper considers a\npersonalized FL framework based on model regularization, and proposes a model\naggregation algorithm named PRoBit+ to concurrently overcome these limitations.\nPRoBit+ employs one-bit stochastic quantization and maximum likelihood\nestimation for parameter aggregation, and dynamically adjusts the step size of\nparameter updates, improving training stability of deep neural networks under\nlow communication overhead and heterogeneous data distributions. PRoBit+'s\nstatistical analysis is then conducted and its Byzantine robustness is proved.\nThe $(\\epsilon,0)$-differential privacy and a convergence upper bound of the\nPRoBit+ based FL are also theoretically established in heterogeneous contexts.\nThe analysis illustrates the trade-off among transmission accuracy, security\nguarantees, and convergence rates, and also indicates that the performance\ndegradation caused by transmission errors and privacy protection can be\nprogressively eliminated at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/M)$ as the number of\nuploading clients $M$ increases. Comprehensive numerical experiments are\nconducted to assess PRoBit+ in comparison to benchmark methods across different\nByzantine attacks and varying proportions of malicious clients. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that PRoBit+ exhibits improved Byzantine\nrobustness over existing bit-based transmission schemes, minimal performance\ndegradation related to privacy protection, and nearly identical performance to\nfull-precision FedAvg in a secure environment.",

Using a conservative\n4$\\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson based statistical\nframework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match\nprobabilities $p < 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters\nsuch as Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and\nradio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger driven processes can fuel\nhigh energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain\nunclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and\na hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of AGN\nlike matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto\ncentral supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at\ngamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources\namong secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically\nmotivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work\nconstitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between\ngamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy\nmergers catalog, opening new avenues for understanding the role of galaxy\ninteractions in high-energy astrophysics.",

    "abstract": "The Lane-Emden equation, a nonlinear second-order ordinary differential\nequation, plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics and astrophysics,\nparticularly in modeling the structure of stellar interiors. Also referred to\nas the polytropic differential equation, it describes the behavior of\nself-gravitating polytropic spheres. In this study, we present a novel approach\nto the solution of the eigenvalue problem which arises when considering the\nLane-Emden equation for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 using Physics-Informed Neural\nNetworks (PINNs). The novelty of this work is that, we not only solve the\nLane-Emden equation via PINNS but we also determine the eigenvalue, r, which is\nthe stellar radius. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using Bayesian\noptimization in the Optuna framework to identify optimal values for the number\nof hidden layers, number of neurons, activation function, optimizer, and\nlearning rate for each value of n. The results show that, for n = 0, 1, PINNs\nachieve near-exact agreement with theoretical eigenvalues (errors < 0.000806%).\nWhile for more nonlinear cases, n = 2, 3 and n=4, PINNs yield errors below\n0.0009% and 0.05% respectively, validating their robustness.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding puzzle in urban science is whether there's an intrinsic match\nbetween human populations and the mass of their built environments. Previous\nfindings have revealed various urban properties scaling nonlinearly with\npopulation, yet existing models of city built mass are still dominated by\nper-capita linear thinking. Our analysis of >3,000 cities globally reveals\nuniversal sublinear scaling of city mass with population at both the city\n(\\{beta}=0.90) and neighborhood levels ({\\delta}=0.75). This means that larger\ncities and denser neighborhoods achieve economies of scale with less per-capita\nbuilt mass. Our theoretical framework further shows that city-level scaling\nemerges naturally from within-city disparities. This multi-scale understanding\nredefines \"over-built\" and \"under-built\" conditions as deviations from expected\nscaling patterns, implying either excessive environmental impacts or inadequate\nliving standards. Effective urban policy thus requires moving beyond simple\nper-capita assumptions, adopting scale-adjusted metrics and managing cities as\nnested, complex systems.",

    "abstract": "Radar sensors play a crucial role for perception systems in automated driving\nbut suffer from a high level of noise. In the past, this could be solved by\nstrict filters, which remove most false positives at the expense of undetected\nobjects. Future highly automated functions are much more demanding with respect\nto error rate. Hence, if the radar sensor serves as a component of perception\nsystems for such functions, a simple filter strategy cannot be applied. In this\npaper, we present a modified filtering approach which is characterized by the\nidea to vary the filtering depending on the potential of harmful collision with\nthe object which is potentially represented by the radar point. We propose an\nalgorithm which determines a criticality score for each point based on the\nplanned or presumable trajectory of the automated vehicle. Points identified as\nvery critical can trigger manifold actions to confirm or deny object presence.\nOur pipeline introduces criticality regions. The filter threshold in these\ncriticality regions is omitted. Commonly known radar data sets do not or barely\nfeature critical scenes. Thus, we present an approach to evaluate our framework\nby adapting the planned trajectory towards vulnerable road users, which serve\nas ground truth critical points. Evaluation of the criticality metric prove\nhigh recall rates. Besides, our post-processing algorithm lowers the rate of\nnon-clustered critical points by 74.8 % in an exemplary setup compared to a\nmoderate, generic filter.",

Thus, multilevel\nsecond-order matrices and reconfigurable third-order matrices with 3-bit\ncontrol is realized. For larger reconfigurable rotation angles, tunable\nbraiding operations are also demonstrated.

Our analysis demonstrates that noise disrupts the convergence of\ndeterministic trajectories toward extinction by altering the phase space\ntopology, enabling back-transitions to viable states. This mechanism gives rise\nto noise-induced metastability and reveals a form of stochastic robustness not\ncaptured by deterministic models. These findings suggest that natural\nfluctuations can serve as a stabilizing force in complex systems, offering a\ncompelling counter-narrative to classical models in ecology, epidemiology, and\nbeyond.

Using four velocity tracers from the\nbroad H$\\beta$ width at half-maximum ($\\rm FWHM_{\\rm H\\beta} $) or the line\ndispersion from the mean or rms spectra, $f$ for each RM epoch are calculated.\nSignificant correlations are found between $f$ and observational parameters,\nsuch as the broad line widths, the Eddington ratios and the line profile\nshapes. For NGC 5548, $f \\propto \\rm {FWHM}_{mean}^{-0.70\\pm0.13}$ and for NGC\n4151, $f \\propto \\rm {FWHM}_{mean}^{-3.31\\pm0.59}$. This suggests that a\nvariable $f$ should be included to weight the virial SMBH mass. Using a simple\nmodel of thick-disc broad line regions (BLRs), we show that changes in mean\ninclination can explain $f$ variation. The inclination range is $14.1-40.6$ deg\nfor NGC 5548 and $14.0-55.1$ deg for NGC 4151. Modeling the light curves of $f$\nwith a damped random walk process yields mean timescales of 638 and 668 days,\nconsistent with BLR dynamical timescales within uncertainties. This indicates\nthat $f$ variations are linked to BLR dynamics, likely due to changes in\ngeometry or inclination.",

Here, we\nestablish that fairness -- in terms of a relaxation of envy-freeness -- and\nPareto efficiency can always be achieved together. Specifically, our fairness\nguarantees are in terms of envy-freeness up to $k$ reallocations (EFR-$k$): An\nallocation $A$ of the indivisible items is said to be EFR-$k$ if there exists a\nsubset $R$ of at most $k$ items such that, for each agent $i$, we can reassign\nitems from within $R$ (in $A$) and obtain an allocation, $A^i$, which is\nenvy-free for $i$. We establish that, when allocating mixed manna among $n$\nagents with additive valuations, an EFR-$(n-1)$ and Pareto optimal (PO)\nallocation $A$ always exists. Further, the individual envy-free allocations\n$A^i$, induced by reassignments, are also PO. In addition, we prove that such\nfair and efficient allocations are efficiently computable when the number of\nagents, $n$, is fixed.\n  We also obtain positive results focusing on EFR by itself (and without the PO\ndesideratum). Specifically, we show that an EFR-$(n-1)$ allocation of mixed\nmanna can be computed in polynomial time. In addition, we prove that when all\nthe items are goods, an EFR-${\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}$ allocation exists and can\nbe computed efficiently.

Inferring or evaluating whether two items have a complementary\nrelationship requires complementary relationship labels; however, defining\nthese labels is challenging because of the inherent ambiguity of such\nrelationships. Complementary labels based on user historical behavior logs\nattempt to capture these relationships, but often produce inconsistent and\nunreliable results. Recent efforts have introduced large language models (LLMs)\nto infer these relationships. However, these approaches provide a binary\nclassification without a nuanced understanding of complementary relationships.\nIn this study, we address these challenges by introducing Function-Based Labels\n(FBLs), a novel definition of complementary relationships independent of user\npurchase logs and the opaque decision processes of LLMs. We constructed a\nhuman-annotated FBLs dataset comprising 2,759 item pairs and demonstrated that\nit covered possible item relationships and minimized ambiguity. We then\nevaluated whether some machine learning (ML) methods using annotated FBLs could\naccurately infer labels for unseen item pairs, and whether LLM-generated\ncomplementary labels align with human perception. Our results demonstrate that\neven with limited data, ML models, such as logistic regression and SVM achieve\nhigh macro-F1 scores (approximately 0.82). Furthermore, LLMs, such as\ngpt-4o-mini, demonstrated high consistency (0.989) and classification accuracy\n(0.849) under the detailed definition of FBLs, indicating their potential as\neffective annotators that mimic human judgment.

Wormhole\nsolutions are derived by considering the radial pressure to admit an equation\nof state corresponding to Chaplygin gas. The Chaplygin gas equation of state is\ntaken into consideration in two different forms:\n$p_{r}=-\\frac{Bb(r)^{u}}{\\rho^{a}}$, $p_{r}=-\\frac{B}{\\rho^{a}}$. Wormhole\nmodels are also generated assuming that a variable barotropic fluid may explain\nthe radial pressure given by $p_{r} =-\\omega\\rho b(r)^u$. For every model, the\nshape function $b(r)$ is the function that can be derived from the wormhole\nmetric in any scenario. The stability analysis of the wormhole solutions and\nthe shape function viability for each situation are then investigated.Since\neach wormhole model is shown to violate the null energy condition (NEC), it can\nbe understood that these wormholes are traversable. More generally, we\ninvestigate whether the model is stable under the hydrostatic equilibrium state\ncondition using the TOV equation.The physical characteristics of these models\nare shown under the same energy circumstances. The typical characteristic is\nthe radial pressure $p_{r}$ near the wormhole throat, which violates the NEC\n$(\\rho+P_{r} \\geq0)$.

Our\nexperimental data on temporal width closely aligns with the predictions of this\nmodel. Additionally, we introduced a new concept: the atomic velocity group\nrelating to the two-photon resonance condition and the one-photon detuning in\nthis atomic frame. These two parameters are crucial for understanding the\nbehavior of the biphoton source. The concept indicates that the hot-atom source\nbehaves similarly to the cold-atom source.

    "abstract": "Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) considerably changed how\ntechnologies can influence language. While previous technologies could mediate\nor assist humans, there is now a tendency to offload the task of writing itself\nto these technologies, enabling them to change our linguistic ecosystem more\ndirectly. While they provide us quick access to information and impressively\nfluent output, beneath their apparent sophistication lies a subtle, more\ninsidious threat: the gradual decline and loss of linguistic diversity. With\nthis opinion piece, I explore how model collapse, with a particular focus on\ntranslation technology, can lead to the loss of linguistic forms, grammatical\nfeatures, and cultural nuance. Model collapse refers to the eventual\nconsequence of self-consuming training loops, where models reinforce their own\nbiases and lose linguistic diversity. Drawing on recent work in Computer\nVision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation (MT), I argue\nthat the tails of our linguistic distributions are vanishing, and with them,\nthe narratives and identities they carry. This is a call to resist linguistic\nflattening and to reimagine NLP as a field that encourages, values and protects\nexpressive multilingual lexical and linguistic diversity and creativity.",

    "abstract": "The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision\ntheory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no\nrational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce\nauxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal\ndiscounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve\nmathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually\nperceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative\napproach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse\npartitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are\ngrouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a\nrepresentative element of its group before being added. This method allows for\na phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a\nbehavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as\na definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a\nplausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might\nhandle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg\nseries can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed\npartition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral\nmodeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.",

However, the former requires\nboth a robotic system and a skilled operator, limiting scalability, while the\nlatter faces challenges in aligning the visual gap between human hand\ndemonstrations and the deployed robot observations. To address this, we propose\na human hand data collection system combined with our hand-to-gripper\ngenerative model, which translates human hand demonstrations into robot gripper\ndemonstrations, effectively bridging the observation gap. Specifically, a GoPro\nfisheye camera is mounted on the human wrist to capture human hand\ndemonstrations. We then train a generative model on a self-collected dataset of\npaired human hand and UMI gripper demonstrations, which have been processed\nusing a tailored data pre-processing strategy to ensure alignment in both\ntimestamps and observations. Therefore, given only human hand demonstrations,\nwe are able to automatically extract the corresponding SE(3) actions and\nintegrate them with high-quality generated robot demonstrations through our\ngeneration pipeline for training robotic policy model.

Traffic data\noften consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and\noccupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these\nvariables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to\ncapture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the\nMulti-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built\non the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles\nmultivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The\nproposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and\nseparates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions\ninto two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike\nprior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across\nall traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises\nin practice.

    "abstract": "Cache systems fundamentally limit modern computing performance due to their\ninability to precisely capture data relationships. While achieving 85-92% hit\nrates, traditional systems rely on statistical heuristics that cannot guarantee\nrelationship discovery, leading to suboptimal prefetching and resource waste.\nWe present PFCS (Prime Factorization Cache System), which leverages the\nmathematical uniqueness of prime factorization to achieve deterministic\nrelationship discovery with zero false positives. PFCS assigns unique primes to\ndata elements and represents relationships as composite numbers, enabling the\nrecovery of perfect relationships through factorization. A comprehensive\nevaluation across database, ML, and HPC workloads demonstrates an average\nperformance improvement of x 6.2, 98.9% hit rates, and a 38% power reduction\ncompared to state-of-the-art systems. The mathematical foundation provides\nformal guarantees impossible with approximation-based approaches, establishing\na new paradigm for cache system design",

We assume that a total of $M$ MTSs are\ndeployed, and that there are $L$ possible positions for each MTS. The resulting\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) maximization problem is difficult to tackle directly\nbecause of the coupling between the placement decisions of the different MTSs.\nMathematically, we are faced with a nonlinear discrete optimization problem\nwith $L^M$ possible solutions. A remarkable result shown in this paper is that\nthe above challenging problem can be efficiently solved within\n$O(ML^2\\log(ML))$ time. There are two key steps in developing the proposed\nalgorithm. First, we successfully decouple the placement variables of different\nMTSs by introducing a continuous auxiliary variable $\\mu$; the discrete primal\nvariables are now easy to optimize when $\\mu$ is held fixed, but the\noptimization problem of $\\mu$ is nonconvex. Second, we show that the\noptimization of continuous $\\mu$ can be recast into a discrete optimization\nproblem with only $LM$ possible solutions, so the optimal $\\mu$ can now be\nreadily obtained.

Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a\nconsistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align\nimbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal\ndata fusion.

Such\nextensive broadband modeling is essential for constraining the underlying\nmultiwavelength radiative mechanisms in the 3C 279 jet and permits to estimate\nthe physical parameters and explore their evolution in time. Our SED modeling\nstudy suggests that the increase in the Doppler beaming factor along with the\nvariation of the emitting electrons is the cause for the flares in this source.\nThe multiwavelength emission of 3C 279 was found to be well explained by the\nscenario in which the emission region is outside the BLR at a distance of\n$\\sim6.42\\times10^{3} R_S$.

AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent\ncoordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB)\nsystems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine,\nfacilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side\nPlatform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the\nAgent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation,\nperformance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent\nteams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform\n(DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline\nthe design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for\nagent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction-based methods have demonstrated very promising results for 3D\nanomaly detection. However, these methods face great challenges in handling\nhigh-precision point clouds due to the large scale and complex structure. In\nthis study, a Down-Up Sampling Network (DUS-Net) is proposed to reconstruct\nhigh-precision point clouds for 3D anomaly detection by preserving the group\ncenter geometric structure. The DUS-Net first introduces a Noise Generation\nmodule to generate noisy patches, which facilitates the diversity of training\ndata and strengthens the feature representation for reconstruction. Then, a\nDown-sampling Network~(Down-Net) is developed to learn an anomaly-free center\npoint cloud from patches with noise injection. Subsequently, an Up-sampling\nNetwork (Up-Net) is designed to reconstruct high-precision point clouds by\nfusing multi-scale up-sampling features. Our method leverages group centers for\nconstruction, enabling the preservation of geometric structure and providing a\nmore precise point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an\nObject-level AUROC of 79.9% and 79.5%, and a Point-level AUROC of 71.2% and\n84.7% on the Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet datasets, respectively.",

However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on\nmodeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,\nneglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every\nsensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and\nnon-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity\nclassification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a\ncasual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation\nlearning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an\nearly-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are\nrespectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an\nindependence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to\nimplicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling\nstrategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain\nperturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive\nexperiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our\ncausality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related\nstate-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and\ncross-position settings. Detailed ablation and visualizations analyses reveal\nunderlying casual mechanism, indicating its effectiveness, efficiency, and\nuniversality in cross-domain activity recognition scenario.",

However, in practice, only a small fraction of these\ncombinations are truly informative. Thus it is essential to select useful\nfeature combinations to reduce noise and manage memory consumption. While\nfeature selection methods have been extensively studied, they are typically\nlimited to selecting individual features. Extending these methods for\nhigh-order feature combination selection presents a significant challenge due\nto the exponential growth in time complexity when evaluating feature\ncombinations one by one. In this paper, we propose $\\textbf{TayFCS}$, a\nlightweight feature combination selection method that significantly improves\nmodel performance. Specifically, we propose the Taylor Expansion Scorer\n(TayScorer) module for field-wise Taylor expansion on the base model. Instead\nof evaluating all potential feature combinations' importance by repeatedly\nrunning experiments with feature adding and removal, this scorer only needs to\napproximate the importance based on their sub-components' gradients. This can\nbe simply computed with one backward pass based on a trained recommendation\nmodel. To further reduce information redundancy among feature combinations and\ntheir sub-components, we introduce Logistic Regression Elimination (LRE), which\nestimates the corresponding information gain based on the model prediction\nperformance. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate both the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

In\nparticular, Davidson's method for ties has been questioned, and we propose an\nalternative. We argue that the most correct use of this method is to estimate\nstrength parameters first, and then fix these to estimate a draw-propensity\nparameter, rather than estimating all parameters simultaneously, as Davidson\ndoes. This results in a model that is consistent with, and provides more\ncontext for, a simple method for handling draws proposed by Glickman.

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of\ndual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and\nrich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned\nvisible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nstate-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.",

    "abstract": "Soil salinity is a critical factor influencing agricultural productivity and\nenvironmental sustainability, requiring precise monitoring tools. This paper\nfocuses on developing a frequency-dependent model to predict soil salinity\nbased on electrical conductivity (EC) and volumetric water content (VWC). A\ndataset of 40 soil samples with varying levels of salinity and moisture,\nconsisting of two soil types (sandy and clayey), was experimentally measured\nfor EC in the frequency range of 10 to 295 MHz using electrical conductivity\nspectroscopy (ECS) measurement with the DAK-VNA (Dielectric Assessment Kit -\nVector Network Analyzer) system. A new, more comprehensive frequency-dependent\nmodel is proposed, surpassing previous models that lacked frequency\nconsiderations. This modelling approach was conducted in stages: initially, a\nfrequency-independent model for electrical conductivity as a function of\nsalinity and moisture was developed. Next, a frequency-dependent model was\nintroduced. Finally, a comparison between pure sandy soil and a sandy-clay\nmixture led to the final model, which also incorporates effective porosity. The\nresults of the proposed model, comparing measured and predicted values, provide\na robust approach to accurately predict soil salinity. Findings demonstrate\nthat the model can enhance salinity prediction accuracy, extending its\napplicability beyond agriculture to geological and hydrological applications in\nreal-world scenarios.",

Contemporary data-driven methods using neural radiance\nfields have achieved photorealistic driving scene modeling, but they suffer\nfrom low rendering efficacy. Recently, some approaches have explored 3D\nGaussian splatting for modeling dynamic urban scenes, enabling high-fidelity\nreconstruction and real-time rendering. However, these approaches often neglect\nto model fine-grained variations between frames and camera viewpoints, leading\nto suboptimal results. In this work, we propose a new approach named ArmGS that\nexploits composite driving Gaussian splatting with multi-granularity appearance\nrefinement for autonomous driving scene modeling. The core idea of our approach\nis devising a multi-level appearance modeling scheme to optimize a set of\ntransformation parameters for composite Gaussian refinement from multiple\ngranularities, ranging from local Gaussian level to global image level and\ndynamic actor level. This not only models global scene appearance variations\nbetween frames and camera viewpoints, but also models local fine-grained\nchanges of background and objects.

    ],
    "abstract": "In the famous Two Cultures paper, Leo Breiman provided a visionary\nperspective on the cultures of ''data models'' (modeling with consideration of\ndata generation) versus ''algorithmic models'' (vanilla machine learning\nmodels). I provide a modern perspective on these approaches. One of Breiman's\nkey arguments against data models is the ''Rashomon Effect,'' which is the\nexistence of many different-but-equally-good models. The Rashomon Effect\nimplies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated\nthe data. Conversely, one of his core advantages in favor of data models is\nsimplicity, as he claimed there exists an ''Occam Dilemma,'' i.e., an\naccuracy-simplicity tradeoff. After 25 years of powerful computers, it has\nbecome clear that this claim is not generally true, in that algorithmic models\ndo not need to be complex to be accurate; however, there are nuances that help\nexplain Breiman's logic, specifically, that by ''simple,'' he appears to\nconsider only linear models or unoptimized decision trees. Interestingly, the\nRashomon Effect is a key tool in proving the nullification of the Occam\nDilemma. To his credit though, Breiman did not have the benefit of modern\ncomputers, with which my observations are much easier to make.\n  Breiman's goal for interpretability was somewhat intertwined with causality:\nsimpler models can help reveal which variables have a causal relationship with\nthe outcome. However, I argue that causality can be investigated without the\nuse of single models, whether or not they are simple. Interpretability is\nuseful in its own right, and I think Breiman knew that too.\n  Technically, my modern perspective does not belong to either of Breiman's Two\nCultures, but shares the goals of both of them - causality, simplicity,\naccuracy - and shows that these goals can be accomplished in other ways,\nwithout the limitations Breiman was concerned about.",

The star is known\nto produce such emission (observed as periodic radio pulses) via electron\ncyclotron maser emission (ECME). However, past studies on ECME from this star\nwere confined to observations at specific rotational phase ranges where one\nexpects to see such pulses. We, for the first time, observed the star for its\none complete rotation cycle and discovered that the star also produces\n'off-pulse' emission, which we term as secondary enhancements. Two such\nenhancements were observed, one of which is left circularly polarized (LCP) and\nthe other is right circularly polarized (RCP), the latter is confirmed to be\npersistent. Using simulation, we infer that such pulses are likely related to\nthe large misalignment between the stellar rotation and magnetic dipole axes\n($>80^\\circ$), leading to the formation of highly complex magnetospheric plasma\ndistribution. In addition, by extracting dynamic spectra for the primary\npulses, we discovered prominent fine structures in one of the LCP pulses, with\ntimescales as small as the instrumental time resolution (8 seconds). This is\nthe first time that such structures are seen from a magnetic hot star, and has\nthe potential to reveal detailed information about how the emission is driven,\nand the nature of the elementary sources of radiation. To pinpoint the origin\nof these fine structures and their significance, higher time and spectral\nresolution observations should be conducted in the future.",

This paper argues that recent advances in neural\nnetworks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --\nrepresent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an\nexisting experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules\nformulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging\nempirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior\nas models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),\nwhich have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same\ntask. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions\nabout the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to\ncomplete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere\nimplementation of the pLoT solution.

    "abstract": "A Wi-Fi-enabled device, or simply Wi-Fi device, sporadically broadcasts probe\nrequest frames (PRFs) to discover nearby access points (APs), whether connected\nto an AP or not. To protect user privacy, unconnected devices often randomize\ntheir MAC addresses in the PRFs, known as MAC address randomization. While\nprior works have achieved accurate device counting under MAC address\nrandomization, they typically rely on machine learning, resulting in\ninefficient deployment due to the time-consuming processes of data cleaning,\nmodel training, and hyperparameter tuning. To enhance deployment efficiency, we\npropose RateCount, an accurate, lightweight, and learning-free counting\napproach based on the rate at which APs receive PRFs within a window. RateCount\nemploys a provably unbiased closed-form expression to estimate the device count\ntime-averaged over the window and an error model to compute the lower bound of\nthe estimation variance. We also demonstrate how to extend RateCount to people\ncounting by incorporating a device-to-person calibration scheme. Through\nextensive real-world experiments conducted at multiple sites spanning a wide\nrange of counts, we show that RateCount, without any deployment costs for\nmachine learning, achieves comparable counting accuracy with the\nstate-of-the-art learning-based device counting and improves previous people\ncounting schemes by a large margin.",

As agents and their environments grow\nmore complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but\ncritical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box\ntesting technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable\nagent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training\nflaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse\nenvironmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying\nconfigurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each\ngenerated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By\ncomparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies\nwhether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to\nunsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that\nAIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both\ntotal and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of\nautonomous agents.",

The unrestricted construction of recursive types\nand type bounds has made subtype decidability a much harder problem than in\ntraditional object-oriented programming.\n  Recognizing this, our paper introduces Nominal Wyvern, a DOT-like dependent\ntype system that takes an alternative approach: instead of having a uniform\nstructural syntax like DOT, Nominal Wyvern is designed around a \"semantic\nseparation\" between the nominal declaration of recursive types on the one hand,\nand the structural refinement of those types when they are used on the other.\nThis design naturally guides the user to avoid writing undecidably recursive\nstructural types.\n  From a technical standpoint, this separation also makes guaranteeing\ndecidability possible by allowing for an intuitive adaptation of material/shape\nseparation, a technique for achieving subtype decidability by separating types\nresponsible for subtyping constraints from types that represent concrete data.\nThe result is a type system with syntax and structure familiar to OOP users\nthat achieves decidability without compromising the expressiveness of F-bounded\npolymorphism and module systems as they are used in practice.",

Recent studies have revealed the sink token,\nwhich receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic\nrole. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token\nand other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden\nstates, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens\nconsistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we\npropose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these\nfindings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we\ndefine token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink\ntoken. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that\ntokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater\nimportance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our\nmethod results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to\nlayer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,\nwhile also achieving superior performance on LongBench.",

However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an\nentire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and\ninitial conditions.\n  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods\nto propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs.\nThese models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order\nLie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the\nremainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the\nremainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We\nshow how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using\ninteresting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting\nmodel can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical\nsystems modeled as ODEs.",

We develop analytic predictions of the biases from\nthe thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich and cosmic infrared background to CMB lensing\nauto- and cross-correlations with low-redshift matter tracers, as well as\nB-mode delensing, based on a halo model for the dominant one- and two-halo\ncontributions to the relevant foreground bi- and tri-spectra. The method is\nflexible enough to allow variations in cosmology, astrophysical modeling,\nexperimental configurations and analysis choices, thus enabling an improved\nunderstanding of the uncertainties involved in current mitigation strategies.\nWe find that the shape of the bias relative to the CMB lensing auto-spectrum\nsignal is remarkably insensitive to changes in cosmological and astrophysical\nparameter values.

    "abstract": "In this article, we will discuss the optimization of Shanghai's recycling\ncollection program, with the core of the task as making a decision among the\nchoice of the alternatives. We will be showing a vivid and comprehensive\napplication of the classical mathematical multi-criteria decision model:\nAnalytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), using the eigenvector method. We will also\nseek the key criteria for the sustainability development of human society, by\nassessing the important elements of waste recycling.First, we considered the\nevaluation for a quantified score of the benefits and costs of recycling\nhousehold glass wastes in Shanghai, respectively. In the evaluation of each\nscore, we both adopted the AHP method to build a hierarchical structure of the\nproblem we are facing. We first identified the key assessment criteria of the\nevaluation, on various perspectives including direct money costs and benefits,\nand further environmental and indirect considerations. Then, we distributed\nquestionnaires to our school science teachers, taking the geometric mean, to\nbuild the pairwise comparison matrix of the criterion. After the theoretical\nmodeling works are done, we began collecting the essential datasets for the\nevaluation of each score, by doing research on the official statistics,\nInternet information, market information and news reports. Sometimes, we\nproceed a logical pre-procession of the data from other data, if the data\nwanted isn't directly accessible. Then, we crucially considered the\ngeneralization of our mathematical model. We considered from several\nperspectives, including the extension of assessment criteria, and the\nconsideration of the dynamic interdependency between the wastes, inside a\nlimited transportation container.",

    "abstract": "Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy,\nand parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to\nachieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for\nhigh-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable\nregression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic\ncodes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are\ninfrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge\ncan address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we\ndemonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective\nregularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all\ndiagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters to\nsix or fewer, we reduce the dimensionality of the regression problem while\nmaintaining model interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging\nof predictors in OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which\nreduces the variance of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why\nbroader diagnostic groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly\ngranular ICD-10 codes in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.",

    "abstract": "Just like we classify lions and tigers into the same panthera, but into\ndifferent species, we can classify molecules and solids by their spatial and\nspin space symmetries. In magnetic molecules and solids, local moments of the\natoms can be represented by different colors; we can therefore classify these\nmaterials by playing with colors. The advantage of the multicolor group scheme\nis that it unifies the classifications into a single framework through\nmulticolor group theory, including the recently identified altermagnets and\n$p$-wave magnets. In particular, non-magnetic compounds fall into 0-color\ngroups, ferro/ferrimagnets fall into 1-color groups, antiferromagnets, as\nusual, fall into 2-color groups, and non-collinear magnets fall into the simple\nand complex multicolor groups. Moreover, confusions brought about by\nconventional magnetic-group classification can be resolved through this new\nframework.",

    "abstract": "Using the theoretical basis developed by Yao and Zeilberger, we consider\ncertain graph families whose structure results in a rational generating\nfunction for sequences related to spanning tree enumeration. Said families are\nPowers of Cycles and Powers of Path; later, we briefly discuss Torus graphs and\nGrid graphs. In each case we know, a priori, that the set of spanning trees of\nthe family of graphs can be described in terms of a finite-state-machine, and\nhence there is a finite transfer-matrix that guarantees the generating function\nis rational. Finding this ``grammar'', and hence the transfer-matrix is very\ntedious, so a much more efficient approach is to use experimental mathematics.\nSince computing numerical determinants is so fast, one can use the matrix tree\ntheorem to generate sufficiently many terms, then fit the data to a rational\nfunction. The whole procedure can be done rigorously a posteriori.",
