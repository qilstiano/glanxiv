In this research, GRAS/Geant4 simulations were\nperformed to characterise the count rates that a simple Cherenkov detector\ndesign would experience in a low Earth orbit, and we find that Cherenkov count\nrates due to most particle components vary significantly depending on many\ndifferent factors, including the location in the orbit, the date of the orbit,\nwhether or not the detector is within the van Allen belts, and whether or not a\nsolar particle event is occurring. We find that a small Cherenkov detector is\nreadily able to gather detailed data on both trapped particles and spectral\ninformation during Ground-Level Enhancements. We also investigate the use of\ncoincidence as a method to remove count rates due to trapped particles and\ndelta electrons, finding that this method is generally very effective for\nresolving count rates due to GLEs amongst intense trapped particle\nenvironments, but that some Cherenkov count rates due to trapped particles are\nstill observed in the simulated south Atlantic anomaly region.",

However, this approach offers no\nway to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for\nexample, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address\nthis gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the\nperformance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic\nconstraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of\nmaking a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining\nfrom a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the\nperformance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from\nthe MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better\naccuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds\n\\$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades\nwhen the cost of making a mistake is as low as \\$0.1. Overall, our findings\nsuggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models,\npractitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather\nthan attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely\ndwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.",

We present a more efficient\napproach that simultaneously guarantees a reliable estimate of the cosmic-ray\nimpact on the chemistry of prestellar cores. We introduce a numerical framework\nthat mimics the cosmic-ray propagation within gas clouds and applies it to\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the code GIZMO. It simulates the\ncosmic-ray attenuation by computing the effective column density of H$_2$ that\nis traversed, which is estimated using the same kernel weighting approach as\nemployed in the simulation. The obtained cosmic-ray ionisation rate is then\nused in post-processing to study the chemical evolution of the clouds. We found\nthat cosmic-ray propagation affects deuterated and non-deuterated species\nsignificantly and that it depends on the assumed cosmic-ray spectrum. We\nexplored correlations between the electron abundance, the cosmic-ray ionisation\nrate, and the abundance of the most relevant ions (HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$,\nDCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$, and o-H$_2$D$^+$), with the purpose of finding simple\nexpressions that link them. We provide an analytical formula to estimate the\nionisation fraction, X(e$^-$), from observable tracers and applied it to\nexisting observations of high-mass clumps. We obtained values of about\n10$^{-8}$, which is in line with previous works and with expectations for dense\nclouds.

Although well-studied in planar geometries, spatially localised\ndoubly diffusive convection has never been investigated in a spherical shell, a\ngeometry of relevance to astrophysics. In this paper, numerical simulation is\nused to compute spatially localised solutions of doubly diffusive convection in\nan axisymmetric spherical shell. Several families of spatially localised\nsolutions, named using variants of the word convecton, are found and their\nbifurcation diagram computed. The various convectons are distinguished by their\nsymmetry and by whether they are localised at the poles or at the equator. We\nfind that because the convection rolls that develop in the spherical shell are\nnot straight but curve around the inner sphere, their strength varies with\nlatitude, and the system is spatially modulated. As a result spatially periodic\nstates can no longer form and, much like in a planar system with non-standard\nboundary conditions, localised states are forced to arise via imperfect\nbifurcations.

In the language of diagrammatic perturbation theory,\n``commutator diagrams'' can be identified with non-parquet diagrams. We examine\nthe physical processes described by these terms and include the relevant\ndiagrams in a way that is suggested by the Jastrow-Feenberg approach. We show\nthat the corrections from non-parquet contributions are, at short distances,\nlarger than all other many-body effects.\n  We examine here neutron matter as a prototype of systems with state-dependent\ninteractions. Calculations are carried out for neutrons interacting via the\nso-called $v_8$ version of four popular interactions. We determine the\nstructure and effective interactions and apply the method to the calculation of\nthe energetics, structure and dynamic properties such as the single-particle\nself-energy and the dynamic response functions as well as BCS pairing in both\nsinglet and triplet states. We find that many-body correlations lead to a\nstrong reduction of the spin-orbit interaction, and, therefore, to a\nsuppression of the $^3P_2$ and $^3P_2$-$^3F_2$ gaps. We also find pairing in\n$^3P_0$ states; the strength of the pairing gap depends sensitively on the\npotential model employed.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, a class of stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) showing two\ndistinct light-curve peaks has emerged, where the first peak cannot be\nattributed to shock cooling emission. Such peculiar SNe are often studied\nindividually, explained by a combination of powering mechanisms, but are rarely\ndiscussed broadly as a group. In this paper, we attempt to form a picture of\nthe landscape of double-peaked SESNe and their powering mechanisms by adding\ntwo more objects -- SN 2021uvy and SN 2022hgk. SN 2021uvy is a broad, luminous\nSN Ib with an unusually long first peak rise and constant color evolution with\nrising photospheric temperature during the second peak. Though its first peak\nresembles SN 2019stc, their second peaks differ, making SN 2021uvy unique. SN\n2022hgk shows photometric similarity to SN 2019cad and spectroscopic similarity\nto SN 2005bf, both proposed to be powered by a double-nickel distribution in\ntheir ejecta. We analyze their light curves and colors, compare them with a\nsample of double-peaked SESNe from the ZTF archive, and analyze the light curve\nparameters of the sample. We observe a correlation (p-value~0.025) between the\npeak absolute magnitudes of the first and second peaks. No single definitive\npowering mechanism applies to the whole sample, as it shows variety in the\nphotometric and spectroscopic properties. However, sub-groups of similarity\nexist that can be explained by mechanisms like the double-nickel distribution,\nmagnetar central engine, interaction, and fallback accretion. We also map out\nthe duration between the peaks ($\\Delta t^{21}$) vs the difference between peak\nabsolute magnitudes ($\\Delta M^{21}$) as a phase-space that could potentially\ndelineate the most promising powering mechanisms for the double-peaked SESNe.",

A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with\ntemporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk pro-files. Evaluated on a\nlongitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and\nan F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false\nnegatives by 21%.

The magnetic field interaction control generated by magnetorquers\ncan overcome these weaknesses of propulsion. This actuation enables\nsimultaneous control of attitude and formation control among desired satellite\ngroups.

However,\nproximity operations often involve relatively short distances between\nsatellites, which can easily compromise the effectiveness of this\napproximation. To avoid model errors that could result in satellite collisions,\nwe utilize a magnetic field model described by Biot-Savart's law, without\ndistance approximations (Near-field model), in consideration of short-distance\noperations. To overcome the high computational cost associated with the coil\ngeometry and relative states information, a learning-based magnetic field\napproximation is derived, and its effectiveness is shown in the docking\nsimulation of target and chaser satellites equipped with electromagnetic coils\non three axes.

Once we are in\nthis setting, we focus our attention on the rigidly convex sets (RCSs) defined\nby these polynomials. In particular, we study the corresponding rigidly convex\nsets looking at spectrahedral relaxations constructed through the use of monic\nsymmetric linear matrix polynomials (MSLMPs) of small size and depending\npolynomially (actually just cubically) on the coefficients of the corresponding\npolynomials. We analyze how good are the obtained spectrahedral approximations\nto these rigidly convex sets. We do this analysis by measuring the behavior\nalong the diagonal, where we precisely recover the original univariate Eulerian\npolynomials. Thus we conclude that, measuring through the diagonal, our\nrelaxation-based spectrahedral method for approximation of the rigidly convex\nsets defined by multivariate Eulerian polynomials is highly accurate. In\nparticular, we see that this relaxation-based spectrahedral method for\napproximation of the rigidly convex sets defined by multivariate Eulerian\npolynomials provides bounds for the extreme roots of the corresponding\nunivariate Eulerian polynomials that are better than these already found in the\nliterature. All in all, this tells us that, at least close to the diagonal, the\nglobal outer approximation to the rigidly convex sets provided by this\nrelaxation-based spectrahedral method is itself highly accurate.",

Evaluating AoI under such conditions is challenging, as system\nstates become temporally correlated and traditional stationary analysis is\ninapplicable. We investigate an $M_{t}/G/1/1$ queueing system with a\ntime-varying sampling rate and probabilistic preemption, proposing a novel\nanalytical framework based on multi-dimensional partial differential equations\n(PDEs) to capture the time evolution of the system's status distribution. To\nsolve the PDEs, we develop a decomposition technique that breaks the\nhigh-dimensional PDE into lower-dimensional subsystems. Solving these\nsubsystems allows us to derive the Aol distribution at arbitrary time\ninstances. We show AoI does not exhibit a memoryless property, even with\nnegligible processing times, due to its dependence on the historical sampling\nprocess. Our framework extends to the stationary setting, where we derive a\nclosed-form expression for the Laplace-Stieltjes Transform (LST) of the\nsteady-state AoI. Numerical experiments reveal AoI exhibits a non-trivial lag\nin response to sampling rate changes. Our results also show that no single\npreemption probability or processing time distribution can minimize Aol\nviolation probability across all thresholds in either time-varying or\nstationary scenarios. Finally, we formulate an optimization problem and propose\na heuristic method to find sampling rates that reduce costs while satisfying\nAoI constraints.",

In order to build anomaly-free\nmodels, the $B-L$ charges of these exotic fermions must satisfy two constraint\nequations, known as the anomaly equations. Here, we focus on solutions\ninvolving four to eight new right-handed fermions, favoring cases where all the\n$B-L$ charges of these fermions are rational numbers. We showed that, when\nconsidering only the right-handed fermions necessary to realize the mechanism,\nthe solutions must have irrational charge values. By adding one more exotic\nsinglet fermion, which does not directly enter the mechanism mass matrix, it\nbecomes possible to find solutions with rational charges, while the addition of\na second one enables a reduction of the scalar sector. On top of the two\nanomaly equations, a set of inequalities and additional constraint equations\nwere added to correctly account for neutrino masses and to minimize the scalar\ncontent.

Although their main established function lacks\ndirect evidence in human olfaction, OBPs are traditionally believed to act as\nodorant transporters in the olfactory sense, which led to the exploration of\nOBPs as biomimetic sensor units in artificial noses. Now, available RNA-seq and\nproteomics data identified the expression of human OBPs (hOBP2A and hOBP2B) in\nboth, male and female reproductive tissues. This observation prompted the\nconjecture that OBPs may possess functions that go beyond the olfactory sense,\npotentially as hormone transporters. Such a function could further link them to\nthe tumorigenesis and cancer progression of hormone dependent cancer types\nincluding ovarian, breast, prostate and uterine cancer. In this structured\nreview, we use available data to explore the effects of genetic alterations\nsuch as somatic copy number aberrations and single nucleotide variants on OBP\nfunction and their corresponding gene expression profiles. Our computational\nanalyses suggest that somatic copy number aberrations in OBPs are associated\nwith large changes in gene expression in reproductive cancers while point\nmutations have little to no effect. Additionally, the structural\ncharacteristics of OBPs, together with other lipocalin family members, allow us\nto explore putative functions within the context of cancer biology.

At the microscopic level, we show that these TDs are responsible\nfor the dynamical breakdown of local orientational order, thereby linking\ntopological excitations to short-range structural changes. Finally, we\nestablish that the spatial localization and cooperative alignment of TDs\nunderlie the formation of macroscopic shear bands, which drive plastic flow\nunder large shear loads. This process is mediated by the quasi-periodic\nannihilation of large defect clusters and their geometric transformation from\nan approximately isotropic to a strongly anisotropic shape. Our results provide\na unified framework for understanding plastic deformation and shear band\nformation in two-dimensional amorphous systems by connecting topology,\nshort-range order, and mechanical response.",

We develop a quantum description of limit tori within the\nLindblad master-equation formalism for a system of two coupled\ndriven-dissipative Kerr cavities. Using the spectral theory of the Liouvillian\nand the truncated Wigner approximation, we analyze the system across the\nquantum-to-classical transition. In the classical limit, we identify two pairs\nof purely imaginary Liouvillian eigenvalues, corresponding to persistent\nquasiperiodic modes of the limit torus. Quantum fluctuations induce small\nnegative real parts to these eigenvalues, giving rise to finite lifetimes of\nthese modes. The corresponding Liouvillian gaps vanish algebraically in the\nclassical limit. This behavior signals a genuine continuous dynamical phase\ntransition, marked by the spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry.\nAnalysis of individual quantum trajectories reveals quantum-fluctuation-induced\ndephasing as the primary mechanism behind this \"quantum melting\" of the torus.\nWe quantify this dephasing using a circular-variance-based order parameter,\nrevealing universal scaling with both system size and time.

This has rekindled the\nlong-standing debate on whether these colors reflect the conditions of TNO\nformation or their subsequent collisional evolution. In this study, we address\nthis question with 98.7% certainty, using a model-agnostic, data-driven\napproach based on causal graphs. First, as a sanity check, we demonstrate how\nour model can replicate the currently accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical\nhistory, blindly and without any orbital modeling or physics-based assumptions.\nIn fact, our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune)\npredicts the existence of an unknown perturbing body, i.e., Neptune. We then\nshow how this model predicts, with high certainty, that the color of TNOs is\nthe root cause of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way\naround. This strongly suggests that the colors of TNOs reflect an underlying\ndynamical property, most likely their formation location. Moreover, our causal\nmodel excludes formation scenarios that invoke substantial color modification\nby subsequent irradiation.

Existing theoretical\nanalyses primarily rely on algorithm-independent techniques such as uniform\nconvergence, heavily utilising model structure to obtain generalisation bounds.\nIn this work, we instead leverage the algorithmic aspects that promote\ngeneralisation in diffusion models, developing a general theory of\nalgorithm-dependent generalisation for this setting.

It is thus critical to develop compact, efficient, and robust\nsources to generate such states. Here we report on a compact, narrowband,\nfiber-coupled source of two-mode squeezed states of light at 795 nm based on\nfour wave mixing (FWM) in a $^{85}$Rb atomic vapor. The source is designed in a\nsmall modular form factor, with two input fiber-coupled beams, the seed and\npump beams required for the FWM, and two output fibers, one for each of the\nmodes of the squeezed state. The system is optimized for low pump power (135\nmW) to achieve a maximum intensity-difference squeezing of 4.4 dB after the\noutput fibers at an analysis frequency of 1 MHz. The narrowband nature of the\nsource makes it ideal for atomic-based quantum sensing and quantum networking\nconfigurations that rely on atomic quantum memories. Such a source paves the\nway for a versatile and portable platform for applications in quantum\ninformation science.",

    "abstract": "The Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem refers to the question of the\nexistence of a Nash equilibrium in an abstract economy. This model is due to\nKenneth J. Arrow and Gerard Debreu in their pioneering work from 1954. An\nabstract economy is an extension of John Nash's original concept of a\nnon-cooperative game from the 1950's. Here players selfishly seek to maximize\ntheir profits, which may depend on the others' choices. The novelty of an\nabstract economy is that the players may now mutually constrain each-other in\ntheir decision-making. A Nash equilibrium is reached when no player alone can\nincrease his profit by a unilateral change of strategy. Abstract economies have\nfound widespread applications from welfare economy, economic analysis and\npolicy-making to constrained optimization, partial differential equations and\noptimal allocation.\n  We generalize Leigh Tesfatsion's Nash equilibrium existence result to\nabstract economies without resorting to commonly employed convexity\nassumptions, thereby also re-proving all known Nash equilibrium existence\nresults as special cases. A key element of our proof is the translation of the\nGeneralized Nash Equilibrium Problem into the question of the existence of a\ncoincidence of two particularly defined maps, and the application of a\ncoincidence result from algebraic topology due to Samuel Eilenberg and Deane\nMontgomery in 1946.",

Furthermore, we analyse symmetries in first-passage problems of\nfluctuating currents with two boundaries. We show that optimal currents --\nthose for which the effective affinity fully accounts for the dissipation --\nsatisfy a symmetry property: the current's average speed to reach the positive\nthreshold equals the current's speed to reach the negative threshold.

Apparent deviations from the\n`Poissonian' value can arise when significant correlations or anti-correlations\nare localised on small spatial scales.

In the context of simulations, if clustering is treated as the tracer\nof a discretised underlying density field, any sub- or super-Poissonian\nsampling of the tracer induces such small-scale modifications and vice versa;\nwe show this explicitly using recent innovations in angular power spectrum\nestimation from discrete catalogues. Finally, we show that the full covariance\nof clustering power spectra can also be computed explicitly: it depends only on\nthe two-, three- and four-point statistics of the point process.

However, existing models typically produce\nonly short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and\nreal-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing\nStreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on\nflow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with\ndifferent partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content\nconsistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with\nvarying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,\nwe train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a\nmultistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is\nperformed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,\nthe total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of\nchunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance\nat 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We\nevaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our\nmodel enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive\ngeneration, and video-to-video.

In particular, detached TNOs with\norbital inclinations below ~25 degrees are not easily generated from any known\nmechanism currently in the modern solar system. One notable hypothesis for the\norigins of detached TNOs is that a ~Mars- to Earth-mass planetary embryo\ndetached the perihelia of these objects from Neptune during the process of\nKuiper belt formation before the embryo itself was ejected. We numerically\nmodel this scenario via simulations of Kuiper belt formation from a primordial\nplanetesimal belt that is dispersed through the migration of the giant planets.\nIn addition to ~100,000 Kuiper belt objects, each of our simulations contains a\nhypothetical population of embryos in the primordial belt. We find that our\nembryos are unlikely to reach the high-perihelion, large semimajor axis orbit\nnecessary to efficiently detach TNO perihelia from Neptune's influence.\nMoreover, embryos will typically take at least 100 Myrs to reach these unlikely\norbits, at which point most of the primordial belt will have already been\nejected by the planets, limiting the available population that can be detached.\nFinally, the TNOs that our embryos do detach consistently have a semimajor axis\ndistribution that is more biased toward small values than observed detached\nTNOs have. Thus, we conclude that planetary embryos in the primordial Kuiper\nbelt are not likely to have been the primary mechanism for the origin of\ndetached TNOs.",

    "abstract": "The large-scale structure survey J-PAS is taking data since October 2023. In\nthis work, we present a forecast based on the Fisher matrix method to establish\nits sensitivity to the sum of the neutrino masses. We adapt the Fisher Galaxy\nSurvey Code (FARO) to account for the neutrino mass under various\nconfigurations applied to galaxy clustering measurements. This approach allows\nus to test the sensitivity of J-PAS to the neutrino mass across different\ntracers, with and without non-linear corrections, and under varying sky\ncoverage. We perform our forecast for two cosmological models: $\\Lambda CDM +\n\\sum m_\\nu$ and $w_0w_a CDM + \\sum m_\\nu$. We combine our J-PAS forecast with\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck Collaboration and Type\nIa supernova (SN) data from Pantheon Plus. Our analysis shows that, for a sky\ncoverage of 8,500 square degrees, J-PAS galaxy clustering data alone will\nconstrain the sum of the neutrino masses to an upper limit at 95\\% C.L of $\\sum\nm_\\nu < 0.32$ eV for the $\\Lambda CDM + \\sum m_\\nu$ model, and $\\sum m_\\nu <\n0.36$ eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \\sum m_\\nu$ model. When combined with Planck\ndata, the upper limit improves significantly. For J-PAS+Planck at 95\\% C.L, we\nfind $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.061$ eV for the $\\Lambda CDM + \\sum m_\\nu$ model, and for\nJ-PAS+Planck+Pantheon Plus, we obtain $\\sum m_\\nu < 0.12$ eV for the $w_0w_a\nCDM + \\sum m_\\nu$ model. These results demonstrate that J-PAS clustering\nmeasurements can play a crucial role in addressing challenges in the neutrino\nsector, including potential tensions between cosmological and terrestrial\nmeasurements of the neutrino mass, as well as in determining the mass ordering.",

Advances in computer vision and image processing technologies\npresent significant potential to address this gap by enhancing radiologists'\ncapabilities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Large language models (LLMs),\nparticularly generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), have become the\nprimary approach for understanding and generating textual data. In parallel,\nvision transformers (ViTs) have proven effective at converting visual data into\na format that LLMs can process efficiently. In this paper, we present ChestGPT,\na deep-learning framework that integrates the EVA ViT with the Llama 2 LLM to\nclassify diseases and localize regions of interest in chest X-ray images. The\nViT converts X-ray images into tokens, which are then fed, together with\nengineered prompts, into the LLM, enabling joint classification and\nlocalization of diseases. This approach incorporates transfer learning\ntechniques to enhance both explainability and performance. The proposed method\nachieved strong global disease classification performance on the VinDr-CXR\ndataset, with an F1 score of 0.76, and successfully localized pathologies by\ngenerating bounding boxes around the regions of interest. We also outline\nseveral task-specific prompts, in addition to general-purpose prompts, for\nscenarios radiologists might encounter.

Our solution is to\nexplicitly anchor the model in the underlying flow during training.

The estimation of particle size distributions is\ncommonly formulated as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, an\nill-posed inverse problem characterized by instability due to measurement noise\nand limited data. To address this, we use a Gaussian process prior to\nregularize the solution and integrate a normalization constraint into the\nGaussian process via two approaches: by constraining the Gaussian process using\na pseudo-measurement and by using Lagrange multipliers in the equivalent\noptimization problem. To improve computational efficiency, we employ a spectral\nexpansion of the covariance kernel using eigenfunctions of the Laplace\noperator, resulting in a computationally tractable low-rank representation\nwithout sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we investigate two complementary\nstrategies for hyperparameter estimation: a data-driven approach based on\nmaximizing the unconstrained log marginal likelihood, and an alternative\napproach where the physical constraints are taken into account. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed constrained Gaussian process\nregression framework accurately reconstructs particle size distributions,\nproducing numerically stable, smooth, and physically interpretable results.\nThis methodology provides a principled and efficient solution for addressing\ninverse scattering problems and related ill-posed integral equations.",

    "abstract": "Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of\nquestion. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn\nactivity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to\nclarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In\nthis paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based\nQuestion-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine\nthe automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in\nquestions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on\nseveral benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these\ndeficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and\nLlama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving\ndeficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as\nzero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the\nmodel now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)\ndecides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)\ndetermines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers\nthe resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without\nthe use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents\nwith transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An\nimprovement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies\nin the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional\nLLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,\nthe benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient\ncontext. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to\nharness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.",

However, these methods face challenges, such as\nredundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source\nand limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back\nwindows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to\nreduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics.\nAdditionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of\npatterns and trends over extended periods.

Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nfour benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models.

Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader\nchallenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,\nrequiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning\ndifferent temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose\nMemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system\nresource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of\nplaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling\ncost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates\nboth memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes\ncan be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions\nbetween memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.\nMemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings\ncontrollability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation\nfor continual learning and personalized modeling.",

    "abstract": "External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology\nstartups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a\ncritical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and\nresource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has\ninvestigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels\nconsider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more\nthan 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated\npost-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own\ndecisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals\nand several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work\nvalidating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its\nadoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we\nprompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors\nto a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business\nangel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated\nmachine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as\ninput features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy\n(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant\ncorrelation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional\nhuman-graded evaluations.

We simulate the interaction quench on the initial state which is the\nground state of harmonic potential with noninteracting bosons and fermions. We\nsolve the time-dependent many-boson Schr\\\"odinger equation exactly using\nnumerical methods. To understand the many-body dynamics we analyze several\nmeasures of many-body information entropy, monitoring their time evolution and\nassessing their dependence on interaction strength. We establish that for weak\ninteraction quench the dynamics is statistics independent, both dipolar bosons\nand fermions do not relax. Whereas it is significantly different for dipolar\nbosons from that of dipolar fermions in the stronger interaction quench. When\ndipolar bosons exhibit concurrent signature of relaxation in all entropy\nmeasures, dipolar fermions fail to relax. For dipolar bosons and for larger\ninteraction quench, the many-body information entropy measures dynamically\napproach the value predicted for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random\nmatrices, implying statistical relaxation. The relaxation time is uniquely\ndetermined when the orbital fragmentation exhibits a $1/M$ population in each\norbital ($M$ is the number of orbitals) and all entropy measures saturate to\nthe maximum entropy values. The relaxation time also becomes independent of the\nstrength of dipolar interaction. Whereas, for the same quench protocol, dipolar\nfermions exhibit modulated oscillations in all entropy dynamics. Our study is\nalso complemented by the measures of delocalization in Hilbert space, clearly\nestablishing the onset of chaos for strongly interacting dipolar bosons.

In\nthis paper, we use experiment, simulation, and theory to study a snake-like\nrobot as it undulates without sensory feedback through a narrow channel\ncontaining a linear array of boulder-like hemispherical obstacles. The profile\nof the boulder landscape approximates a one-dimensional potential introduced by\nAubry and Andr\\'e (AA) to study wave function localization in aperiodic\nlattices. The AA model provides a deterministically disordered alternative to\nthe better-known phenomenon of Anderson localization, which occurs in truly\nrandom disordered lattices. When the boulder landscape is strictly periodic,\nthe robot can pass completely through the channel. But if the landscape is\nsufficiently aperiodic, the robot becomes trapped and fails to exit the\nchannel. The metrics we use to quantify this transition -- including\nexponential distributions of robot position when localized -- agree well with\nearlier experimental and theoretical work on a localization transition that\noccurs when quantum waves interact with the AA potential. A theoretical\ntreatment of the robot's motion using resistive force theory modified to\ninclude spatially varying drag forces reproduces the behavior we observe.\nFurther, our results indicate that the transition is generated by large\nfluctuations in the driving torques required for self-propulsion. These results\npoint to a potentially fundamental connection between classical and quantum\nwave mechanics and the locomotion of undulators. Our study illustrates how\nanalogies with models from condensed matter physics and wave optics can lead to\nthe discovery of principles of self-propulsion in non-periodic landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Particles diffusing near interfaces face anisotropic resistance to motion due\nto hydrodynamic interactions. While this has been extensively studied near\n\\textit{hard} interfaces since the works of Lorentz and Brenner, our\nunderstanding of diffusion near \\textit{soft, thermally fluctuating} interfaces\nremains limited. Previous studies have predominantly focused on particles much\nlarger than the molecular scale at which thermal fluctuations become important.\nIn this work, we numerically investigate the dynamics of individual solvent\nmolecules near a thermally fluctuating lipid membrane, a canonical soft\ninterface in biology. We observe that diffusive motion of solvent molecules\nnear the fluctuating membrane is slightly enhanced compared to a flat rigid\ninterface and significantly more so than near an undulated rigid interface.\nThis enhancement in diffusive motion of solvent molecules arises from\nspontaneous momentum exchanges between the moving membrane and adjacent\nmolecules, promoting mixing. Notably, this dispersion effect overcomes\ngeometric trapping that slows diffusion near the rigid undulated interface. Our\nanalysis reveals that the momentum transfer near the fluctuating membrane is so\nefficient that it resembles an effective slip boundary condition over a length\nscale equal to the fluctuation height. These molecular-scale mechanisms differ\nfrom those of larger particles, where hydrodynamic memory and elasticity\neffects can be at play as they relax over timescales comparable to significant\ndiffusive motion. Our findings advance understanding of enhanced diffusive\nmotion and promoted mixing near soft fluctuating membranes involved in diverse\nbiological processes and soft-matter technologies containing natural and model\ncell membranes.",

Since the latter is observable, it\nseems that there is a preferred momentum routing set by experiments. However,\nit is shown in this work that the chiral anomaly is momentum-routing invariant.\nThis idea is specially important for situations in which there are no\nexperiments yet to decide on the momentum routing, like in supersymmetric\ntheories and in frameworks with CPT and Lorentz violation.

CosmoBench is the largest dataset of\nits kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter\nhalos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand\ndirected trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time\nscales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict\ncosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the\nvelocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,\nand to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time\nscales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established\napproaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.\nFor the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that\nare minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more\ncomputationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural\nnetworks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features\nsometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far\nlonger training times.

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the\nfields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its\nability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the\navailability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods\npredominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,\nfailing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.\nFurthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a\nsingle reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse\ndemands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic\nmethods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as\nthere is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural\nnetworks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and\nspecific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified\nneurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first\nintroduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query\nentity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching\nposterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is\nproposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as\nwell as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In\nthis way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by\nmerging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is\nproposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations\nover the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four\nreasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation)\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.",

In practical scenarios, the PDE\nevaluations used to build a response surface are often corrupted by numerical\nnoise, especially for the low-fidelity models. This noise, which may originate\nfrom loose solver tolerances, coarse discretisations, or transient effects, can\nlead to overfitting in MISC, degrading surrogate quality through nonphysical\noscillations and loss of convergence, thereby limiting its utility in\ndownstream tasks like uncertainty quantification, optimisation, and control. To\ncorrect this behaviour, we propose an improved version of MISC that can\nautomatically detect the presence of solver noise during the surrogate model\nconstruction and then ignore the exhausted fidelities. Our approach monitors\nthe spectral decay of the surrogate at each iteration, identifying stagnation\nin the coefficient spectrum that signals the onset of noise. Once detected, the\nalgorithm selectively halts the use of noisy fidelities, focusing computational\nresources on those fidelities that still provide meaningful information. The\neffectiveness of this approach is numerically validated on two challenging test\ncases: a parabolic advection--diffusion PDE with uncertain coefficients, and a\nparametric turbulent incompressible Navier--Stokes problem. The results\nshowcase the accuracy and robustness of the resulting multi-fidelity surrogate\nand its capability to extract relevant information, even from under-resolved\nmeshes not suitable for reliable single-fidelity computations.",

Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by\ndirectly leveraging graph topologies.

We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,\nrevealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and\nmeteorological variability.

By\ncombining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each\ncomponent, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse\nplanning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs\nalone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically\nperform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict\nmental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future\ndevelopment of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative\nagents.",

In fact $G/O(G)$ is isomorphic to either a $2$-group (in which case $G$\nis soluble), or $\\textrm{PSL}(2,q)$ or $\\textrm{PGL}(2,q)$ where $q$ is an odd\nprime power.

We derive tight expected runtime bounds of PAES-25 with one-bit\nmutation on $m$-LOTZ until the entire Pareto front is found: $\\Theta(n^3)$\niterations if $m=2$, $\\Theta(n^3 \\log^2(n))$ iterations if $m=4$ and\n$\\Theta(n(2n/m)^{m/2} \\log(n/m))$ iterations if $m>4$ where $n$ is the problem\nsize and $m$ the number of objectives. To the best of our knowledge, these are\nthe first known tight runtime bounds for an MOEA outperforming the best known\nupper bound of $O(n^{m+1})$ for (G)SEMO on $m$-LOTZ when $m$ is at least $4$.\nWe also show that archivers, such as the Adaptive Grid Archiver (AGA),\nHypervolume Archiver (HVA) or Multi-Level Grid Archiver (MGA), help to\ndistribute the set of solutions across the Pareto front of $m$-LOTZ\nefficiently.

These results prompted concerns about the emergence of\nharmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we\ncontextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts\nthe internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series\nof experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient\nvector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space\ndimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to \"emergent misalignment\" may be\nbetter interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning\non insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we\nidentify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs\nalignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and\nby misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can\ndegrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.\nOur findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed\nmisalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The\nresults underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that\npreserve intended behavior across domains.",

Using the Furukawa-Ito\nclassification of dual defective sets, we classify convenient Newton polytopes\nwith vanishing Newton numbers as certain Cayley sums called $B_k$-polytopes.\nThese $B_k$-polytopes generalize the $B_1$- and $B_2$-facets appearing in the\nlocal monodromy conjecture in the Newton non-degenerate case.

Vanishing of the $e$-Newton\nnumber characterizes the dual defective sets. The $e$-Newton number calculates\nthe algebraic degrees (Maximum Likelihood, Euclidean Distance, and Polar\ndegrees). For instance, we show that all the known formulas for the algebraic\ndegrees in the Newton non-degenerate case are implied by basic properties of\nthe $e$-Newton number.",

While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their\nextension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,\nthe challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled\nphysical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses\na foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator\nreflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we\npresent the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet\nvariants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly\ncoupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with\ndual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional\ncoupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic\nthermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient\nphase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical\nDeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked\nusing both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our\nresults demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is\ncrucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch\ncounterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer\nadvantages for decoupled or single-physics problems.

Even with up to 300 photons, the QNDness is only\nreduced by a few percent.

In typical workflows, raw diffraction\npatterns are commonly cropped to isolate the valid central region before\nreconstruction. However, if the crop is misaligned from the diffraction\npattern's zero-order, reconstruction may suffer from slower convergence, phase\nwrapping, and reduced image fidelity. These issues are further exacerbated in\nexperimental configurations involving reflective geometries or broadband\nillumination, where incorrect cropping introduces systematic preprocessing\nerrors that compromise the entire ptychographic inversion.

Implementing both types of alignment\nis a non-trivial task. To address this, we further analyze the linear and\nnonlinear forms of the well-established Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion\n(HSIC) and deliberately design feature mapping and feature pairing blocks\nwithin the CRA module.

SecureT2I is compatible with both general-purpose and\ndomain-specific models and can be integrated via lightweight fine-tuning\nwithout architectural changes.

A key challenge is\nthat occasional drivers' acceptance behavior towards offered tasks is uncertain\nand influenced by task properties and compensation. The current literature\nlacks formulations that fully address this challenge. Hence, we formulate an\nintegrated problem that maximizes total expected cost savings by offering task\nbundles to occasional drivers. To this end, we simultaneously determine the\noptimal bundle set, their assignment to occasional drivers, and compensations\nfor each pair while considering acceptance probabilities, which are captured\nvia generic logistic functions. The vast number of potential bundles, combined\nwith incorporating acceptance probabilities leads to a mixed-integer nonlinear\nprogram (MINLP) with exponentially many variables. Using mild assumptions, we\naddress these complexities by exploiting properties of the problem, leading to\nan exact linearization of the MINLP which we solve via a tailored exact column\ngeneration algorithm. Our algorithm uses a variant of the elementary shortest\npath problem with resource constraints (ESPPRC) that features a non-linear and\nnon-additive objective function as its subproblem, for which we develop\ntailored dominance and pruning strategies. We introduce several heuristic and\nexact variants and perform an extensive set of experiments evaluating the\nalgorithm performances and solution structures. The results demonstrate the\nefficiency of the algorithms for instances with up to 120 tasks and 60 drivers\nand highlight the advantages of integrated decision-making over sequential\napproaches.

Here, we introduce the\nPEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal\ndifferential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from\nchaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This\napproach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization\nlandscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process\nwithout distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by\nrecovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from\nnoise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of\nthe dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is\ncorrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that\nthis method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct\nsymbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount\nof data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method\nderives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as\nnetwork sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing\nyet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving\nmicroscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent\nrelationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and\nsynchrony in neural circuits.

By pumping a relatively low-Q resonance in the\nC-band, we excite a signal soliton comb centred around a far-detuned, high-Q\nO-band resonance. This process also generates repetition-rate-locked combs at\nthe pump and idler frequencies, with the latter occurring at a wavelength\nbeyond\n  2$\\mu$m. We demonstrate that the solitons supported by this platform are\ndistinct from other families of dissipative solitons and call them -\nhyperparametric solitons. They emerge when the narrow-band signal mode,\nphase-matched under negative pump detuning, reaches sufficient power to drive\nbistability in the parametric signal.

    "abstract": "We present a compact, ionization-based detector for the state-selective and\nspatially resolved measurement of individual Rydberg atoms trapped in the\nvicinity of an atom chip. The system combines an electrostatic lens system for\nguiding charged particles with an array of channel electron multipliers (CEMs)\ncapable of detecting both ions and electrons produced by ionization. Designed\nfor quantum information applications, this device enables the detection of\ncorrelations between spatially separated Rydberg qubits. Additionally, the\nelectrodes provide compensation for stray electric fields and control over\nparticle trajectories. The imaging system achieves a total magnification of\nmore than 12, with a single-axis magnification up to 200, while maintaining low\naberrations. We characterize the performance of the system using a charged\nparticle trajectory simulation software and discuss how a coincidence\nmeasurement of ions and electrons can be used to calibrate the detection\nefficiency. This detector enables high-fidelity measurement of multiple Rydberg\natoms and is well-suited for applications in cavity-mediated quantum gates.",

    "abstract": "Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications\ndemands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty\nquantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep\ntwin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation\nuncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty\n(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift\nregimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2\n+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head\nuncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty\ndominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced\nmultivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples\n(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=\n0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat.

    "abstract": "The emerging field of neuromorphic computing for edge control applications\nposes the need to quantitatively estimate and limit the number of spiking\nneurons, to reduce network complexity and optimize the number of neurons per\ncore and hence, the chip size, in an application-specific neuromorphic\nhardware. While rate-encoding for spiking neurons provides a robust way to\nencode signals with the same number of neurons as an ANN, it often lacks\nprecision. To achieve the desired accuracy, a population of neurons is often\nneeded to encode the complete range of input signals. However, using population\nencoding immensely increases the total number of neurons required for a\nparticular application, thus increasing the power consumption and on-board\nresource utilization. A transition from two neurons to a population of neurons\nfor the LQR control of a cartpole is shown in this work. The near-linear\nbehavior of a Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neuron can be exploited to achieve the\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control of a cartpole system. This has been\nshown in simulation, followed by a demonstration on a single-neuron hardware,\nknown as Lu.i. The improvement in control performance is then demonstrated by\nusing a population of varying numbers of neurons for similar control in the\nNengo Neural Engineering Framework, on CPU and on Intel's Loihi neuromorphic\nchip. Finally, linear control is demonstrated for four multi-linked pendula on\ncart systems, using a population of neurons in Nengo, followed by an\nimplementation of the same on Loihi. This study compares LQR control in the NEF\nusing $7$ control and $7$ neuromorphic performance metrics, followed by a\ncomparison with other conventional spiking and non-spiking controllers.",

This\nstudy investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization\nframework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five\nuse cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code\ngeneration, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how\nprompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases\ndemonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use\ncase and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed\nnotable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a\nsubstantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the\nrouter agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and\nof a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was\nexplored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%,\nusing the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance.\nOverall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt\noptimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning\nand example selection are optimized together.

Previous research tackles dataset inference\nby aggregating results of membership inference attacks (MIAs) -- methods to\ndetermine whether individual samples are a part of the training dataset.\nHowever, restricted by the low accuracy of MIAs, previous research mandates\ngrey-box access to $\\mathcal{M}$ to get intermediate outputs (probabilities,\nloss, perplexity, etc.) for obtaining satisfactory results.

Our method is enabled by two sets\nof locally built reference models, one set involving $\\mathcal{D}$ in training\nand the other not.

However, the O-phase is prone to lattice disordering at\nhigh temperatures, primarily via anti-site defect formation across the Ti and\nNb sites, which can reduce the material's creep resistance and high-temperature\ntensile properties, necessitating the need to identify strategies to mitigate\nthe disorder. Here, we focus on identifying suitable alloying additions to\nsuppress the disordering of the O-phase using density functional theory and\nnudged elastic band calculations. Specifically, we consider six different\nalloying additions, namely, V, Cr, Fe, Mo, Ta, and W, and examine their role in\nthe thermodynamics of anti-site formation and the kinetics of atomic diffusion.\nUpon verifying the ground state structure and formation energy of Ti$_2$AlNb,\nwe observe the proclivity of all alloying elements (except V) to occupy the Nb\nsite in the O-phase structure. Subsequently, we find that none of the alloying\nadditions can effectively suppress anti-site formation in Ti$_2$AlNb,\nhighlighting the unfavourable thermodynamics. However, we find that Mo and W\nadditions to Ti$_2$AlNb can kinetically suppress the disorder by reducing the\ndiffusivities of Ti and Nb, by $\\approx$4$\\times$ and 8$\\times$ compared to the\npristine O-phase, respectively, at an operating temperature of 823 K.

Yet, its practical realization has been\nseverely limited by the inherently weak spin-orbit coupling in typical systems,\nresulting in vanishingly small transverse shifts and extremely low scattering\nefficiency. This fundamental trade-off has rendered the PSHE observable only\nthrough complex weak measurement protocols and signal amplification-approaches\nthat come at the cost of further intensity loss, particularly in nanoscale\nsystems. In this work, we overcome this longstanding challenge by introducing a\nnovel mechanism based on symmetry breaking and mode coupling in a standalone\nscatterer, which unlocks a regime of Friedrich-Wintgen superscattering with\nstrong near-field spin-orbit interaction. This allows for simultaneous\nenhancement of both the photonic spin Hall shift and the far-field scattering\nintensity-boosting the latter by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to\nconventional dipolar particles. Through tailored multipolar interference, the\nPSHE is made accessible at experimentally convenient angles, enabling post\nselection-free detection. We report the first direct experimental observation\nof the PSHE from a single superscattering particle, achieved in the microwave\nregime via polarization-resolved far-field measurements. Our findings not only\nvalidate a new physical pathway for enhancing spin-dependent light-matter\ninteractions, but also establish a robust, scalable platform for spin-based\nphotonic technologies.

As the beamforming in the CAPA system is a function that maps a\ncoordinate on the aperture to the beamforming weight at the coordinate, a DNN\ncalled BeaINR is proposed to parameterize this function, which is called\nimplicit neural representation (INR). We further find that the optimal\nbeamforming function lies in the subspace of channel function, i.e., it can be\nexpressed as a weighted integral of channel function. Based on this finding, we\npropose another DNN called CoefINR to learn the weighting coefficient with INR,\nwhich has lower complexity than learning the beamforming function with BeaINR.\nSimulation results show that the proposed INR-based methods outperform\nnumerical baselines in both spectral efficiency (SE) and inference time, with\nCoefINR offering additional training efficiency.",

Additionally, we demonstrate\nthat performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be\nmitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance\nand explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will\nenhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity\nestimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance.",

Experimentally, ergodicity\nis lost because measurements are conducted within a finite time window. More\nthan seventy years ago, Kauzmann posed a fundamental question: If experiments\ncould run indefinitely, would there exist a critical temperature at which an\nergodicity-breaking phase transition occurs? Random first-order transitions\nrepresent the modern theoretical framework for this idea, rigorously\nestablished in the mean-field limit of high-dimensional atomistic systems and\nseveral idealized physical models. However, achieving theoretical understanding\nin finite dimensions is challenging, while experimental and numerical\nlimitations on accessible timescales hinder direct observation of the putative\nKauzmann transition. Here, we overcome this longstanding barrier by developing\na computational strategy that combines three advanced Monte Carlo methods to\naccess the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional atomistic\nglass-former down to zero temperature across a range of system sizes. This\nenables us to directly measure thermodynamic and structural observables that\nprovide unambiguous evidence that the system undergoes a Kauzmann transition at\na temperature that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. This transition is\ntowards an ideal glass state characterized by a complex energy landscape with a\nhierarchical organization of low-lying states. Our results are the first\ndemonstration that computer simulations can fully probe the statistical\nmechanics of the bulk transition to a non-ergodic glass state.

However,\ntraditional wireless sensing techniques mainly rely on the line-of-sight (LoS)\nassumptions, i.e., the sensing targets are directly visible to both the sensing\ntransmitter and receiver. This hinders ISAC systems to be applied in complex\nenvironments such as the urban low-altitude airspace, which usually suffers\nfrom signal blockage and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) multi-path propagation. To\naddress this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to enable\nenvironment-aware NLoS ISAC by leveraging the new technique called channel\nknowledge map (CKM), which was originally proposed for environment-aware\nwireless communications. One major novelty of our proposed method is that the\nsame CKM built for wireless communication can be directly used to enable NLoS\nwireless sensing, thus enjoying the benefits of ``killing two birds with one\nstone''. To this end, the sensing targets are treated as virtual user equipment\n(UE), and the wireless communication channel priors are transformed into the\nsensing channel priors, allowing one single CKM to serve dual purposes. We\nillustrate our proposed framework by a specific CKM called \\emph{channel\nangle-delay map} (CADM). Specifically, the proposed framework utilizes CADM to\nderive angle-delay priors of the sensing channel by exploiting the relationship\nbetween communication and sensing angle-delay distributions, enabling sensing\ntarget localization in the challenging NLoS environment. Extensive simulation\nresults demonstrate significant performance improvements over classic\ngeometry-based sensing methods, which is further validated by Cram\\'er-Rao\nLower Bound (CRLB) analysis.",

To study its structure and dynamics,\nmachine learning models are increasingly used to identify key microbial\npatterns associated with disease and environmental factors. However, microbiome\ndata present unique challenges due to their compositionality,\nhigh-dimensionality, sparsity, and high variability, which can obscure\nmeaningful signals. Besides, the effectiveness of machine learning models is\noften constrained by limited sample sizes, as microbiome data collection\nremains costly and time consuming. In this context, data augmentation has\nemerged as a promising strategy to enhance model robustness and predictive\nperformance by generating artificial microbiome data. The aim of this study is\nto improve predictive modeling from microbiome data by introducing a\nmodel-based data augmentation approach that incorporates both taxonomic\nrelationships and covariate information. To that end, we propose TaxaPLN, a\ndata augmentation method built on PLN-Tree generative models, which leverages\nthe taxonomy and a data-driven sampler to generate realistic synthetic\nmicrobiome compositions. We further introduce a conditional extension based on\nfeature-wise linear modulation, enabling covariate-aware generation.\nExperiments on high-quality curated microbiome datasets show that TaxaPLN\npreserves ecological properties and generally improves or maintains predictive\nperformances, particularly with non-linear classifiers, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

To overcome this\nfundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that\nelevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our\nframework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,\nincorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial\nDisentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual\ndescriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's\nfeatures to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns\na representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time\nCausal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM\ninterprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation\ndecoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct\nan extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public\ndatasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under\ncross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings.

We study the impact of a binary companion on low-J CO spectral\nlines of AGB star outflows. By varying the orbital separation and wind\nvelocity, we aim to find line shapes characteristic of more complex\nbinary-induced morphologies. We generated a grid of nine 3D models of a\nmass-losing AGB star using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code Phantom,\nwith three values for both the outflow velocity and orbital separation.\nUtilising the radiative transfer code Magritte, we created synthetic spectral\nlines for the low rotational transitions of CO at different inclinations and\nposition angles. Our simulations show a variety of morphologies, always with a\npronounced spiral structure arising in the orbital plane, but with varying\nshapes in the meridional plane, and different degrees of global flattening. We\nfind that the CO line profiles can deviate strongly from the parabolic or\nflat-topped profiles expected from spherically symmetric outflows. A variety of\nline shapes emerge, with two peaks near the terminal velocity, and a central\nbump near the central velocity being the most pronounced. In specific cases,\nthe spectral lines can appear parabolic, hiding the presence of a binary\ncompanion. We find the CO spectral lines can serve as a binary diagnostic.

    "abstract": "Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks\nin a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been\nproposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods\nusually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy\nfunction, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the\npossible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible\nassignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN\nremains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features\nwith an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper\nproposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with\ninfinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:\n(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call\nassignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment\ngraphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that\ncan learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.\nTo evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal\nassignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space\ndimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for\nrepresenting and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless\nof the state and action space dimensionalities.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation\nmodels in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are\noften domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications\nfor which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video\nmodeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as\ngeneral-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether\nthe knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be\neffectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,\npretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address\nthis, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five\n*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,\nand weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple\ntrainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the\npotential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that\nstate-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging\nthe general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our\nresults reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities\nfor the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific\napplications.

    "abstract": "Auditory streaming enables the brain to organize sequences of sounds into\nperceptually distinct sources, such as following a conversation in a noisy\nenvironment. A typical experiment for investigating perceptual boundaries and\nbistability is to present a subject with a stream containing two alternating\ntone stimuli. We investigate a model for the processing of such a stream\nconsisting of two identical neural populations of excitatory and inhibitory\nneurons. The populations are coupled via delayed cross-inhibition and\nperiodically forced with sharp step-type signals (the two-tone stream). We\ntrack how the perception boundary depends on threshold selection and establish\nhow boundaries between three different auditory perceptions (single tone versus\ntwo tones versus bistability between both perceptions) relate to bifurcations\nsuch as symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that these transitions are governed\nby symmetry-breaking bifurcations and that the perceptual classification based\non neural thresholds is highly sensitive to threshold choice. Our analysis\nreveals that a fixed threshold is insufficient to capture the true perceptual\nboundaries and proposes a variable-threshold criterion, informed by the\namplitude dynamics of neural responses. Finally, we illustrate how key stimulus\nparameters such as tone duration, delay, and internal time scale shape the\nboundaries of auditory perceptual organization in the plane of the two most\ncommonly varied experimental parameters, the representation rate, and the\ndifference in tone frequency. These findings offer mechanistic insight into\nauditory perception dynamics and provide a refined framework for linking neural\nactivity to perceptual organization.",

The lack of new discoveries since the Higgs boson, together with the\nlack of a new higher energy collider, has left searches for new physics\nconceptually and empirically wide open. Physicists must make use of the\nexperiment at hand while also creatively exploring alternatives that have not\nyet been explored. This encourages the pursuit of models that have at least one\nof two key features: i) they take radically novel approaches, or ii) are easily\ntestable. I present four cases, neutralino dark matter, the relaxion, repulsive\ngravity, and models of lepton flavour universality violation, and show that\neven if they do not exhibit traditional epistemic virtues, they are nonetheless\npursuitworthy. I argue that experimental context strongly determines\npursuitworthiness and I lay out the conditions under which experiment\nencourages the pursuit of ugly models.",

Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at\nelevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,\nsupplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D\nobject-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift\nintroduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a\n2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure\nroadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we\nemploy a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as\nparallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar\nposition, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which\nis unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of\nreal-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate\ngeneralizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather\nscenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection\naccuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse\nlighting and weather conditions.

To this end, we present a\nset of 21 VLT/SINFONI K-band observations from five archival programs at a\nspectral resolution of 4000. We aim to measure atmospheric properties, such as\ntemperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, to understand the similarities\nand differences between objects ranging from M5 to L5 in spectral type. We\nextracted the spectra of these targets with the TExTRIS code. Subsequently, we\nmodel them using ForMoSA, a Bayesian forward modeling tool for spectral\nanalysis, exploring four families of self-consistent atmospheric models: ATMO,\nBT-Settl, Exo-REM, and Sonora. Here we present the spectra of our targets and\nthe derived parameters from the atmospheric modeling. We observed a drop in\neffective temperature of more than 500 K as a function of spectral type at the\nM/L transition, likely related to limitations in the current atmospheric\nmodels. In addition, we report carbon-to-oxygen ratio measurements for three\ncompanions (2M 0103 AB b, AB Pic b, and CD-35 2722 b), which contribute to the\ngrowing list of exoplanets for which this value has been measured. In\nconclusion, the VLT/SINFONI Library highlights two key points. First, there is\na critical need to further investigate the discrepancies among grids of spectra\ngenerated by self-consistent models, as these models yield varying results and\ndo not uniformly explore the parameter space. Second, we do not observe\napparent discrepancies in the K-band spectra between companions and isolated\nbrown dwarfs, which potentially suggests that these super-Jupiter objects\nformed through a similar process; however, this warrants further investigation.",

We present a comprehensive\ngrid of 30 million stellar pulsation models, computed using the MESA stellar\nevolution code and the GYRE oscillation code, tailored specifically to delta\nScuti stars. The grid spans a wide range of masses, metallicities, and surface\nrotation velocities, and covers evolutionary phases from the early\npre-main-sequence through the main sequence and into the post-main-sequence\ncontraction phase. For each model, we compute hundreds of adiabatic pulsation\nfrequencies for degrees l = 0-3, capturing p-modes, g-modes, f-modes, and their\ninteractions through avoided crossings. Our analysis maps the behaviour of\nasteroseismic observables, including the large frequency separation (Delta nu)\nand the phase offset parameter (epsilon), across age, mass, and rotation. We\ninvestigate how these parameters change with evolutionary stage and revisit the\nscaling relations applicable to delta Scuti stars. This new model grid, which\nis publicly available, is designed to support the asteroseismology community in\ninterpreting delta Scuti pulsations and in probing the evolution and internal\nstructure of these stars. These improvements over previous model grids will\nallow for reliable age estimates and stronger constraints on stellar evolution\npathways and the timing of planet formation across A- and F-type stellar\npopulations.",

The\nGraph Neural Tangent Kernel provides a theoretical bridge by interpreting GNNs\nthrough the lens of neural tangent kernels. However, its reliance on deep,\nstacked layers introduces repeated computations that hinder performance. In\nthis work, we introduce a new perspective by designing the simplified graph\nkernel, which replaces deep layer stacking with a streamlined $K$-step message\naggregation process. This formulation avoids iterative layer-wise propagation\naltogether, leading to a more concise and computationally efficient framework\nwithout sacrificing the expressive power needed for graph tasks. Beyond this\nsimplification, we propose another Simplified Graph Kernel, which draws from\nGaussian Process theory to model infinite-width GNNs. Rather than simulating\nnetwork depth, this kernel analytically computes kernel values based on the\nstatistical behavior of nonlinear activations in the infinite limit. This\neliminates the need for explicit architecture simulation, further reducing\ncomplexity. Our experiments on standard graph and node classification\nbenchmarks show that our methods achieve competitive accuracy while reducing\nruntime.

Although\nclinical evaluations are often used in traditional diagnostic procedures,\nmachine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for improving stroke diagnosis.\nTo supplement traditional diagnostic techniques, this study investigates\nmachine learning models for early brain stroke prediction using CT scan images.\nThis research proposes a novel machine learning approach to brain stroke\ndetection, focusing on optimizing classification performance with pre-trained\ndeep learning models and advanced optimization strategies.

As a result, in a metal, the nematic\ncollective mode interacts with two different sets of gapless excitations: the\nparticle-hole excitations of the metal and the lattice fluctuations that become\nsoft at the induced structural transition, namely, the transverse acoustic\nphonons. However, the \\textit{dynamics} of these hybridized collective modes\nformed by the transverse acoustic phonons and the metallic electronic-nematic\nfluctuations has remained largely unexplored. Here we address this problem by\ndeveloping a formalism in which the nemato-elastic coupling is obtained\nmicroscopically from the direct coupling between electrons and transverse\nacoustic phonons enabled by impurities present in the crystal. We then\ndemonstrate the emergence of hybrid nemato-elastic modes that mix the\ncharacteristics of the transverse phonons and of the nematic fluctuations. Near\nthe nematic quantum critical point in a metal, two massless modes emerge with\nintertwined dynamic behaviors, implying that neither mode dominates the\nresponse of the system. We systematically study the non-trivial dependence of\nthese collective modes on the longitudinal and transverse momenta, revealing a\nrich landscape of underdamped and overdamped modes as the proximity to the\nquantum critical point and the strength of the electron-phonon coupling are\nchanged.

However, the resulting segmentation lacks\nsegment-level supervision, limiting the effectiveness of feedback between\nframes and action representations. To address this limitation, we propose\nClosed Loop Optimal Transport (CLOT), a novel OT-based framework with a\nmulti-level cyclic feature learning mechanism. Leveraging its encoder-decoder\narchitecture, CLOT learns pseudo-labels alongside frame and segment embeddings\nby solving two separate OT problems.

Recent core convection simulations, accounting for CMB\nheterogeneities, propose locally stable regions (or regional inversion lenses,\nRILs) rather than a global layer, allowing both stable and unstable regions to\ncoexist. In this study, we consider a suite of numerical simulations of\nthermal, chemical, and thermochemical convection models focussed on Ekman\nnumber ($E=10^{-5}$) with thermal and chemical flux Rayleigh numbers\n$\\widetilde{Ra}_T=30-4000$ and $\\widetilde{Ra}_C=30-100000$, and thermal and\nchemical Prandtl numbers $Pr_T=1$ and $Pr_\\xi=10$. Analysis of purely chemical\nmodels reveals light element accumulation (LEA) below the CMB, resulting in\neither locally stable regions near the poles or global layers, depending on the\nstrength of chemical forcing. These chemically stratified regions persist in\nour thermochemical models even if the thermal field is fully destabilising. The\naddition of a heterogeneous CMB heat flux leads to the formation of RILs driven\nby thermal stratification. Stable regions in these thermochemical models have\nvarying locations, properties, and morphologies depending on whether thermal or\nchemical convection dominates. In the investigated parameter range, these RILs\nare O(100 km) thick, and their strength and thickness generally increase with\nthe strength of thermal driving; they are comparatively less sensitive to the\nstrength of chemical driving.

Furthermore, while FMs\nachieve macro F1 scores > 0.70 on previously established benchmarks such as\nLizard and PanNuke, on PhenoCell, we observe scores as low as 0.20.

    "abstract": "One of the major breakthroughs in science of the last (20th) century was\nbuilding a bridge between the worlds of stochastic (random) systems and\ndeterministic (dynamical) systems. It was started by the celebrated 1958 paper\nby A.N.Kolmogorov \\cite{Kolmo}, who called this new theory (and actually a new\nway of thinking about deterministic systems) stochasticity of dynamical\nsystems. Later, this name was essentially replaced by a short (sexier but more\nvague ``chaos theory\"). Kolmogorov's discovery demonstrated that the time\nevolution of deterministic systems could be indistinguishable from the\nevolution of purely random (stochastic) systems. Moreover, it has been later\nestablished that typical deterministic systems are chaotic. However, as well as\nstochastic systems, which could be more or less random (from random processes\nwith independent values to random processes with long memory) , chaotic\ndynamical systems could be strongly or weakly chaotic. Actually, the majority\nof chaotic systems are weakly chaotic, especially those that are relevant\nmodels for various real-world processes. Naturally, the theory of weakly\nchaotic systems is less developed because it deals with more complicated\nproblems than the studies of strongly chaotic systems. We present here a brief\nreview of this theory, including recently published and some new results.",

However, a limitation is that a\npronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech\nrecognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation\nlexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being\ntreated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a\nspeech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a\ngrapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model.\nTo jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic\napproximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM\n(expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance\nparticularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Based on the\nWhistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are\nconducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of\nphoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5\\% error rate\nreductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword\nor full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain\nadaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms\nthe standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the\nG2P model by 9% error rate reductions.

    "abstract": "Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key\nlevers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to\nfulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are\nfrequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy\ndiscourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain\nunder meaningful human supervision.\n  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision\noutside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to\nAI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and\noperational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either\na policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims\nto prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,\nremediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight\nstrategies nonetheless necessitate control.\n  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a\ntheoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the\nconditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and\nwhat is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how\nsupervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,\nand drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a\nmaturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some\nboundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,\nand where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the\nquestion of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment\ncontext, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying\nboth present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical\nadvances.",

Within this range, the Sun provides huge incoming solar flux to the\ntelescope that also varies by a factor of ~ 20 from the lower end to the upper\nend of the wavelength band of interest. Thermal Filter Assembly (TFA) is an\noptical component at the SUIT entrance aperture, directly facing the Sun.

The TFA is designed to allow only 0.1-0.45% of the incoming flux to\npass within 200-400 nm. The choice of materials for substrate and coating for\nthe filter poses several challenges in terms of contamination, corrosion/\noxidation and durability during the manufacturing process.

    "abstract": "Optimization of metasurface designs for specific functionality is a\nchallenging problem due to the intricate relation between structural features\nand electromagnetic responses. Recently, many researchers resolved to inverse\ndesign of metasurfaces for efficient design parameters based on methods such as\nparameter optimization, evolutionary optimization and machine learning. In this\npaper a hybrid quantum machine learning method which uses quantum encoders to\nenhance the performance of a classical GAN is applied to implement inverse\ndesign of a metasurface. Aiming towards angle-independent unidirectional\ntransmission, this approach combines a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network\n(QGAN) with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to optimize metasurface designs.\nIncident-angle independent uni-directional transmission has potential\napplications in efficient solar cells, thermal cooling, non-reciprocal devices,\netc. However, it is very challenging to achieve such a metasurface design via\nforward methods and hence very few studies exist till now in this direction.\nThe methodology employed in this work reduces the data requirement for inverse\ndesign by 30% compared to conventional GAN-based methods. More importantly, the\ndeveloped metasurface designs show high fidelity of 95% with regard to the\ntargeted far-field radiation patterns. We also provide a material look-up table\nfor feasible substitutes of the obtained material design with real materials\nand yet maintaining performance accuracy. Further, we embed the\ninverse-designed metasurfaces into Perovskite solar cell layers to demonstrate\nthe improvement in its performance. We observe that the conversion efficiency\nof the example perovskite solar cell improves by 95% and remains independent of\nincident angle in the range -60$^\\circ$ to 60$^\\circ$ within the desired\nfrequency range.",

In this work, we present a\nmulti-robot aerial soft manipulator for floating litter collection, leveraging\nthe capabilities of aerial robots. The proposed system consists of two aerial\nrobots connected by a flexible rope manipulator, which collects floating litter\nusing a hook-based tool. Compared to single-aerial-robot solutions, the use of\ntwo aerial robots increases payload capacity and flight endurance while\nreducing the downwash effect at the manipulation point, located at the midpoint\nof the rope. Additionally, we employ an optimization-based rope-shape planner\nto compute the desired rope shape. The planner incorporates an adaptive\nbehavior that maximizes grasping capabilities near the litter while minimizing\nrope tension when farther away. The computed rope shape trajectory is\ncontrolled by a shape visual servoing controller, which approximates the rope\nas a parabola. The complete system is validated in outdoor experiments,\ndemonstrating successful grasping operations. An ablation study highlights how\nthe planner's adaptive mechanism improves the success rate of the operation.\nFurthermore, real-world tests in a water channel confirm the effectiveness of\nour system in floating litter collection.

While advanced causal inference methods\nexist for use in such circumstances, their adoption in CEAs remains limited,\nwith many studies relying on overly simplistic methods such as linear\nregression or propensity score matching.

Conventional\nnetwork binarization approaches, which directly quantize both weights and\nactivations in change detection models, severely limit the network's ability to\nrepresent input data and distinguish between changed and unchanged regions.\nThis results in significantly lower detection accuracy compared to real-valued\nnetworks. To overcome these challenges, BiCD enhances both the representational\npower and feature separability of BNNs, improving detection performance.\nSpecifically, we introduce an auxiliary objective based on the Information\nBottleneck (IB) principle, guiding the encoder to retain essential input\ninformation while promoting better feature discrimination. Since directly\ncomputing mutual information under the IB principle is intractable, we design a\ncompact, learnable auxiliary module as an approximation target, leading to a\nsimple yet effective optimization strategy that minimizes both reconstruction\nloss and standard change detection loss. Extensive experiments on street-view\nand remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BiCD establishes a new benchmark\nfor BNN-based change detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in this\ndomain.",

Traditional methods face the\nfollowing two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific\ndata: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in\nscientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.\nSecondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space\nexpands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.\nAdvancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have\nopened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes.

    "abstract": "We propose a methodology for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to\ndetermine their passing priority at unsignalized intersections where they\ncoexist with human-driven vehicles (HVs). Assuming that CAVs can perceive the\nentry order of surrounding vehicles using computer vision technology and are\ncapable of avoiding collisions, we introduce a voting-based distributed\nconsensus algorithm inspired by Raft to resolve tie-breaking among\nsimultaneously arriving CAVs. The algorithm is structured around the candidate\nand leader election processes and incorporates a minimal consensus quorum to\nensure both safety and liveness among CAVs under typical asynchronous\ncommunication conditions. Assuming CAVs to be SAE (Society of Automotive\nEngineers) Level-4 or higher autonomous vehicles, we implemented the proposed\ndistributed consensus algorithm using gRPC. By adjusting variables such as the\nCAV-to-HV ratio, intersection scale, and the processing time of computer vision\nmodules, we demonstrated that stable consensus can be achieved even under\nmixed-traffic conditions involving HVs without adequate functionalities to\ninteract with CAVs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm\nreached consensus at a typical unsignalized four-way, two-lane intersection in\napproximately 30-40 ms on average. A secondary vision-based system is employed\nto complete the crossing priorities based on the recognized lexicographical\norder of the license plate numbers in case the consensus procedure times out on\nan unreliable vehicle-to-vehicle communication network. The significance of\nthis study lies in its ability to improve traffic flow at unsignalized\nintersections by enabling rapid determination of passing priority through\ndistributed consensus even under mixed traffic with faulty vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized\nintersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for\nsignaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans\nare utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading\nto further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a\nuser-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study\nproposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous\ndescriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)\nresults, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or\nring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)\nsoftware and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first\nleverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan\ndescriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and\nphase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python\nscripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic\nsignal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.\nWithin a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan\nediting. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of\nover 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300\nplan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of\nunderstanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an\neasy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,\nserving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile\napplication of LLMs in the field of ITS.

In this study we develop a simple but physically\nconsistent ice cloud model, and analyze it using methods from the theory of\ndynamical systems. We find that the model constitutes a nonlinear oscillator\nwith two Hopf bifurcations in the relevant parameter regime. In addition to the\ncharacterization of the equilibrium states and the occurring limit cycle, we\nfind scaling behaviors of the bifurcations and the limit cycle, reducing the\nparameter space crucially.

Here, we propose using the Euler\nCharacteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.\nComputed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic\nfeatures, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,\noffering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature\nspace. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine\nbenchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition\nconstant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation\nagainst traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular\nfingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show\nthat our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking\namong the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its\ncombination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON\nfingerprint, significantly \\emph{enhances predictive performance},\noutperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the\ncomplementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for\nbeing combined with established techniques.

In this work, we investigate the\nrelationship between the density of these structures and the overall efficiency\nof absorption. In three different simplified geometries, approximating crypts,\nleaf-like villi, and finger-like villi we calculate analytically the\nconcentration profile and the absorption flux, assuming that there is only\ndiffusion between these structures while the lumen is well mixed. When plotting\nthe absorption flux per unit of gut length as a function of the structures'\ndensity, we observe that there is a density maximizing absorption. We study\nnumerically this optimum. It depends weakly on the absorption properties of the\ngiven nutrient, so that a geometry optimal for one nutrient is close to optimum\nfor another nutrient. Physiological data from various animal species align with\nthis predicted optimal range and potentially reflect evolutionary selection for\nefficient nutrient uptake, supporting the model's validity.",

We propose\nreframing the localization task as a sequential anomaly detection problem and\nadvocate for the use of threshold-dependent metrics such as accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1-score, which better reflect real-world behavior.\nSpecifically, we analyze the performance of the open-source Coarse-to-Fine\nProposal Refinement Framework (CFPRF), which achieves a 20-ms EER of 7.61% on\nthe in-domain PartialSpoof evaluation set, but 43.25% and 27.59% on the\nLlamaPartialSpoof and Half-Truth out-of-domain test sets. Interestingly, our\nreproduced version of the same model performs worse on in-domain data (9.84%)\nbut better on the out-of-domain sets (41.72% and 14.98%, respectively). This\nhighlights the risks of over-optimizing for in-domain EER, which can lead to\nmodels that perform poorly in real-world scenarios.

Such confounding can\nbe caused by variables that otherwise might prove difficult to measure, for\nexample factors relating to genetics, environment, and upbringing. Recent\nmethodological investigations have shown that despite its intuitive appeal, the\nconventionally employed analysis does not relate to a well-defined causal\ntarget, even in the case of constant confounding. A main challenge is that the\nanalysis will target the subpopulation of exposure discordant pairs. In the\npresence of an effect of the cosibling's exposure on the sibling's outcome,\nthere is a second challenge, namely that the effect corresponds to an\nintervention that always exposes the cosibling to the opposite exposure from\nthe sibling. We characterise the sibling comparison in terms of the cross-over\ndesign. Estimands of interest are discussed before using this characterisation\nto establish more natural conditions for targeting an appropriate causal\nparameter. We cast the above-mentioned challenges of the sibling comparison in\nterms of those facing the cross-over trialist: in order to target an\nappropriate estimand one must be able to argue the absence of a certain type of\ncarry-over effect as well as absence of trial-by-treatment interaction, thus\nestablishing that the former study design emulates the latter warts and all. We\nexplore weighting to counter the effects of such interactions and to target\nother estimands. The weights rely on estimates of the unobserved confounding\nstructure. Through simulations and an example analysis, we illustrate its\npotential usefulness to assess the validity of the assumptions of the matched\nanalysis.

    "abstract": "In polarization optics, various topological constructs, namely Poincar\\'e\nspheres of different orders, are used to represent uniform and structured\npolarization distributions. Similarly, there are also structured polarization\noptical elements. Consequently, various topological indices are defined for\nstructured beams and elements. These topological aspects naturally allow us to\nholonomy-based categorization of polarization transformations. In this paper,\nwe introduce holonomically constrained polarization transformations on\ntopological constructs. The conditions on the topological parameters of the\nbeams, elements and spheres to achieve holonomically constrained polarization\ntransformations are discussed in detail. A topological treatment of holonomic\nsystems is needed, since abundant polarization transformations reported in the\nliterature on beams with structured polarization are nonholonomic. It is\nprudent to carry out this study since it can not be assumed that switching\nbetween holonomic and nonholonomic transformations does not affect the system\noutput. It is shown here how these concepts enable us to introduce topological\nindex spaces for polarization optics.",

    "abstract": "Error correction at short blocklengths remains a challenge for low-density\nparity-check (LDPC) codes, as belief propagation (BP) decoding is suboptimal\ncompared to maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD). While BP rarely makes errors, it\noften fails to converge due to a small number of problematic, erroneous\nvariable nodes (VNs). Multi-round BP (MRBP) decoding improves performance by\nidentifying and perturbing these VNs, enabling BP to succeed in subsequent\ndecoding attempts. However, existing heuristic approaches for VN identification\nmay require a large number of decoding rounds to approach ML performance. In\nthis work, we draw a connection between identifying candidate VNs to perturb in\nMRBP and estimating channel output errors, a problem previously addressed by\nsyndrome-based neural decoders (SBND). Leveraging this insight, we propose an\nSBND-inspired neural network architecture that learns to predict which VNs MRBP\nneeds to focus on. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning\napproach outperforms expert rules from the literature, requiring fewer MRBP\ndecoding attempts to reach near-MLD performance. This makes it a promising lead\nfor improving the decoding of short LDPC codes.",

    "abstract": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on\nalgorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet,\nhuman-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make\nunexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or\nimmediate reward. This trait, often dubbed \"free will\" in a loose sense, might\nbe crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in\nproblem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free\nWill Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI\nagents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their\ndecision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive\nstate as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses\nprobabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a\nquantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms\nanalogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to\nimprove an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen\nchanges. Experiments in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit environment\ndemonstrate that agents using this framework achieve higher rewards and policy\ndiversity compared to baseline methods.",

The main problem of this kind of algorithms is the\nlong execution time due to cache misses. In this work, we propose a quantum\nalgorithm for the Fixed RAdius Neighbor Search problem (FRANS) based on the\nfixed-point version of Grover's algorithm. We derive an efficient circuit for\nsolving the FRANS with linear query complexity with the number of particles\n$N$. The quantum circuit returns the list of all the neighbors' pairs within\nthe fixed radius, together with their distance, avoiding the slow down given by\ncache miss. We explicitly write the Grover's operator and analyze its gate\ncomplexity. The whole algorithm has complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(M^{\\frac{1}{2}}N^{2})$ in the worst-case scenario, where $M$ is\nthe number of neighboring pairs, and uses $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ number of\nqubits. By employing extra ancilla qubits the depth of the circuit can be\nbrought down to $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ at the cost of $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ qubits\nfor unstructured dataset, or $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{poly}(\\log N))$ qubits for\nstructured datasets.

    "abstract": "To render a sequence testable, namely capable of identifying and detecting\nerrors, it is necessary to apply a transformation that increases its length by\nintroducing statistical dependence among symbols, as commonly exemplified by\nthe addition of parity bits. However, since the decoder does not have prior\nknowledge of the original symbols, it must treat the artificially introduced\nsymbols as if they were independent. Consequently, these additional symbols\nmust be transmitted, even though their conditional probability, under ideal and\nerror free conditions, would be zero. This sequence extension implies that not\nall symbol combinations of the new length are practically realizable: if an\nerror modifies a sequence, making it inadmissible such an error becomes\ndetectable. Recent developments in Set Shaping Theory have revealed a\nsurprising result: it is always possible to transform a sequence into a longer\nversion by carefully selecting which longer sequences are allowed, in such a\nway that the overall set of sequences becomes more structured and less complex\nthan the original. This means that even though the sequence is extended and\ndependencies are introduced between symbols, the total amount of information\ncontained in the new set does not increase proportionally on the contrary, it\ncan be slightly reduced. In other words, one can construct a new set of longer\nsequences where each one corresponds uniquely to an original sequence, but the\nentire set is designed in such a way that it can be treated as if the symbols\nwere independent, making encoding simpler. This allows sequence to become\ntestable capable of detecting errors without adding visible redundancy or\nincreasing the informational content.",

The\nanalytical expressions for the fluxes are obtained through the standard method\nof Mano, Suzuki and Takasugi in the form of combined post-Minkowskian (PM) and\npost-Newtonian (PN) expansions. The reached PM accuracy for the energy and\nangular momentum losses is $O(G^5)$ and $O(G^4)$, respectively, and 7PN for\nboth.

The expressions for radiative losses\nare then used to get the 5PM radiation-reacted scattering angle, which should\nalso serve as a cross-check of ongoing calculations by other methods.",

Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at\nleast one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our\nerror analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation\ninconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced\ngeneralizability due to the model being trained on social history sections\nonly. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the\ncompleteness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.",

To remedy this problem,\nwe attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various\nattacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low\nentropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on\nthe universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is\nelaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.\n2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower\nentropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark\ncontrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct\nexisting test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:\nRectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial\nrectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with\nclean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified\nwith low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating\ntheir adversarial nature. To ensure the rectified samples can be correctly\nclassified with low entropy, we carry out secondary rectification by forward\nminimizing prediction entropy, thus creating a Max-Min entropy optimization\nscheme. Further, based on the second property, we propose an attack-aware\nweighting mechanism to adaptively adjust the strengths of Max-Min entropy\nobjectives.

Several well-known maximally superintegrable models with reflections\nappear as particular cases of this general family, among them, the celebrated\nDunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system. Furthermore, restricting\nto the case of \"hidden\" quantum quadratic symmetries, maximally superintegrable\ncurved oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonians of Dunkl type, sharing the\nsame underlying $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ coalgebra symmetry, are\npresented.

NGC4449 NIR color-magnitude\ndiagrams reveal a broad range of stellar populations, spanning different\nevolutionary phases, from young main sequence stars, to old red giant branch\nstars and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The analysis of their spatial\ndistributions shows that younger (< 10 Myr) populations form an S-shaped\ndistribution aligned with the galaxy's north-south axis, while stars aged 10 -\n60 Myr show shifting concentrations from the north to the south, consistent\nwith the possibility that external interactions or tidal effects may have\ntriggered star formation in spatially distinct bursts. Clusters of comparable\nages generally follow these distributions, suggesting that cluster and field\nstars form at the same pace in each galaxy region. Thanks to the unprecedented\nhigh-spatial resolution and sensitivity of the JWST data we recover a clear gap\nbetween Oxygen-rich and the carbon star branch of the AGB population and the\npresence of a massive AGB star \"finger\". The analysis of these stars can\nprovide constraints on AGB evolution models and dust production in this galaxy.\nThese results confirms NGC 4449 status as a compelling example of a local dwarf\nstarburst galaxy undergoing complex and possibly external driven star formation\nand underscore the power of JWST in probing the full lifecycle of stars in\nnearby starburst systems.",

Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in\ntourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),\nensuring refined time-frequency analysis.

Experimental results demonstrate that this\napproach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust\nunder dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to\nbroader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain\nmanagement, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation\nare key challenges.

This model is motivated by the\ntheoretical framework of Schwarzschild - de Sitter black holes. Assuming that\nthe accelerated cosmic expansion is caused by CCBHs, I perform a cosmological\nparameter estimation using datasets including Planck 2018 CMB, CMB lensing,\nBAO, and supernovae. The analysis reveals notable shifts in cosmological\nparameters, such as $H_0 = 72.24^{+0.34}_{-0.35} \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, compared\nto the standard $\\Lambda \\mathrm{CDM}$. My $H_0$ constraint is consistent with\nthe value $H_0 = 73.04 \\pm 1.04 \\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ reported by SH0ES within $1\n\\sigma$.

    "abstract": "The study assesses Hungary's National AI Strategy and its implementation\nthrough the analysis of strategic documents, publicly available financial\nrecords, and expert interviews with the Hungarian AI Coalition President and\nChief Strategic Advisor to the Government Commissioner for AI. 22 goals from\nHungary's strategy were evaluated through conceptual, governance, temporal, and\nfinancial dimensions before being benchmarked against Singapore's National AI\nStrategies (NAIS 1.0 and NAIS 2.0). Key findings include an estimated total of\nEUR 4.65 billion in AI-related public investment in Hungary. Openly available\nfinancial data was found for only half of the evaluated goals, and just three\nprojects made up 98\\% of all documented funding. The research also reveals\nHungary's implementation challenges, including fragmented execution following\nministerial reorganizations and the absence of designated biennial reviews\nsince 2020. Furthermore, the paper provides targeted recommendations for\nHungary's forthcoming AI strategy, drawing on Singapore's framework as a\nreference point. These include adapting to the era of large language models,\nrestructuring the existing triple helix network to foster more effective\ndialogue and advocacy, and positioning the country as an East-West bridge for\nautomotive AI experimentation.",

    "abstract": "Brownian motion near soft surfaces is a situation widely encountered in\nnanoscale and biological physics. However, a complete theoretical description\nis lacking to date. Here, we theoretically investigate the dynamics of a\ntwo-dimensional colloid in an arbitrary external potential and near a soft\nsurface. The latter is minimally modelled by a Winkler's foundation, and we\nrestrict the study to the colloidal motion in the direction perpendicular to\nthe surface. We start from deterministic hydrodynamic considerations, by\ninvoking the already-established leading-order soft-lubrication forces acting\non the particle. Importantly, a negative softness-induced and\nposition-dependent added mass is identified. We then incorporate thermal\nfluctuations in the description. In particular, an effective Hamiltonian\nformulation is introduced and a temperature-dependent generalized potential is\nconstructed in order to ensure equilibrium properties for the colloidal\nposition. From these considerations and the Fokker-Planck equation, we then\nderive the relevant Langevin equation, which self-consistently allows to\nrecover the deterministic equation of motion at zero temperature.\nInterestingly, besides an expected multiplicative-noise feature, the noise\ncorrelator appears to be modified by the surface softness. Moreover, a\nsoftness-induced temperature-dependent spurious drift term has to be\nincorporated within the Ito prescription. Finally, using numerical simulations\nwith various initial conditions and parameter values, we statistically analyze\nthe trajectories of the particle when placed within a harmonic trap and in\npresence of the soft surface. This allows us to: i) quantify further the\ninfluence of surface softness, through the added mass, which enhances the\nvelocity fluctuations; and ii) show that intermediate-time diffusion is\nunaffected by softness, within the assumptions of the model.",

    "abstract": "To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage\npipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly\nprioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability.

II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to\narticulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain\nlimited by predefined categories).

A sequential\nincrease in SLDs is observed since cycle 21, and cycle 24 has the highest\nnumber of SLDs (since cycle 14), which offers a unique opportunity to probe the\nCME characteristics that occurred during SLDs (hereafter CME_SLD), in a\nstatistical sense. Here, we investigate the CME_SLD during the descending\nphases of solar cycles 23 (2004-2008) and 24 (2015-2019). The fraction of CMEs\nthat occurred on SLDs is found to be 14 and 11%, for cycles 23 and 24,\nrespectively, compared to the total CMEs that occurred in the aforementioned\ndurations. CME_SLD that occurred on the visible side of the solar disk are\nfound to be slower, smaller in width, and carrying low Kinetic energy and mass\ncompared to the entire population of CMEs. The distribution of annual evolution\nof speed, angular width and acceleration of the CMESLD with the CMEs that\noccurred on the non-SLD days (hereafter CME_Non-SLD) for the descending phases\nshows that the CME_SLD are different from the CME_non-SLD in terms of\ncharacteristics (such as speed, width and acceleration). A comparative analysis\nof CME_SLD kinematics of cycle 23 and 24 shows that the weakest cycle 24 has\nwider and more massive events. In contrast, other parameters of CME_SLD such as\nspeed, acceleration and Kinetic energy do not have a disparate nature. CME_SLD\nin both SC23 and SC24 are statistically similar. Therefore, this investigation\nsuggests that SLDs, and hence the sunspot number, may not be a sufficient\ncandidate to predict the solar eruptive activities (e.g. CMEs). On the other\nhand, our analysis of the relation between the strength of the geomagnetic\nstorm and probable candidate parameters revealed Dst index to be very well\ncorrelated with the product of V and Bz.",

This phenomenon arises\nbecause the angular momentum of the black hole is quantized, creating an energy\ngap between the spinless black hole state and the first excited spinning\nstates. Radiation with angular momentum -- such as photons, gravitons, and\npartial waves of a massless scalar field, which we also study -- must supply\nenough energy to bridge this gap to be absorbed. Below this threshold, no\nabsorption can occur, rendering the black hole transparent. For frequencies\nabove the gap, the scarcity of black hole states continues to suppress the\nabsorption cross-section relative to semiclassical predictions, making the\nblack hole translucent rather than completely transparent. Notably,\nelectromagnetic absorption is significantly stronger than gravitational\nabsorption, beyond what differences in spin alone would suggest.",

Despite its role in the few\npredictive theories that exist, a dynamical understanding of what determines\nsaid flux (and its direction in scale) has yet to be established. In this\nstudy, we work towards this understanding by investigating how the dynamics of\ncomplex Fourier velocity phases influence the flux of conserved quantities in\nhydrodynamic shell models. The phase dynamics, like energy evolution, are\ninfluenced by contributions from all neighboring triads, making the full\nproblem intractable. Instead, we assume that the dynamics of the triad phases\nare determined solely by the so-called self-interaction term and treat the\nother neighboring triad terms as noise. This transforms the phase dynamics into\nthat of a noisy phase oscillator, which we solve analytically to predict phase\nstatistics. We validate this assumption with a suite of shell model\nsimulations. Our results give us analytical predictions for the energy flux,\nwhen the energy spectrum is given. We prove that all shell models that conserve\nenergy along with a sign-indefinite quadratic quantity (this includes\nthree-dimensional turbulence analogues) undergo a forward energy cascade, and\nfurther show that the phase dynamics prevent the shell model analogue of\ntwo-dimensional turbulence from forming an inverse cascade of energy.",

While\nOperators significantly simplify DevOps workflows, they introduce new security\nrisks. In particular, Kubernetes enforces namespace isolation to separate\nworkloads and limit user access, ensuring that users can only interact with\nresources within their authorized namespaces. However, Kubernetes Operators\noften demand elevated privileges and may interact with resources across\nmultiple namespaces. This introduces a new class of vulnerabilities, the\nCross-Namespace Reference Vulnerability. The root cause lies in the mismatch\nbetween the declared scope of resources and the implemented scope of the\nOperator logic, resulting in Kubernetes being unable to properly isolate the\nnamespace. Leveraging such vulnerability, an adversary with limited access to a\nsingle authorized namespace may exploit the Operator to perform operations\naffecting other unauthorized namespaces, causing Privilege Escalation and\nfurther impacts. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to\nsystematically investigate the security vulnerability of Kubernetes Operators.\nWe present Cross-Namespace Reference Vulnerability with two strategies,\ndemonstrating how an attacker can bypass namespace isolation.

However, existing methods\noften suffer from limited feature representation, computational redundancy, and\ninsufficient availability of high-quality training data -- challenges that\nhinder their ability to meet industrial demands for both accuracy and\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and\nefficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built\nupon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation\ncapability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This\nmodule improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual\nstructure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture\nfine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational\npower of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy\ncaused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive\nScreening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and\naggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level\nsemantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant\ncomputations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection\naccuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,\nparticularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality\ndataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources.

With the great success of Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) across diverse downstream tasks, this paper explores how\nLLMs can be incorporated to enhance the generalization of learned optimizers.\nThough promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly\nincluding high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost\nand suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token\nsequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical\nfeatures.\n  In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to\nalleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \\textbf{LLM4Hint}\nthat leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization\nhints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model\nto produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the\nSQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously\nreducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting\nstrategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the\nbackbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit\nmatching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight\nmodel, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model.

Moreover, we discovered a gender-dominant axis in the created\nspeaker space, indicating the potential to control speaker attributes.",

The\nmagnetic-field-induced circular polarization of the time-integrated\nphotoluminescence changes sign across the emission spectrum with a width\nreflecting the QD size. It is negative on the low energy side, i.e. for\nemission from large QDs, but positive on the high energy side, i.e. for\nemission from small QDs. However, the exciton g factor, measured by spin-flip\nRaman scattering, is positive across the whole QD ensemble. The\nmagnetic-field-induced circular polarization of the photoluminescence dynamics\nis studied as function of the magnetic field strength and direction. The\ndynamics are non-monotonic over a time range up to milliseconds. The time\ndependence of the photoluminescence circular polarization degree and sign\nstrongly depends on the emission energy and changes with magnetic field\norientation. The observed nonmonotonic behavior is provided by the interplay of\nbright and dark exciton states, contributing to the emission. The experiment is\ninterpreted using a kinetic theory, which accounts for the dynamics of the spin\nstates in the exciton level quartet in longitudinal and tilted magnetic fields,\nthe radiative recombination processes, and the redistribution of the excitons\nbetween these states as result of spin relaxation.

Reliable\ndetection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily\nevaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more\ncommonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor\ngeneralisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce\nWETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT\ndetection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia\neditors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,\nSummarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new\ndatasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three\nprompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing\nprompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,\ntraining-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot\ndetectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in\nrealistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such\nmodels on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in\neditor-driven contexts.",

However VMS are important in several\nways. They efficiently spread nucleosynthesis products through their boosted\nstellar winds, they are predicted to explode as pair-instability supernovae or\nto form heavy black-holes from direct collapse, and they outshine all other\ntypes of stars in the ultraviolet light, thus dominating the integrated light\nof starbursts.

    "abstract": "The cold outer regions of protoplanetary disks are expected to contain a\nmidplane-centered layer where gas-phase CO molecules freeze out and their\noverall abundance is low. The layer then manifests itself as a void in the\nchannel maps of CO rotational emission lines. We explore whether the frozen-out\nlayer can expose the circumplanetary environment of embedded accreting\nprotoplanets to observations. To this end, we performed 3D radiative gas-dust\nhydrodynamic simulations with opacities determined by the redistribution of\nsubmicron- and millimeter-sized dust grains. A Jupiter-mass planet with an\naccretion luminosity of $\\sim$$10^{-3}\\,L_{\\odot}$ was considered as the\nnominal case. The accretion heating sustains a warm bubble around the planet,\nwhich locally increases the abundance of gas-phase CO molecules. Radiative\ntransfer predictions of the emergent sky images show that the bubble becomes a\nconspicuous CO emission source in channel maps. It appears as a low-intensity\noptically thick spot located in between the so-called dragonfly wings that\ntrace the fore- and backside line-forming surfaces. The emission intensity of\nthe bubble is nearly independent of the tracing isotopolog, suggesting a very\nrich observable chemistry, as long as its signal can be deblended from the\nextended disk emission. This can be achieved with isotopologs that are\noptically thin or weakly thermally stratified across the planet-induced gap,\nsuch as C$^{18}$O. For these, the bubble stands out as the brightest residual\nin synthetic ALMA observations after subtraction of axially averaged channel\nmaps inferred from the disk kinematics, enabling new automatic detections of\nforming protoplanets. By contrast, the horseshoe flow steadily depletes large\ndust grains from the circumplanetary environment, which becomes unobservable in\nthe submillimeter continuum, in accordance with the scarcity of ALMA\ndetections.",

However, the two primary categories of\nAFMs, altermagnets and TP-symmetric AFMs, either lack intrinsic\nvalley-polarization or net spin-polarization. Here, we propose an effective\napproach for achieving spontaneous spin-valley polarization in TP-broken\nlayered ferroelectric antiferromagnets (FE-AFMs). The FE-AFMs exhibit lifted\nspin degeneracy across the entire Brillouin zone, along with uncompensated spin\ndensity of states. They combine the benefits of spin-polarization in\naltermagnets with valley-polarization in TP-symmetric AFMs. Furthermore, the\nFE-AFMs feature layer-dependent spin-polarization, rooted in their intrinsic\nferroelectric property, allowing for the flexible control over spin-valley\npolarization by interlayer sliding. This tunability facilitates sign-reversible\nand size-tunable valley Hall and Nernst effects, along with other\nspin-valley-dependent transport properties. Our findings are demonstrated in a\nbroad class of TP-broken bilayer antiferromagnets such as Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br,\nI), VX2 (X = S, Se), and VSi2X4 (X = N, P), underscoring the potential of\nFE-AFMs for advancing next-generation spin- and valley-based information\ntechnologies.",

The proposed solver first establishes the relationships\nbetween the macroscopic governing equations and mesoscopic formal equations\nthat describe the temperature, flow, and phase fields. The macroscopic\ngoverning equations are then discretized by the finite volume method (FVM),\nwith the corresponding fluxes calculated based on the established\nrelationships. In this way, it enables a unified and coherent solution\nframework for all fields. In contrast to the conventional lattice Boltzmann\nmethods, the present approach handles additional terms directly via finite\nvolume discretization, offering a more straightforward and flexible\nformulation. Furthermore, the use of the total enthalpy equation to couple the\ntemperature field with the phase fraction allows for efficient modeling of\nphase change processes, significantly reducing the computational complexity\nassociated with interface tracking. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed\nsolver are demonstrated by a series of benchmark tests, including the\nconductive freezing problem, the three-phase Stefan problem, the freezing of a\nliquid film in a two-dimensional container, the solidification of a static\ndroplet on a cold surface, and the freezing of a droplet upon impact with a\ncold surface.",

    "abstract": "The widespread use of consumer drones has introduced serious challenges for\nairspace security and public safety. Their high agility and unpredictable\nmotion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods\nfocus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on\nforecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection\nto be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised\nvision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of\ndrones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone\ntrajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with\ncamera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We\nthen combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a\nself-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our\nmethod on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that\nfeature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban\nscenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised\nimage-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction,\nreducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D\nlabels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for\nreal-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance\nto support reproducible research in the robotics community.",

    "abstract": "Linear sketches are fundamental tools in data stream analytics. They are\nnotable for supporting both approximate frequency queries and heavy hitter\ndetection with bounded trade-offs for error and memory. Importantly, on streams\nthat contain sensitive information, linear sketches can be easily privatized\nwith the injection of a suitable amount of noise. This process is efficient in\nthe single release model, where the output is released only at the end of the\nstream. In this setting, it suffices to add noise to the sketch once.\n  In contrast, in the continual observation model, where the output is released\nat every time-step, fresh noise needs to be added to the sketch before each\nrelease. This creates an additional computational overhead. To address this, we\nintroduce Lazy Sketch, a novel differentially private sketching method that\nemploys lazy updates, perturbing and modifying only a small portion of the\nsketch at each step. Compared to prior work, we reduce the update complexity by\na factor of $O(w)$, where $w$ is the width of the sketch. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our method increases throughput by up to 250x over prior work,\nmaking continual observation differential privacy practical for high-speed\nstreaming applications.\n  In addition, for heavy hitter detection, we present a new sketch-based\nalgorithm that leverages lazy updates to achieve a per-update complexity of\n$O(d \\log (T/w) + \\log w)$, for linear sketches with dimension $d\\times w$ and\nstreams of length $T$. This marks a significant improvement over prior\napproaches in the streaming continual observation model, which require\nrecomputing frequency estimates for every item in the input domain at each time\nstep.",

There is clearly a \"bump\" at the\nBridge phase of Vela's pulse profiles, that could also be regarded as the third\npulse (P3). Differently, the Crab's, Geminga's & Dragonfly's Bridges relatively\nresemble a \"valley floor\". Despite such an apparent difference, it is\ninteresting to investigate whether their Bridge emissions are still within the\nsame general picture as Vela's. Assuming the north-south symmetry, we would\nexpect the fourth component (Bridge2/P4) to exist as well. However, such a\nhypothetical Bridge2/P4 is not intuitively identified on $\\gamma$-ray\nphaseograms of the Crab, Geminga, Dragonfly and Vela pulsars. It is also\nintriguing to hint at the rationale for the non-discovery of Bridge2/P4. Our\nprototypical toy model is free of assumptions on emission regions or radiation\nmechanisms. Instead, it assumes a north-south symmetric geometry and one\ncircularly symmetric beam per hemisphere, while taking into account Doppler\nshifts (the most innovative element), time delays and energy-dependent beam\nshapes. Tentative compatibility of our fitting results with wind models is\nreported. Notably, for the Crab pulsar, we found a preliminary qualitative\ncorrelation between our model predictions and the IXPE results on X-ray\npolarisation.

However, Rust projects\noften have mixed code, i.e., code that also uses unsafe Rust, FFI (Foreign\nFunction Interfaces), and inline assembly for low-level control. The Rust\ncompiler is unable to statically enforce Rust principles in mixed Rust code\nwhich can lead to many security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose\nCapsLock, a security enforcement mechanism that can run at the level of machine\ncode and detect Rust principle violations at run-time in mixed code. CapsLock\nis kept simple enough to be implemented into recent capability-based hardware\nabstractions that provide low-cost spatial memory safety. CapsLock introduces a\nnovel revoke-on-use abstraction for capability-based designs, wherein accessing\na memory object via a capability implicitly invalidates certain other\ncapabilities pointing to it, thereby also providing temporal memory safety\nautomatically, without requiring software to explicitly specify such\ninvalidation. Thus, CapsLock is the first mechanism capable of providing\ncross-language enforcement of Rust principles. We implemented a prototype of\nCapsLock on QEMU. Evaluation results show that CapsLock is highly compatible\nwith existing Rust code (passing 99.7% of the built-in test cases of the 100\nmost popular crates) and flags Rust principle violations in real-world Rust\nprojects that use FFI or inline assembly.

DCAC\ndynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and\nuniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on\ncontextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse\nsigning behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that\nexisting methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter\nupdates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant\npath. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to\nsubnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and\neffectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC\nfurther strengthens multi-scale consistency.

    "abstract": "Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,\nparticularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping\nwith freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing\ndeepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in\npixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the\nsource face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The\nprevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread\nfalse information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create\nnon-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the\ncreation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures\nare not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating\nwidely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake\ndetection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of\nvariations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises\nprivacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal\nfacial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is\nto identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively\nwithout accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations\nusing multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the\neffectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse\nscenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting\nface-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in\nchallenging real-world applications.

However, the viscous timescale of a thin disk is far longer\nthan the observed timescale of CL AGNs. Though this problem can be resolved by\nintroducing the large-scale magnetic field, the mechanism for radio-quiet CL\nAGNs with weak/absent large-scale magnetic field remains a mystery. In this\nwork, we assume that the thin accretion disk is collapsed from the inner\nadvection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) instead of substituting by the outer\nthin disk through advection. This idea is tested by comparing the cooling\ntimescale ($t_{\\rm cool}$) of an ADAF with the observed timescale ($t_{\\rm\ntran}$) of turn-on CL AGNs. We compile a sample of 102 turn-on CL AGNs from the\narchived data and calculate the cooling timescale of an ADAF with the critical\nmass accretion rate based on some conventional assumptions. It is found that\n$t_{\\rm cool}$ is much shorter than $t_{\\rm tran}$ in most of the CL AGNs,\nwhich validates our assumption though $t_{\\rm cool}$ is not consistent with\n$t_{\\rm tran}$ ($t_{\\rm cool}<t_{\\rm tran}$).

However, building end-to-end\nexplainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)\nmodeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as\nlimited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle\nmolecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,\ni.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,\ntargeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB\nIDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to\nobtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity\n(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained\nGNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage\nmolecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and\nsparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the\nstructure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference\nin molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by\nintegrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,\nreducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving\nthe lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,\napplying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the\ncontribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction\nscores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model\ninterpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating\nimportant molecular substructures in lead optimization.",

    "abstract": "The intermetallic compound BaFe2Al9 exhibits unusual physical properties\nassociated with a charge density wave (CDW) transition. Unlike conventional CDW\nmaterials, which typically display subtle structural distortions or lattice\nmodulations, BaFe2Al9 undergoes a first-order phase transition in which lattice\nstrain plays a crucial role in the formation of the CDW state. To further\nexplore this unique behavior, we conducted high-pressure studies, examining the\nelectrical transport, magnetic, and structural properties to gain deeper\ninsight into the underlying CDW mechanism. At ambient pressure, electrical\nresistivity and magnetization measurements confirm the presence of a CDW\ntransition. Upon applying pressure, the CDW transition temperature (TCDW)\nshifts to higher values, reaching approximately 300 K near 3.2 GPa, and the\nelectrical resistivity increases, suggesting that pressure modulates the charge\ncarrier concentration. Furthermore, the initially sharp first-order transition\nbecomes more gradual, and analysis of the temperature derivative of resistivity\nindicates a crossover from first-order to second-order like behavior under\npressure. High-pressure magnetization measurements are consistent with the\nelectrical transport data, showing an enhancement of TCDW with increasing\npressure. The residual resistivity increases with pressure, while the Fermi\nliquid coefficient A decreases above 2 GPa, pointing to a possible Fermi\nsurface reconstruction. High-pressure synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction\n(XRD) measurements at room temperature reveal a lattice anomaly near 3.8 GPa,\nmarked by a distinct trend change in macrostrain, further supporting the\nexistence of a pressure induced structural response. These findings provide\nvaluable insight into the nature of CDW formation in BaFe2Al9 and highlight the\ncritical role of lattice strain and external pressure in tuning its electronic\nground state.",

Then, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)\nis used to replace Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for achieving a more concise\nand understandable mapping process between layers and further enhanced\nnon-linear modeling ability. The experimental results on several PolSAR\ndatasets show that the features could be conceptualization under the premise of\nachieving satisfactory accuracy through the proposed pipeline, and the\nanalytical function for predicting category labels from conceptual labels can\nbe obtained by combining spline functions, thus promoting the research on the\ninterpretability of the DL-based PolSAR image classification model.",

Through extensive\nbenchmarking, this study quantifies the performance overhead introduced by\ntransferring data between CXL memory, CPU, and GPUs, focusing on how\nconcurrency and data volume influence bandwidth utilization and latency. This\nstudy also compares CPUbased optimizer steps when model parameters, gradients,\nand optimizer states reside in local memory versus CXL memory, revealing that\nnaive adoption of CXL often degrades performance during the optimizer phase. To\novercome these challenges, this study proposes a CXL-aware allocation to\nstrategically partition CPU offloading workloads across both local and CXL\nmemory. This study further demonstrates that employing multiple AICs\nsignificantly reduces bandwidth contention, thus improving scalability.\nExperimental results show that these optimizations enable efficient\nlong-context LLM fine-tuning, underscoring CXL as a promising avenue for\nunlocking the full potential of CPU offloading in long-context LLM fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enhance model robustness in unseen or\ndistributionally shifted target domains through training exclusively on source\ndomains. Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning\nstrategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they\npredominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous\nmulti-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key\nchallenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling\nmodels trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target\ndistributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences\nbetween modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG\ntypically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness\nduring generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to\nconsider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each\nmodality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent\ngeneralization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded\ngeneralization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\napproach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired\nmodalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling\nsynchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space. Additionally,\nwe introduce a supervised disentanglement framework that separates\nmodal-general and modal-specific information, further enhancing the alignment\nof unified representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,\nincluding EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon, demonstrate the effectiveness\nand superiority of our method in enhancing multi-modal domain generalization.",

    "abstract": "In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown\npromising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark\ndatasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger\nsets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant\nunlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)\nor large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions\nfrom those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution\n(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can\nlead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In\nthis paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework\nwith an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize\nunlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets\ndemonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves\nthe performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and\n(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD\nimages leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS\noutperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,\nrespectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes\nabundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks.

We report upon the growth\nand transport properties of epitaxial Bi (0001) films in the thickness range of\n5-32 nm deposited directly on GaAs (111) substrates, without a buffer layer.\nThe quality of Bi films are found to depend on conditions for substrate\ntreatment using Ar+ ion-milling and annealing. Substrates milled at low ion\nbeam currents display poor surface reconstruction after annealing, which\nhinders the growth of high-quality films. In contrast, substrates milled under\noptimized conditions led to reconstructed surfaces upon annealing, resulting in\nepitaxial Bi films with predominantly single-domain orientation. Although\nepitaxial films formed in both cases, transport measurements indicated\nsignificantly higher conductivity for films grown on optimally treated\nsubstrates. Measurements at low temperatures suggest that the transport\nproperties are dominated by a surface state. Magneto-transport measurements\nsuggest that conductivity and mobility improve progressively with increasing\nfilm thickness. Remarkably, our 5 nm Bi film demonstrated resilience to ambient\nconditions without oxidation, with transport properties similar to those of\nbilayer Bi films grown by confinement heteroepitaxy in other studies.

However, the development of object-centric world models has\nlargely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as\nbasic geometries).

On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our\nmethod can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,\noutperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy.

We conduct extensive evaluations on the real-world\nScanNet25k dataset, where our method outperforms SOTA weakly supervised\nbaselines by +4.3% mean alignment accuracy and is the only weakly supervised\napproach to surpass the supervised ROCA by +2.7%. To assess generalization, we\nintroduce SUN2CAD, a real-world test set with 20 novel object categories, where\nour method achieves SOTA results without prior training on them.",

In this setting, an LLM\nagent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant\ninformation from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper\nexplores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected\nnumber of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy\nalgorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information\ngain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate\nestimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very\ndifficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which\nleads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better\nestimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information\nPursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on\nconformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship\nbetween prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate\nuncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast\nto conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a\ndistribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with\n20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter\nquery-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based\nchain-of-thought methods.

Mainstream protection mechanisms leverage trusted\nexecution environments (TEEs) where confidentiality and integrity for secretive\ndata are shielded using hardware-based encryption and integrity checking.\nUnfortunately, running model inference entirely within TEEs is subject to\nnon-trivial slowdown, which is further exacerbated in LLMs due to the\nsubstantial computation and memory footprint involved. Recent studies reveal\nthat the hybrid TEE-based scheme offloading partial model inference operations\nto the untrusted accelerators (e.g., GPU) is a promising solution. However,\nprior offloading schemes fail to ensure dual protection of data and model in\nTransformer inference, as they cannot securely offload critical operations,\ni.e., Attention and SoftMax, forcing these computations to remain confined\nwithin TEEs. To address these challenges, we propose TwinShield, a framework\nenabling secure Transformer inference in heterogeneous TEE and accelerator\nsystems with dual protection for both model and data. TwinShield offloads ~87%\nof computation to GPUs and delivers 4.0x - 6.1x speedups over previous\napproaches across various Transformer models.",

    "abstract": "Component Modal Synthesis (CMS) is a reduced order modelling method widely\nused for large-scale complex systems. It can effectively approximate\nsystem-level models through component synthesis, in which the repetitive\ngeometrical components are modelled once and synthesised together. However, the\nconventional CMS only applies to systems with stationary components connected\nby strictly compatible ports, limiting it from modelling systems with moving\ncomponents. This paper presents an adaptive port (AP) technique to extend CMS\napproaches for modelling parametric systems with rotational parts. To\ndemonstrate the capability of the AP technique, we apply it to the Static\nCondensation Reduced Basis Element (SCRBE), one widely used variant of CMS\napproaches. The AP-based SCRBE (AP-SCRBE) can enforce the synthesis of\nrotational-stationary components over a shared adaptive port when the\nconnecting surfaces of two components are discretisation-wise incompatible,\nwhich happens when one component moves relative to the others. Numerical\nexperiments on the NREL 5MW wind turbine show that, in the context of\nrotational-stationary component synthesis, the AP-SCRBE can accurately and\nefficiently model the rotating rotor with pitch rotation of blades. It can\nproduce almost identical results to a high-fidelity finite element model at two\nto three orders faster speeds.",

Recent\nprogress in operator learning has enabled surrogate models that efficiently\npredict full PDE solution fields; however, these models often struggle with\naccuracy and robustness when faced with highly nonlinear responses driven by\nsequential input functions. To address these challenges, we propose the\nSequential Neural Operator Transformer (S-NOT), a architecture that combines\ngated recurrent units (GRUs) with the self-attention mechanism of transformers\nto address time-dependent,nonlinear PDEs. Unlike S-DeepONet (S-DON), which uses\na dot product to merge encoded outputs from the branch and trunk sub-networks,\nS-NOT leverages attention to better capture intricate dependencies between\nsequential inputs and spatial query points. We benchmark S-NOT on three\nchallenging datasets from real-world applications with plastic and\nthermo-viscoplastic highly nonlinear material responses: multiphysics steel\nsolidification, a 3D lug specimen, and a dogbone specimen under temporal and\npath-dependent loadings. The results show that S-NOT consistently achieves a\nhigher prediction accuracy than S-DON even for data outliers, demonstrating its\naccuracy and robustness for drastically accelerating computational frameworks\nin scientific and engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "The collaborative classification of dual-frequency PolSAR images is a\nmeaningful but also challenging research. The effect of regional consistency on\nclassification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data\nare two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To\ntackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with\nstatistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this\narticle. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature\nextractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is\ndesigned to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial\ninformation learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR\ncovariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first\ndynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and\npixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature\ninteraction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the\nclassification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected\ndistillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of\ndifferent frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency\ndata. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher\nmodel to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to\nlearn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of\ndual-frequency data on different terrain objects. Comprehensive experiments on\nfour measured dual-frequency PolSAR data demonstrate that the proposed\nSKDNet-SSR outperforms other related methods.",

    "abstract": "Library migration happens when a library can not meet the project's\nrequirements and is non-trivial to accomplish. To mitigate the problem,\nsubstantial efforts have been devoted to understanding its characteristics and\nrecommending alternative libraries, especially for programming language (PL)\necosystems with a central package hosting platform, such as Python (PyPI).\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, understanding of C/C++ library\nmigrations is still lacking, possibly due to challenges resulting from the\nfragmented and complicated dependency management practices in the C/C++\necosystem. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper analyzes 19,943 C/C++\nprojects that utilize different package management tools and establishes the\nfirst C/C++ library migration dataset. Based on the dataset, we investigate the\nprevalence, domains, target library, and rationale of C/C++ library migrations\nand compare the results with three widely investigated PLs: Python, JavaScript,\nand Java. We find that the overall trend in the number of C/C++ library\nmigrations is similar to Java. Migrations across different package management\ntools are also observed. In C/C++, library migrations mainly occur in GUI,\nBuild, and OS development, but are rare in domains (e.g., Testing and Logging)\nthat dominate library migrations in the three compared PLs. 83.46\\% of C/C++\nsource libraries only have one migration target, suggesting that our library\nmigration dataset could be used directly to recommend migration targets. We\nfind four C/C++-specific migration reasons, such as less compile time and\nunification of dependency management, revealing the unique dependency\nmanagement requirements in C/C++ projects. We believe our findings can help\nC/C++ developers make more informed library migration decisions and shed light\non the design of C/C++ library migration tools.",

While this approach is intended to enhance visual\nunderstanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding\nencoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a\nphenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic\ninvestigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state\nof the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant\nredundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a\nprincipled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we\nintroduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder\nutility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders\ncontribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming\nsubstantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders\ncontribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,\nconfirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical\ninefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed\nmetrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient\nand effective multimodal architectures.",

Smart contracts, using\nblockchains as their underlying technology, inherit the desired properties such\nas verifiability, immutability, and transparency, which make it a great suit in\ntrustless environments.\n  In this thesis, we consider several decentralized protocols to be built on\nblockchains, specifically using smart contracts on Ethereum. We used\nalgorithmic and cryptographic tools in our implementations to further improve\nthe level of security and efficiency beyond the state-of-the-art works. We\nproposed a new approach called Blind Vote, which is an untraceable, secure,\nefficient, secrecy-preserving, and fully on-chain electronic voting protocol\nbased on the well-known concept of Chaum's blind signatures. We illustrate that\nour approach achieves the same security guarantees as previous methods such as\nTornado Vote [1], while consuming significantly less gas. Thus, we provide a\ncheaper and considerably more gas-efficient alternative for anonymous\nblockchain-based voting. On the other hand, we propose a new family of\nalgorithms for private, trustless auctions that protect bidder identities and\nbid values while remaining practical for smart contract execution. We ensure\ntrustlessness by running the auction logic in a smart contract, thereby\neliminating reliance on any single trusted party. This approach prevents bid\ntampering, front-running, and collusion by enforcing immutability and\ndecentralized verification of bids. The resulting protocol uniquely combines\nefficiency, trustlessness, and enduring bid privacy, offering a scalable and\nsecure solution for blockchain-based marketplaces and other decentralized\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Talking head generation with arbitrary identities and speech audio remains a\ncrucial problem in the realm of the virtual metaverse. Recently, diffusion\nmodels have become a popular generative technique in this field with their\nstrong generation capabilities. However, several challenges remain for\ndiffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference and visual artifacts caused\nby the implicit latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which\ncomplicates the diffusion process; 2) a lack of authentic facial expressions\nand head movements due to inadequate multi-modal information fusion. In this\npaper, MoDA handles these challenges by: 1) defining a joint parameter space\nthat bridges motion generation and neural rendering, and leveraging flow\nmatching to simplify diffusion learning; 2) introducing a multi-modal diffusion\narchitecture to model the interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary\nconditions, enhancing overall facial expressiveness. In addition, a\ncoarse-to-fine fusion strategy is employed to progressively integrate different\nmodalities, ensuring effective feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat MoDA improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency, making it suitable\nfor real-world applications.

Based on a\nsecond-harmonic lock-in method combined with an a.c. temperature gradient,\n$\\nabla T$, we measured a nonlinear Seebeck voltage in NiFe|Pt bilayers at 300\nK, the amplitude of which increases in proportion to $(\\nabla T)^2$. We also\nobserved that the nonlinear Seebeck voltage increases as the sample length\nalong the $\\nabla T$ direction decreases, showing a characteristic scaling law\ndistinct from the conventional linear Seebeck effect.

There have been increasing studies on\nLEO satellite networking. It is a crucial problem how to evaluate these studies\nin a systematic and reproducible manner. In this paper, we present OpenSN,\ni.e., an open source library for emulating large-scale satellite network (SN).\nDifferent from Mininet-based SN emulators (e.g., LeoEM), OpenSN adopts\ncontainer-based virtualization, thus allows for running distributed routing\nsoftware on each node, and can achieve horizontal scalability via flexible\nmulti-machine extension. Compared to other container-based SN emulators (e.g.,\nStarryNet), OpenSN streamlines the interaction with Docker command line\ninterface and significantly reduces unnecessary operations of creating virtual\nlinks. These modifications improve emulation efficiency and vertical\nscalability on a single machine. Furthermore, OpenSN separates user-defined\nconfiguration from container network management via a Key-Value Database that\nrecords the necessary information for SN emulation. Such a separation\narchitecture enhances the function extensibility. To sum up, OpenSN exhibits\nadvantages in efficiency, scalability, and extensibility, thus is a valuable\nopen source library that empowers research on LEO satellite networking.\nExperiment results show that OpenSN constructs mega-constellations 5X-10X\nfaster than StarryNet, and updates link state 2X-4X faster than LeoEM. We also\nverify the scalability of OpenSN by successfully emulating the five-shell\nStarlink constellation with a total of 4408 satellites.",

Three NIR spectra were obtained during two\noutbursts in October and November 2023, with the 3-meter Infrared Telescope\nFacility and the Palomar 200-inch Telescope, respectively. The NIR spectra\nexhibited absorption features at 1.5 and 2.0 $\\mu$m, consistent with the\ndiagnostic absorption bands of water ice, superimposed on a red dust-scattering\ncontinuum. We find that the absorption bands and the red continuum can be well\nexplained by micrometer-sized crystalline ice at 140--170 K, along with\nsub-micrometer-sized refractory grains (e.g., amorphous carbon). In addition,\nan optical spectrum was obtained with the Lijiang 2.4-meter Telescope during\nthe November 2023 outburst, which exhibited the emission bands of gaseous CN,\nC$_3$, C$_2$ and NH$_2$. The C$_3$/CN and C$_2$/CN ratios suggest that\n12P/Pons-Brooks was ''typical'' in C$_3$ abundance but somewhat depleted in\nC$_2$. The specific kinetic energy of the 2023 November outburst is estimated\nto be $\\sim8\\times10^3$ J kg$^{-1}$, suggesting a likely triggering mechanism\nsimilar to 332P/Ikeya--Murakami and 17P/Holmes, i.e., the crystallization of\namorphous water ice. A refractory-to-ice ratio of $\\sim$1.7--3.2 is derived\nfrom the total mass loss of dust and gas, aligning with the lower-end estimates\nfor 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 1P/Halley.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel system architecture for hybrid satellite\ncommunications, integrating quantum key distribution (QKD) and classical radio\nfrequency (RF) data transmission using a dual-band reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface (RIS). The motivation is to address the growing need for global,\nsecure, and reliable communications by leveraging the security of quantum\noptical links and the robustness of classical RF channels within a unified\nframework. By employing a frequency-selective RIS, the system independently\noptimizes both quantum (850 nm) and classical (S-band) channels in real time,\ndynamically adapting to environmental fluctuations such as atmospheric\nturbulence and rain attenuation. The joint optimization of the quantum bit\nerror rate (QBER) and the classical signal-to noise ratio (SNR) is formulated\nas a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling\nefficient adaptive phase control utilizing both quantum and classical\ncomputational methods. Comprehensive theoretical modeling and simulations,\nbenchmarked against experimental data from the Micius satellite, demonstrate\nsubstantial performance gains. Notably, the RIS assisted system reduces QBER\nfrom approximately 2.5% to 0.7%, increases the secure key rate (SKR) to over\n30,000 bits per second, and enhances classical RF SNR by about 3 dB at high\nelevation angles.

These tasks, including design optimization, control, and\nuncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in\nreal-world applications. However, standard training data generation methods are\ncomputationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality, as their cost\nscales exponentially with the number of inputs.This paper investigates\nefficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid\ninterpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with\nhigher-dimensional input parameter spaces.

At the peak, the continuum of the flare component is well fitted\nby a blackbody spectrum with temperature of $T = 8122 \\pm 273$ K, which is\ncomparable with the results of previous studies that reported the spectral\nenergy distribution of near-ultraviolet to optical during the flare could be\napproximated by single-temperature blackbody radiation at $T \\sim 10^{4}$ K. We\nalso estimated the time evolution of the flare temperature during the decay\nphase. The radiative energy of this flare within the optical range is $4.4\n\\times 10^{32}$ erg, taking into account the time-dependent variation in the\ndecreasing flare temperature and expanding flare area. Furthermore, we detected\na delayed increase in the flux of H$\\alpha$ after the photometric flare peak,\nsecondary increase, and gradual increase even after the white-light flare\nended. Comparison of our results with light curves obtained by the\nSun-as-a-star analysis of solar flares indicates that these signals may be due\nto postflare loops near the stellar limb. Our result about time evolution of\nwhite-light continuum will help to gain more insight into the mechanism of\nwhite-light flares both on the Sun and stars. Additionally, since extreme\nultraviolet radiation from flare loops plays a key role in planetary\natmospheric escape, the existence of postflare loops on stellar flares and its\ntime evolution will help future studies about habitability of close-in planets.",

In order to deploy sustainable RAG systems in\nlow-resource settings, achieving high retrieval accuracy is not only a\nusability requirement but also a cost-saving strategy.

We propose a\nnew retriever model, KinyaColBERT, which integrates two key concepts: late\nword-level interactions between queries and documents, and a morphology-based\ntokenization coupled with two-tier transformer encoding. This methodology\nresults in lexically grounded contextual embeddings that are both fine-grained\nand self-contained. Our evaluation results indicate that KinyaColBERT\noutperforms strong baselines and leading commercial text embedding APIs on a\nKinyarwanda agricultural retrieval benchmark.

Unlike\ntraditional approaches that treat market prices as exogenous, our model\ncaptures the feedback between aggregators' strategies and locational marginal\nprices (LMPs) of electricity.

We prove the existence and uniqueness of a\nmean-field equilibrium and validate the framework through a case study of the\nOahu Island power system.

As LMs are increasingly\ndeployed using low-precision quantization for efficiency, this paper\ninvestigates the efficacy of such attacks for jailbreaking aligned LMs across\ndifferent quantization schemes. We propose gradient-guided attacks, including a\ntailored progressive bit-level search algorithm introduced herein and a\ncomparative word-level (single weight update) attack. Our evaluation on\nLlama-3.2-3B, Phi-4-mini, and Llama-3-8B across FP16 (baseline), and\nweight-only quantization (FP8, INT8, INT4) reveals that quantization\nsignificantly influences attack success. While attacks readily achieve high\nsuccess (>80% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack budget\nof 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20% and 50%,\nrespectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8\nmodels maintained ASR below 65%, demonstrating some resilience compared to INT8\nand INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation\nlocations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes,\nwith (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics. Besides,\njailbreaks induced in FP16 models were highly transferable to subsequent\nFP8/INT8 quantization (<5% ASR difference), though INT4 significantly reduced\ntransferred ASR (avg. 35% drop).

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) poses challenges in diagnosis and monitoring due to\nits progressive nature and complex symptoms. This study introduces a novel\napproach utilizing surface electromyography (sEMG) to objectively assess PD\nseverity, focusing on the biceps brachii muscle. Initial analysis of sEMG data\nfrom five PD patients and five healthy controls revealed significant\nneuromuscular differences. A traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) model\nachieved up to 83% accuracy, while enhancements with a Graph Convolutional\nNetwork-Support Vector Machine (GCN-SVM) model increased accuracy to 92%.\nDespite the preliminary nature of these results, the study outlines a detailed\nexperimental methodology for future research with larger cohorts to validate\nthese findings and integrate the approach into clinical practice. The proposed\napproach holds promise for advancing PD severity assessment and improving\npatient care in Parkinson's disease management.",

If\nthe liquid-crystal cell is infinitely thick, then the predicted pitch depends\ncontinuously on material parameters. Here, we consider how the prediction must\nbe modified in a cell of finite thickness. If the Debye screening length is\nlarge enough, we find that the free energy has multiple minima. In these\nminima, the cholesteric pitch is locked to the cell thickness, so that the cell\ncontains an integer number of pitches.

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, an abundance of information from neutron-star\nobservations, nuclear experiments and theory has transformed our efforts to\nelucidate the properties of dense matter. However, at high densities relevant\nto the cores of neutron stars, substantial uncertainty about the dense matter\nequation of state (EoS) remains. In this work, we present a semiparametric EoS\nframework aimed at better integrating knowledge across these domains in\nastrophysical inference. We use a Meta-model at low densities, and Gaussian\nProcess extensions at high densities. Comparisons between our semiparametric\nframework to fully nonparametric EoS representations show that imposing nuclear\ntheoretical and experimental constraints through the Meta-model up to nuclear\nsaturation density results in constraints on the pressure up to twice nuclear\nsaturation density. We show that our Gaussian Process trained on EoS models\nwith nucleonic, hyperonic, and quark compositions extends the range of EoS\nexplored at high density compared to a piecewise polytropic extension schema,\nunder the requirements of causality of matter and of supporting the existence\nof heavy pulsars. We find that maximum TOV masses above $3.2 M_{\\odot}$ can be\nsupported by causal EoS compatible with nuclear constraints at low densities.\nWe then combine information from existing observations of heavy pulsar masses,\ngravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and X-ray pulse profile\nmodeling of millisecond pulsars within a Bayesian inference scheme using our\nsemiparametric EoS prior. With current astrophysical observations, we find a\nfavored pressure at two times nuclear saturation density of $P(2\\rho_{\\rm nuc})\n= 1.98^{+2.13}_{-1.08}\\times10^{34}$ dyn/cm$^{2}$, a radius of a $1.4\nM_{\\odot}$ neutron star value of $R_{1.4} = 11.4^{+0.98}_{-0.60}$\\;km, and\n$M_{\\rm max} = 2.31_{-0.23}^{+0.35} M_{\\odot}$ at the 90\\% credible level.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the possibility that the recently identified population of\nhigh-redshift, obscured quasars - known as \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs) -\noriginates from early black hole seed formation driven by ultra-strongly\nself-interacting dark matter (uSIDM). In this framework, dark matter halos\nundergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross\nsections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds\nwith masses $\\gtrsim 10^{5} M_\\odot$ at redshifts $z \\gtrsim 5$. We develop a\nsemi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo\npopulation, the redshift of collapse $z_{\\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH\nmass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal\nEddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM\nscenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their\nabundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a\nmechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve\nin standard CDM-based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \\sim 5$\nshows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree\nsimulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m_{\\rm BH} \\gtrsim 10^{7}\nM_\\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational\ntracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early\nuniverse could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter\ninteractions.",

To address these challenges, we introduce two core\ninnovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that\nleverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from\nunstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a\nlightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node\nidentification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency\nsubgraph extraction.
