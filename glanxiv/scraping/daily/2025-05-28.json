    "abstract": "Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the\nmeaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and\nare deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend\nnegation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual\nquestion answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions\ncovering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We\nconstruct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated\nversions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20\nstate-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models\nstruggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop\ncompared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover\na U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades\nperformance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals\ncritical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future\nVLM development. Project page available at\nhttps://yuhui-zh15.github.io/NegVQA/.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text\nfrom their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability\ngeneralizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains\nunclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in\nLLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be\nrecalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset\nof 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English\noriginals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new\ntranslations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,\nMalagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families\nand sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to\nidentify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting\nmasked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating\ncontinuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages,\neven for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for\nexample, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6%\nof the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking\ncharacters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop\nfor shuffled official translations).

    "abstract": "Hyperelastic material characterization is crucial for understanding the\nbehavior of soft materials -- such as tissues, rubbers, hydrogels, and polymers\n-- under quasi-static loading before failure. Traditional methods typically\nrely on uniaxial tensile tests, which require the cumbersome preparation of\ndumbbell-shaped samples for clamping in a uniaxial testing machine. In\ncontrast, indentation-based methods, which can be conducted \\textit{in-situ}\nwithout sample preparation, have been underexplored. To characterize the\nhyperelastic behavior of soft materials, deep indentation is required, where\nthe material response extends beyond linear elasticity. In this study, we\nperform finite element analysis to link the force ($F$) versus indentation\ndepth ($D$) curve with the hyperelastic behavior of a soft incompressible\nmaterial, using a one-term Ogden model for simplicity. We identify three\nindentation regimes based on the ratio between indentation depth and the radius\n($R$) of the spherical-tipped cylindrical indenter: the Hertzian regime ($D <\n0.1R$), where $F = \\frac{16}{9} E R^{0.5} D^{1.5}$; the parabolic regime ($D >\n10R$), where $F = E D^2 \\beta$ and the indenter radius becomes irrelevant; and\nan intermediate regime ($0.1R < D < 10R$) bridging the two extremes. We find\nthat the Ogden strain-stiffening coefficient ($\\alpha$) increases the parabolic\nindentation coefficient ($\\beta$), allowing for the estimation of $\\alpha$ from\n$\\beta$. Furthermore, we observe that Coulomb friction increases $\\beta$,\npotentially masking the effect of strain-stiffening for small $\\alpha$.\nHowever, for $\\alpha > 3$, friction has a negligible effect. Finally, our\nresults show good agreement with experimental data, demonstrating that deep\nindentation can be an effective method for extracting hyperelastic properties\nfrom soft materials through \\textit{in-situ} testing.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computers are an ideal platform to study the ground state properties\nof strongly correlated systems due to the limitation of classical computing\ntechniques particularly for systems exhibiting quantum phase transitions. While\nthe error rates of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are still\nhigh, simulating strongly correlated systems on such devices and extracting\ninformation of possible phases may be within reach. The frustrated\ntransverse-field Ising model (TFIM) is such a system with multiple ordered\nmagnetic phases. In this study, we simulate a two-dimensional frustrated TFIM\nwith next-nearest-neighbor spin-exchange interactions at zero temperature. The\ncompetition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and\nnext-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling gives rise to frustration in\nthe system. Moreover, the presence of quantum fluctuations makes the\nground-state phase profile even richer. We use the Variational Quantum\nEigensolver (VQE) to compute the phases on a square lattice with periodic\nboundary conditions for a system of 16 sites (qubits). The trained VQE circuits\nare compared to exact diagonalization, allowing us to extract error measures of\nVQE. We focus on the ground-state phase transitions of this model, where VQE\nsucceeds in finding the dominant magnetic phases. The optimized VQE circuits\nare then executed on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer without\nusing any error mitigation techniques. Our experiments show near perfect\nrecovery of the magnetic phases of the frustrated model through ground-state\nenergy, the energy derivative, and the spin correlation functions. Thus, we\nshow that the trapped-ion quantum processor is able to achieve reliable\nsimulations of a strongly correlated system within the limitations of the VQE\napproach.",

However, existing benchmarks fall short in assessing\nthe core skills of LLMs in symbolic mathematics-such as integration,\ndifferential equations, and algebraic simplification. To address this gap, we\nintroduce ASyMOB, a novel assessment framework focused exclusively on symbolic\nmanipulation, featuring 17,092 unique math challenges, organized by similarity\nand complexity. ASyMOB enables analysis of LLM generalization capabilities by\ncomparing performance in problems that differ by simple numerical or symbolic\n`perturbations'. Evaluated LLMs exhibit substantial degradation in performance\nfor all perturbation types (up to -70.3%), suggesting reliance on memorized\npatterns rather than deeper understanding of symbolic math, even among models\nachieving high baseline accuracy. Comparing LLM performance to computer algebra\nsystems, we identify examples where they fail while LLMs succeed, as well as\nproblems solved only by combining both approaches. Models capable of integrated\ncode execution yielded higher accuracy compared to their performance without\ncode, particularly stabilizing weaker models (up to +33.1% for certain\nperturbation types). Notably, the most advanced models (o4-mini, Gemini 2.5\nFlash) demonstrate not only high symbolic math proficiency (scoring 96.8% and\n97.6% on the unperturbed set), but also remarkable robustness against\nperturbations, (-21.7% and -21.2% vs. average -50.4% for the other models).\nThis may indicate a recent \"phase transition\" in the generalization\ncapabilities of frontier LLMs. It remains to be seen whether the path forward\nlies in deeper integration with sophisticated external tools, or in developing\nmodels so capable that symbolic math systems like CAS become unnecessary.",

However, such\napproaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the\nunderlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.\n  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning.\nRather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured\nnumerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain\nknowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a\nnumeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an\neffect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference\naligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction\nmodel using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nreinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.\n  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach\n-- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a\n21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and\noutperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%.

In the\ngeometric VOF interface-capturing (IC) approach, the PLIC method is used to\nreconstruct the interface, and the Lagrangian Explicit (LE) method is used in\nthe directionally split advection procedure. To model the hyperelastic behavior\nof the solid, we consider Mooney-Rivlin material models, where we use the left\nCauchy-Green deformation tensor (B) to account for the solid deformation on an\nEulerian grid and the fifth-order WENO-Z reconstruction method is utilized to\ntreat the advection terms involved in the transport equation of B. Multiple\nbenchmark problems are considered to verify the accuracy of the approach.\nFurthermore, to demonstrate the capability of the solver to handle turbulent\ninteractions, we perform direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent channel\nflow with a deformable compliant bottom wall and a rigid top wall; our\nobservations align well with previous experimental and numerical works. The\ndetailed numerical experiments show that: (i) Despite the discontinuity of the\ninterface across the cell boundaries and stress discontinuity across the\ninterface, a VOF/PLIC-based FSI framework can provide stable and accurate\nsolutions that significantly minimizes numerical artifacts (e.g., flotsam and\nspurious currents) while maintaining a sharp interface. (ii) The accuracy of a\nVOF/PLIC-based FSI approach on coarse grids is comparable to the accuracy of a\ndiffusive IC method-based FSI approach on much finer grids.",

In this paper, we introduce\nER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and\ndecision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where\nclinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient\npresentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes\ndata from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal\nclinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and\nphysical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER\nprovider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key\nstages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment\nselection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to\nreflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via\nrule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales\nexplaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in\nresidency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation.

A huge bottleneck is the\nattention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and\nvideo length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where\nonly a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However,\nexisting techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity\nlevels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. % To address this\nconcern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention\nfor visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion\nModels to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention\nmechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the\nprior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of\nthe full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. % Experimental\nresults on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate\nthat Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1\\% of the tokens during inference,\noutperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and\nMInference.

While efficient algorithms for addressing MPECs and their stochastic\nvariants (SMPECs) have been recently presented, distributed SMPECs over\nnetworks pose significant challenges. This work aims to develop fully iterative\nmethods with complexity guarantees for resolving distributed SMPECs in two\nproblem settings: (1) distributed single-stage SMPECs and (2) distributed\ntwo-stage SMPECs. In both cases, the global objective function is distributed\namong a network of agents that communicate cooperatively. Under the assumption\nthat the parametrized VI is uniquely solvable, the resulting implicit problem\nin upper-level decisions is generally neither convex nor smooth. Under some\nstandard assumptions, including the uniqueness of the solution to the VI\nproblems and the Lipschitz continuity of the implicit global objective\nfunction, we propose single-stage and two-stage zeroth-order distributed\ngradient tracking optimization methods where the gradient of a smoothed\nimplicit objective function is approximated using two (possibly inexact)\nevaluations of the lower-level VI solutions. In the exact setting of both the\nsingle-stage and two-stage problems, we achieve the best-known complexity bound\nfor centralized nonsmooth nonconvex stochastic optimization. This complexity\nbound is also achieved (for the first time) for our method in addressing the\ninexact setting of the distributed two-stage SMPEC.

The model implements a triple-stream attention framework\nincorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention\nfor material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample\nrelationships.

However, the synthesized controller only\nensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single\ntrajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an\nentire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics\nmodel and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex\nfeasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring\nhigh dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to\nintegrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide\ndynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize\ncumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm,\ncalled contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs\nto provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in\na fully automated setting.

Recently, some neural compression methods,\nsuch as Scaffold-GS, were proposed for 3DGS but they did not adopt the approach\nof end-to-end optimized analysis-synthesis transforms which has been proven\nhighly effective in neural signal compression. Without an appropriate analysis\ntransform, signal correlations cannot be removed by sparse representation.\nWithout such transforms the only way to remove signal redundancies is through\nentropy coding driven by a complex and expensive context modeling, which\nresults in slower speed and suboptimal rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To\novercome this weakness, we propose Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform\nCoding (SHTC), the first end-to-end optimized transform coding framework for\n3DGS compression. SHTC jointly optimizes the 3DGS, transforms and a lightweight\ncontext model. This joint optimization enables the transform to produce\nrepresentations that approach the best R-D performance possible. The SHTC\nframework consists of a base layer using KLT for data decorrelation, and a\nsparsity-coded enhancement layer that compresses the KLT residuals to refine\nthe representation. The enhancement encoder learns a linear transform to\nproject high-dimensional inputs into a low-dimensional space, while the decoder\nunfolds the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to reconstruct\nthe residuals. All components are designed to be interpretable, allowing the\nincorporation of signal priors and fewer parameters than black-box transforms.\nThis novel design significantly improves R-D performance with minimal\nadditional parameters and computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "The development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) conversational\nagents based on large language models raises important questions about the\nrelationship between human norms, values, and practices and AI design and\nperformance. This article explores what it means for AI agents to be\nconversationally aligned to human communicative norms and practices for\nhandling context and common ground and proposes a new framework for evaluating\ndevelopers' design choices. We begin by drawing on the philosophical and\nlinguistic literature on conversational pragmatics to motivate a set of\ndesiderata, which we call the CONTEXT-ALIGN framework, for conversational\nalignment with human communicative practices. We then suggest that current\nlarge language model (LLM) architectures, constraints, and affordances may\nimpose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment.",

A key\nchallenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively\nunlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good\nperformance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM\nunlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets --\npainting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This\ncan be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign\nperturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly\nunlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present\n$\\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic\nscenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on\nexisting unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined\nforget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of\ndifficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that\nthe performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on\n$\\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more\nrecent methods.

Prior work has highlighted the framework's limitations in\ndynamic environments due to its tendency to produce \"lazy\" iterates. However,\nbuilding on insights showing FTRL's ability to produce \"agile\" iterates, we\nshow that it can indeed recover known dynamic regret bounds through optimistic\ncomposition of future costs and careful linearization of past costs, which can\nlead to pruning some of them. This new analysis of FTRL against dynamic\ncomparators yields a principled way to interpolate between greedy and agile\nupdates and offers several benefits, including refined control over regret\nterms, optimism without cyclic dependence, and the application of minimal\nrecursive regularization akin to AdaFTRL. More broadly, we show that it is not\nthe lazy projection style of FTRL that hinders (optimistic) dynamic regret, but\nthe decoupling of the algorithm's state (linearized history) from its iterates,\nallowing the state to grow arbitrarily. Instead, pruning synchronizes these two\nwhen necessary.",

In the search for SFs, a\ncorrespondence between the expected output signals and different gravity models\nis needed, both for guiding the design of future interferometers, and for\nidentifying the signal in experimental data. In this work, we provide such a\ncorrespondence for some classes of SFs and geometries of the interferometers.\nWe consider three different classes of SFs, characterised by the decay\nbehaviours and symmetries of their two-point correlation functions. Our\napproach applies to Michelson laser interferometers with Fabry-P\\'erot arm\ncavities such as the km-long LIGO detectors and those without arm cavities such\nas the laboratory-scale setups QUEST and GQuEST. Analysing the expected\ninterferometer output signals, we identify three characteristic signatures for\neach class of SF. The designed broadband sensitivity of the laboratory-scale\ninstruments would allow all characteristic signatures of the different classes\nof SFs to be observed, and such observations could provide more information on\nthe nature of the SFs than those from LIGO. On the other hand, we find that\nLIGO is better suited for detecting the bare presence or absence of SFs.",

The PIROM\narchitecture integrates a reduced-physics backbone, based on the\nlumped-capacitance model (LCM), with data-driven correction dynamics formulated\nvia a coarse-graining approach rooted in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. While the\nLCM captures the dominant heat transfer mechanisms, the correction terms\ncompensate for residual dynamics arising from higher-order non-linear\ninteractions and heterogeneities across material layers. The proposed PIROM is\nbenchmarked against two non-intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs): Operator\nInference (OpInf) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE). The PIROM\nconsistently achieves errors below 1% for a wide range of extrapolative\nsettings involving time- and space-dependent boundary conditions and\ntemperature-varying material property perturbations. In contrast, OpInf\nexhibits moderate degradation, and NODE suffers substantial loss in accuracy\ndue to its lack of embedded physics. Despite higher training costs, PIROM\ndelivers online evaluations of two orders of magnitude faster than the\nfull-order model. These results demonstrate that PIROM effectively reconciles\nthe trade-offs between accuracy, generalizability, and efficiency, providing a\nrobust framework for thermal modeling of TPS under diverse operating\nconditions.",

Here we take a different perspective: working in\nthe analog domain, we characterize the consequences of the inherent\nimperfection of a physical learning system and, ultimately, overcome them. We\ntrain an analog network of self-adjusting resistors -- a contrastive local\nlearning network (CLLN) -- for multiple tasks, and observe limit cycles and\ncharacteristic scaling behaviors absent in `perfect' systems. We develop an\nanalytical model that captures these phenomena by incorporating an uncontrolled\nbut deterministic bias into the learning process.

    "abstract": "Real-time tracking of previously unseen, highly dynamic objects in\ncontact-rich environments -- such as during dexterous in-hand manipulation --\nremains a significant challenge. Purely vision-based tracking often suffers\nfrom heavy occlusions due to the frequent contact interactions and motion blur\ncaused by abrupt motion during contact impacts. We propose TwinTrack, a\nphysics-aware visual tracking framework that enables robust and real-time 6-DoF\npose tracking of unknown dynamic objects in a contact-rich scene by leveraging\nthe contact physics of the observed scene. At the core of TwinTrack is an\nintegration of Real2Sim and Sim2Real. In Real2Sim, we combine the complementary\nstrengths of vision and contact physics to estimate object's collision geometry\nand physical properties: object's geometry is first reconstructed from vision,\nthen updated along with other physical parameters from contact dynamics for\nphysical accuracy. In Sim2Real, robust pose estimation of the object is\nachieved by adaptive fusion between visual tracking and prediction of the\nlearned contact physics. TwinTrack is built on a GPU-accelerated, deeply\ncustomized physics engine to ensure real-time performance. We evaluate our\nmethod on two contact-rich scenarios: object falling with rich contact impacts\nagainst the environment, and contact-rich in-hand manipulation. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, TwinTrack achieves\nsignificantly more robust, accurate, and real-time 6-DoF tracking in these\nchallenging scenarios, with tracking speed exceeding 20 Hz.

PPFL\npreserves the privacy and security of a client's data without exchanging it.\nHowever, ensuring that data at each client is of high quality and ready for\nfederated learning (FL) is a challenge due to restricted data access. In this\npaper, we introduce CADRE (Customizable Assurance of Data Readiness) for\nfederated learning (FL), a novel framework that allows users to define custom\ndata readiness (DR) metrics, rules, and remedies tailored to specific FL tasks.\nCADRE generates comprehensive DR reports based on the user-defined metrics,\nrules, and remedies to ensure datasets are prepared for FL while preserving\nprivacy. We demonstrate a practical application of CADRE by integrating it into\nan existing PPFL framework. We conducted experiments across six datasets and\naddressed seven different DR issues. The results illustrate the versatility and\neffectiveness of CADRE in ensuring DR across various dimensions, including data\nquality, privacy, and fairness. This approach enhances the performance and\nreliability of FL models as well as utilizes valuable resources.",

    "abstract": "Existence of a minimal length in spacetime geometries avoids several singular\nsituations involving quantum theory and gravity. In this work, we show that the\nexistence of such a minimal length also affects the gravitational wave (GW)\nwaveform of any inspiraling binary black hole (BH) system by introducing a\nminimum frequency, below which the BHs behave as perfectly reflecting compact\nobjects, while above they are identical to classical BHs. This leads to a\nsignificant imprint on the tidal heating term, appearing in the GW waveform at\n2.5 post Newtonian order. Based on these modifications to the inspiraling\nwaveform, it turns out that the detection of highly spinning and highly\nabsorbing, almost classical BH like compact objects, inspiraling around each\nother, would be in tension with the quantum properties of BH geometries. The\nsame would also be true if the zero point length exceeds the Planck length by a\nsignificant amount, suggesting that the zero point length, if it exists, must\nbe of the same order as the Planck length, or smaller, purely from GW\nobservations.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a growing concern gaining attention in both public discourse\nand AI research. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used for\nrecognition, they still lack real-world effectiveness. Large language models\n(LLMs) show strong potential but require domain-specific fine-tuning and\nstruggle with non-textual cues. Since depression is often expressed through\nvocal tone and behaviour rather than explicit text, relying on language alone\nis insufficient. Diagnostic accuracy also suffers without incorporating\npsychological expertise. To address these limitations, we present, to the best\nof our knowledge, the first application of LLMs to multimodal depression\ndetection using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. We extract the audio features using the\npre-trained model Wav2Vec, and mapped it to text-based LLMs for further\nprocessing. We also propose a novel strategy for incorporating psychological\nknowledge into LLMs to enhance diagnostic performance, specifically using a\nquestion and answer set to grant authorised knowledge to LLMs. Our approach\nyields a notable improvement in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean\nSquare Error (RMSE) compared to a base score proposed by the related original\npaper.

Although natural\nenvironments exhibit complex non-rigid motions, 4D-SLAM remains relatively\nunderexplored due to its inherent challenges; even with 2.5D signals, the\nproblem is ill-posed because of the high dimensionality of the optimization\nspace.

To further\nmodel non-rigid deformations, we employ a warp-field represented by a\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) and introduce a novel camera pose estimation\ntechnique along with surface regularization terms that facilitate\nspatio-temporal reconstruction.

In\nhealthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired\ndigital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis.\nHowever, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents\nsignificant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive\nannotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g.,\nregions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells).

In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified\nIncremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address\ntemporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining\nout-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The\nkey innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD\ncontinual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships\nbetween existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental\nuniversal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS\nmethod effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation,\nenabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units,\nand cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications.

The next challenge is Referring Expression Counting (REC), where\nthe goal is to count objects based on fine-grained attributes and contextual\ndifferences. Existing methods struggle with distinguishing visually similar\nobjects that belong to the same category but correspond to different referring\nexpressions. To address this, we propose C-REX, a novel contrastive learning\nframework, based on supervised contrastive learning, designed to enhance\ndiscriminative representation learning. Unlike prior works, C-REX operates\nentirely within the image space, avoiding the misalignment issues of image-text\ncontrastive learning, thus providing a more stable contrastive signal. It also\nguarantees a significantly larger pool of negative samples, leading to improved\nrobustness in the learned representations. Moreover, we showcase that our\nframework is versatile and generic enough to be applied to other similar tasks\nlike class-agnostic counting. To support our approach, we analyze the key\ncomponents of sota detection-based models and identify that detecting object\ncentroids instead of bounding boxes is the key common factor behind their\nsuccess in counting tasks.

This paper extends our prior work on the Flexure-FET MC\nreceiver by integrating a competitive binding model to enhance performance in\nhigh-interference environments, where multiple molecular species coexist in the\nreception space. Previous studies have largely focused on ligand concentration\nestimation and detection, without fully addressing the effects of inter-species\ncompetition for receptor binding. Our proposed framework captures this\ncompetition, offering a more biologically accurate model for multitarget\nenvironments. By incorporating competition dynamics, the model improves\nunderstanding of MC behavior under interference. This approach enables\nfine-tuning of receptor responses by adjusting ligand concentrations and\nreceptor affinities, thereby optimizing the performance of the Flexure-FET MC\nreceiver. Comprehensive analysis shows that accounting for competitive binding\nis crucial for improving reliability and accuracy in complex MC systems.\nFactors such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), symbol error probability (SEP),\ninterferer concentration, and receptor dynamics are shown to significantly\naffect performance. The proposed framework highlights the need to manage these\nfactors effectively. Results demonstrate that modeling interference through\ncompetitive binding offers a realistic system perspective and allows tuning of\nreceiver response, enabling robust detection in environments with multiple\ncoexisting species.",

However, within-label variation--cases where\nannotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an\nadditional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain\nhighlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the\nNLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text\nexplanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To\nsystematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales\nbehind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for\ncategorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset\nof the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it\naligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the\ntaxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that\nconditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically\ncloser to human explanations than those generated using only labels or\nhighlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also\nshows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between\nhuman and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.",

In this case, their\nlearned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples\nare mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as\na noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is\nasymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit\nmakes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial\ncorrelation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical\nscore and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on\nthe Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one\ngenerated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same\neffect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent\nmemorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better\nvariance control under some regularity conditions of the true data\ndistribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be\nreformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential\nDouble-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE). This perspective highlights two\nregularization mechanisms taking place in denoising diffusions: an initial\nGaussian kernel first diffuses mass isotropically in the ambient space, while a\nsecond kernel applied in score space concentrates and spreads that mass along\nthe data manifold. Hence, even a straightforward regularization-without any\nlearning-already mitigates memorization and enhances generalization.\nNumerically, we illustrate our results with several experiments on synthetic\nand MNIST datasets.",

Quantum machine learning is a promising research field but\nsuffers from well known deficits such as barren plateaus and measurement\noverheads. To address this problem, recent research has examined quantum\nreservoir computing to address time-series prediction tasks. Although a\npromising idea, developing circuits that are expressive enough while respecting\nthe limited depths available on current devices is challenging. In classical\nreservoir computing, the onion echo state network model (ESN)\n[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-72359-9_9] was introduced to increase the\ninterpretability of the representation structure of the embeddings. This onion\nESN model utilizes a concatenation of smaller reservoirs that describe\ndifferent time scales by covering different regions of the eigenvalue spectrum.\nHere, we use the same idea in the realm of quantum reservoir computing by\nsimultaneously evolving smaller quantum reservoirs to better capture all the\nrelevant time-scales while keeping the circuit depth small. We do this by\nmodifying the rotation angles which we show alters the eigenvalues of the\nquantum evolution, but also note that modifying the number of mid-circuit\nmeasurements accomplishes the same goals of changing the long-term or\nshort-term memory. This onion QRC outperforms a simple model and a single\nclassical reservoir for predicting the degradation of aluminum alloys in\ndifferent environmental conditions.

    "abstract": "Can quantum theory be applied on all scales? While there are many arguments\nfor the universality of quantum theory, this question remains a subject of\ndebate. It is unknown how far the existence of macroscopic irreversibility can\nbe derived from or reconciled with time-reversal symmetric quantum dynamics.\nFurthermore, reasoning about quantum measurements can appear to produce\nsurprising and even paradoxical outcomes. The classical outcomes of quantum\nmeasurements are in some contexts deemed to violate the fundamental principle\nof locality, in particular when considering entanglement and Bell non-locality.\nTherefore measurement, irreversibility and locality can all appear to challenge\nthe universality of quantum theory. In this thesis we approach these problems\nusing counterfactuals -- statements about the possibility and impossibility of\ntransformations. Using the principles of constructor theory and quantum\ninformation theory, we find novel features of quantum thermodynamics relating\nto irreversibility, information erasure and coherence. We also develop tools to\nquantify the full implications of non-commutativity of quantum operators in\nsettings where quantum theory is applied universally to measurement devices.\nThis reveals new ways of characterising the quantum information stored in\nentanglement and quantum branching structure. Our results reinforce the ability\nof universal quantum theory to consistently describe both microscopic and\nmacroscopic observers and thermodynamic systems.",

    "abstract": "Tunneling ionization followed by strong-field excitation leads to important\nultrafast phenomena such as charge migration and lasing. Recent theoretical\ndevelopments suggest that the population of the ionic excited state can be\ngreatly enhanced due to the complex interplay between tunneling and excitation.\nIn this Letter, using an adiabatic approach for both tunneling and excitation,\nsemi-analytical solutions are derived for the population and coherence of a\ntwo-level ionic system. This approach removes the strong-field dressing,\nrevealing novel sub-half-cycle processes for excited state population and\ncoherence buildup. It predicts that the excited state population is enhanced by\nan order of magnitude, independent of the laser wavelength, while coherence\namplitude can be boosted by over four orders of magnitude for a multi-cycle\npulse. For a single-cycle pulse, it suggests that coherence amplitude decreases\nrapidly as the wavelength increases. This work introduces a novel framework for\ngenerating and controlling the electronic excited state and coherence using\nintense laser pulses, with applications in strong-field control of chemistry\nand lasing.",

These developments are necessitated by the increased\nvolatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids.

To address this challenge, this paper\nintroduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and\nevaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are\nrepresentative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both\nglobal and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first\ntime, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition,\nit supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone\nformulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize\naccess to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair\ncomparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for\ntraining, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with\nthe goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field.

Unlike Cs/FA alloying in\nbulk thin films or nonconfined nanocubes, FA incorporation in nanoplatelets\nrequires meticulous control over the reaction conditions, given that\nnanoplatelets are obtained in kinetically-driven growth regimes instead of\nthermodynamically-driven conditions. Through in-situ photoluminescence (PL)\nmeasurements, we find that excess FA leads to uncontrolled growth, where\nphase-impurities and nanoplatelets of multiple thicknesses co-exist.\nRestricting the FA content to up to 25% Cs substitution enables monodisperse\nPeNPLs, and increases the PL quantum yield (from 53% to 61%), exciton lifetime\n(from 18 ns to 27 ns), and stability in ambient air (from ~2 days to >7 days)\ncompared to CsPbI$_3$. This arises due to hydrogen bonding between FA and the\noleate and oleylammonium ligands, anchoring them to the surface to improve\noptoelectronic properties and stability. The reduction in non-radiative\nrecombination, improvement in the nanoplatelet aspect ratio, and higher ligand\ndensity lead to FA-containing PeNPLs more effectively forming edge-up\nsuperlattices, enhancing the PL degree of linear polarization from 5.1%\n(CsPbI$_3$) to 9.4% (Cs$_{0.75}$FA$_{0.25}$PbI$_3$). These fundamental insights\nshow how the stability limitations of PeNPLs could be addressed, and these\nmaterials grown more precisely to improve their performance as polarized light\nemitters, critical for utilizing them in next-generation display, bioimaging\nand communications applications.",

If quality is truly dataset-intrinsic and\nindependent of model architecture, dataset size, and class balance, then the\nsame datasets should perform better (or worse) regardless of these other\nfactors. To test this hypothesis, here we create thousands of datasets, each\ncontrolled for size and class balance, and use them to train classifiers with a\nwide range of architectures, from random forests and support-vector machines to\ndeep networks. We find that classifier performance correlates strongly by\nsubset across architectures ($R^2=0.79$), supporting quality as an intrinsic\nproperty of datasets independent of dataset size and class balance and of model\narchitecture. Digging deeper, we find that dataset quality appears to be an\nemergent property of something more fundamental: the quality of datasets'\nconstituent classes.

VidText offers the following key features: 1) It covers a wide\nrange of real-world scenarios and supports multilingual content, encompassing\ndiverse settings where video text naturally appears. 2) It introduces a\nhierarchical evaluation framework with video-level, clip-level, and\ninstance-level tasks, enabling assessment of both global summarization and\nlocal retrieval capabilities. 3) The benchmark also introduces a set of paired\nperception reasoning tasks, ranging from visual text perception to cross-modal\nreasoning between textual and visual information. Extensive experiments on 18\nstate-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) reveal that current models\nstruggle across most tasks, with significant room for improvement.

Our paper fills this gap based on a\nthree year-long study by the NExSS Quantitative Habitability Science Working\nGroup. We reviewed past studies of habitability, but find that the lack of a\nuniversally valid definition of life prohibits a universally applicable\ndefinition of habitability. A more nuanced approach is needed. We introduce a\nquantitative habitability assessment framework (QHF) that enables\nself-consistent, probabilistic assessment of the compatibility of two models:\nFirst, a habitat model, which describes the probability distributions of key\nconditions in the habitat. Second, a viability model, which describes the\nprobability that a metabolism is viable given a set of environmental\nconditions.

However, observational\nevidence indicates that accretion may begin earlier. We propose that compact\nsystems are surviving remnants of planet accretion that occurred during the\nfinal phases of infall. In regions of the disk experiencing ongoing infall, the\nplanetary mass is set by the balance between accretion of infalling solids and\nthe increasingly rapid inward migration driven by the surrounding gas as the\nplanet grows. This balance selects for similarly-sized planets whose mass is a\nfunction of infall and disk conditions. We show that infall-produced planets\ncan survive until the gas disk disperses and migration ends, and that across a\nbroad range of conditions, the mass of surviving systems is regulated to a few\n10^{-5} to 10^{-4} times the host star's mass.

    "abstract": "Recent manufacturing systems are increasingly adopting multi-robot\ncollaboration to handle complex and dynamic environments. While multi-agent\narchitectures support decentralized coordination among robot agents, they often\nface challenges in enabling real-time adaptability for unexpected disruptions\nwithout predefined rules. Recent advances in large language models offer new\nopportunities for context-aware decision-making to enable adaptive responses to\nunexpected changes. This paper presents an initial exploratory implementation\nof a large language model-enabled control framework for dynamic task\nreassignment in multi-robot manufacturing systems. A central controller agent\nleverages the large language model's ability to interpret structured robot\nconfiguration data and generate valid reassignments in response to robot\nfailures. Experiments in a real-world setup demonstrate high task success rates\nin recovering from failures, highlighting the potential of this approach to\nimprove adaptability in multi-robot manufacturing systems.",

Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLM) fail to generate images based on the hidden meaning inherent in\nrhetorical language--despite such content being readily mappable to visual\nrepresentations by humans. A key limitation is that current models emphasize\nobject-level word embedding alignment, causing metaphorical expressions to\nsteer image generation towards their literal visuals and overlook the intended\nsemantic meaning. To address this, we propose Rhet2Pix, a framework that\nformulates rhetorical text-to-image generation as a multi-step policy\noptimization problem, incorporating a two-layer MDP diffusion module. In the\nouter layer, Rhet2Pix converts the input prompt into incrementally elaborated\nsub-sentences and executes corresponding image-generation actions, constructing\nsemantically richer visuals. In the inner layer, Rhet2Pix mitigates reward\nsparsity during image generation by discounting the final reward and optimizing\nevery adjacent action pair along the diffusion denoising trajectory. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Rhet2Pix in rhetorical\ntext-to-image generation.

Through a deep understanding\nand comprehensive material characterization, we discover the key process that\nallows this unique behavior: a Pd-O-Hf configuration that capitalizes on Pd\ninnate affinity for integrating into HfO2. This structure actively facilitates\ncharge redistribution at room temperature, effectively eliminating the need for\nelectroforming. Moreover, the fabricated ReRAM device provides tunable\nresistance states for dense memory and reduces programming and reading energy\nby 43% and 73%, respectively, using spiking neural networks (SNN). This study\nreveals novel mechanistic insights and delineates a strategic roadmap for the\nrealization of power-efficient and cost-effective ReRAM devices.",

This study aims to clarify the\ninfluence of turbine thrust and tip-speed ratio on tip-vortex breakdown and the\nevolution of the near wake. Scaling arguments show that these parameters\ncontribute to the wake dynamics in distinct ways, and that neither thrust nor\ntip-speed ratio are alone sufficient to describe near and intermediate wake\ndevelopment. These considerations are especially critical for time-varying\nflows. To demonstrate these principles, a wind turbine at a near utility-scale\nReynolds number ($Re_D=4\\times10^6$) is forced in periodic rotation-rate\noscillations at low Strouhal numbers ($St=0.04$). The slow time-varying forcing\nprotocol decouples thrust and tip-speed ratio effects without introducing\nnonlinear dynamics into the wake that would appear at higher forcing\nfrequencies. Flow measurements in the wake of the turbine show disturbances\npropagate through the wake as traveling waves, with thrust and tip-speed ratio\nvariations displaying synergistic or competing effects on wake dynamics\ndepending on the relative phase and amplitude of such disturbances. The results\nprovide key insights into the dynamics of time-varying wakes, limitations in\nexisting models of rotor wake dynamics, and to future novel wake-control\nschemes.",

    "abstract": "A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly\nimplemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in\nmemory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems\nstill have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or\nreflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated\nerrors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory\nIntelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent\nsystems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for\nlongitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather\nthan passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,\nhuman-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured\ncapture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system\ncapability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this\nvision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift\ndetection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into\nsystems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,\njudgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in\ncurrent AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating\nintelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially\nresponsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,\ngenerative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.",

We therefore ask: Can LLMs match the conclusions\nof systematic reviews written by clinical experts when given access to the same\nstudies? To explore this question, we present MedEvidence, a benchmark pairing\nfindings from 100 SRs with the studies they are based on. We benchmark 24 LLMs\non MedEvidence, including reasoning, non-reasoning, medical specialist, and\nmodels across varying sizes (from 7B-700B). Through our systematic evaluation,\nwe find that reasoning does not necessarily improve performance, larger models\ndo not consistently yield greater gains, and knowledge-based fine-tuning\ndegrades accuracy on MedEvidence. Instead, most models exhibit similar\nbehavior: performance tends to degrade as token length increases, their\nresponses show overconfidence, and, contrary to human experts, all models show\na lack of scientific skepticism toward low-quality findings. These results\nsuggest that more work is still required before LLMs can reliably match the\nobservations from expert-conducted SRs, even though these systems are already\ndeployed and being used by clinicians.

We report here high-precision microscopic\ncalculations that reveal the surprising result that the FQH anyons often bind\ntogether into stable clusters, which we term molecular anyons. This is\ncounterintuitive, given that the elementary anyons carry the same charge and\nare therefore expected to repel one another. The number of anyons in a cluster,\nits binding energy and its size depend sensitively on the parent FQH state and\nthe interaction between electrons (which is experimentally tunable, e.g., by\nvarying the quantum well width). Our calculations further suggest that the\ncharge-$1/4$ non-Abelian anyons of the $5/2$ FQH state may also bind to form\ncharge-$1/2$ Abelian clusters.

The CMPC leverages the LB-MPC to\nsafely learn the unmodeled dynamics to reduce conservatism and improve\nperformance compared to standalone RMPC schemes, which are conservative in\nnature. In addition, we present an implementation of the CMPC framework that\ncombines a particular RMPC and a Gaussian Process MPC scheme.

Two independent parameters, the\neffective number of extra relativistic species $\\Delta N_\\mathrm{eff}$ and the\neffective mass $M_\\mathrm{sp}^\\mathrm{eff}$ of the relic, influence linear\ncosmological observables. We find $\\Delta N_\\mathrm{eff}$ to be more tightly\nconstrained with $\\sigma(\\Delta N_\\mathrm{eff})\\sim10^{-3}$, for a less\nabundant, heavier LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic around\nmatter-radiation equality than a more abundant, lighter LiMR which becomes\nfully non-relativistic just after recombination, for which $\\sigma(\\Delta\nN_\\mathrm{eff})\\sim10^{-2}$. The uncertainties on $M_\\mathrm{sp}^\\mathrm{eff}$\ndiffer by a factor of $\\sim3$ between the two cases. Our analysis also reveals\ndistinct parameter correlations: the phenomenological parameters $\\{\\Delta\nN_\\mathrm{eff}, M_\\mathrm{sp}^\\mathrm{eff}\\}$ are found to be negatively\ncorrelated for the former case and positively correlated for the latter. We\nobtain similar constraints on the cosmological parameters (in either case) for\nboth the inflaton/moduli decay and the Dodelson-Widrow models when the first\ntwo moments of the LiMR distribution function, related to the phenomenological\nparameters, are matched. Finally, by constructing a modified distribution that\nmatches the first two moments of the Dodelson-Widrow but deviates maximally in\nthe third moment, we demonstrate that CMB Stage IV data is not expected to be\nsensitive to higher moments of the distribution.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel treebank-driven approach to comparing syntactic\nstructures in speech and writing using dependency-parsed corpora. Adopting a\nfully inductive, bottom-up method, we define syntactic structures as\ndelexicalized dependency (sub)trees and extract them from spoken and written\nUniversal Dependencies (UD) treebanks in two syntactically distinct languages,\nEnglish and Slovenian. For each corpus, we analyze the size, diversity, and\ndistribution of syntactic inventories, their overlap across modalities, and the\nstructures most characteristic of speech. Results show that, across both\nlanguages, spoken corpora contain fewer and less diverse syntactic structures\nthan their written counterparts, with consistent cross-linguistic preferences\nfor certain structural types across modalities. Strikingly, the overlap between\nspoken and written syntactic inventories is very limited: most structures\nattested in speech do not occur in writing, pointing to modality-specific\npreferences in syntactic organization that reflect the distinct demands of\nreal-time interaction and elaborated writing. This contrast is further\nsupported by a keyness analysis of the most frequent speech-specific\nstructures, which highlights patterns associated with interactivity,\ncontext-grounding, and economy of expression. We argue that this scalable,\nlanguage-independent framework offers a useful general method for\nsystematically studying syntactic variation across corpora, laying the\ngroundwork for more comprehensive data-driven theories of grammar in use.",

GUST leverages the representational power of deep generative\nmodels to learn a high-dimensional conditional distribution of as-fabricated\nunit cell geometries given nominal designs, thereby enabling uncertainty\nquantification. To address the scarcity of real-world manufacturing data, GUST\nemploys a two-stage learning process. First, it leverages self-supervised\npretraining on a large-scale synthetic dataset to capture the structure\nvariability inherent in metamaterial geometries and an approximated\ndistribution of as-fabricated geometries given nominal designs. Subsequently,\nGUST employs transfer learning by fine-tuning the pretrained model on limited\nreal-world manufacturing data, allowing it to adapt to specific manufacturing\nprocesses and nominal designs. With only 960 unit cells additively manufactured\nin only two passes, GUST can capture the variability in geometry and effective\nmaterial properties. In contrast, directly training a generative model on the\nsame amount of real-world data proves insufficient, as demonstrated through\nboth qualitative and quantitative comparisons. This scalable and cost-effective\napproach significantly reduces data requirements while maintaining the\neffectiveness in learning complex, real-world geometric uncertainties, offering\nan affordable method for free-form geometric uncertainty quantification in the\nmanufacturing of metamaterials.

Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in\nshaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation\nand development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by\nintroducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's\nability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the\nstress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find\nthat, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks.

We utilize\nthe Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play\nflow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the\ndegree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the\nregularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In\nparticular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex\nfunctional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with\nrespect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which then ensures the existence of\nits unique fixed point, which is then shown to be the unique global minimizer\nfor our optimization problem. This extends recent results where the Best\nResponse flow was applied to solve convex optimization problems regularized by\nthe relative entropy with respect to arbitrary reference measures, and with\narbitrary values of the regularization parameter. Our results explain precisely\nhow the assumption of convexity can be relaxed, at the expense of making a\nspecific choice of the regularizer.

MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference\nspeed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior\nwork has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP\nobjective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP\ntraining, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually\nincreases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a\nreverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the\nforward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during\npre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output\nquality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding.

However, accuracy\nmetrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail\nto reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better\nunderstand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into\nfundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps),\nExecute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the\ncorrectness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the\nexecution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already\nknows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation.

Importantly, in this setting, we\nidentify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall\nthrough improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths.

    "abstract": "Traditional survival models often rely on restrictive assumptions such as\nproportional hazards or instantaneous effects of time-varying covariates on the\nhazard function, which limit their applicability in real-world settings. We\nconsider the nonparametric estimation of the conditional survival function,\nwhich leverages the flexibility of neural networks to capture the complex,\npotentially long-term non-instantaneous effects of time-varying covariates. In\nthis work, we use Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), a deep learning\narchitecture designed for operator learning, to model the arbitrary effects of\nboth time-varying and time-invariant covariates. Specifically, our method\nrelaxes commonly used assumptions in hazard regressions by modeling the\nconditional hazard function as an unknown nonlinear operator of entire\nhistories of time-varying covariates. The estimation is based on a loss\nfunction constructed from the nonparametric full likelihood for censored\nsurvival data. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method performs well,\nwhereas the Cox model yields biased results when the assumption of\ninstantaneous time-varying covariate effects is violated. We further illustrate\nits utility with the ADNI data, for which it yields a lower integrated Brier\nscore than the Cox model.",

Here, we study the\ncharacteristics of the FCN formed during shear thickening to investigate the\nrole of constraints, emphasizing the impact of resistance to gear-like rolling.\nWe contrast the FCN formed by sliding friction alone with that formed by\nparticles with sliding and rolling constraints. Particles with sliding\nconstraints only form a highly interconnected network with primary force chains\nin the compressive direction, which requires orthogonal support from other\nforce chains. However, orthogonal support is not required for mechanical\nstability when particles have both sliding and rolling constraints. In\naddition, the force chains appear linear and longer, reducing the jamming\nvolume fraction for rough/faceted particles.

These\nSMBHBs are expected to retain substantial eccentricity throughout their\nevolution due to their formation history. In this study, we propose a new\nmodeling scenario of the nHz SGWB by incorporating the eccentricity of SMBHBs\ninto a multi-scale adaptive simulation-based framework. We employ a time-domain\neccentric waveform model, \\esigmahm{}, to generate realistic gravitational wave\n(GW) signals from an astrophysical population of SMBHB, including physical\neffects from sub-parsec scales to Gpc scales. The eccentric inspiraling binary,\nunlike circular binaries, emits GW signal in multiple frequencies. As a\nconsequence, the SGWB energy density in each frequency bin is not independent;\ninstead, the presence of eccentricity introduces a spectral correlation between\ndifferent frequencies. We show that these spectral correlations are absent for\ncircular binaries but become increasingly significant for populations with\nhigher eccentricities. Our novel approach can capture this effect and opens up\nthe window towards measuring this with a high signal-to-noise ratio with future\nobservations. This work develops the frontier of nHz signal modeling using\neccentricity at small scales and can model realistic nHz signal, which will be\nessential for robust inference from future observations to shed light on the\nastrophysical properties of SMBHBs.",

While\nthere is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence\nfor average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding\ntools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the\nclassical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness\nof inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree\npolynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.\n  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree\nhardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for\nlearning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it\nto prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a\nchallenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To\nour knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework\nwas open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree\nhardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with\nsingle-qubit measurements.\n  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and\nidentify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for\nprotocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity\nlandscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more\nentangled single-copy measurements.\n  We show average-case hardness for the \"standard\" variant of Learning\nStabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.",

This paper compares the dynamical properties and\nstar-formation histories of surviving and disrupted satellites around Milky\nWay-like galaxies using the DC Justice League suite of very high-resolution\ncosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way analogs and their halo\nenvironments. We analyze the full census of galaxies accreted within the past\n12 Gyrs, which including both surviving satellites at $z=0$, and dwarf galaxies\nthat disrupted and merged with the host prior to $z=0$. Our simulations\nsuccessfully reproduce the trends in $M_*$-[Fe/H]-[$\\alpha$/Fe] observed in\nsurviving Milky Way satellites and disrupted stellar streams, indicating\nearlier star-formation for disrupted progenitors. We find the likelihood and\ntimescales for quenching and disruption are strongly correlated with the mass\nand time of infall. In particular, none of the galaxies accreted more than 12\nGyrs ago survived, and only 20% of all accreted galaxies with $M_*>10^8M_\\odot$\nsurvive. Additionally, satellites with highly radial trajectories are more\nlikely to quench and disrupt. Disruption proceeds quickly for $\\geq10^6M_\\odot$\nsatellites accreted $10{-}12$ Gyr ago, often on timescales similar to the\n$\\sim300$ Myr snapshot spacing. For high-mass satellites, the disruption\ntimescale is faster than the quenching timescale. As a result, 92% of disrupted\ngalaxies remain star-forming up until disruption. In contrast, Ultra Faint\nDwarfs (UFDs) tend to quench prior to accretion, and 94% of UFDs accreted up to\n12 Gyr ago survive at $z=0$.",

Experiments in conventional turbulent\nflow chambers are inevitably complicated by proximity to boundaries and mean\nflow, obscuring the fundamental aspects of the relaxation to the quiescent\nfluid state. Here, we circumvent these issues by creating a spatially-localized\nblob of turbulent fluid using eight converging vortex generators focused\ntowards the center of a tank of water, and observe its decay and spread over\ndecades in time, using particle image velocimetry with a logarithmic sampling\nrate. The blob initially expands and decays until it reaches the walls of the\ntank and eventually transitions to a second regime of approximately spatially\nuniform decay. We interpret these dynamics within the framework of a nonlinear\ndiffusion equation, which predicts that the ideal quiescent-turbulent fluid\nboundary is sharp and propagates non-diffusively, driven by turbulent eddies\nwhile decaying with characteristic scaling laws. We find direct evidence for\nthis model within the expansion phase of our turbulent blob and use it to\naccount for the detailed behavior we observe, in contrast to earlier studies.\nOur work provides a detailed spatially-resolved narrative for the behavior of\nturbulence once the forcing is removed, and demonstrates unexpectedly that the\nturbulent cascade leaves an indelible footprint far into the decay process.",

Focusing on two representative\nquantum Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and the toric\ncode (TC), we demonstrate that sparse neural networks can reach accuracies\ncomparable to their dense counterparts, even when pruned by more than an order\nof magnitude in parameter count.

Moreover, we\nidentify universal scaling behavior that persists across network sizes and\nphysical models, where the boundaries of scaling regions are determined by the\nunderlying Hamiltonian. At the onset of high-error scaling, we observe\nsignatures of a sparsity-induced quantum phase transition that is first-order\nin shallow networks.

    "abstract": "Ultralight vector dark matter induces metric fluctuations that generate\ntiming residuals in the arrival times of pulsar emissions through two distinct\nmodes: a fast mode, sourced by coherent field oscillations, and a slow mode,\narising from interference patterns. These modes enable the detection of vector\ndark matter with masses $m \\sim 10^{-24} - 10^{-22}\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ and $m \\sim\n10^{-18} - 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, respectively, using pulsar timing arrays.\nWhile previous studies have explored the fast mode, they neglect the full\nstatistical treatment of the vector field and a precise treatment of its\npolarization structure. In this work, we investigate the timing residuals from\nboth modes, fully accounting for the statistical properties of ultralight\nvector dark matter, assuming equipartition among its three polarization states.\nThe two-point correlation functions of timing residuals that we derive serve as\ndirect tools for identifying vector dark matter signatures as a stochastic\nbackground in pulsar timing data.",

The critical theory at the threshold is a\ncontinuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional\nnon-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of\ncertain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality,\nrespectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors\nsimultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime\nof projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes\nunstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this\ncritical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the\nentanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of\nrandom weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or\nGHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits.\nExtensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor\nnetwork / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million\nqubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime\nleads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient\nnon-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the\npercolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality.

We consider a variant of the paradigmatic spin-boson model where\nthe spin is driven and bosons are subject to Markovian loss proportional to\nfrequency (hence, vanishing at low frequencies). We show that the steady state\nexhibits a localization phase transition where the spin's dynamics is frozen,\nto be contrasted with the ground-state transition in the absence of\ndissipation.

We study such behavior in Gross--Neveu--Yukawa field\ntheories where $N_f$ flavors of Dirac fermions are coupled to two\norder-parameter fields with $SO(N_A)$ and $SO(N_B)$ symmetry, respectively. To\nthat end, we employ the perturbative renormalization group up to three-loop\norder in $4-\\epsilon$ spacetime dimensions. We distinguish two key scenarios:\n(i) The two orders are compatible as characterized by anticommuting mass terms,\nand (ii) the orders are incompatible. For the first case, we explore the\nstability of a quantum multicritical point with emergent $SO(N_A\\!+\\!N_B)$\nsymmetry. We find that the stability is controlled by increasing the number of\nDirac fermion flavors. Moreover, we extract the series expansion of the leading\ncritical exponents for the chiral $SO(4)$ and $SO(5)$ models up to third order\nin $\\epsilon$. Notably, we find a tendency towards rapidly growing expansion\ncoefficients at higher orders, rendering an extrapolation to $\\epsilon=1$\ndifficult. For the second scenario, we study a model with $SO(4) \\simeq SO(3)\n\\times SO(3)$ symmetry, which was recently suggested to describe criticality of\nantiferromagnetism and superconductivity in Dirac systems. However, it was also\nargued that a physically admissible renormalization-group fixed point only\nexists for $N_f$ above a critical number $N_{c}^>$. We determine the\ncorresponding series expansion at three-loop order as $N_{c}^>\\approx\n16.83-7.14\\epsilon-7.12\\epsilon^2$. This suggests that the physical choice of\n$N_f=2$ may be a borderline case, where true criticality and pseudocriticality,\nas induced by fixed-point annihilation, are extremely challenging to\ndistinguish.",

In this work, we re-analyse the optical (g and r bands)\nlight-curves of J2320+0024 within the framework of Bayesian model selection.\nWhen a periodicity is searched for together with red noise, the analysis of the\ng-band light-curve finds a peak in the posterior of the period at ~290 days.\nThe posterior profile is too broad to result in a preference for the periodic\nmodels with respect to models including only red-noise. Furthermore, the same\npeak is not present in the analysis of the r-band light-curve. A periodic model\nwithout red-noise identifies a different (~1100 days) periodicity, and it is\nsignificantly statistically disfavoured with respect to the other tested\nmodels.

Previous studies have explained the\nweak evolution of the high-redshift MZR in terms of weakly evolving or\nsaturated gas fractions, but we find this alone does not explain the evolution\nin FIRE-2. Instead, stellar feedback following intense bursts of star formation\ndrives enriched gas out of galaxies, resetting their interstellar medium and\nseparating their histories into distinct ``burst cycles\". We develop the\n``Reduced Burst Model\", a simplified gas-regulator model that successfully\nreproduces the simulated MZR and identifies the dominant drivers of its\nevolution. As redshift decreases, the metallicity of inflows within burst\ncycles increases at fixed stellar mass due to increased wind recycling of\nenriched gas. Meanwhile, the metal mass produced by stars per inflowing gas\nmass within these cycles decreases because of decreased star formation per gas\nmass inflowing into the galaxy. The effects of these two processes on the\nmedian metallicity largely cancel, holding the MZR constant for $z = 5 - 12$.\nAt fixed stellar mass, the simulations predict lower gas metallicities at\nhigher $\\rm H\\alpha$-derived star formation rates, in qualitative agreement\nwith the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), but this effect is reduced in\nrest UV-selected samples.",

Fits to the triplet excitation spectrum identify\nan XXZ-type anisotropic exchange with $J_{XX}$ = 0.11(2) meV and $J_Z =\n0.15(1)$ meV. These findings establish BiYbGeO$_5$ as a structurally disordered\nbut magnetically well-isolated quantum dimer system, providing a model platform\nfor studying the resilience of entangled spin states to site dilution.",

To reduce costs, a potential\npromising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language\nmodel before transferring it to the large one. We construct small \"surrogate\nmodels\" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the\nlarge target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders\ntrained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model,\na process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the\nfull-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair\nand, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with\nthe target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall\nVLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder. The code is at\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/zero.",

Recent\napproaches attempt to address this challenge by manually deciding when to apply\nlong or short reasoning. However, they lack the flexibility to adapt CoT length\ndynamically based on question complexity. In this paper, we propose Auto\nLong-Short Reasoning (AutoL2S), a dynamic and model-agnostic framework that\nenables LLMs to dynamically compress their generated reasoning path based on\nthe complexity of the reasoning question. AutoL2S enables a learned paradigm,\nin which LLMs themselves can decide when longer reasoning is necessary and when\nshorter reasoning suffices, by training on data annotated with our proposed\nmethod, which includes both long and short CoT paths and a special <EASY>\ntoken. We then use <EASY> token to indicate when the model can skip generating\nlengthy CoT reasoning. This proposed annotation strategy can enhance the LLMs'\nability to generate shorter CoT reasoning paths with improved quality after\ntraining. Extensive evaluation results show that AutoL2S reduces the length of\nreasoning generation by up to 57% without compromising performance,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of AutoL2S for scalable and efficient LLM\nreasoning.",

To address this critical trade-off, we\nintroduce HiDream-I1, a new open-source image generative foundation model with\n17B parameters that achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality within\nseconds. HiDream-I1 is constructed with a new sparse Diffusion Transformer\n(DiT) structure. Specifically, it starts with a dual-stream decoupled design of\nsparse DiT with dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, in which two\nseparate encoders are first involved to independently process image and text\ntokens. Then, a single-stream sparse DiT structure with dynamic MoE\narchitecture is adopted to trigger multi-model interaction for image generation\nin a cost-efficient manner. To support flexiable accessibility with varied\nmodel capabilities, we provide HiDream-I1 in three variants: HiDream-I1-Full,\nHiDream-I1-Dev, and HiDream-I1-Fast.\n  Furthermore, we go beyond the typical text-to-image generation and remould\nHiDream-I1 with additional image conditions to perform precise,\ninstruction-based editing on given images, yielding a new instruction-based\nimage editing model namely HiDream-E1. Ultimately, by integrating text-to-image\ngeneration and instruction-based image editing, HiDream-I1 evolves to form a\ncomprehensive image agent (HiDream-A1) capable of fully interactive image\ncreation and refinement.

However, they still face significant challenges: they\nare highly sensitive to reasoning errors, require large volumes of annotated\ndata or accurate verifiers, and struggle to generalize beyond specific domains.\nTo address these limitations, we explore self-correction as a strategy to\nenhance reasoning VLMs. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of reasoning\nVLMs' self-correction abilities and identify key gaps. Based on our findings,\nwe introduce Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement training\nframework. Sherlock introduces a trajectory-level self-correction objective, a\npreference data construction method based on visual perturbation, and a dynamic\n$\\beta$ for preference tuning. Once the model acquires self-correction\ncapabilities using only 20k randomly sampled annotated data, it continues to\nself-improve without external supervision. Built on the Llama3.2-Vision-11B\nmodel, Sherlock achieves remarkable results across eight benchmarks, reaching\nan average accuracy of 64.1 with direct generation and 65.4 after\nself-correction.

Formal mathematical reasoning,\nwhich can be checked with a formal verifier, is one approach to addressing this\nissue. However, currently LLMs are simply not good enough to solve complex\nproblems in a formal way, and even just formalizing an informal problem\nstatement can be challenging. Motivated by this fact, in this work we consider\nthe problem of learning reliable verifiers for natural language\nChain-of-Thought reasoning.

In this work\nwe give a formal PAC-learning framework for studying this problem. We propose\nand analyze several natural verification goals, at different levels of\nstrength, in this framework.

This is why we model the\ndrift and diffusion of our signature SDE as linear functions of path\nsignatures. We provide conditions that ensure the existence and uniqueness of\nsolutions to a general signature SDE. We then introduce the Expected Signature\nMatching Method (ESMM) for linear signature SDEs, which enables inference of\nthe signature-dependent drift and diffusion coefficients from observed\ntrajectories.

This understanding is critical, as disparities in the quality of LLM\nresponses can perpetuate representational harms by ignoring the different\ncultural contexts underlying Simplified versus Traditional Chinese, and can\nexacerbate downstream harms in LLM-facilitated decision-making in domains such\nas education or hiring. To investigate potential LLM performance disparities,\nwe design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term\nchoice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to\ndifferently in Mainland China and Taiwan), and regional name choice (prompting\nthe LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and\nTraditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of 11 leading\ncommercial LLM services and open-sourced models -- spanning those primarily\ntrained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our analyses\nindicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and\nprompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified\nChinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored\nTraditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these\ndisparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written\ncharacter preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese.\nThese findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such,\nwe provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations\nof future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants\n(https://github.com/brucelyu17/SC-TC-Bench).",

    "abstract": "Industrial Control Systems (ICS) manage critical infrastructures like power\ngrids and water treatment plants. Cyberattacks on ICSs can disrupt operations,\ncausing severe economic, environmental, and safety issues. For example,\nundetected pollution in a water plant can put the lives of thousands at stake.\nICS researchers have increasingly turned to honeypots -- decoy systems designed\nto attract attackers, study their behaviors, and eventually improve defensive\nmechanisms. However, existing ICS honeypots struggle to replicate the ICS\nphysical process, making them susceptible to detection. Accurately simulating\nthe noise in ICS physical processes is challenging because different factors\nproduce it, including sensor imperfections and external interferences.\n  In this paper, we propose SimProcess, a novel framework to rank the fidelity\nof ICS simulations by evaluating how closely they resemble real-world and noisy\nphysical processes. It measures the simulation distance from a target system by\nestimating the noise distribution with machine learning models like Random\nForest. Unlike existing solutions that require detailed mathematical models or\nare limited to simple systems, SimProcess operates with only a timeseries of\nmeasurements from the real system, making it applicable to a broader range of\ncomplex dynamic systems. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a\ncase study using real-world power grid data from the EPIC testbed. We compare\nthe performance of various simulation methods, including static and generative\nnoise techniques. Our model correctly classifies real samples with a recall of\nup to 1.0. It also identifies Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture as the best\ndistribution to simulate our power systems, together with a generative solution\nprovided by an autoencoder, thereby helping developers to improve honeypot\nfidelity. Additionally, we make our code publicly available.",

First, we find that all seven prompt types used in our\nexperiments produce a net positive steering effect, but exhibit high variance\nacross samples, and often give an effect opposite of the desired one. No prompt\ntype clearly outperforms the others, and yet the steering vectors resulting\nfrom the different prompt types often differ directionally (as measured by\ncosine similarity). Second, we show that higher cosine similarity between\ntraining set activation differences predicts more effective steering.

Our approach tightly integrates the concept of passage of time, with each\nagent considered as an entity in the PDES framework and responding to prior\nrequests from other agents. Such coupling mechanism enables the agents to work\nin a co-operative environment towards a common goal while many tasks run in\nparallel throughout the simulation. It further enables setting up boundaries to\nthe outputs of the AI agents by applying necessary dynamic constraints using\nnon-AI agents while allowing for scalability through deployment of hundreds of\nsuch agents in a larger compute cluster. Distributing smaller AI agents can\nenable extremely scalable simulations in the future, addressing local memory\nbottlenecks for model parameter storage. Within a PDES involving both AI and\nnon-AI agents, we break down the problem at hand into structured steps, when\nnecessary, providing a set of multiple choices to the AI agents, and then\nprogressively solve these steps towards a final goal. At each step, the non-AI\nagents act as unbiased auditors, verifying each action by the AI agents so that\ncertain rules of engagement are followed. We evaluate our approach by solving\nfour problems from four different domains and comparing the results with those\nfrom AI models alone. Our results show greater accuracy in solving problems\nfrom various domains where the AI models struggle to solve the problems solely\nby themselves.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning advances robot capabilities by enabling the acquisition of\ndiverse behaviors from human demonstrations. However, large-scale datasets used\nfor policy training often introduce substantial variability in quality, which\ncan negatively impact performance. As a result, automatically curating datasets\nby filtering low-quality samples to improve quality becomes essential. Existing\nrobotic curation approaches rely on costly manual annotations and perform\ncuration at a coarse granularity, such as the dataset or trajectory level,\nfailing to account for the quality of individual state-action pairs. To address\nthis, we introduce SCIZOR, a self-supervised data curation framework that\nfilters out low-quality state-action pairs to improve the performance of\nimitation learning policies. SCIZOR targets two complementary sources of\nlow-quality data: suboptimal data, which hinders learning with undesirable\nactions, and redundant data, which dilutes training with repetitive patterns.\nSCIZOR leverages a self-supervised task progress predictor for suboptimal data\nto remove samples lacking task progression, and a deduplication module\noperating on joint state-action representation for samples with redundant\npatterns. Empirically, we show that SCIZOR enables imitation learning policies\nto achieve higher performance with less data, yielding an average improvement\nof 15.4% across multiple benchmarks.

Appearing as\ndark, tendril-like downflows above growing flare loop arcades, SADs themselves\nare yet to be tied into the standard model of solar flares. The uncertainty of\ntheir origin is, in part, due to a lack of spectral observations, with the last\npublished SAD spectral observations dating back to the Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory / Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SOHO/SUMER)\nera in 2003. In this work, we present new observations of SADs within an\nM-class solar flare on April 2nd, 2022, observed by the Hinode EUV Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) and NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory. We measure Fe XXIV\n192.02 Angstrom Doppler downflows and non-thermal velocities in the\nlow-intensity SAD features, exceeding values measured in the surrounding flare\nfan. The ratio of temperature-sensitive Fe XXIV 255.11 Angstrom and Fe XXIII\n263.41 Angstrom lines also allow the measurement of electron temperature,\nrevealing temperatures within the range of the surrounding flare fan. We\ncompare EIS line-of-sight Doppler velocities with plane-of-sky velocities\nmeasured by AIA, to construct the 3D velocity profile of four prominent SADs,\nfinding evidence for their divergence above the flare loop arcade - possibly\nrelated to the presence of a high altitude termination shock.

In this, still a speculative scenario, the\naccretion for a time is mainly onto an accretion disk with a radius of ~1Ro\nthat increases in mass. The accretion disk launches the powerful two opposite\njets by releasing gravitational energy, up to several times super-Eddington, as\nits mass increases. The jets launched by the disk remove high-entropy gas from\nits outskirts and the envelope that the WD inflates due to nuclear burning on\nits surface. The motivations to allow WDs to launch powerful jets are recent\nfindings, from the morphologies of post-CEE planetary nebulae, that jets play a\nmajor role in the CEE and the accumulating evidence that jets power luminous\nred novae by jets, as their morphologies indicate. I strengthen my call to\ninclude jets in the simulation and modeling of the CEE, consider the GEE as a\nphase preceding the CEE in many (but not all) cases, and include jets as a\nmajor ingredient in modeling and simulating all energetic luminous red novae.",

Such phenomenon is consistently\nobserved across vast RL runs without entropy intervention, where the policy\nentropy dropped sharply at the early training stage, this diminished\nexploratory ability is always accompanied with the saturation of policy\nperformance. In practice, we establish a transformation equation R=-a*e^H+b\nbetween entropy H and downstream performance R. This empirical law strongly\nindicates that, the policy performance is traded from policy entropy, thus\nbottlenecked by its exhaustion, and the ceiling is fully predictable H=0,\nR=-a+b. Our finding necessitates entropy management for continuous exploration\ntoward scaling compute for RL. To this end, we investigate entropy dynamics\nboth theoretically and empirically. Our derivation highlights that, the change\nin policy entropy is driven by the covariance between action probability and\nthe change in logits, which is proportional to its advantage when using Policy\nGradient-like algorithms. Empirical study shows that, the values of covariance\nterm and entropy differences matched exactly, supporting the theoretical\nconclusion. Moreover, the covariance term stays mostly positive throughout\ntraining, further explaining why policy entropy would decrease monotonically.\nThrough understanding the mechanism behind entropy dynamics, we motivate to\ncontrol entropy by restricting the update of high-covariance tokens.\nSpecifically, we propose two simple yet effective techniques, namely Clip-Cov\nand KL-Cov, which clip and apply KL penalty to tokens with high covariances\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of creating smart contracts for\napplications represented using Business Process Management and Notation (BPMN)\nmodels. In our prior work we presented a methodology that automates the\ngeneration of smart contracts from BPMN models. This approach abstracts the\nBPMN flow control, making it independent of the underlying blockchain\ninfrastructure, with only the BPMN task elements requiring coding. In\nsubsequent research, we enhanced our approach by adding support for nested\ntransactions and enabling a smart contract repair and/or upgrade. To empower\nBusiness Analysts (BAs) to generate smart contracts without relying on software\ndevelopers, we tackled the challenge of generating smart contracts from BPMN\nmodels without assistance of a software developer. We exploit the Decision\nModel and Notation (DMN) standard to represent the decisions and the business\nlogic of the BPMN task elements and amended our methodology for transformation\nof BPMN models into smart contracts to support also the generation script to\nrepresent the business logic represented by the DMN models. To support such\ntransformation, we describe how the BA documents, using the BPMN elements, the\nflow of information along with the flow of execution. Thus, if the BA is\nsuccessful in representing the blockchain application requirements using BPMN\nand DMN models, our methodology and the tool, called TABS, that we developed as\na proof of concept, is used to generate the smart contracts directly from those\nmodels without developer assistance.",

The research is performed by applying the Large Eddy\nSimulation (LES) method allowing for a detailed analysis of both instantaneous\nand time-averaged flow characteristics. It is shown that the tilting eliminates\nthe occurrence of separation zones in waviness troughs, which minimizes the\nshape drag and maximizes the wall shear stress. In particular, compared to an\noptimal classical sinusoidal waviness shape the drag coefficient drops 14%.\nSimultaneously, 70% better performance in separation control is achieved.\nMoreover, it is also shown that when this issue is a priority, even further\nimprovement can be achieved, though at the expense of greater drag.",

    "abstract": "Fast machine code generation is especially important for fast start-up\njust-in-time compilation, where the compilation time is part of the end-to-end\nlatency. However, widely used compiler frameworks like LLVM do not prioritize\nfast compilation and require an extra IR translation step increasing latency\neven further; and rolling a custom code generator is a substantial engineering\neffort, especially when targeting multiple architectures.\n  Therefore, in this paper, we present TPDE, a compiler back-end framework that\nadapts to existing code representations in SSA form. Using an IR-specific\nadapter providing canonical access to IR data structures and a specification of\nthe IR semantics, the framework performs one analysis pass and then performs\nthe compilation in just a single pass, combining instruction selection,\nregister allocation, and instruction encoding. The generated target\ninstructions are primarily derived code written in high-level language through\nLLVM's Machine IR, easing portability to different architectures while enabling\noptimizations during code generation.\n  To show the generality of our framework, we build a new back-end for LLVM\nfrom scratch targeting x86-64 and AArch64. Performance results on SPECint 2017\nshow that we can compile LLVM-IR 8--24x faster than LLVM -O0 while being on-par\nin terms of run-time performance. We also demonstrate the benefits of adapting\nto domain-specific IRs in JIT contexts, particularly WebAssembly and database\nquery compilation, where avoiding the extra IR translation further reduces\ncompilation latency.",

However, the dust-reddened\nAGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared\nemission and a potential \"dust budget crisis\" in cases when the host galaxy is\neither undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust\nextinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various\nextinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing\nthe predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI,\nHerschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly\nconstrained to $A_V \\lesssim 1.0$ mag for A2744-45924 and $A_V \\lesssim 1.5$\nmag for RUBIES-BLAGN-1 under the SMC extinction laws, with slightly weaker\nconstraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised $A_V$\nvalues yield a radiative efficiencies of $10\\%$ for the LRD population, easing\nthe tension with the Soltan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower\nredshifts.

The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a\ndescription of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent\noptimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with\nand without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus\nable to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this\ncase. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of\nmachine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been widely tested\nusing tools like OpenAI Gym, though many tasks in these environments could also\nbenefit from hierarchical planning. However, there is a lack of a tool that\nenables seamless integration of hierarchical planning with RL. Hierarchical\nDomain Definition Language (HDDL), used in classical planning, introduces a\nstructured approach well-suited for model-based RL to address this gap. To\nbridge this integration, we introduce HDDLGym, a Python-based tool that\nautomatically generates OpenAI Gym environments from HDDL domains and problems.\nHDDLGym serves as a link between RL and hierarchical planning, supporting\nmulti-agent scenarios and enabling collaborative planning among agents. This\npaper provides an overview of HDDLGym's design and implementation, highlighting\nthe challenges and design choices involved in integrating HDDL with the Gym\ninterface, and applying RL policies to support hierarchical planning. We also\nprovide detailed instructions and demonstrations for using the HDDLGym\nframework, including how to work with existing HDDL domains and problems from\nInternational Planning Competitions, exemplified by the Transport domain.\nAdditionally, we offer guidance on creating new HDDL domains for multi-agent\nscenarios and demonstrate the practical use of HDDLGym in the Overcooked\ndomain. By leveraging the advantages of HDDL and Gym, HDDLGym aims to be a\nvaluable tool for studying RL in hierarchical planning, particularly in\nmulti-agent contexts.",

Specifically, we\nexplore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to\npinpoint bad cases.

This new\ndata is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the\nmost effective examples are kept.

    "abstract": "Continually expanding new languages for existing large language models (LLMs)\nis a promising yet challenging approach to building powerful multilingual LLMs.\nThe biggest challenge is to make the model continuously learn new languages\nwhile preserving the proficient ability of old languages. To achieve this,\nrecent work utilizes the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to expand new\nlanguages by adding new experts and avoid catastrophic forgetting of old\nlanguages by routing corresponding tokens to the original model backbone (old\nexperts). Although intuitive, this kind of method is parameter-costly when\nexpanding new languages and still inevitably impacts the performance of old\nlanguages. To address these limitations, we analyze the language\ncharacteristics of different layers in LLMs and propose a layer-wise expert\nallocation algorithm (LayerMoE) to determine the appropriate number of new\nexperts for each layer. Specifically, we find different layers in LLMs exhibit\ndifferent representation similarities between languages and then utilize the\nsimilarity as the indicator to allocate experts for each layer, i.e., the\nhigher similarity, the fewer experts. Additionally, to further mitigate the\nforgetting of old languages, we add a classifier in front of the router network\non the layers with higher similarity to guide the routing of old language\ntokens. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art baseline with 60% fewer experts in the single-expansion\nsetting and with 33.3% fewer experts in the lifelong-expansion setting,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our method.",

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main cause of\ncancer-related deaths worldwide. A subset of lung cancer, adenocarcinomas, is\ncharacterised by mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene.\nTreatment of EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinomas has become less effective over\ntime due to drug resistance development, which is associated with a second\nmutation in the EGFR gene. An important factor in the development of cancer is\nangiogenesis, which is the formation of blood vessels from the existing\nvasculature. These newly formed blood vessels provide oxygen and nutrients to\ntumour cells to maintain tumour growth and proliferation. We applied a hybrid\ndiscrete-continuous (HDC) model to capture the dynamic vasculature in the\ntumour microenvironment (TME). In the case of pre-existing resistance, the\nformation of angiogenic networks creates a microenvironment that supports\ntumour survival and enhances drug resistance. In the case of spontaneous\nmutation-induced resistance, earlier and more frequent mutations confer a\ngreater survival advantage to the tumour population. There is also a mutually\nreinforcing relationship between a high proliferation rate and high resistance\ncharacteristics.

This approach introduces flexible steering configurations, including\nfull-layer steering and segmented steering. Unlike traditional methods\nconstrained to single-layer or fixed-layer operations, Fusion Steering employs\ndynamic injection of prompt-specific activation deltas across all transformer\nlayers. These activation deltas are derived from reference completions that\ncombine the ground-truth answer with a model-generated explanation to\nfacilitate semantically enriched, example-specific steering. The injection\nweights are optimized per prompt using Optuna, targeting a joint objective that\nbalances token overlap (factual alignment) and perplexity (fluency proxy).\nEvaluation employs a composite score integrating token overlap and LLM-graded\nquality, encompassing factual accuracy, coherence, and relevance. Empirical\nresults on 260 SimpleQA prompts (selected from 500 where the baseline failed)\nshowcase the efficacy of segmented steering.

Second, we propose \\textit{ImageReFL}, a fine-tuning method that\nimproves image diversity with minimal loss in quality by training on real\nimages and incorporating multiple regularizers, including diffusion and ReFL\nlosses. Our approach outperforms conventional reward tuning methods on standard\nquality and diversity metrics. A user study further confirms that our method\nbetter balances human preference alignment and visual diversity. The source\ncode can be found at https://github.com/ControlGenAI/ImageReFL .",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction kernels in computed tomography (CT) affect spatial resolution\nand noise characteristics, introducing systematic variability in quantitative\nimaging measurements such as emphysema quantification. Choosing an appropriate\nkernel is therefore essential for consistent quantitative analysis. We propose\na multipath cycleGAN model for CT kernel harmonization, trained on a mixture of\npaired and unpaired data from a low-dose lung cancer screening cohort. The\nmodel features domain-specific encoders and decoders with a shared latent space\nand uses discriminators tailored for each domain.We train the model on 42\nkernel combinations using 100 scans each from seven representative kernels in\nthe National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. To evaluate performance, 240\nscans from each kernel are harmonized to a reference soft kernel, and emphysema\nis quantified before and after harmonization. A general linear model assesses\nthe impact of age, sex, smoking status, and kernel on emphysema. We also\nevaluate harmonization from soft kernels to a reference hard kernel. To assess\nanatomical consistency, we compare segmentations of lung vessels, muscle, and\nsubcutaneous adipose tissue generated by TotalSegmentator between harmonized\nand original images. Our model is benchmarked against traditional and\nswitchable cycleGANs. For paired kernels, our approach reduces bias in\nemphysema scores, as seen in Bland-Altman plots (p<0.05). For unpaired kernels,\nharmonization eliminates confounding differences in emphysema (p>0.05). High\nDice scores confirm preservation of muscle and fat anatomy, while lung vessel\noverlap remains reasonable. Overall, our shared latent space multipath cycleGAN\nenables robust harmonization across paired and unpaired CT kernels, improving\nemphysema quantification and preserving anatomical fidelity.",

Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision\nadvances in order to track human body movements in real life applications.

The consumers of pose estimation movements believe that human poses\ncontent tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation\nsoftware usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we\ndevelop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human\nhealth. This proposed hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method aims\nto detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified\nreal time pose estimation.

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the\nfirst two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar\nproperties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the\nproperties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of\nseveral theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes,\nwhich are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity\nmeasurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift\n7.04, hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the\n[OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow Hbeta emission indicates an\nextremely low chemical enrichment, less than 0.01 solar. We argue that such\nproperties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early\ncosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has\ndeveloped a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models\nassuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or\nsuper-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations,\nalthough they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in rare cases.\nModels invoking \"primordial black holes\" (i.e. putative black holes formed\nshortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment\nassociated with this black hole.",

To address the\nchallenges of cross-sensor and cross-modal integration, we contribute VTV150K,\na comprehensive dataset comprising 150,000 video frames from 100 diverse\nobjects captured across three different tactile sensors (GelSight Mini, DIGIT,\nand Tac3D), annotated with four fundamental tactile attributes (hardness,\nprotrusion, elasticity, and friction). We develop a novel three-stage training\nparadigm that includes VTV enhancement for robust visuo-tactile representation,\nVTV-text alignment for cross-modal correspondence, and text prompt finetuning\nfor natural language generation. Our framework enables sophisticated tactile\nreasoning capabilities including feature assessment, comparative analysis,\nscenario-based decision making and so on.

    "abstract": "The Ingleton inequality first appeared in matroid theory, where Ingleton\nproved in 1971 that every rank function coming from a representable matroid on\nfour subsets satisfies a particular inequality. Because this inequality is not\nimplied by submodularity, Shannon-type axioms alone, it and various analogues\nplay a central role in separately linear and non-linear phenomena in a variety\nof areas of mathematics. The Ingleton inequality for finite groups concerns the\nvarious intersections of four subgroups. It holds for many quadruples of\nsubgroups of finite groups, but not all, the smallest example being four\nsubgroups of $S_5$, of order 120. Open questions are whether the Inlgeton\ninequality always holds for metacycle and nilpotent groups. (There is a proof\nin the literature due to Oggier and Stancu, but there is an already known issue\nwith their proof, which we address in this article.)\n  In this paper we prove that the Ingleton inequality always holds for\nmetacycle groups, but that it fails for supersoluble groups, a class of groups\nonly a little larger than nilpotent groups. Although we do not resolve the\nnilpotent case here we do make some reductions, and also prove that there are\nno nilpotent violators of the Ingleton inequality of order less than 1024.

This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless\nsensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed\nsystem adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor\nwith multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model\ninter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The\nextracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by\nMulti-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical\nconstraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and\nour self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy\nover state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints\n(wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to\naccurately estimate.",

In this study we introduce a\nfeature-selection framework using the upper-tail dependence coefficient\n({\\lambda}U) of the novel A2 copula, which quantifies how often extreme higher\nvalues of a predictor co-occur with diabetes diagnoses (target variable).\nApplied to the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset (n=253,680), our method\nprioritizes five predictors (self-reported general health, high blood pressure,\nbody mass index, mobility limitations, and high cholesterol levels) based on\nupper tail dependencies. These features match or outperform MI and GA selected\nsubsets across four classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression,\nGradient Boosting), achieving accuracy up to 86.5% (XGBoost) and AUC up to\n0.806 (Gradient Boosting), rivaling the full 21-feature model. Permutation\nimportance confirms clinical relevance, with BMI and general health driving\naccuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply a copula's\nupper-tail dependence for supervised feature selection, bridging extreme-value\ntheory and machine learning to deliver a practical toolkit for diabetes\nprevention.",

    "abstract": "Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of\nlarge language models (LLMs) is an emerging research challenge in claim\nverification. While KGs provide structured, semantically rich representations\nwell-suited for reasoning, most existing verification methods rely on\nunstructured text corpora, limiting their ability to effectively leverage KGs.\nAdditionally, despite possessing strong reasoning abilities, modern LLMs\nstruggle with multi-step modular pipelines and reasoning over KGs without\nadaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ClaimPKG, an end-to-end\nframework that seamlessly integrates LLM reasoning with structured knowledge\nfrom KGs. Specifically, the main idea of ClaimPKG is to employ a lightweight,\nspecialized LLM to represent the input claim as pseudo-subgraphs, guiding a\ndedicated subgraph retrieval module to identify relevant KG subgraphs. These\nretrieved subgraphs are then processed by a general-purpose LLM to produce the\nfinal verdict and justification. Extensive experiments on the FactKG dataset\ndemonstrate that ClaimPKG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming\nstrong baselines in this research field by 9%-12% accuracy points across\nmultiple categories. Furthermore, ClaimPKG exhibits zero-shot generalizability\nto unstructured datasets such as HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively combining\nstructured knowledge from KGs with LLM reasoning across various LLM backbones.",

Ternary transition-metal complex hydrides (hydrido\ncomplexes)-typically regarded as hydrogen storage materials-exhibit a large\nrange of compounds stabilized at low pressure with recent predictions for\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductivity. Motivated by this class of materials, we\ninvestigated complex hydride formation in the Mg-Pt-H system, which has no\nknown ternary hydride compounds. Guided by ab initio structural predictions, we\nsuccessfully synthesized a novel complex transition-metal hydride,\nMg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$, using laser-heated diamond anvil cells. The compound forms\nin a body-centered cubic structural prototype at moderate pressures between\n8-25 GPa. Unlike the majority of known hydrido complexes, Mg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$ is\nmetallic, with formal charge described as 4[Mg]$^{2+}$.3[PtH$_2$]$^{2-}$. X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) measurements obtained during decompression reveal that\nMg$_4$Pt$_3$H$_6$ remains stable upon quenching to ambient conditions.\nMagnetic-field and temperature-dependent electrical transport measurements\nindicate ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c$ (50%) = 2.9 K, in\nreasonable agreement with theoretical calculations. These findings clarify the\nphase behavior in the Mg-Pt-H system and provide valuable insights for\ntransition-metal complex hydrides as a new class of hydrogen-rich\nsuperconductors.",

    "abstract": "Kagome spin ice is an intriguing class of spin systems constituted by\nin-plane Ising spins with ferromagnetic interaction residing on the kagome\nlattice, theoretically predicted to host a plethora of magnetic transitions and\nexcitations. In particular, different variants of kagome spin ice models can\nexhibit different sequences of symmetry breaking upon cooling from the\nparamagnetic to the fully ordered ground state. Recently, it has been\ndemonstrated that the frustrated intermetallic HoAgGe stands as a faithful\nsolid-state realization of kagome spin ice. Here we use single crystal neutron\ndiffuse scattering to map the spin ordering of HoAgGe at various temperatures\nmore accurately and surprisingly find that the ordering sequence appears to be\ndifferent from previously known scenarios: From the paramagnetic state, the\nsystem first enters a partially ordered state with fluctuating magnetic\ncharges, in contrast to a charge-ordered paramagnetic phase before reaching the\nfully ordered state. Through state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations and\nscaling analyses using a quasi-2D model for the distorted Kagome spin ice in\nHoAgGe, we elucidate a single three-dimensional (3D) XY phase transition into\nthe ground state with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). However, the 3D XY\ntransition has a long crossover tail before the fluctuating magnetic charges\nfully order. More interestingly, we find both experimentally and theoretically\nthat the TRS breaking phase of HoAgGe features an unusual, hysteretic response:\nIn spite of their vanishing magnetization, the two time-reversal partners are\ndistinguished and selected by a nonlinear magnetic susceptibility tied to the\nkagome ice rule. Our discovery not only unveils a new symmetry breaking\nhierarchy of kagome spin ice, but also demonstrates the potential of\nTRS-breaking frustrated spin systems for information technology applications.",

Recent efforts have transferred knowledge from\nmultiple LLMs into a single target model; however, they suffer from\ninterference and degraded performance among tasks, largely due to limited\nflexibility in candidate selection and training pipelines. To address these\nissues, we propose a framework that adaptively selects and aggregates knowledge\nfrom diverse LLMs to build a single, stronger model, avoiding the high memory\noverhead of ensemble and inflexible weight merging. Specifically, we design an\nadaptive selection network that identifies the most relevant source LLMs based\non their scores, thereby reducing knowledge interference. We further propose a\ndynamic weighted fusion strategy that accounts for the inherent strengths of\ncandidate LLMs, along with a feedback-driven loss function that prevents the\nselector from converging on a single subset of sources. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method can enable a more stable and scalable knowledge\naggregation process while reducing knowledge interference by up to 50% compared\nto existing approaches.

It is not yet common for a teacher to assign students individualized\nhomework targeting their specific weaknesses, provide students with instant\nfeedback, or simulate student responses to a new exam question. While these\nmodels excel in predictive performance, this lack of adoption can be attributed\nto a significant weakness: the lack of explainability of model decisions,\nleading to a lack of trust from students, parents, and teachers. This thesis\naims to bring human needs to the forefront of eXplainable AI (XAI) research,\ngrounded in the concrete use case of personalized learning and teaching. We\nframe the contributions along two verticals: technical advances in XAI and\ntheir aligned human studies.

We propose four novel\ntechnical contributions in interpretability with a multimodal modular\narchitecture (MultiModN), an interpretable mixture-of-experts model\n(InterpretCC), adversarial training for explainer stability, and a\ntheory-driven LLM-XAI framework to present explanations to students\n(iLLuMinaTE), which we evaluate in diverse settings with professors, teachers,\nlearning scientists, and university students.

However, current evaluation\npractices largely rely on semantic segmentation post-processed with connected\ncomponents (CC), which cannot separate confluent lesions (aggregates of\nconfluent lesion units, CLUs) due to reliance on spatial connectivity. To\naddress this misalignment with clinical needs, we introduce formal definitions\nof CLUs and associated CLU-aware detection metrics, and include them in an\nexhaustive instance segmentation evaluation framework. Within this framework,\nwe systematically evaluate CC and post-processing-based Automated Confluent\nSplitting (ACLS), the only existing methods for lesion instance segmentation in\nMS. Our analysis reveals that CC consistently underestimates CLU counts, while\nACLS tends to oversplit lesions, leading to overestimated lesion counts and\nreduced precision. To overcome these limitations, we propose ConfLUNet, the\nfirst end-to-end instance segmentation framework for MS lesions. ConfLUNet\njointly optimizes lesion detection and delineation from a single FLAIR image.\nTrained on 50 patients, ConfLUNet significantly outperforms CC and ACLS on the\nheld-out test set (n=13) in instance segmentation (Panoptic Quality: 42.0% vs.\n37.5%/36.8%; p = 0.017/0.005) and lesion detection (F1: 67.3% vs. 61.6%/59.9%;\np = 0.028/0.013).

So far, non-classical features\nhave not been found in QSHHG yet. The closed form theory of QSHHG in atoms and\nsolids developed here answers the question under which conditions non-classical\nfeatures can be realized. QSHHG results in a multi-mode entanglement between\nharmonic sideband modes and perturbative quantum mode. A projective measurement\non either creates a variety of non-classical states commonly used in quantum\ninformation science. This opens a pathway towards quantum engineering high\nharmonic generation as a short wavelength source for quantum information\nscience.",

Nevertheless, existing deep learning\napproaches in hydrology remain largely confined to local-scale applications and\ndo not leverage the inherent spatial connections of bodies of water. Thus,\nthere is a strong need for new deep learning methodologies that are capable of\nmodeling spatio-temporal relations to improve river discharge and flood\nforecasting for scientific and operational applications. To address this, we\npresent RiverMamba, a novel deep learning model that is pretrained with\nlong-term reanalysis data and that can forecast global river discharge and\nfloods on a $0.05^\\circ$ grid up to 7 days lead time, which is of high\nrelevance in early warning. To achieve this, RiverMamba leverages efficient\nMamba blocks that enable the model to capture global-scale channel network\nrouting and enhance its forecast capability for longer lead times. The forecast\nblocks integrate ECMWF HRES meteorological forecasts, while accounting for\ntheir inaccuracies through spatio-temporal modeling. Our analysis demonstrates\nthat RiverMamba delivers reliable predictions of river discharge, including\nextreme floods across return periods and lead times, surpassing both\noperational AI- and physics-based models.",

Current\nvisual reasoning with LMMs is constrained to either processing fixed\nuser-provided images or reasoning solely through text-based chain-of-thought\n(CoT). Thinking with Generated Images unlocks a new dimension of cognitive\ncapability where models can actively construct intermediate visual thoughts,\ncritique their own visual hypotheses, and refine them as integral components of\ntheir reasoning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nthrough two complementary mechanisms: (1) vision generation with intermediate\nvisual subgoals, where models decompose complex visual tasks into manageable\ncomponents that are generated and integrated progressively, and (2) vision\ngeneration with self-critique, where models generate an initial visual\nhypothesis, analyze its shortcomings through textual reasoning, and produce\nrefined outputs based on their own critiques. Our experiments on vision\ngeneration benchmarks show substantial improvements over baseline approaches,\nwith our models achieving up to 50% (from 38% to 57%) relative improvement in\nhandling complex multi-object scenarios.

    "abstract": "Pathology image segmentation across multiple centers encounters significant\nchallenges due to diverse sources of heterogeneity including imaging\nmodalities, organs, and scanning equipment, whose variability brings\nrepresentation bias and impedes the development of generalizable segmentation\nmodels. In this paper, we propose PathFL, a novel multi-alignment Federated\nLearning framework for pathology image segmentation that addresses these\nchallenges through three-level alignment strategies of image, feature, and\nmodel aggregation. Firstly, at the image level, a collaborative style\nenhancement module aligns and diversifies local data by facilitating style\ninformation exchange across clients. Secondly, at the feature level, an\nadaptive feature alignment module ensures implicit alignment in the\nrepresentation space by infusing local features with global insights, promoting\nconsistency across heterogeneous client features learning. Finally, at the\nmodel aggregation level, a stratified similarity aggregation strategy\nhierarchically aligns and aggregates models on the server, using layer-specific\nsimilarity to account for client discrepancies and enhance global\ngeneralization. Comprehensive evaluations on four sets of heterogeneous\npathology image datasets, encompassing cross-source, cross-modality,\ncross-organ, and cross-scanner variations, validate the effectiveness of our\nPathFL in achieving better performance and robustness against data\nheterogeneity.",

In contrast, we aim to improve the performance of small MLLMs in a\nmore label-efficient and cost-effective manner. To this end, we first prompt\nmultiple teacher MLLMs to generate both label predictions and corresponding\nrationales, which collectively serve as the teachers' knowledge.

In Stage 2, we further fine-tune the\nstudent model using both LoRA fine-tuning and DPO on the data points where\nteachers' predictions conflict.

To maintain performance under varying noise conditions, we\nalso introduce a novel noise-tracking mechanism that dynamically adjusts neural\nparameters during transmission.

What is the relationship between this\norganizational paradigm and feature disentanglement as well as reconstruction\nperformance? To address these questions, we propose the SAEMA, which validates\nthe stratified structure of the representation by observing the variability of\nthe rank of the symmetric semipositive definite (SSPD) matrix corresponding to\nthe modal tensor unfolded along the latent tensor with the level of noise added\nto the residual stream. To systematically investigate how sparse encoding\nalters representational structures, we define local and global representations,\ndemonstrating that they amplify inter-feature distinctions by merging similar\nsemantic features and introducing additional dimensionality.

Among existing methods, 3D\nobject detection in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) has emerged as the mainstream\nframework. To guarantee a safe, robust and trustworthy 3D object detection, 3D\nadversarial attacks are investigated, where attacks are placed in 3D\nenvironments to evaluate the model performance, e.g. putting a film on a car,\nclothing a pedestrian. The vulnerability of 3D object detection models to 3D\nadversarial attacks serves as an important indicator to evaluate the robustness\nof the model against perturbations. To investigate this vulnerability, we\ngenerate non-invasive 3D adversarial objects tailored for real-world attack\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "Grid-based storage systems with uniformly shaped loads (e.g., containers,\npallets, totes) are commonplace in logistics, industrial, and transportation\ndomains. A key performance metric for such systems is the maximization of space\nutilization, which requires some loads to be placed behind or below others,\npreventing direct access to them. Consequently, dense storage settings bring up\nthe challenge of determining how to place loads while minimizing costly\nrearrangement efforts necessary during retrieval. This paper considers the\nsetting involving an inbound phase, during which loads arrive, followed by an\noutbound phase, during which loads depart. The setting is prevalent in\ndistribution centers, automated parking garages, and container ports. In both\nphases, minimizing the number of rearrangement actions results in more optimal\n(e.g., fast, energy-efficient, etc.) operations. In contrast to previous work\nfocusing on stack-based systems, this effort examines the case where loads can\nbe freely moved along the grid, e.g., by a mobile robot, expanding the range of\npossible motions. We establish that for a range of scenarios, such as having\nlimited prior knowledge of the loads' arrival sequences or grids with a narrow\nopening, a (best possible) rearrangement-free solution always exists, including\nwhen the loads fill the grid to its capacity. In particular, when the sequences\nare fully known, we establish an intriguing characterization showing that\nrearrangement can always be avoided if and only if the open side of the grid\n(used to access the storage) is at least 3 cells wide.

However, the question of why the use of history should lower MSE\nremains open. In this paper, we theoretically demystify this paradox by\nderiving a bias-variance decomposition of the MSE of ordinary importance\nsampling (IS) estimators, demonstrating that history-dependent behavior policy\nestimation decreases their asymptotic variances while increasing their\nfinite-sample biases. Additionally, as the estimated behavior policy conditions\non a longer history, we show a consistent decrease in variance. We extend these\nfindings to a range of other OPE estimators, including the sequential IS\nestimator, the doubly robust estimator and the marginalized IS estimator, with\nthe behavior policy estimated either parametrically or non-parametrically.",

    "abstract": "The dominant paradigm for training large-scale vision and language models is\nHe initialization and a single global learning rate (\\textit{standard\nparameterization}, SP). Despite its practical success, standard parametrization\nremains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective: Existing\ninfinite-width theory would predict instability under large learning rates and\nvanishing feature learning under stable learning rates. However, empirically\noptimal learning rates consistently decay much slower than theoretically\npredicted. By carefully studying neural network training dynamics, we\ndemonstrate that this discrepancy is not fully explained by finite-width\nphenomena such as catapult effects or a lack of alignment between weights and\nincoming activations. We instead show that the apparent contradiction can be\nfundamentally resolved by taking the loss function into account: In contrast to\nMean Squared Error (MSE) loss, we prove that under cross-entropy (CE) loss, an\nintermediate \\textit{controlled divergence} regime emerges, where logits\ndiverge but loss, gradients, and activations remain stable. Stable training\nunder large learning rates enables persistent feature evolution at scale in all\nhidden layers, which is crucial for the practical success of SP. In experiments\nacross optimizers (SGD, Adam), architectures (MLPs, GPT) and data modalities\n(vision, language), we validate that neural networks operate in this controlled\ndivergence regime under CE loss but not under MSE loss. Our empirical evidence\nsuggests that width-scaling considerations are surprisingly useful for\npredicting empirically optimal learning rate exponents. Finally, our analysis\nclarifies the effectiveness and limitations of recently proposed layerwise\nlearning rate scalings for standard initialization.",

The central focus of our work is to understand the critical\nphenomena of Catastrophic Overfitting (CO) and Robust Overfitting (RO) in AT\nfrom an energy perspective. We analyze the impact of existing AT approaches on\nthe energy of samples during training and observe that the behavior of the\n``delta energy' -- change in energy between original sample and its adversarial\ncounterpart -- diverges significantly when CO or RO occurs. After a thorough\nanalysis of these energy dynamics and their relationship with overfitting, we\npropose a novel regularizer, the Delta Energy Regularizer (DER), designed to\nsmoothen the energy landscape during training.

In the wake of recent world events, the\nrelevance and scope of such Civil Clauses has been questioned in reports issued\nby some governments and by the EU Commission, a development that opens the door\nto a possible blurring of the distinction between peaceful and military\nresearch.\n  This paper documents the reflections stimulated by a panel discussion on this\nissue recently organized by the Science4Peace Forum.

We use this approach to derive\ngeneral conditions for the coincidence of the critical threshold with the\nsurvival/extinction threshold in the local limit. We further argue that the\ncorrect time scale to separate fast extinction from slow extinction in sparse\ngraphs is, in general, the exponential scale, by showing that fast extinction\nmay occur on stretched exponential time scales in sparse scale-free spatial\nnetworks. Together with recent results by Nam, Nguyen and Sly (Trans. Am.

One of\nthe state-of-the-art approaches, Alternative Blind Power Identification (ABPI),\ntheoretically eliminates the dependence on steady-state temperatures,\naddressing a major shortcoming of previous approaches. However, ABPI\nperformance has remained unverified in actual hardware implementations. In this\nstudy, we conduct the first empirical validation of ABPI on commercial hardware\nusing the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX platform. Our findings reveal that, while\nABPI provides computational efficiency and independence from steady-state\ntemperature, it exhibits considerable accuracy deficiencies in real-world\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that\nintegrates Custom Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CPINNs) with the underlying\nthermal model of ABPI. Our approach employs a specialized loss function that\nharmonizes physical principles with data-driven learning, complemented by\nmulti-objective genetic algorithm optimization to balance estimation accuracy\nand computational cost. In experimental validation, CPINN-ABPI achieves a\nreduction of 84.7\\% CPU and 73.9\\% GPU in the mean absolute error (MAE)\nrelative to ABPI, with the weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE)\nimproving from 47\\%--81\\% to $\\sim$12\\%.

Building on\nrecent theoretical insights about the spectral geometry of these models, we\npropose a unified framework for simultaneous community detection and model\nselection across the full blockmodel hierarchy.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve\nand summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI\nassistants. While these models enhance user experience by generating coherent\nsummaries, they obscure the contributions of original content creators, raising\nconcerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of\nvaluing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries. We propose using\nShapley values, a game-theoretic method that allocates credit based on each\ndocument's marginal contribution. Although theoretically appealing, Shapley\nvalues are expensive to compute at scale. We therefore propose Cluster Shapley,\nan efficient approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity between\ndocuments. By clustering documents using LLM-based embeddings and computing\nShapley values at the cluster level, our method significantly reduces\ncomputation while maintaining attribution quality. We demonstrate our approach\nto a summarization task using Amazon product reviews. Cluster Shapley\nsignificantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy,\noutperforming baseline methods such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP\nwith a better efficient frontier. Our approach is agnostic to the exact LLM\nused, the summarization process used, and the evaluation procedure, which makes\nit broadly applicable to a variety of summarization settings.",

However,\ntraditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and\ntarget domains are known, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This\nleads to performance degradation if private classes exist. To address this\nlimitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation\n(UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of\ncategory settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low\nconfidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to\nconfusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP:\nUniDA-SS with Image Matching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework\ncomposed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based\nDistinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes,\nenabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the\nidentification of common classes across domains. Second, Target-based Image\nMatching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels\nbased on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective\nlearning of common classes.

To address this gap, we propose next-event prediction\n(NEP), a learning task that harnesses future video segments as a rich,\nself-supervised signal to foster temporal reasoning.

To support this task, we\ncurate V1-33K, a dataset comprising 33,000 automatically extracted video\nsegments spanning diverse real-world scenarios. We further explore a range of\nvideo instruction-tuning strategies to study their effects on temporal\nreasoning.

A novel metric, the Adoption over Time\nIndex (ATI), captures cumulative adoption intensity and identifies shifts in\nadoption trends, improving the ability to distinguish between fundamental\nadoption paths. By combining ATI with three key features found to be indicative\nof adoption dynamics, we define a typology of eight distinct paths, including\ntwo newly identified trajectories - the decelerating path and the declining\nmoderate path. Applying this framework to a case study of an off-grid Bedouin\npopulation in southern Israel reveals that these retreating paths exist in\nsubstantial proportions. Identifying such trends is critical for addressing\nstagnation and preventing backsliding in the diffusion process. The leaping\npath, by contrast, was nearly absent. We also identify behavioral diversity\nwithin both front-runner and trailing groups. Differentiating among these\ngroups can help tailor acceleration strategies. The analysis further reveals\nsignificant disparities in adoption levels across the region, with lagging\nclusters being widespread and overall adoption falling short of the region's\npotential.",

However, these supervised methods require expensive and manually\nannotated multi-modal data--an ultimately unsustainable resource. While recent\nefforts have explored unsupervised post-training, their methods are complex and\ndifficult to iterate. In this work, we are the first to investigate the use of\nGRPO, a stable and scalable online RL algorithm, for enabling continual\nself-improvement without any external supervision. We propose MM-UPT, a simple\nyet effective framework for unsupervised post-training of MLLMs. MM-UPT builds\nupon GRPO, replacing traditional reward signals with a self-rewarding mechanism\nbased on majority voting over multiple sampled responses. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that MM-UPT significantly improves the reasoning ability of\nQwen2.5-VL-7B (e.g., 66.3 %$\\rightarrow$72.9 % on MathVista, 62.9\n%$\\rightarrow$68.7 % on We-Math), using standard dataset without ground truth\nlabels.

    "abstract": "As sixth-generation (6G) networks continue to evolve, AI-driven solutions are\nplaying a crucial role in enabling more efficient and adaptive resource\nmanagement in wireless communication. One of the key innovations in 6G is\nuser-centric cell-free massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (UC-CFmMIMO), a\nparadigm that eliminates traditional cell boundaries and enhances network\nperformance by dynamically assigning access points (APs) to users. This\napproach is particularly well-suited for vehicular networks, offering seamless,\nhomogeneous, ultra-reliable, and low-latency connectivity. However, in dense\nnetworks, a key challenge lies in efficiently allocating frequency resources\nwithin a limited shared subband spectrum while accounting for frequency\nselectivity and the dependency of signal propagation on bandwidth. These\nfactors make resource allocation increasingly complex, especially in dynamic\nenvironments where maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) is critical. This paper\ntackles these challenges by proposing a hybrid multi-user allocation strategy\nthat integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and metaheuristic optimization to\nenhance spectral efficiency (SE), ensure fairness, and mitigate interference\nwithin shared subbands. To assess its effectiveness, we compare this hybrid\napproach with two other methods: the bio-inspired Aquila Optimizer (AO) and\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based Actor-Critic Reinforcement\nLearning (AC-RL). Our evaluation is grounded in real-world patterns and channel\ncharacteristics, utilizing the 3GPP-3D channel modeling framework (QuaDRiGa) to\ncapture realistic propagation conditions. The results demonstrate that the\nproposed hybrid strategy achieves a superior balance among competing\nobjectives, underscoring the role of AI-driven resource allocation in advancing\nUC-CFmMIMO systems for next-generation wireless networks.",

Our empirical evaluation confirms SOReL's ability to accurately\nestimate regret in the Bayesian setting whilst TOReL's offline hyperparameter\ntuning achieves competitive performance with the best online hyperparameter\ntuning methods using only offline data.

In this paper, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a\nmethod for dimension reduction and estimate the number of significant principal\ncomponents of the empirical covariance matrix of the angular measure under the\nassumption of a spiked covariance structure. Therefore, we develop Akaike\nInformation Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) to estimate\nthe location of the spiked eigenvalue of the covariance matrix, reflecting the\nnumber of significant components, and explore these information criteria on\nconsistency. On the one hand, we investigate the case where the dimension $d$\nis fixed, and on the other hand, where the dimension $d$ converges to $\\infty$\nunder different high-dimensional scenarios. When the dimension $d$ is fixed, we\nestablish that the AIC is not consistent, whereas the BIC is weakly consistent.\nIn the high-dimensional setting, with techniques from random matrix theory, we\nderive sufficient conditions for the AIC and the BIC to be consistent. Finally,\nthe performance of the different AIC and BIC versions is compared in a\nsimulation study and applied to high-dimensional precipitation data.",

However, each\ncylinder can have a different cross-section with an arbitrary shape and\ndifferent gyrotropic material properties, i.e., both gyroelectric and\ngyromagnetic anisotropies are considered. The solution to the problem combines\nthe following three elements: (i) development of a superpotentials-based\ncylindrical vector wave function (CVWF) expansion to express the EM field in\nthe gyrotropic region; (ii) utilization of the extended boundary condition\nmethod (EBCM) to account for non-circular cylinders; (iii) use of Graf's\nformulas, specifically adapted for the CVWFs, to apply the EBCM at each\ncylinder.

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of IoT devices and their diverse workloads,\ncontainer-based microservices deployed at edge nodes have become a lightweight\nand scalable solution. However, existing microservice scheduling algorithms\noften assume static resource availability, which is unrealistic when multiple\ncontainers are assigned to an edge node. Besides, containers suffer from\ncold-start inefficiencies during early-stage training in currently popular\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In this paper, we propose a hybrid\nlearning framework that combines offline imitation learning (IL) with online\nSoft Actor-Critic (SAC) optimization to enable a cold-start-aware microservice\nscheduling with dynamic allocation for computing resources. We first formulate\na delay-and-energy-aware scheduling problem and construct a rule-based expert\nto generate demonstration data for behavior cloning. Then, a GRU-enhanced\npolicy network is designed in the policy network to extract the correlation\namong multiple decisions by separately encoding slow-evolving node states and\nfast-changing microservice features, and an action selection mechanism is given\nto speed up the convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method\nsignificantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior final performance.\nCompared with baselines, our algorithm improves the total objective by $50\\%$\nand convergence speed by $70\\%$, and demonstrates the highest stability and\nrobustness across various edge configurations.",

    "abstract": "The construction of confidence intervals for the mean of a bounded random\nvariable is a classical problem in statistics with numerous applications in\nmachine learning and virtually all scientific fields. In particular, obtaining\nthe tightest possible confidence intervals is vital every time the sampling of\nthe random variables is expensive. The current state-of-the-art method to\nconstruct confidence intervals is by using betting algorithms. This is a very\nsuccessful approach for deriving optimal confidence sequences, even matching\nthe rate of law of iterated logarithms. However, in the fixed horizon setting,\nthese approaches are either sub-optimal or based on heuristic solutions with\nstrong empirical performance but without a finite-time guarantee. Hence, no\nbetting-based algorithm guaranteeing the optimal\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2\\log\\frac1\\delta}{n}})$ width of the\nconfidence intervals are known. This work bridges this gap. We propose a\nbetting-based algorithm to compute confidence intervals that empirically\noutperforms the competitors. Our betting strategy uses the optimal strategy in\nevery step (in a certain sense), whereas the standard betting methods choose a\nconstant strategy in advance. Leveraging this fact results in strict\nimprovements even for classical concentration inequalities, such as the ones of\nHoeffding or Bernstein.

    "abstract": "Charge radii are sensitive indicators to identify the nuclear structure\nphenomena throughout the whole nuclide chart. In particular, the shrunken trend\nof changes of charge radii along a long isotopic chain is intimately associated\nwith the shell quenching effect. In this work, the systematic evolution of\ncharge radii along the proton numbers $Z=8$, $10$, $12$, $14$, $18$ isotopes is\ninvestigated by a relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov model. A ansatz about\nneutron-proton correlation around Fermi surface is considered for describing\nthe abnormal behavior of nuclear charge radii. Our results show that the\nneutron-proton pairing corrections around the Fermi surface lead to a sudden\nstrengthening of the charge radii of these isotopic chains at $N=8$, 20 and 28,\nreflecting the fact that this correction enhances the shell closure across\n$N=8$, 20 and 28. The reproduction of the $N=14$ charge radius in the Mg\nisotopes is affected by the way in which pairing correlations are handled, with\nBCS theory overestimating the shell effect of $N=14$, and the Bogoliubov\nquasiparticle transformation suggests a stronger pairing correlation near the\nproton Fermi surface, which is more consistent with experimental results. An\nanalysis of the deviations from the theoretical and available experimental data\nfor the charge radii of the 24 selected even-even nuclei shows that the\nneutron-proton pairing correction around the Fermi surface has an improved\neffect on the calculation of the charge {radii} using the meson-exchange\neffective interactions, but it does not help to significantly improve the\nresults calculated by the density-dependent effective interactions.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in solving complex tasks such as mathematics and coding. However,\nthese models frequently exhibit a phenomenon known as overthinking during\ninference, characterized by excessive validation loops and redundant\ndeliberation, leading to substantial computational overheads. In this paper, we\naim to mitigate overthinking by investigating the underlying mechanisms from\nthe perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We first showcase that the\ntendency of overthinking can be effectively captured by a single direction in\nthe model's activation space and the issue can be eased by intervening the\nactivations along this direction. However, this efficacy soon reaches a plateau\nand even deteriorates as the intervention strength increases. We therefore\nsystematically explore the activation space and find that the overthinking\nphenomenon is actually tied to a low-dimensional manifold, which indicates that\nthe limited effect stems from the noises introduced by the high-dimensional\nsteering direction. Based on this insight, we propose Manifold Steering, a\nnovel approach that elegantly projects the steering direction onto the\nlow-dimensional activation manifold given the theoretical approximation of the\ninterference noise. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 distilled models\nvalidate that our method reduces output tokens by up to 71% while maintaining\nand even improving the accuracy on several mathematical benchmarks. Our method\nalso exhibits robust cross-domain transferability, delivering consistent token\nreduction performance in code generation and knowledge-based QA tasks.

This framework provides an easy\nand convenient way to re-obtain a number of other quantum frameworks like\nvariable time search, quantum divide & conquer and bomb query algorithms. The\nunderlying algorithm is simple, explicitly constructed, and has low\npoly-logarithmic factors in the complexity.\n  As a corollary, this gives a quantum algorithm for variable time search with\nunknown times with optimal query complexity $\\text{O}(\\sqrt{T \\log\n\\min(n,t_{\\max})})$, where $T = \\sum_i t_i^2$ and $t_{\\max} = \\max_i t_i$ if\n$t_i$ is the number of steps required to compute the $i$-th variable.

A variety of\nmechanisms for valley polarization have been proposed, among which the\nvalley-layer coupling mechanism involves the induction of valley polarization\nby an out-of-plane electric field. Here, through first-principles calculations,\nit is found that the weak valley-layer coupling can exist in centrosymmetric\n$\\mathrm{FeCl_2}$ monolayer.

    "abstract": "Modeling physical systems in a generative manner offers several advantages,\nincluding the ability to handle partial observations, generate diverse\nsolutions, and address both forward and inverse problems. Recently, diffusion\nmodels have gained increasing attention in the modeling of physical systems,\nparticularly those governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). However,\ndiffusion models only access noisy data $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ at intermediate\nsteps, making it infeasible to directly enforce constraints on the clean sample\n$\\boldsymbol{x}_0$ at each noisy level. As a workaround, constraints are\ntypically applied to the expectation of clean samples\n$\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{x}_0|\\boldsymbol{x}_t]$, which is estimated using the\nlearned score network. However, imposing PDE constraints on the expectation\ndoes not strictly represent the one on the true clean data, known as Jensen's\nGap. This gap creates a trade-off: enforcing PDE constraints may come at the\ncost of reduced accuracy in generative modeling. To address this, we propose a\nsimple yet effective post-hoc distillation approach, where PDE constraints are\nnot injected directly into the diffusion process, but instead enforced during a\npost-hoc distillation stage. We term our method as Physics-Informed\nDistillation of Diffusion Models (PIDDM). This distillation not only\nfacilitates single-step generation with improved PDE satisfaction, but also\nsupport both forward and inverse problem solving and reconstruction from\nrandomly partial observation. Extensive experiments across various PDE\nbenchmarks demonstrate that PIDDM significantly improves PDE satisfaction over\nseveral recent and competitive baselines, such as PIDM, DiffusionPDE, and\nECI-sampling, with less computation overhead.

While smart agriculture utilizes artificial intelligence (AI)\ntechnologies to enable precise control, it still encounters significant\nchallenges, including excessive reliance on agricultural expert knowledge,\ndifficulties in fusing multimodal data, poor adaptability to dynamic\nenvironments, and bottlenecks in real-time decision-making at the edge. Large\nlanguage models (LLMs), with their exceptional capabilities in knowledge\nacquisition and semantic understanding, provide a promising solution to address\nthese challenges. To this end, we propose Farm-LightSeek, an edge-centric\nmultimodal agricultural IoT data analytics framework that integrates LLMs with\nedge computing. This framework collects real-time farmland multi-source data\n(images, weather, geographic information) via sensors, performs cross-modal\nreasoning and disease detection at edge nodes, conducts low-latency management\ndecisions, and enables cloud collaboration for model updates. The main\ninnovations of Farm-LightSeek include: (1) an agricultural\n\"perception-decision-action\" closed-loop architecture; (2) cross-modal adaptive\nmonitoring; and (3)a lightweight LLM deployment strategy balancing performance\nand efficiency. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat Farm-LightSeek consistently achieves reliable performance in\nmission-critical tasks, even under the limitations of edge computing resources.\nThis work advances intelligent real-time agricultural solutions and highlights\nthe potential for deeper integration of agricultural IoT with LLMs.",

In this work, we introduce\nSYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in\nmulti-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how\nquickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it\nshifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying\nSYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that\nsycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode. Our analysis shows that alignment\ntuning amplifies sycophantic behavior, whereas model scaling and reasoning\noptimization strengthen the model's ability to resist undesirable user views.\nReasoning models generally outperform instruction-tuned models but often fail\nwhen they over-index on logical exposition instead of directly addressing the\nuser's underlying beliefs. Finally, we evaluate four additional prompting\nstrategies and demonstrate that adopting a third-person perspective reduces\nsycophancy by up to 63.8% in debate scenario.

Pangu Embedded addresses the significant\ncomputational costs and inference latency challenges prevalent in existing\nreasoning-optimized LLMs. We propose a two-stage training framework for its\nconstruction. In Stage 1, the model is finetuned via an iterative distillation\nprocess, incorporating inter-iteration model merging to effectively aggregate\ncomplementary knowledge. This is followed by reinforcement learning on Ascend\nclusters, optimized by a latency-tolerant scheduler that combines stale\nsynchronous parallelism with prioritized data queues. The RL process is guided\nby a Multi-source Adaptive Reward System (MARS), which generates dynamic,\ntask-specific reward signals using deterministic metrics and lightweight LLM\nevaluators for mathematics, coding, and general problem-solving tasks. Stage 2\nintroduces a dual-system framework, endowing Pangu Embedded with a \"fast\" mode\nfor routine queries and a deeper \"slow\" mode for complex inference. This\nframework offers both manual mode switching for user control and an automatic,\ncomplexity-aware mode selection mechanism that dynamically allocates\ncomputational resources to balance latency and reasoning depth.

However, the neural responses are usually\nobtained within the diffusion approximation modeling synaptic inputs as\ncontinuous Gaussian noise. Here, we present a rigorous mean-field theory that\nencompasses synaptic shot-noise for sparse balanced inhibitory neural networks\ndriven by an excitatory drive. Our theory predicts new dynamical regimes, in\nagreement with numerical simulations, which are not captured by the classical\ndiffusion approximation. Notably, these regimes feature self-sustained global\noscillations emerging at low connectivity (in-degree) via either continuous or\nhysteretic transitions and characterized by irregular neural activity, as\nexpected for balanced dynamics. For sufficiently weak (strong) excitatory drive\n(inhibitory feedback) the transition line displays a peculiar re-entrant shape\nrevealing the existence of global oscillations at low and high in-degrees,\nseparated by an asynchronous regime at intermediate levels of connectivity. The\nmechanisms leading to the emergence of these global oscillations are distinct:\ndrift-driven at high connectivity and cluster activation at low connectivity.\nThe frequency of these two kinds of global oscillations can be varied from slow\n(around 1 Hz) to fast (around 100 Hz), without altering their microscopic and\nmacroscopic features, by adjusting the excitatory drive and the synaptic\ninhibition strength in a prescribed way.

    "abstract": "DNA, encoding genetic instructions for almost all living organisms, fuels\ngroundbreaking advances in genomics and synthetic biology. Recently, DNA\nFoundation Models have achieved success in designing synthetic functional DNA\nsequences, even whole genomes, but their susceptibility to jailbreaking remains\nunderexplored, leading to potential concern of generating harmful sequences\nsuch as pathogens or toxin-producing genes. In this paper, we introduce\nGeneBreaker, the first framework to systematically evaluate jailbreak\nvulnerabilities of DNA foundation models. GeneBreaker employs (1) an LLM agent\nwith customized bioinformatic tools to design high-homology, non-pathogenic\njailbreaking prompts, (2) beam search guided by PathoLM and log-probability\nheuristics to steer generation toward pathogen-like sequences, and (3) a\nBLAST-based evaluation pipeline against a curated Human Pathogen Database\n(JailbreakDNABench) to detect successful jailbreaks. Evaluated on our\nJailbreakDNABench, GeneBreaker successfully jailbreaks the latest Evo series\nmodels across 6 viral categories consistently (up to 60\\% Attack Success Rate\nfor Evo2-40B). Further case studies on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and HIV-1\nenvelope protein demonstrate the sequence and structural fidelity of jailbreak\noutput, while evolutionary modeling of SARS-CoV-2 underscores biosecurity\nrisks. Our findings also reveal that scaling DNA foundation models amplifies\ndual-use risks, motivating enhanced safety alignment and tracing mechanisms.\nOur code is at https://github.com/zaixizhang/GeneBreaker.",

    "abstract": "A notoriously difficult challenge in extreme value theory is the choice of\nthe number $k\\ll n$, where $n$ is the total sample size, of extreme data points\nto consider for inference of tail quantities. Existing theoretical guarantees\nfor adaptive methods typically require second-order assumptions or von Mises\nassumptions that are difficult to verify and often come with tuning parameters\nthat are challenging to calibrate. This paper revisits the problem of adaptive\nselection of $k$ for the Hill estimator. Our goal is not an `optimal' $k$ but\none that is `good enough', in the sense that we strive for non-asymptotic\nguarantees that might be sub-optimal but are explicit and require minimal\nconditions. We propose a transparent adaptive rule that does not require\npreliminary calibration of constants, inspired by `adaptive validation'\ndeveloped in high-dimensional statistics. A key feature of our approach is the\nconsideration of a grid for $k$ of size $ \\ll n $, which aligns with common\npractice among practitioners but has remained unexplored in theoretical\nanalysis. Our rule only involves an explicit expression of a variance-type\nterm; in particular, it does not require controlling or estimating a biasterm.\nOur theoretical analysis is valid for all heavy-tailed distributions,\nspecifically for all regularly varying survival functions. Furthermore, when\nvon Mises conditions hold, our method achieves `almost' minimax optimality with\na rate of $\\sqrt{\\log \\log n}~ n^{-|\\rho|/(1+2|\\rho|)}$ when the grid size is\nof order $\\log n$, in contrast to the $ (\\log \\log (n)/n)^{|\\rho|/(1+2|\\rho|)}\n$ rate in existing work.

Gradient projection has emerged\nas an effective and popular paradigm in CL, where it partitions the gradient\nspace of previously learned tasks into two orthogonal subspaces: a primary\nsubspace and a minor subspace. New tasks are learned effectively within the\nminor subspace, thereby reducing interference with previously acquired\nknowledge. However, existing Gradient Projection methods struggle to achieve an\noptimal balance between plasticity and stability, as it is hard to\nappropriately partition the gradient space.

    "abstract": "The orderly behaviors observed in large-scale groups, such as fish schooling\nand the organized movement of crowds, are both ubiquitous and essential for the\nsurvival and stability of these systems. Such complex collective behaviors\noften emerge from simple local interactions and strategy adjustments among\nindividuals. Understanding how these basic rules shape complex group dynamics\nhas long been a significant scientific challenge. Historically, research has\npredominantly focused on imitation and social learning, where individuals adopt\nthe strategies of more successful peers to refine their behavior. However, in\nrecent years, an alternative learning approach, self-exploration and\nintrospective learning, has garnered increasing attention. In this paradigm,\nindividuals assess their own circumstances and select strategies that best\nalign with their specific conditions. Two primary forms of this learning are\ncoordination and anti-coordination, where individuals align with and diverge\nfrom the local majority, respectively. In this study, we analyze networked\nsystems of coordinating and anti-coordinating individuals, exploring the\ncombined effects of system dynamics, network structure, and behavioral\npatterns. We address several practical questions, including the number of\nequilibria, their characteristics, the equilibrium time, and the resilience of\nsystems. We find that the number of equilibrium states can be extremely large,\neven increasing exponentially with minor alternations to the network structure.\nMoreover, the network structure has a significant impact on the average\nequilibrium time. Despite the complexity of these findings, variations can be\ncaptured by a single, simple network characteristic: the average path length.\nOur research offers valuable insights into how modifications to the interaction\nstructure can influence behavioral alignment in social networks.",

The key alternative is energy harvesting, but\nbattery-less IoT systems require extensive evaluation to demonstrate that they\nare sufficiently performant across the full range of expected operating\nconditions. IoT developers thus need an evaluation platform that (i) ensures\nthat each evaluated application and configuration is exposed to exactly the\nsame energy environment and events, and (ii) provides a detailed account of\nwhat the application spends the harvested energy on. We therefore developed the\nEStacker evaluation platform which (i) provides fair and repeatable evaluation,\nand (ii) generates energy stacks. Energy stacks break down the total energy\nconsumption of an application across hardware components and application\nactivities, thereby explaining what the application specifically uses energy\non. We augment EStacker with the ST-SP optimization which, in our experiments,\nreduces evaluation time by 6.3x on average while retaining the temporal\nbehavior of the battery-less IoT system (average throughput error of 7.7%) by\nproportionally scaling time and power. We demonstrate the utility of EStacker\nthrough two case studies. In the first case study, we use energy stack profiles\nto identify a performance problem that, once addressed, improves performance by\n3.3x. The second case study focuses on ST-SP, and we use it to explore the\ndesign space required to dimension the harvester and energy storage sizes of a\nsmart parking application in roughly one week (7.7 days).

    "abstract": "This paper studies a bandit optimization problem where the goal is to\nmaximize a function $f(x)$ over $T$ periods for some unknown strongly concave\nfunction $f$. We consider a new pairwise comparison oracle, where the\ndecision-maker chooses a pair of actions $(x, x')$ for a consecutive number of\nperiods and then obtains an estimate of $f(x)-f(x')$. We show that such a\npairwise comparison oracle finds important applications to joint pricing and\ninventory replenishment problems and network revenue management. The challenge\nin this bandit optimization is twofold. First, the decision-maker not only\nneeds to determine a pair of actions $(x, x')$ but also a stopping time $n$\n(i.e., the number of queries based on $(x, x')$). Second, motivated by our\ninventory application, the estimate of the difference $f(x)-f(x')$ is biased,\nwhich is different from existing oracles in stochastic optimization literature.\nTo address these challenges, we first introduce a discretization technique and\nlocal polynomial approximation to relate this problem to linear bandits. Then\nwe developed a tournament successive elimination technique to localize the\ndiscretized cell and run an interactive batched version of LinUCB algorithm on\ncells. We establish regret bounds that are optimal up to poly-logarithmic\nfactors. Furthermore, we apply our proposed algorithm and analytical framework\nto the two operations management problems and obtain results that improve\nstate-of-the-art results in the existing literature.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image generation models have led to a\nsurge in subject-driven text-to-image generation, which aims to produce\ncustomized images that align with textual descriptions while preserving the\nidentity of specific subjects. Despite significant progress, current methods\nstruggle to disentangle identity-relevant information from identity-irrelevant\ndetails in the input images, resulting in overfitting or failure to maintain\nsubject identity. In this work, we propose a novel framework that improves the\nseparation of identity-related and identity-unrelated features and introduces\nan innovative feature fusion mechanism to improve the quality and text\nalignment of generated images. Our framework consists of two key components: an\nImplicit-Explicit foreground-background Decoupling Module (IEDM) and a Feature\nFusion Module (FFM) based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE). IEDM combines\nlearnable adapters for implicit decoupling at the feature level with inpainting\ntechniques for explicit foreground-background separation at the image level.\nFFM dynamically integrates identity-irrelevant features with identity-related\nfeatures, enabling refined feature representations even in cases of incomplete\ndecoupling. In addition, we introduce three complementary loss functions to\nguide the decoupling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method in enhancing image generation quality,\nimproving flexibility in scene adaptation, and increasing the diversity of\ngenerated outputs across various textual descriptions.",

In this setting, we show risk bounds that reveal that convergence\nrates are crucially influenced by the geometry of the loss template, as\nformalized by Wang and Scott (2024), rather than of the loss function itself.\nParticularly, we establish risk upper bounds that holds for any decay rate of\nthe loss whose template is smooth with respect to the $p$-norm. In the case of\nexponentially decaying losses, our results indicates a contrast between the\n$p=\\infty$ case, where the risk exhibits a logarithmic dependence on $k$, and\n$p=2$ where the risk scales linearly with $k$. To establish this separation\nformally, we also prove a lower bound in the latter scenario, demonstrating\nthat the polynomial dependence on $k$ is unavoidable.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from catastrophic forgetting in\ncontinual learning (CL) scenarios, where performance on previously learned\ntasks degrades severely while training on sequentially arriving tasks. Although\npioneering CL approaches using orthogonal subspaces can mitigate task\ninterference, they typically employ fixed budget allocation, neglecting the\nvarying complexity across tasks and layers. Besides, recent budget-adaptive\ntuning methods for LLMs often adopt multi-stage paradigms that decouple\noptimization and budget allocation. Such decoupling results in potential\nmisalignment, which hinders those approaches' practical application in CL\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose OA-Adapter, a novel\nparameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs that unifies\ndynamic budget adaptation with orthogonal subspace learning in a single\nend-to-end training stage. Specifically, OA-Adapter introduces a dynamic\nbottleneck dimension adaptation mechanism that simultaneously allocates an\nefficient parameter budget and optimizes task objectives without misalignment.\nTo effectively preserve previously acquired knowledge while coordinating with\nthe dynamic budget allocation, orthogonal constraints are applied specifically\nbetween the parameter subspace of the current task and the dynamically\nallocated parameter subspaces of historical tasks. Experimental results on\ncontinual learning benchmarks demonstrate that OA-Adapter outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and parameter efficiency, achieving\nhigher average accuracy while using 58.5% fewer parameters on the standard CL\nbenchmark.",

The proposed two-layer barrier Lyapunov function (BLF)-based control\ndesign considers the input and the input rate as states that are constrained\nusing two BLFs in the first layer, while another BLF in the second layer\nconstrains the plant states. The adaptive control law ensures that the plant\nstates, input amplitude, and input rate remain within the user-defined safe\nsets despite unmatched bounded disturbances. Sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of a feasible control policy are also provided. To the best of the\nauthors' knowledge, this is the first optimization-free method that imposes\nuser-defined constraints on the state, input, and input rate and also provides\nverifiable feasibility conditions in the presence of parametric uncertainties\nand disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Different types of graphs and complex networks have been characterized,\nanalyzed, and modeled based on measurements of their respective topology.\nHowever, the available networks may constitute approximations of the original\nstructure as a consequence of sampling incompleteness, noise, and/or error in\nthe representation of that structure. Therefore, it becomes of particular\ninterest to quantify how successive modifications may impact a set of adopted\ntopological measurements, and how respectively undergone changes can be\ninterrelated, which has been addressed in this paper by considering similarity\nnetworks and hierarchical clustering approaches. These studies are developed\nrespectively to several topological measurements (accessibility, degree,\nhierarchical degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality,\nassortativity, and average shortest path) calculated from complex networks of\nthree main types (Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi, Barab\\'asi-Albert, and geographical) with\nvarying sizes or subjected to progressive edge removal or rewiring. The\ncoincidence similarity index, which can implement particularly strict\ncomparisons, is adopted for two main purposes: to quantify and visualize how\nthe considered topological measurements respond to the considered network\nalterations and to represent hierarchically the relationships between the\nobserved changes undergone by the considered topological measurements. Several\nresults are reported and discussed, including the identification of three types\nof topological changes taking place as a consequence of the modifications. In\naddition, the changes observed for the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi and Barab\\'asi-Albert\nnetworks resulted mutually more similarly affected by topological changes than\nfor the geometrical networks. The latter type of network has been identified to\nhave more heterogeneous topological features than the other two types of\nnetworks.",

While effective, this trend comes at an extraordinary cost.\nThis is due to two deeply intertwined factors: the size of models and the size\nof datasets. While promising research efforts focus on reducing the size of\nmodels, the other half of the equation remains fairly mysterious. Indeed, it is\nsurprising that the standard approach to training remains to iterate over and\nover, uniformly sampling the training dataset. In this paper we explore a\nseries of alternative training paradigms that leverage insights from\nhard-data-mining and dropout, simple enough to implement and use that can\nbecome the new training standard. The proposed Progressive Data Dropout reduces\nthe number of effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of the baseline. This\nsavings actually do not come at any cost for accuracy. Surprisingly, the\nproposed method improves accuracy by up to 4.82%.

Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through\nprompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model\nparameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm\nthat turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human\n(or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the\nrelevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward\nsignals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending\nportions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned\nadjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three\ncomponents: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs\ncritiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts\nspan-level reward on answer while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a\nspan-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients.\nAcross summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad\nconsistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing\nboth higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results demonstrate\nthat natural-language feedback, when converted to gradients, is a powerful\nsignal for fine-grained policy optimization.

One of the key techniques in such researches is\nleveraging the accurate prediction of the MUS performance through GPR in\ndifferent test scenarios. Due to the potential correlations among the multiple\nMUS performance metrics, current researches commonly utilize a multi-output GPR\n(MOGPR) to model the multiple performance metrics simultaneously. This approach\ncan achieve a more accurate prediction, rather than modeling each metric\nindividually. However, MOGPR still suffers from negative transfer. When the\nfeature of one output variable is incorrectly learned by another, the models\ntraining process will be negatively affected, leading to a decline in\nprediction performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel\nadaptive regularization approach into the conventional MOGPR training process.\nUnlike existing regularization approaches for mitigating negative transfer in\nMOGPR, our method penalizes the inconsistencies among output-specific\ncharacteristic parameters using adaptively adjustable regularization weights.\nThis mechanism helps each set of output parameters avoid local optima.\nConsequently, it yields simultaneous improvements in predictive accuracy across\nall outputs. Finally, we validate our approach on a numerical case and on a\nboundary test scenario generation case for a MUS multi-objectives search task.",

Recent applications\ninclude the recovery of information from light that has been scrambled during\npropagation through a complex scattering medium, especially in the challenging\ncase where the deterministic input-output transmission matrix cannot be\nmeasured. This naturally raises the question of what the limit is that\ninformation theory imposes on this recovery process, and whether neural\nnetworks can actually reach this limit. To answer these questions, we introduce\na model-free approach to calculate the Cram\\'er-Rao bound, which sets the\nultimate precision limit at which artificial neural networks can operate. As an\nexample, we apply this approach in a proof-of-principle experiment using laser\nlight propagating through a disordered medium, evidencing that a convolutional\nnetwork approaches the ultimate precision limit in the challenging task of\nlocalizing a reflective target hidden behind a dynamically-fluctuating\nscattering medium.

Reinforcement learning (RL), a dominant paradigm for learning in\nhigh-dimensional control tasks, is known to suffer from brittleness to task\nvariations and catastrophic forgetting. Neuroevolution (NE) has recently gained\nattention for its robustness, scalability, and capacity to escape local optima.\nIn this paper, we investigate an understudied dimension of NE: its transfer\nlearning capabilities. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks: a) in stepping\ngates, neural networks are tasked with emulating logic circuits, with designs\nthat emphasize modular repetition and variation b) ecorobot extends the Brax\nphysics engine with objects such as walls and obstacles and the ability to\neasily switch between different robotic morphologies. Crucial in both\nbenchmarks is the presence of a curriculum that enables evaluating skill\ntransfer across tasks of increasing complexity. Our empirical analysis shows\nthat NE methods vary in their transfer abilities and frequently outperform RL\nbaselines. Our findings support the potential of NE as a foundation for\nbuilding more adaptable agents and highlight future challenges for scaling NE\nto complex, real-world problems.",

High-dimensional feature spaces that are\ntypical of machine learning classification models admit many possible\ncounterfactual examples to a decision, and so it is important to identify\nadditional criteria to select the most useful counterfactuals. In this paper,\nwe explore the idea that the counterfactuals should be maximally informative\nwhen considering the knowledge of a specific individual about the underlying\nclassifier. To quantify this information gain we explicitly model the knowledge\nof the individual, and assess the uncertainty of predictions which the\nindividual makes by the width of a conformal prediction interval. Regions of\nfeature space where the prediction interval is wide correspond to areas where\nthe confidence in decision making is low, and an additional counterfactual\nexample might be more informative to an individual. To explore and evaluate our\nindividualised conformal prediction interval counterfactuals (CPICFs), first we\npresent a synthetic data set on a hypercube which allows us to fully visualise\nthe decision boundary, conformal intervals via three different methods, and\nresultant CPICFs.

While prior work focuses on dataset-level augmentation to reduce\nmemorization, little is known about which individual samples contribute most.\nWe present the first data-centric study of memorization dynamics in tabular\ndiffusion models. We quantify memorization for each real sample based on how\nmany generated samples are flagged as replicas, using a relative distance\nratio. Our empirical analysis reveals a heavy-tailed distribution of\nmemorization counts: a small subset of samples contributes disproportionately\nto leakage, confirmed via sample-removal experiments. To understand this, we\ndivide real samples into top- and non-top-memorized groups and analyze their\ntraining-time behaviors. We track when each sample is first memorized and\nmonitor per-epoch memorization intensity (AUC). Memorized samples are memorized\nslightly earlier and show stronger signals in early training. Based on these\ninsights, we propose DynamicCut, a two-stage, model-agnostic mitigation method:\n(a) rank samples by epoch-wise intensity, (b) prune a tunable top fraction, and\n(c) retrain on the filtered dataset. Across multiple tabular datasets and\nmodels, DynamicCut reduces memorization with minimal impact on data diversity\nand downstream performance. It also complements augmentation-based defenses.\nFurthermore, DynamicCut enables cross-model transferability: high-ranked\nsamples identified from one model (e.g., a diffusion model) are also effective\nfor reducing memorization when removed from others, such as GANs and VAEs.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in\nfamiliar contexts, but struggle when the context conflicts with their\nparametric knowledge. To investigate this phenomenon, we introduce\nCounterLogic, a dataset containing 1,800 examples across 9 logical schemas,\nexplicitly designed to evaluate logical reasoning through counterfactual\n(hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) scenarios. Our systematic evaluation of 11\nLLMs across 6 different datasets reveals a consistent performance degradation,\nwith accuracies dropping by 27% on average when reasoning through\ncounterfactual information. We propose Self-Segregate, a prompting method\nenabling metacognitive awareness (explicitly identifying knowledge conflicts)\nbefore reasoning. Our method dramatically narrows the average performance gaps\nfrom 27% to just 11%, while significantly increasing the overall accuracy\n(+7.5%). We discuss the implications of these findings and draw parallels to\nhuman cognitive processes, particularly on how humans disambiguate conflicting\ninformation during reasoning tasks. Our findings offer practical insights for\nunderstanding and enhancing LLMs reasoning capabilities in real-world\napplications, especially where models must logically reason independently of\ntheir factual knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Business process simulation (BPS) is a key tool for analyzing and optimizing\norganizational workflows, supporting decision-making by estimating the impact\nof process changes. The reliability of such estimates depends on the ability of\na BPS model to accurately mimic the process under analysis, making rigorous\naccuracy evaluation essential. However, the state-of-the-art approach to\nevaluating BPS models has two key limitations. First, it treats simulation as a\nforecasting problem, testing whether models can predict unseen future events.\nThis fails to assess how well a model captures the as-is process, particularly\nwhen process behavior changes from train to test period. Thus, it becomes\ndifficult to determine whether poor results stem from an inaccurate model or\nthe inherent complexity of the data, such as unpredictable drift. Second, the\nevaluation approach strongly relies on Earth Mover's Distance-based metrics,\nwhich can obscure temporal patterns and thus yield misleading conclusions about\nsimulation quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that\nevaluates simulation quality based on its ability to generate representative\nprocess behavior. Instead of comparing simulated logs to future real-world\nexecutions, we evaluate whether predictive process monitoring models trained on\nsimulated data perform comparably to those trained on real data for downstream\nanalysis tasks. Empirical results show that our framework not only helps\nidentify sources of discrepancies but also distinguishes between model accuracy\nand data complexity, offering a more meaningful way to assess BPS quality.",

Antiferromagnets support both right-handed\nand left-handed magnon modes, which we treat as positive and negative frequency\nbranches, analogous to electrons and holes in semiconductors. Using a\ntwo-sublattice model with a minimal exchange interaction scheme, we derive the\ntemperature-dependent spin-wave spectrum and evaluate the associated thermal\nspin pumping coefficients. Our analysis reveals that the competition between\nleft- and right-handed modes gives rise to a compensation temperature, where\nthe net thermally generated spin current vanishes. Importantly, we show that\nthis compensation point does not necessarily coincide with the crossing of\nmagnon dispersion branches. While previous research considers a detailed\nmicroscopic model including all magnetic sublattices and exchange couplings,\nour approach demonstrates that key features of mode-resolved spin transport can\nbe captured by a simplified and analytically transparent model.

Many of these systems utilize\ndiffractive optical components (DOEs) for holography, PSF engineering, or\nwavefront shaping. Existing approaches have, however, mostly remained limited\nto laboratory prototypes, owing to a large quality gap between simulation and\nmanufactured devices. We aim at lifting the fundamental technical barriers to\nthe practical use of learned diffractive optical systems. To this end, we\npropose a fabrication-aware design pipeline for diffractive optics fabricated\nby direct-write grayscale lithography followed by nano-imprinting replication,\nwhich is directly suited for inexpensive mass production of large area designs.\nWe propose a super-resolved neural lithography model that can accurately\npredict the 3D geometry generated by the fabrication process.

To\ntackle the computational challenges, we also devise tensor-parallel compute\nframework centered on distributing large-scale FFT computation across many\nGPUs.

Both\ntheorems show that if a $d$-dimensional bipartite quantum strategy's\nobservables $\\epsilon$-almost commute, then they are within $O(\\mathrm{poly}(d)\n\\epsilon)$ (in operator norm) of observables from a genuine tensor product\nstrategy.

    "abstract": "Computer-aided design (CAD) is crucial in prototyping 3D objects through\ngeometric instructions (i.e., CAD programs). In practical design workflows,\ndesigners often engage in time-consuming reviews and refinements of these\nprototypes by comparing them with reference images. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce the CAD review task to automatically detect and correct potential\nerrors, ensuring consistency between the constructed 3D objects and reference\nimages. However, recent advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs)\nstruggle to recognize multiple geometric components and perform spatial\ngeometric operations within the CAD program, leading to inaccurate reviews. In\nthis paper, we propose the CAD program repairer (ReCAD) framework to\neffectively detect program errors and provide helpful feedback on error\ncorrection. Additionally, we create a dataset, CADReview, consisting of over\n20K program-image pairs, with diverse errors for the CAD review task. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our ReCAD significantly outperforms existing\nMLLMs, which shows great potential in design applications.",

These results\nestablish the TWA model as a reliable theoretical tool for studying the\nmechanisms of THz beam shaping via the designed K.

Moreover, we design a novel adaptive rank selector to\nselect the appropriate expert for each task. By jointly training low-rank\nexperts, MoRE can enhance the adaptability and efficiency of LoRA in multi-task\nscenarios. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over multiple multi-task\nbenchmarks along with different LLMs to verify model performance. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that compared to traditional LoRA and its variants, MoRE\nsignificantly improves the performance of LLMs in multi-task scenarios and\nincurs no additional inference cost.

    "abstract": "The preservation of early visual arts, particularly color photographs, is\nchallenged by deterioration caused by aging and improper storage, leading to\nissues like blurring, scratches, color bleeding, and fading defects. Despite\ngreat advances in image restoration and enhancement in recent years, such\nsystematic defects often cannot be restored by current state-of-the-art\nsoftware features as available e.g. in Adobe Photoshop, but would require the\nincorporation of defect-aware priors into the underlying machine learning\ntechniques. However, there are no publicly available datasets of autochromes\nwith defect annotations. In this paper, we address these limitations and\npresent the first approach that allows the automatic removal of greening color\ndefects in digitized autochrome photographs. For this purpose, we introduce an\napproach for accurately simulating respective defects and use the respectively\nobtained synthesized data with its ground truth defect annotations to train a\ngenerative AI model with a carefully designed loss function that accounts for\ncolor imbalances between defected and non-defected areas. As demonstrated in\nour evaluation, our approach allows for the efficient and effective restoration\nof the considered defects, thereby overcoming limitations of alternative\ntechniques that struggle with accurately reproducing original colors and may\nrequire significant manual effort.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs), even when\ntrained to generate extended long reasoning steps, still face significant\nchallenges on hard reasoning problems. However, much of the existing literature\nrelies on direct prompting with simple in-context learning examples for\nevaluation, which largely overlooks advanced techniques to elicit LLMs'\ndeliberate reasoning before drawing conclusions that LLMs hit a performance\nceiling. In this paper, we systematically explore the combined potential of\nin-context search and test-time scaling on super hard reasoning tasks. We find\nthat by employing advanced in-context search prompting to LLMs augmented with\ninternal scaling, one can achieve transformative performance breakthroughs on\ntasks previously deemed \"unsolvable\" (e.g., reported success rates below 5%).\nWe provide both empirical results and theoretical analysis of how this\ncombination can unleash LLM reasoning capabilities: i) Empirically, on\ncontrolled NP-hard tasks and complex real-world planning benchmarks, our\napproach achieves up to a 30x improvement in success rates compared to\npreviously reported results without any external mechanisms; ii) Theoretically,\nwe show that in-context search prompting, when combined with internal scaling,\nsignificantly extends the complexity class of solvable reasoning problems.\nThese findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the limitations of LLMs\non complex tasks, indicating that current evaluation paradigms systematically\nunderestimate their true potential. Our work calls for a critical reassessment\nof how LLM reasoning is benchmarked and a more robust evaluation strategy that\nfully captures the true capabilities of contemporary LLMs, which can lead to a\nbetter understanding of their operational reasoning boundaries in real-world\ndeployments.",

Latent space models are crucial in analyzing network data\nfor tasks like community detection and link prediction due to their\ninterpretability and visualization capabilities. However, when the network size\nis relatively small, and the true latent space dimension is considerable, the\nparameters in latent space models may not be estimated very well. To address\nthis issue, we propose a Network Model Averaging (NetMA) method tailored for\nlatent space models with varying dimensions, specifically focusing on link\nprediction in networks. For both single-layer and multi-layer networks, we\nfirst establish the asymptotic optimality of the proposed averaging prediction\nin the sense of achieving the lowest possible prediction loss. Then we show\nthat when the candidate models contain some correct models, our method assigns\nall weights to the correct models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the consistency\nof the NetMA-based weight estimator tending to the optimal weight vector.\nExtensive simulation studies show that NetMA performs better than simple\naveraging and model selection methods, and even outperforms the \"oracle\" method\nwhen the real latent space dimension is relatively large. Evaluation on\ncollaboration and virtual event networks further emphasizes the competitiveness\nof NetMA in link prediction performance.",

    "abstract": "We introduce ACE-Step, a novel open-source foundation model for music\ngeneration that overcomes key limitations of existing approaches and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance through a holistic architectural design. Current\nmethods face inherent trade-offs between generation speed, musical coherence,\nand controllability. For example, LLM-based models (e.g. Yue, SongGen) excel at\nlyric alignment but suffer from slow inference and structural artifacts.\nDiffusion models (e.g. DiffRhythm), on the other hand, enable faster synthesis\nbut often lack long-range structural coherence. ACE-Step bridges this gap by\nintegrating diffusion-based generation with Sana's Deep Compression AutoEncoder\n(DCAE) and a lightweight linear transformer. It also leverages MERT and\nm-hubert to align semantic representations (REPA) during training, allowing\nrapid convergence. As a result, our model synthesizes up to 4 minutes of music\nin just 20 seconds on an A100 GPU-15x faster than LLM-based baselines-while\nachieving superior musical coherence and lyric alignment across melody,\nharmony, and rhythm metrics. Moreover, ACE-Step preserves fine-grained acoustic\ndetails, enabling advanced control mechanisms such as voice cloning, lyric\nediting, remixing, and track generation (e.g. lyric2vocal,\nsinging2accompaniment). Rather than building yet another end-to-end\ntext-to-music pipeline, our vision is to establish a foundation model for music\nAI: a fast, general-purpose, efficient yet flexible architecture that makes it\neasy to train subtasks on top of it. This paves the way for the development of\npowerful tools that seamlessly integrate into the creative workflows of music\nartists, producers, and content creators. In short, our goal is to build a\nstable diffusion moment for music. The code, the model weights and the demo are\navailable at: https://ace-step.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as a key enabling platform for\nlow-altitude economy, due to its advantages such as 3D maneuverability,\nflexible deployment, and LoS air-to-air/ground communication links. In\nparticular, the intrinsic high mobility renders UAV especially suitable for\noperating as a movable antenna (MA) from the sky. In this paper, by exploiting\nthe flexible mobility of UAV swarm and antenna position adjustment of MA, we\npropose a novel UAV swarm enabled two-level MA system, where UAVs not only\nindividually deploy a local MA array, but also form a larger-scale MA system\nwith their individual MA arrays via swarm coordination. We formulate a general\noptimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate over all ground\nUEs, by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV swarm placement positions, their\nindividual MAs' positions, and receive beamforming for different UEs. We first\nconsider the special case where each UAV has only one antenna, under different\nscenarios of one single UE, two UEs, and arbitrary number of UEs. In\nparticular, for the two-UE case, we derive the optimal UAV swarm placement\npositions in closed-form that achieves IUI-free communication, where the UAV\nswarm forms a uniform sparse array (USA) satisfying collision avoidance\nconstraint. While for the general case with arbitrary number of UEs, we propose\nan efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated\nnon-convex optimization problem. Then, we extend the results to the case where\neach UAV is equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results verify that the\nproposed low-altitude UAV swarm enabled MA system significantly outperforms\nvarious benchmark schemes, thanks to the exploitation of two-level mobility to\ncreate more favorable channel conditions for multi-UE communications.",

The number of bright SMGs with such high SFRs is hard to reconcile\nwith the standard models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper we\nprovide evidence that, in a small sample of 12 bright SMGs, the SFRs derived\nfrom spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting are significantly higher than\nthose obtained using low-frequency radio emission as a proxy for star\nformation. Using the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT), which allows imaging\nat 144 MHz with sub-arcsecond angular resolution, we have produced deep images\nof a small sample of bright SMGs in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field\nextracted from the NEPSC2 survey. For all 12 SMGs, we find radio-emitting\nmid-infrared galaxies at distances from a few arcseconds down to sub-arcsecond\nscales from the SMG and/or the presence of a radio-emitting AGN. The SFRs\nderived from the radio emission of the SMG, disentangled from the AGN-related\nradio emission, are systematically lower by a factor of $\\sim 5$ (median value)\nthan those derived from the multi-band SED fitting. We discuss whether our\nassumptions might be, at least in part, responsible for the observed\ndiscrepancy. We argue that the radio-derived SFRs are not systematically\nunderestimated but can be affected by a significant dispersion ($0.3-0.5$ dex).\nConsidering these new SFR estimates, the offset of the specific SFR of the 12\nbright SMGs from the star-forming galaxy main sequence\n($\\Delta\\mathrm{(SSFR)}$) is significantly reduced, with all 12 bright SMGs\nwhich are only a factor of 2 more star-forming than the main sequence galaxies.",

    "abstract": "As a fundamental imaging task, All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) aims to\nachieve image restoration caused by multiple degradation patterns via a single\nmodel with unified parameters. Although existing AiOIR approaches obtain\npromising performance in closed and controlled scenarios, they still suffered\nfrom considerable performance reduction in real-world scenarios since the gap\nof data distributions between the training samples (source domain) and\nreal-world test samples (target domain) can lead inferior degradation awareness\nability. To address this issue, a Unified Domain-Adaptive Image Restoration\n(UDAIR) framework is proposed to effectively achieve AiOIR by leveraging the\nlearned knowledge from source domain to target domain. To improve the\ndegradation identification, a codebook is designed to learn a group of discrete\nembeddings to denote the degradation patterns, and the cross-sample contrastive\nlearning mechanism is further proposed to capture shared features from\ndifferent samples of certain degradation. To bridge the data gap, a domain\nadaptation strategy is proposed to build the feature projection between the\nsource and target domains by dynamically aligning their codebook embeddings,\nand a correlation alignment-based test-time adaptation mechanism is designed to\nfine-tune the alignment discrepancies by tightening the degradation embeddings\nto the corresponding cluster center in the source domain. Experimental results\non 10 open-source datasets demonstrate that UDAIR achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance for the AiOIR task.

    "abstract": "Sediment transport is crucial in the hydro-morphodynamic evolution of free\nsurface flows in shallow water environments, which is typically modeled under\nthe shallow water assumption. In classical shallow water modeling for sediment\ntransport, the vertical structure of the flow is collapsed into a\ndepth-averaged and near-bed velocity, usually reconstructed empirically, e.g.,\nusing a parameterized logarithmic profile. In practice, large variations from\nsuch empirical profiles can occur. It is therefore essential to resolve the\nvertical structure of the velocity profile within the shallow water framework\nto better approximate near-bed velocity. This study introduces a model and\nsimulations that incorporate vertical velocity variations and bottom\nerosion-deposition effects in sediment transport, providing a computationally\nefficient framework for predicting sediment dynamics in shallow water\nenvironments. We employ the so-called moment model approach for the velocity\nvariation, which considers a polynomial expansion of the horizontal velocity in\nthe scaled vertical direction. This allows the use of a complex velocity\nprofile with an extended set of variables determined by the polynomial basis\ncoefficients, resolving the vertical structure as part of the solution. The\nextended model comprises four components: (1) the standard shallow water\nequations; (2) moment equations governing evolution of the basis coefficients;\n(3) an evolution equation for sediment concentration; and (4) a transport\nequation for the bed. This enables a coupled model for bedload and suspended\nload transport. We use a hyperbolic regularization technique to ensure model\nstability and realistic eigenvalues. Several numerical tests, including\ndam-break cases with and without wet/dry fronts, validate our results against\nlaboratory data.",

For instance, rephrasing-based defenses are effective against text\nadversarial jailbreaks but fail to counteract image-based attacks. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose a universal defense framework, termed Test-time\nIMmunization (TIM), which can adaptively defend against various jailbreak\nattacks in a self-evolving way.

Driven by advances in\ndeep learning, current audio steganography schemes are mainly based on\nencoding-decoding network architectures. While these methods greatly improve\nthe security of audio steganography, they typically require complex training\nand large pre-trained models. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper\npioneers a Fixed Decoder Network-Based Audio Steganography with Adversarial\nPerturbation Generation (FGAS). Adversarial perturbations carrying secret\nmessage are embedded into the cover audio to generate stego audio. The receiver\nonly needs to share the structure and weights of the fixed decoder network to\naccurately extract the secret message from the stego audio, this eliminates the\nreliance on large pre-trained models. In FGAS, we propose an audio Adversarial\nPerturbation Generation (APG) strategy and design a lightweight fixed decoder.\nThe fixed decoder guarantees reliable extraction of the hidden message, while\nthe adversarial perturbations are optimized to keep the stego audio\nperceptually and statistically close to the cover audio, thereby improving\nresistance to steganalysis. The experimental results show that FGAS\nsignificantly improves the quality of stego audio, achieving an average PSNR\ngain of over 10 dB compared to SOTA methods.

Both magnons and their associated\nmagnon-phonon excitations can act as sources of spin pumping from magnetic\nmaterials into non-magnetic metals. Although a considerable body of research\nhas focused on spin pumping via elastic waves in ferromagnets, similar\ninvestigations involving antiferromagnets have yet to be undertaken. In this\nwork, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of\ngenerating spin currents at ultrasonic frequencies of acoustic resonance in\nantiferromagnetic crystal hematite $\\alpha-\\text{Fe}_2\\text{O}_3$ at room\ntemperature. We provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that, due to\nstrong magnetoelastic coupling, acoustic vibrations in hematite induce\nsignificant variable deviations in magnetization, resulting in spin\naccumulation at the antiferromagnet-normal metal interface, which in turn leads\nto the generation of spin and charge currents in the metal. Charge currents\narising from the inverse spin Hall effect can be measured using the same\nmethodology employed under high-frequency spin pumping conditions at the\nresonances of the magnetic subsystem itself. Moreover, the acoustic resonance\nin hematite is significantly more pronounced (by hundreds or even thousands of\ntimes) than in other quasiferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic systems, enabling\nthe attainment of extremely large amplitudes of magnetic oscillations for spin\npumping. This research highlights the new approach of utilizing acoustic spin\npumping to manipulate spin currents in magnetic materials, particularly\nantiferromagnets.",

However, existing\nZSAD research has shown limitations by either not considering domain adaptation\nof general-purpose backbone models to anomaly detection domains or by\nimplementing only partial adaptation to some model components. In this paper,\nwe propose HeadCLIP to overcome these limitations by effectively adapting both\ntext and image encoders to the domain. HeadCLIP generalizes the concepts of\nnormality and abnormality through learnable prompts in the text encoder, and\nintroduces learnable head weights to the image encoder to dynamically adjust\nthe features held by each attention head according to domain characteristics.\nAdditionally, we maximize the effect of domain adaptation by introducing a\njoint anomaly score that utilizes domain-adapted pixel-level information for\nimage-level anomaly detection. Experimental results using multiple real\ndatasets in both industrial and medical domains show that HeadCLIP outperforms\nexisting ZSAD techniques at both pixel and image levels. In the industrial\ndomain, improvements of up to 4.9%p in pixel-level mean anomaly detection score\n(mAD) and up to 3.0%p in image-level mAD were achieved, with similar\nimprovements (3.2%p, 3.1%p) in the medical domain.",

To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a\npromising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with\nsignificantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However,\nwhile DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets\nremains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the\npresence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across\ndifferent classes. Existing DD approaches assume a uniform level of temporal\nredundancy across all different video semantics, which limits their\neffectiveness on video datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic-Aware Video\nDistillation (DAViD), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict the\noptimal Temporal Resolution of the synthetic videos. A teacher-in-the-loop\nreward function is proposed to update the RL agent policy. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to introduce adaptive temporal resolution\nbased on video semantics in video dataset distillation. Our approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing DD methods, demonstrating substantial\nimprovements in performance.

    "abstract": "Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can improve\nperformance of speech tasks compared to existing systems. To support their\nclaims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this\nwork finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice\nevaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into\nquestion the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure\ncontamination impact, LLMs trained with/without contamination are compared. A\ncontaminated LLM is more likely to generate test sentences it has seen during\ntraining. Then, speech recognisers based on LLMs are compared. They show only\nsubtle error rate differences if the LLM is contaminated, but assign\nsignificantly higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during LLM training.\nResults show that LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data\ncontamination, highlighting the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech\nsystems with held-out data.",

However, their reliance on\nonly a few recent observations leads them to lose track of the long-term\ncontext. Consequently, in just a few steps the generated scenes drift from what\nwas previously observed, undermining the temporal coherence of the sequence.\nThis limitation of the state-of-the-art world models, most of which rely on\ndiffusion, comes from their lack of a lasting environment state. To address\nthis problem, we introduce StateSpaceDiffuser, where a diffusion model is\nenabled to perform long-context tasks by integrating features from a\nstate-space model, representing the entire interaction history. This design\nrestores long-term memory while preserving the high-fidelity synthesis of\ndiffusion models. To rigorously measure temporal consistency, we develop an\nevaluation protocol that probes a model's ability to reinstantiate seen content\nin extended rollouts. Comprehensive experiments show that StateSpaceDiffuser\nsignificantly outperforms a strong diffusion-only baseline, maintaining a\ncoherent visual context for an order of magnitude more steps. It delivers\nconsistent views in both a 2D maze navigation and a complex 3D environment.\nThese results establish that bringing state-space representations into\ndiffusion models is highly effective in demonstrating both visual details and\nlong-term memory.",

We consider the BOSP problem in the presence of correlated\nobjectives. Such correlations often occur in real-world settings such as road\nnetworks, where optimizing two positively correlated objectives, such as travel\ntime and fuel consumption, is common. BOSP is generally computationally\nchallenging as the size of the search space is exponential in the number of\nobjective functions and the graph size. Bounded sub-optimal BOSP solvers such\nas A*pex alleviate this complexity by approximating the Pareto-optimal solution\nset rather than computing it exactly (given a user-provided approximation\nfactor). As the correlation between objective functions increases, smaller\napproximation factors are sufficient for collapsing the entire Pareto-optimal\nset into a single solution. We leverage this insight to propose an efficient\nalgorithm that reduces the search effort in the presence of correlated\nobjectives. Our approach for computing approximations of the entire\nPareto-optimal set is inspired by graph-clustering algorithms. It uses a\npreprocessing phase to identify correlated clusters within a graph and to\ngenerate a new graph representation. This allows a natural generalization of\nA*pex to run up to five times faster on DIMACS dataset instances, a standard\nbenchmark in the field.

    "abstract": "In this work, we develop a novel formalism to include the effect of electron\ndensity fluctuations at ultra small scales (well below the sound horizon at\nlast scattering) on the observed anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB). We treat the electron field as an independent stochastic\nvariable and obtain the required ensemble-averaged photon Boltzmann equations\nusing Ito calculus. Beyond changes to the average recombination history (which\ncan be incorporated in the standard approach) our work identifies two new\neffects caused by the clumpiness of the medium. The first is a correction to\nthe Thomson visibility function caused by correlations of the electron\nfluctuations along the line of sight, leading to an additional broadening of\nthe visibility towards higher redshifts which causes extra damping and smearing\nof the CMB anisotropies. The second effect is a reduction of the effective\nscattering rate in the (pre-)recombination era that affects the photon transfer\nfunctions in a non-trivial manner. These new effects are subdominant in LCDM\nbut can be significant in cosmologies with an early onset of structure\nformation (e.g., due to generation of enhanced small-scale power) as suggested\nby a number of indicators (e.g., the abundance of high redshift galaxies\nobserved by JWST). We discuss the relevance of these new effects to the Hubble\ntension, finding that corrections which cannot be captured by simple\nmodifications to the average recombination history arise.

Yambda-5B contains 4.79 billion user-item\ninteractions from 1 million users across 9.39 million tracks. The dataset\nincludes two primary types of interactions: implicit feedback (listening\nevents) and explicit feedback (likes, dislikes, unlikes and undislikes). In\naddition, we provide audio embeddings for most tracks, generated by a\nconvolutional neural network trained on audio spectrograms. A key\ndistinguishing feature of Yambda-5B is the inclusion of the is_organic flag,\nwhich separates organic user actions from recommendation-driven events. This\ndistinction is critical for developing and evaluating machine learning\nalgorithms, as Yandex Music relies on recommender systems to personalize track\nselection for users. To support rigorous benchmarking, we introduce an\nevaluation protocol based on a Global Temporal Split, allowing recommendation\nalgorithms to be assessed in conditions that closely mirror real-world use. We\nreport benchmark results for standard baselines (ItemKNN, iALS) and advanced\nmodels (SANSA, SASRec) using a variety of evaluation metrics. By releasing\nYambda-5B to the community, we aim to provide a readily accessible,\nindustrial-scale resource to advance research, foster innovation, and promote\nreproducible results in recommender systems.",

This paper presents the development and simulated evaluation of a\nnovel Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)-based frequency-specific speech test\ndesigned to provide granular diagnostic insights. Our approach leverages ASR to\nsimulate the perceptual effects of moderate sloping hearing loss by processing\nspeech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation and subsequently analyzing\nphoneme-level confusion patterns. Key findings indicate that simulated hearing\nloss introduces specific phoneme confusions, predominantly affecting\nhigh-frequency consonants (e.g., alveolar/palatal to labiodental substitutions)\nand leading to significant phoneme deletions, consistent with the acoustic cues\ndegraded in presbycusis. A test battery curated from these ASR-derived\nconfusions demonstrated diagnostic value, effectively differentiating between\nsimulated normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in a comprehensive\nsimulation. This ASR-driven methodology offers a promising avenue for\ndeveloping objective, granular, and frequency-specific hearing assessment tools\nthat complement traditional audiometry.

Despite progress in VTS,\nexisting methods still fall short of the performance seen in ITS. This paper\nidentifies a key limitation in current video text spotters: limited recognition\ncapability, even after extensive end-to-end training. To address this, we\npropose GoMatching++, a parameter- and data-efficient method that transforms an\noff-the-shelf image text spotter into a video specialist. The core idea lies in\nfreezing the image text spotter and introducing a lightweight, trainable\ntracker, which can be optimized efficiently with minimal training data. Our\napproach includes two key components: (1) a rescoring mechanism to bridge the\ndomain gap between image and video data, and (2) the LST-Matcher, which\nenhances the frozen image text spotter's ability to handle video text. We\nexplore various architectures for LST-Matcher to ensure efficiency in both\nparameters and training data. As a result, GoMatching++ sets new performance\nrecords on challenging benchmarks such as ICDAR15-video, DSText, and BOVText,\nwhile significantly reducing training costs.

However, in many real-world scenarios, the parameters of\nthe optimization problem are not known a priori and must be predicted from\ncontextual features. This gives rise to predict-then-optimize problems, where a\nmachine learning model predicts problem parameters that are then used to make\ndecisions via optimization. A growing body of work on decision-focused learning\n(DFL) addresses this setting by training models specifically to produce\npredictions that maximize downstream decision quality, rather than accuracy.\nWhile effective, DFL is computationally expensive, because it requires solving\nthe optimization problem with the predicted parameters at each loss evaluation.\nIn this work, we address this computational bottleneck for linear optimization\nproblems, a common class of problems in both DFL literature and real-world\napplications. We propose a solver-free training method that exploits the\ngeometric structure of linear optimization to enable efficient training with\nminimal degradation in solution quality. Our method is based on the insight\nthat a solution is optimal if and only if it achieves an objective value that\nis at least as good as that of its adjacent vertices on the feasible polytope.\nBuilding on this, our method compares the estimated quality of the ground-truth\noptimal solution with that of its precomputed adjacent vertices, and uses this\nas loss function.

This review meticulously\ntraces the three-decade evolution of Bayesian learning in structural dynamics,\nilluminating core principles, groundbreaking methodologies, and diverse\napplications that have significantly influenced the field. The narrative\ncommences by delving into the basics of Bayesian theory, clarifying essential\nconcepts, and introducing primary methods for deriving posterior distributions,\nwith an in-depth exploration of three types: Laplace approximation, stochastic\nsampling, and variational inference. Subsequently, the text explores the\nimplementation of two types of Bayesian learning in structural dynamics:\nphysical model learning and data-centric statistical model learning. Physical\nmodel learning emphasizes inferring physical model parameters within a Bayesian\nframework for system identification and prediction, while statistical model\nlearning integrates Bayesian learning methodologies into data-centric\nstatistical modeling within probabilistic machine learning. Both types resonate\nacross various applications, such as modal analysis, model updating, damage\ndetection, and reliability updating, highlighting their pivotal role in\nenhancing comprehension of dynamical systems and decision-making. The paper\nalso navigates obstacles by proposing ways to enhance existing Bayesian\ninference strategies. Distinguished from previous research, this study offers a\nthorough examination of both traditional and cutting-edge Bayesian methods. It\nnot only underscores the transformative influence of Bayesian approaches but\nalso serves as a beacon, guiding researchers in the judicious selection and\nrefinement of suitable methods for various challenges in structural dynamics.",

The latter is commonly modelled in a\nprobabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\\tau) as a\nuniversal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies.\nWe test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against\npredictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in\nhost galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences\nbetween predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies,\nprimarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated\nreddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia\nsupernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host\ngalaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with\nvanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the\ndifference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the\ndistribution may peak at E(B-V)>0 when considering a population of young type\nIa supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We\ndemonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling\npeak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives\nrise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also\nbias relative distances between supernovae originating from different\nhost-galaxy populations.

    "abstract": "Bounded continuous responses -- such as proportions -- arise frequently in\ndiverse scientific fields including climatology, biostatistics, and finance.\nBeta regression is a widely adopted framework for modeling such data, due to\nthe flexibility of the Beta distribution over the unit interval. While Bayesian\nextensions of Beta regression have shown promise, existing methods are limited\nto low-dimensional settings and lack theoretical guarantees. In this work, we\npropose a novel Bayesian approach for high-dimensional sparse Beta regression\nframework that employs a tempered posterior. Our method incorporates the\nHorseshoe prior for effective shrinkage and variable selection. Most notable,\nwe propose a novel Gibbs sampling algorithm using P\\'olya-Gamma augmentation\nfor efficient inference in Beta regression model. We also provide the first\ntheoretical results establishing posterior consistency and convergence rates\nfor Bayesian Beta regression. Through extensive simulation studies in both low-\nand high-dimensional scenarios, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nexisting alternatives, offering improved estimation accuracy and model\ninterpretability.\n  Our method is implemented in the R package ``betaregbayes\" available on\nGithub.",

Further, the\ncoexistence of the out-of-plane polarization with in-plane conductivity induced\nby electrostatic charge doping makes these systems strong candidates for\nrealizing ferroelectric metals. Using density functional theory calculations,\nwe analyze the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based Janus sliding\nferroelectric bilayers XMY (M = Mo, W; X, Y = S, Se, Te; X $\\neq$ Y). In\naddition to exhibiting switchable interlayer polarization, Janus sliding\nferroelectrics possess an intrinsic electric field within each monolayer,\narising from the electronegativity difference between the chalcogen atoms. We\ndiscover that the intrinsic electric field of the monolayers can be used to\nmodulate the interlayer ferroelectric polarization and the electronic band\nstructure. We identify the decrease in the interlayer distance due to a\nparticular stacking of the Janus bilayers as a major contributor to increasing\npolarization and reducing the bandgap. The direction of the intrinsic electric\nfield within the Janus monolayers plays a significant role in the modulation of\nlayer-wise contribution in the valence and conduction bands, which influences\nthe polarization reduction due to extrinsic charge dopants. Extending this\nconcept to Janus trilayers, we observe further enhancement in polarization and\nadditional bandgap reduction compared to their bilayer counterparts.

For 2573 EHS, we computed their L*, R*, and M*, with no\nprior assumption from stellar evolution models. Their Galactic positions,\nkinematic and orbital properties were derived. We re-scaled Mp and Rp of 3556\nexoplanets, fully consistently with the stellar data. These new stellar Teff,\nL*, and R* are in rather good agreement with literature values but are more\nprecise. In particular, R* are derived with typically less than 3% uncertainty;\nthis reduces the uncertainty on Rp significantly and allows for a finer\nanalysis of the decrease in the number of planets around the evaporation\nvalley. Larger differences, however, were found for M*. We note that the EHS\npopulation is rather diverse in terms of the chemical and Galactic properties,\nalthough they are all found in the Solar vicinity, close to the Local spiral\narm. Most EHS belong to the thin disc, but some older thick disc and halo\nmembers have also been identified. For the less massive planets, the average Rp\nincreases with the metallicity of the host star. For giant planets, a dichotomy\nbetween dense and inflated planets is found. Denser planets tend to be more\nmassive as the metallicity of the host star increases, while inflated planets\nare more massive for less metallic hosts. If confirmed, this bimodality implies\nthat the diversity of giant exoplanets depends on their Galactic birth locus,\nwith dense giant planets being more numerous than inflated ones when [M/H]>~1.5\ntimes Solar, as in the central Milky Way regions. The Gaia spectroscopic\ncatalogue of exoplanets and their host stars is large, homogeneous, and\nprecise. It would be a useful added-value for planetary studies.",

In this work, we take mathematical reasoning as a case study and\nconduct a comprehensive analysis of various verifiers in both static evaluation\nand RL training scenarios. First, we find that current open-source rule-based\nverifiers often fail to recognize equivalent answers presented in different\nformats across multiple commonly used mathematical datasets, resulting in\nnon-negligible false negative rates. This limitation adversely affects RL\ntraining performance and becomes more pronounced as the policy model gets\nstronger. Subsequently, we investigate model-based verifiers as a potential\nsolution to address these limitations. While the static evaluation shows that\nmodel-based verifiers achieve significantly higher verification accuracy,\nfurther analysis and RL training results imply that they are highly susceptible\nto hacking, where they misclassify certain patterns in responses as correct\n(i.e., false positives).

Here, we develop a homogenization-based macroscopic boundary\ncondition which describes the effective flow across a diffusiophoretic\nmicrostructured membrane, where the interaction between the membrane walls and\nthe solute particles is modeled via a potential-approach. We consider two cases\nwhere potential variations occur (i) at the pore scale and (ii) only in the\nclose vicinity of the boundary, enabling a simplified version of the\nmacroscopic flow description, in the latter case. Chemical interactions at the\nmicroscale are rigorously upscaled to macroscopic phoretic solvent velocity and\nsolute flux contributions, and added to the classical permeability and\ndiffusivity properties of the membrane. These properties stem from the solution\nof Stokes-advection-diffusion problems at the microscale, some of them forced\nby an interaction potential term. Eventually, we show an application of the\nmacroscopic model to develop minimal phoretic pumps, showcasing its suitability\nfor efficient design and optimization procedures.",

Although the\nasymptotic behavior, antisymmetrization issues and the treatment of the Coulomb\ninteraction were discussed in detail, the convergence properties of the\nadiabatic basis were studied at low energies around the formation of the\ncorrelation peak determined mainly by the $J^\\pi=1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ three-body\nstates.

The training of the BHM\nis carried out with an independent data set from which the data at the station\nto be predicted are excluded. We evaluate the spatial prediction performance at\nthe withheld station using Brier score and quantile score, including their\ndecomposition, and compare the performance of our BHM to climatological\nforecasts and a non-hierarchical, spatially constant baseline model. This is\ndone for 109 weather stations in Germany. Compared to the spatially constant\nbaseline model, the spatial BHM significantly improves the estimation of local\ngust parameters. It shows up to 5 % higher skill for prediction quantiles and\nprovides a particularly improved skill for extreme wind gusts. In addition, the\nBHM improves the prediction of threshold levels at most of the stations.\nAlthough a spatially constant approach already provides high skill, our BHM\nfurther improves predictions and improves spatial consistency.",

Modern saturation provers use the\nKnuth-Bendix order (KBO) and the lexicographic path order (LPO) for discovering\nredundant clauses and inferences. Implementing term orderings is however\nchallenging. While KBO comparisons can be performed in linear time and LPO\nchecks in quadratic time, using the best known algorithms for these orders is\nnot enough. Indeed, our experiments show that for some examples term ordering\nchecks may use about 98% of the overall proving time. The reason for this is\nthat some equalities that cannot be ordered can become ordered after applying a\nsubstitution (post-ordered), and we have to check for post-ordering repeatedly\nfor the same equalities. In this paper, we show how to improve post-ordering\nchecks by introducing a new data structure called term ordering diagrams, in\nshort TODs, which creates an index for these checks. We achieve efficiency by\nlazy modifications of the index and by storing and reusing information from\npreviously performed checks to speed up subsequent checks.

To illustrate the results, we provide a nice application\nwith optimisation over the unit sphere in a Euclidean space.\n  As for tools needed for the results, in the Riemannian manifold case we\nintroduce a notion of \"strong local retraction\" and (to deal with Newton's\nmethod type) a notion of \"real analytic-like strong local retraction\".

It is known that without any assumptions about the values being\nseverely restricted or coming from a distribution, very strong impossibility\nresults hold in this setting. To bypass the latter, we turn our attention to\ninstances where the valuation functions are restricted. In particular, we study\npersonalized $2$-value instances, where there are only two possible values each\nagent may have for each good, possibly different across agents, and we show how\nto obtain worst case guarantees with respect to well-known fairness notions,\nsuch as maximin share fairness and envy-freeness up to one (or two) good(s).

    "abstract": "Diffusion transformers (DiT) have demonstrated exceptional performance in\nvideo generation. However, their large number of parameters and high\ncomputational complexity limit their deployment on edge devices. Quantization\ncan reduce storage requirements and accelerate inference by lowering the\nbit-width of model parameters. Yet, existing quantization methods for image\ngeneration models do not generalize well to video generation tasks. We identify\ntwo primary challenges: the loss of information during quantization and the\nmisalignment between optimization objectives and the unique requirements of\nvideo generation. To address these challenges, we present Q-VDiT, a\nquantization framework specifically designed for video DiT models. From the\nquantization perspective, we propose the Token-aware Quantization Estimator\n(TQE), which compensates for quantization errors in both the token and feature\ndimensions. From the optimization perspective, we introduce Temporal\nMaintenance Distillation (TMD), which preserves the spatiotemporal correlations\nbetween frames and enables the optimization of each frame with respect to the\noverall video context. Our W3A6 Q-VDiT achieves a scene consistency of 23.40,\nsetting a new benchmark and outperforming current state-of-the-art quantization\nmethods by 1.9$\\times$.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation,\nwith recent works falling into two main categories: discrete and continuous\ndiffusion models. Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption\nindependently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion\nprogress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion\nmodels map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the\ndiffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture\nsemantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose\n\\textbf{\\underline{N}}on-simultan\\textbf{\\underline{e}}ous\nC\\textbf{\\underline{o}}ntinuous \\textbf{\\underline{Diff}}usion Models\n(NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both\ndiscrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion\nprocess for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising\nparadigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively\nmodulate the denoising progress based on token semantics. Furthermore, NeoDiff\nutilizes an optimized schedule for inference to ensure more precise noise\ncontrol and improved performance. Our approach unifies the theories of discrete\nand continuous diffusion models, offering a more principled and effective\nframework for text generation. Experimental results on several text generation\ntasks demonstrate NeoDiff's superior performance compared to baselines of\nnon-autoregressive continuous and discrete diffusion models, iterative-based\nmethods and autoregressive diffusion-based methods.

    "abstract": "The spontaneous decay of an excited atom by photon emission is one of the\nmost common and elementary physical process present in nature and in\nlaboratories. The decay is random in time with constant probability density, as\nit can be inferred by the exponential law observed experimentally. Despite the\nsimplicity of the process, in Quantum Mechanics the decay itself is considered\na law of nature which is not further analyzed or explained. However it is\nlegitimate to ask for the reason of its randomness and for the dynamics of the\natom around the decay. The decay process of an isolated atom is usually assumed\nto be instantaneous, the so called Quantum jumps. Particular experimental\narrangements can widen the duration of the transition from an excited state to\nthe ground state to a finite time. In general this is due to the quantum back\naction of the detector. The development of Quantum Optics has enormously\nenriched the possibilities to study in detail the process, and new illuminating\ninsights have been obtained, but the question is still valid and its answer is\nstill elusive. In this paper we analyze the spontaneous decay within the new\nprospect introduced by a recent model that complete standard Quantum Mechanics\nin a formalism which is able to describe the dynamics of measurement and of\nspontaneous decay. Comparison is made with more phenomenological theories, the\nQuantum Mechanics of open system and the Stochastic wave function model. In the\nnew model the stochastic photon emission by an excited atom is triggered by the\nvacuum fluctuations. It is suggested how to re-analyze three types of\nexperiments, already realized in many laboratories, in order to reveal the\npresence and the effect of these fluctuations.",

This creates an asymmetry that can be easily exploited by external\nadversaries to launch a clogging Denial of Service (DoS) attack: each forged VC\nmessage forces all neighboring nodes to cryptographically validate it; at\nincreasing rates, easy to generate forged messages gradually exhaust processing\nresources and severely degrade or deny timely validation of benign CAMs/DENMs.\nThe result can be catastrophic when awareness of neighbor vehicle positions or\ncritical reports are missed. We address this problem making the standardized VC\npseudonymous authentication DoS-resilient. We propose efficient cryptographic\nconstructs, which we term message verification facilitators, to prioritize\nprocessing resources for verification of potentially valid messages among bogus\nmessages and verify multiple messages based on one signature verification. Any\nmessage acceptance is strictly based on public-key based message\nauthentication/verification for accountability, i.e., non-repudiation is not\nsacrificed, unlike symmetric key based approaches. This further enables drastic\nmisbehavior detection, also exploiting the newly introduced facilitators, based\non probabilistic signature verification and cross-checking over multiple\nfacilitators verifying the same message; while maintaining verification latency\nlow even when under attack, trading off modest communication overhead.

    "abstract": "In online video platforms, accurate watch time prediction has become a\nfundamental and challenging problem in video recommendation. Previous research\nhas revealed that the accuracy of watch time prediction highly depends on both\nthe transformation of watch-time labels and the decomposition of the estimation\nprocess. TPM (Tree based Progressive Regression Model) achieves\nState-of-the-Art performance with a carefully designed and effective\ndecomposition paradigm. TPM discretizes the watch time into several ordinal\nintervals and organizes them into a binary decision tree, where each node\ncorresponds to a specific interval. At each non-leaf node, a binary classifier\nis used to determine the specific interval in which the watch time variable\nmost likely falls, based on the prediction outcome at its parent node.\n  The tree structure is central to TPM, as it defines the decomposition of\nwatch time estimation and how ordinal intervals are discretized. However, TPM\nuses a predefined full binary tree, which may be sub-optimal for two reasons.\nFirst, full binary trees imply equal partitioning of the watch time space,\nwhich may fail to capture the complexity of real-world distributions. Second,\nrather than relying on a fixed global structure, we advocate for a\npersonalized, data-driven tree that can be learned end-to-end. Thus, we propose\nPTPM to enable highly personalized decomposition of watch estimation with\nbetter efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, we show that TPM suffers from\nselection bias due to conditional modeling and propose a simple solution. We\nconduct extensive experiments on offline datasets and online environments.\nOffline results show improved watch time accuracy, and online A/B tests further\nvalidate the effectiveness of our framework. PTPM has been fully deployed in\ncore traffic scenarios and now serves over 400 million users daily.",

We address\nthis by analyzing message passing neural networks from an information-theoretic\nperspective and developing a suitable analog to data processing inequality to\nquantify information throughout the model's layers. In contrast to non-graph\ndomains, information about the node-level prediction target can increase with\nmodel depth if a node's features are semantically different from its neighbors.\nTherefore, on heterophilic graphs, the latent embeddings of an MPNN each\nprovide different information about the data distribution - different from\nhomophilic settings. This reveals that considering all node representations\nsimultaneously is a key design principle for epistemic uncertainty estimation\non graphs beyond homophily. We empirically confirm this with a simple post-hoc\ndensity estimator on the joint node embedding space that provides\nstate-of-the-art uncertainty on heterophilic graphs. At the same time, it\nmatches prior work on homophilic graphs without explicitly exploiting homophily\nthrough post-processing.",

To achieve this, we first develop a mathematic framework that\ndefines abstract reasoning as the ability to: (i) extract essential patterns\nindependent of surface representations, and (ii) apply consistent rules to\nthese abstract patterns. Based on this framework, we introduce two novel\ncomplementary metrics: \\(\\scoreGamma\\) measures basic reasoning accuracy, while\n\\(\\scoreDelta\\) quantifies a model's reliance on specific symbols rather than\nunderlying patterns - a key indicator of true abstraction versus mere\nmemorization. To implement this measurement, we design a benchmark: systematic\nsymbol remapping in rule-based tasks, which forces models to demonstrate\ngenuine pattern recognition beyond superficial token matching. Extensive LLM\nevaluations using this benchmark (commercial API models, 7B-70B, multi-agent)\nreveal:1) critical limitations in non-decimal arithmetic and symbolic\nreasoning; 2) persistent abstraction gaps despite chain-of-thought prompting;\nand 3) \\(\\scoreDelta\\)'s effectiveness in robustly measuring memory dependence\nby quantifying performance degradation under symbol remapping, particularly\nhighlighting operand-specific memorization. These findings underscore that\ncurrent LLMs, despite domain-specific strengths, still lack robust abstract\nreasoning, highlighting key areas for future improvement.",

Stellar counterparts to\nradio sources are selected by cross-matching the MeerKAT source positions with\n\\textit{Gaia} DR3, using two approaches. The first approach evaluated the\nprobability of chance alignments between the radio survey and \\textit{Gaia}\nsources and used AllWISE infrared colour-colour information to select potential\nstellar candidates. The second approach utilized a Monte Carlo method to\nevaluate the cross-matching reliability probability, based on populations of\nknown radio-emitting stars. From the combined approaches, we found 629\npotential stellar counterparts, of which 169 have existing SIMBAD\nclassifications, making it the largest Galactic plane radio-optical crossmatch\nsample to date. A colour-magnitude analysis of the sample revealed a diverse\npopulation of stellar objects, ranging from massive OB stars, main-sequence\nstars, giants, young stellar objects, emission line stars, red dwarfs and white\ndwarfs. Some of the proposed optical counterparts include\nchromospherically/coronally active stars, for example RS CVn binaries, BY Dra\nsystems, YSOs and flare stars, which typically exhibit radio emission. Based on\nGaia's low-resolution spectroscopy, some of the stars show strong H$\\alpha$\nemission, indicating they are magnetically active, consistent with them being\nradio emitters. While MeerKAT's sensitivity and survey speed make it ideal for\ndetecting faint radio sources, its angular resolution limits accurate\ncounterpart identification for crowded fields such as the Galactic Plane.\nHigher frequency, and, thereby, better spatial resolution, radio observations\nplus circular polarization would be required to strengthen the associations.",

In this\npaper, we propose RAD (Redundancy-Aware Distillation), a novel framework that\nuses self-speculative decoding as a diagnostic tool to identify redundant\nattention layers within the model. These identified layers are then selectively\nreplaced with SSM components, followed by targeted (self-)distillation.\nSpecifically, RAD focuses knowledge transfer on the components identified as\nredundant, considering architectural changes and specific weight initialization\nstrategies. We experimentally demonstrate that self-distillation using RAD\nsignificantly surpasses the performance of the original base model on\nmathematical and coding tasks. Furthermore, RAD is also effective in standard\nknowledge distillation settings, achieving up to approximately 2x faster\nconvergence compared to baseline methods. Notably, while a baseline model\ndistilled from a Llama-3.1 70B teacher achieves scores of 46.17 on GSM8K and\n22.75 on CRUX, RAD achieves significantly higher scores of 71.27 on GSM8K and\n28.25 on CRUX, even when using a much smaller Llama-3.1 8B teacher.

In this model, the infection rate, governing the\ntransition from susceptible to infected individuals, is given by a linear\nfunction of both susceptible and infected populations. Similarly, the removal\nrate, representing the transition from infected to removed individuals, is a\nlinear function of the number of infected individuals.

    "abstract": "User-item interaction histories are pivotal for sequential recommendation\nsystems but often include noise, such as unintended clicks or actions that fail\nto reflect genuine user preferences. To address this issue, we propose the\nUser-Consistent Preference-based Sequential Recommendation System (ConsRec),\ndesigned to capture stable user preferences and filter noisy items from\ninteraction histories. Specifically, ConsRec constructs a user-interacted item\ngraph, learns item similarities from their text representations, and then\nextracts the maximum connected subgraph from the user-interacted item graph for\ndenoising items. Experimental results on the Yelp and Amazon Product datasets\nillustrate that ConsRec achieves a 13% improvement over baseline recommendation\nmodels, showing its effectiveness in denoising user-interacted items. Further\nanalysis reveals that the denoised interaction histories form semantically\ntighter clusters of user-preferred items, leading to higher relevance scores\nfor ground-truth targets and more accurate recommendations.

    "abstract": "Recent prosperity of text-to-image diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion,\nhas stimulated research to adapt them to 360-degree panorama generation. Prior\nwork has demonstrated the feasibility of using conventional low-rank adaptation\ntechniques on pre-trained diffusion models to generate panoramic images.\nHowever, the substantial domain gap between perspective and panoramic images\nraises questions about the underlying mechanisms enabling this empirical\nsuccess. We hypothesize and examine that the trainable counterparts exhibit\ndistinct behaviors when fine-tuned on panoramic data, and such an adaptation\nconceals some intrinsic mechanism to leverage the prior knowledge within the\npre-trained diffusion models. Our analysis reveals the following: 1) the query\nand key matrices in the attention modules are responsible for common\ninformation that can be shared between the panoramic and perspective domains,\nthus are less relevant to panorama generation; and 2) the value and output\nweight matrices specialize in adapting pre-trained knowledge to the panoramic\ndomain, playing a more critical role during fine-tuning for panorama\ngeneration. We empirically verify these insights by introducing a simple\nframework called UniPano, with the objective of establishing an elegant\nbaseline for future research. UniPano not only outperforms existing methods but\nalso significantly reduces memory usage and training time compared to prior\ndual-branch approaches, making it scalable for end-to-end panorama generation\nwith higher resolution.

We present a robust\nframework for sentiment simulation using generative AI agents embedded with\npsychologically rich profiles. Agents are instantiated from a nationally\nrepresentative survey of 2,485 Filipino respondents, combining sociodemographic\ninformation with validated constructs of personality traits, values, beliefs,\nand socio-political attitudes. The framework includes three stages: (1) agent\nembodiment via categorical or contextualized encodings, (2) exposure to\nreal-world political and economic scenarios, and (3) generation of sentiment\nratings accompanied by explanatory rationales. Using Quadratic Weighted\nAccuracy (QWA), we evaluated alignment between agent-generated and human\nresponses. Contextualized encoding achieved 92% alignment in replicating\noriginal survey responses. In sentiment simulation tasks, agents reached\n81%--86% accuracy against ground truth sentiment, with contextualized profile\nencodings significantly outperforming categorical (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d =\n0.70). Simulation results remained consistent across repeated trials\n(+/-0.2--0.5% SD) and resilient to variation in scenario framing (p = 0.9676,\nCohen's d = 0.02).

The effective potential is\nthen expressed as a sum of a zero-range contact interaction and a long-range\ndipole-dipole interaction under the Born approximation.

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal\nlanguage model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse\nhypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage\ninvolves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented\nthrough diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns\nassociated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the\noriginal clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish\nnormotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each\npatient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding\nphysiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model\nto capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding\nclinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into\nstructured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on\ntwo intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established\nbaselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability\nin clinical decision support scenarios.

    "abstract": "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is essential for advancing scientific and\nengineering fields but is hindered by operational complexity, high expertise\nrequirements, and limited accessibility. This paper introduces ChatCFD, an\nautomated agent system for OpenFOAM simulations that processes multi-modal\ninputs (e.g., research papers, meshes) via an interactive interface, leveraging\nDeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 large language models, a multi-agent architecture,\nand OpenFOAM knowledge. Its four-stage pipeline (Knowledge Base Construction,\nUser Input Processing, Case File Generation, and Execution and Error\nReflection) enables iterative trial-reflection-refinement for intricate setups,\nsupporting diverse physical models and external meshes. Validation on 205\nbenchmark tutorial cases, 110 perturbed variants, and 2 literature-derived\ncases shows ChatCFD's 82.1 percent operational success rate on basic cases,\noutperforming MetaOpenFOAM (6.2 percent) and Foam-Agent (42.3 percent), and\n60-80 percent on literature-derived complex cases. Turbulence model studies\nshow a 40 percent success rate for common models versus 10 percent for rare\nones like RNG k-epsilon. Physics coupling analyses reveal higher resource\ndemands for multi-physics-coupled cases, while LLM bias toward simpler setups\nintroduces persistent errors, such as dimensional inconsistency. Ablation\nstudies highlight the efficacy of RAG-based modules and reflection mechanisms.\nBy automating hypothesis testing and parameter exploration, ChatCFD accelerates\nscientific discovery in fluid mechanics and engineering, addressing LLM\nlimitations through structured design and showing strong potential as a modular\ncomponent in MCP-based agent networks for collaborative multi-agent systems,\npaving the way for scalable AI-driven CFD innovation.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements have shown that the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach\nsignificantly enhances the capacity of large language models (LLMs) and\nimproves performance on downstream tasks. Building on these promising results,\nmulti-modal large language models (MLLMs) have increasingly adopted MoE\ntechniques. However, existing multi-modal MoE tuning methods typically face two\nkey challenges: expert uniformity and router rigidity. Expert uniformity occurs\nbecause MoE experts are often initialized by simply replicating the FFN\nparameters from LLMs, leading to homogenized expert functions and weakening the\nintended diversification of the MoE architecture. Meanwhile, router rigidity\nstems from the prevalent use of static linear routers for expert selection,\nwhich fail to distinguish between visual and textual tokens, resulting in\nsimilar expert distributions for image and text. To address these limitations,\nwe propose EvoMoE, an innovative MoE tuning framework. EvoMoE introduces a\nmeticulously designed expert initialization strategy that progressively evolves\nmultiple robust experts from a single trainable expert, a process termed expert\nevolution that specifically targets severe expert homogenization. Furthermore,\nwe introduce the Dynamic Token-aware Router (DTR), a novel routing mechanism\nthat allocates input tokens to appropriate experts based on their modality and\nintrinsic token values. This dynamic routing is facilitated by hypernetworks,\nwhich dynamically generate routing weights tailored for each individual token.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that EvoMoE significantly outperforms other\nsparse MLLMs across a variety of multi-modal benchmarks, including MME,\nMMBench, TextVQA, and POPE.

    "abstract": "Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to receive natal kicks at their formation in\nsupernovae. In order to investigate the magnitude of these kicks, we analyze\nthe proper motions and distance estimates -- either through parallax or\ndispersion measures -- of young isolated pulsars and infer their\nthree-dimensional velocities relative to their local standard of rest. We find\nthat the velocities based on parallax distances of pulsars younger than 10 Myr\nfollow a log-normal distribution with $\\mu=5.60\\pm0.12$ and\n$\\sigma=0.68\\pm0.10$, peaking at ${\\sim}$150--200 km/s, which we adopt as our\nfiducial kick distribution. Using a previously established method that infers\nkick magnitudes through the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories, we also\nestimate the kick velocities of older pulsars, which we find to be consistent\nwith our fiducial kick distribution. A log-normal fit to all pulsars with ages\nbelow 40 Myr yields a more constraining (but possibly more prone to systematic\nerrors) fit with $\\mu=5.67\\pm0.10$ and $\\sigma=0.59\\pm0.08$, respectively.\nMoreover, we (1) resolve the tension between our results and the Maxwellian\ndistribution found by Hobbs et al. (2005), which has a ${\\sim}50\\%$ higher\nmedian velocity, by showing that their analysis is missing a Jacobian needed to\ncorrect for its logarithmic histogram bin sizes, and (2) argue that the\nbimodality found by others is not statistically significant and that previous\nresults are consistent with our inferred kick distribution, effectively\nreconciling the literature on observed NS kicks.",

To bridge this\ntheoretical-practical gap, we defined \"good representation learning\" as\nguaranteeing both transferability and discriminability, and proved that an\nadditional loss term targeting target-domain discriminability is necessary.\nBuilding on these insights, we proposed a novel adversarial-based UDA framework\nthat explicitly integrates a domain alignment objective with a\ndiscriminability-enhancing constraint.

    "abstract": "The primary contribution of this paper is a challenging benchmark dataset,\nUAVPairs, and a training pipeline designed for match pair retrieval of\nlarge-scale UAV images. First, the UAVPairs dataset, comprising 21,622\nhigh-resolution images across 30 diverse scenes, is constructed; the 3D points\nand tracks generated by SfM-based 3D reconstruction are employed to define the\ngeometric similarity of image pairs, ensuring genuinely matchable image pairs\nare used for training. Second, to solve the problem of expensive mining cost\nfor global hard negative mining, a batched nontrivial sample mining strategy is\nproposed, leveraging the geometric similarity and multi-scene structure of the\nUAVPairs to generate training samples as to accelerate training. Third,\nrecognizing the limitation of pair-based losses, the ranked list loss is\ndesigned to improve the discrimination of image retrieval models, which\noptimizes the global similarity structure constructed from the positive set and\nnegative set. Finally, the effectiveness of the UAVPairs dataset and training\npipeline is validated through comprehensive experiments on three distinct\nlarge-scale UAV datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that models\ntrained with the UAVPairs dataset and the ranked list loss achieve\nsignificantly improved retrieval accuracy compared to models trained on\nexisting datasets or with conventional losses. Furthermore, these improvements\ntranslate to enhanced view graph connectivity and higher quality of\nreconstructed 3D models. The models trained by the proposed approach perform\nmore robustly compared with hand-crafted global features, particularly in\nchallenging repetitively textured scenes and weakly textured scenes. For match\npair retrieval of large-scale UAV images, the trained image retrieval models\noffer an effective solution.

The intended\nreaders are plasma physicists as well as graduate students interested in\nlaser-plasma interaction. No prior knowledge of scattering instabilities is\nrequired. Step by step, we explain how the laser hot spots are gradually\nreplaced with other structures, called instantons, as the amplification of the\nscattered light increases. In the amplification range of interest for\nlaser-plasma interaction, instanton--hot spot complexes tend to appear in the\nlaser field (in addition to the expected hot spots), with a non-negligible\nprobability. For even larger amplifications and systems longer than a hot spot\nlength, the hot spot field description is clearly invalidated by the instanton\ntakeover.",

While 3D\ndiverging waves can provide high volume rates, they suffer from limited tissue\nharmonic generation and increased multipath effects, which degrade image\nquality. One compromise is to retain the focusing in elevation while leveraging\nunfocused diverging waves in the lateral direction to reduce the number of\ntransmissions per elevation plane. Reaching the volume rates achieved by full\n3D diverging waves, however, requires dramatically undersampling the number of\nelevation planes. Subsequently, to render the full volume, simple interpolation\ntechniques are applied. This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D ultrasound\nreconstruction from a reduced set of elevation planes by employing diffusion\nmodels (DMs) to achieve increased spatial and temporal resolution. We compare\nboth traditional and supervised deep learning-based interpolation methods on a\n3D cardiac ultrasound dataset. Our results show that DM-based reconstruction\nconsistently outperforms the baselines in image quality and downstream task\nperformance. Additionally, we accelerate inference by leveraging the temporal\nconsistency inherent to ultrasound sequences. Finally, we explore the\nrobustness of the proposed method by exploiting the probabilistic nature of\ndiffusion posterior sampling to quantify reconstruction uncertainty and\ndemonstrate improved recall on out-of-distribution data with synthetic\nanomalies under strong subsampling.",

    "abstract": "Feature matching dominats the time costs in structure from motion (SfM). The\nprimary contribution of this study is a GPU data schedule algorithm for\nefficient feature matching of Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The core\nidea is to divide the whole dataset into blocks based on the matrix band\nreduction (MBR) and achieve efficient feature matching via GPU-accelerated\ncascade hashing. First, match pairs are selected by using an image retrieval\ntechnique, which converts images into global descriptors and searches\nhigh-dimension nearest neighbors with graph indexing. Second, compact image\nblocks are iteratively generated from a MBR-based data schedule strategy, which\nexploits image connections to avoid redundant data IO (input/output) burden and\nincreases the usage of GPU computing power. Third, guided by the generated\nimage blocks, feature matching is executed sequentially within the framework of\nGPU-accelerated cascade hashing, and initial candidate matches are refined by\ncombining a local geometric constraint and RANSAC-based global verification.\nFor further performance improvement, these two seps are designed to execute\nparallelly in GPU and CPU. Finally, the performance of the proposed solution is\nevaluated by using large-scale UAV datasets. The results demonstrate that it\nincreases the efficiency of feature matching with speedup ratios ranging from\n77.0 to 100.0 compared with KD-Tree based matching methods, and achieves\ncomparable accuracy in relative and absolute bundle adjustment (BA). The\nproposed algorithm is an efficient solution for feature matching of UAV images.",

To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes BiasFilter, a model-agnostic,\ninference-time debiasing framework that integrates seamlessly with both\nopen-source and API-based LLMs. Instead of relying on retraining with balanced\ndata or modifying model parameters, BiasFilter enforces fairness by filtering\ngeneration outputs in real time. Specifically, it periodically evaluates\nintermediate outputs every few tokens, maintains an active set of candidate\ncontinuations, and incrementally completes generation by discarding low-reward\nsegments based on a fairness reward signal. To support this process, we\nconstruct a fairness preference dataset and train an implicit reward model to\nassess token-level fairness in generated responses. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that BiasFilter effectively mitigates social bias across a range of\nLLMs while preserving overall generation quality.",

However, depending on the specific optimization\nproblem under consideration, the type and the parameters for the averaging need\nto be adjusted to achieve the smallest optimization error. In this work we\npropose an averaging approach, which we refer to as parallel averaged ADAM\n(PADAM), in which we compute parallely different averaged variants of ADAM and\nduring the training process dynamically select the variant with the smallest\noptimization error. A central feature of this approach is that this procedure\nrequires no more gradient evaluations than the usual ADAM optimizer as each of\nthe averaged trajectories relies on the same underlying ADAM trajectory and\nthus on the same underlying gradients. We test the proposed PADAM optimizer in\n13 stochastic optimization and deep neural network (DNN) learning problems and\ncompare its performance with known optimizers from the literature such as\nstandard SGD, momentum SGD, Adam with and without EMA, and ADAMW. In\nparticular, we apply the compared optimizers to physics-informed neural\nnetwork, deep Galerkin, deep backward stochastic differential equation and deep\nKolmogorov approximations for boundary value partial differential equation\nproblems from scientific machine learning, as well as to DNN approximations for\noptimal control and optimal stopping problems. In nearly all of the considered\nexamples PADAM achieves, sometimes among others and sometimes exclusively,\nessentially the smallest optimization error.

In\nparticular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both\nconventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical\nsettings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM)\nand the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue\nof the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic\nGRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which\nhave been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is\na proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of\nnon-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems.

While\nthese methods offer advantages such as short inference time, they suffer from\nlow performance, particularly when the number of input variables is large. In\nthis study, we hypothesized that this limitation stems from the memorization\nbias of Transformers in symbolic regression. We conducted a quantitative\nevaluation of this bias in Transformers using a synthetic dataset and found\nthat Transformers rarely generate expressions not present in the training data.\nAdditional theoretical analysis reveals that this bias arises from the\nTransformer's inability to construct expressions compositionally while\nverifying their numerical validity.

    "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions has\nsignificantly enhanced their ability to tackle unseen tasks. However, despite\ntheir strong generalization capabilities, instruction-following LLMs encounter\ndifficulties when dealing with tasks that require domain knowledge. This work\nintroduces a specialized instruction fine-tuning for the domain of\ncomputational argumentation (CA). The goal is to enable an LLM to effectively\ntackle any unseen CA tasks while preserving its generalization capabilities.\nReviewing existing CA research, we crafted natural language instructions for\n105 CA tasks to this end. On this basis, we developed a CA-specific benchmark\nfor LLMs that allows for a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in\nsolving various CA tasks. We synthesized 52k CA-related instructions, adapting\nthe self-instruct process to train a CA-specialized instruction-following LLM.\nOur experiments suggest that CA-specialized instruction fine-tuning\nsignificantly enhances the LLM on both seen and unseen CA tasks. At the same\ntime, performance on the general NLP tasks of the SuperNI benchmark remains\nstable.",

Functions such as\nGELU, SELU, and SiLU offer smooth gradients and improved convergence\nproperties, making them popular choices in state-of-the-art models. Despite\nthis trend, the classical ReLU remains appealing due to its simplicity,\ninherent sparsity, and other advantageous topological characteristics. However,\nReLU units are prone to becoming irreversibly inactive - a phenomenon known as\nthe dying ReLU problem - which limits their overall effectiveness. In this\nwork, we introduce surrogate gradient learning for ReLU (SUGAR) as a novel,\nplug-and-play regularizer for deep architectures. SUGAR preserves the standard\nReLU function during the forward pass but replaces its derivative in the\nbackward pass with a smooth surrogate that avoids zeroing out gradients. We\ndemonstrate that SUGAR, when paired with a well-chosen surrogate function,\nsubstantially enhances generalization performance over convolutional network\narchitectures such as VGG-16 and ResNet-18, providing sparser activations while\neffectively resurrecting dead ReLUs. Moreover, we show that even in modern\narchitectures like Conv2NeXt and Swin Transformer - which typically employ GELU\n- substituting these with SUGAR yields competitive and even slightly superior\nperformance. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that advanced\nactivation functions are necessary for optimal performance. Instead, they\nsuggest that the conventional ReLU, particularly with appropriate gradient\nhandling, can serve as a strong, versatile revived classic across a broad range\nof deep learning vision models.",

    "abstract": "An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a\nprincipal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely\nemployed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the\nauxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the\nprincipal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The\nprincipal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum\nwhite noises act as a bath (environment) for this system. Recently it was shown\nthat the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under\ncontinuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a\nsystem of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only\noperators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the\nprincipal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) is determined by the\n``diagonal\" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the\n``off-diagonal\" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial\nconditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks\nonly. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be\nmade to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an\nintegration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the\nnon-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under\ncontinuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced\nconditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic\nNakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian\nquantum systems.",

DPO-based training increases\nparaphrase-type generation accuracy by 3 percentage points over a supervised\nbaseline and raises human preference ratings by 7 percentage points.

    "abstract": "Automatic Gender Recognition (AGR) systems are an increasingly widespread\napplication in the Machine Learning (ML) landscape. While these systems are\ntypically understood as detecting gender, they often classify datapoints based\non observable features correlated at best with either male or female sex. In\naddition to questionable binary assumptions, from an epistemological point of\nview, this is problematic for two reasons. First, there exists a gap between\nthe categories the system is meant to predict (woman versus man) and those onto\nwhich their output reasonably maps (female versus male). What is more, gender\ncannot be inferred on the basis of such observable features. This makes AGR\ntools often unreliable, especially in the case of non-binary and gender\nnon-conforming people. We suggest a theoretical and practical rethinking of AGR\nsystems. To begin, distinctions are made between sex, gender, and gender\nexpression. Then, we build upon the observation that, unlike algorithmic\nmisgendering, human-human misgendering is open to the possibility of\nre-evaluation and correction. We suggest that analogous dynamics should be\nrecreated in AGR, giving users the possibility to correct the system's output.\nWhile implementing such a feedback mechanism could be regarded as diminishing\nthe system's autonomy, it represents a way to significantly increase fairness\nlevels in AGR. This is consistent with the conceptual change of paradigm that\nwe advocate for AGR systems, which should be understood as tools respecting\nindividuals' rights and capabilities of self-expression and determination.",

However,\nexisting VLM often generate inaccurate answers due to a lack of up-to-date\nknowledge. To address this issue, recent research has introduced\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, commonly used in Large\nLanguage Models (LLM), into VLM, incorporating external multi-modal knowledge\nto enhance the accuracy and practicality of VLM systems. Nevertheless, the RAG\nin LLM may be susceptible to data poisoning attacks. RAG-based VLM may also\nface the threat of this attack. This paper first reveals the vulnerabilities of\nthe RAG-based large model under poisoning attack, showing that existing\nsingle-modal RAG poisoning attacks have a 100\\% failure rate in multi-modal RAG\nscenarios. To address this gap, we propose Spa-VLM (Stealthy Poisoning Attack\non RAG-based VLM), a new paradigm for poisoning attacks on large models. We\ncarefully craft malicious multi-modal knowledge entries, including adversarial\nimages and misleading text, which are then injected into the RAG's knowledge\nbase. When users access the VLM service, the system may generate misleading\noutputs. We evaluate Spa-VLM on two Wikipedia datasets and across two different\nRAGs. Results demonstrate that our method achieves highly stealthy poisoning,\nwith the attack success rate exceeding 0.8 after injecting just 5 malicious\nentries into knowledge bases with 100K and 2M entries, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art poisoning attacks designed for RAG-based LLMs. Additionally,\nwe evaluated several defense mechanisms, all of which ultimately proved\nineffective against Spa-VLM, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of\nour attack.",

By scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy, the mass terms in the surface states are identified on both\nsurface terminations. Experimental results reveal the existence of a\nhybridization gap of approximately 23 meV in surface states on the BT\ntermination. This gap comes from the hybridization between the surface states\nand the spin-split states in the adjacent MBT layer. On the MBT termination, an\nexchange mass term of about 30 meV in surface states is identified by taking\nmagnetic-field-dependent Landau level spectra as well as theoretical\nsimulations. In addition, the mass term varies with the field in the film with\na heavy BiMn doping level in the Mn layers.

Recently, multi-agent system shows great\npotential in tackling the above issues. However, directly applying it to MM2MA\ntask presents three critical challenges: (1) inadequate fine-grained\nunderstanding of multimodal inputs (especially for video), (2) the inability of\nsingle models to handle diverse audio events, and (3) the absence of\nself-correction mechanisms for reliable outputs.

While recent\nvision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle\nwith the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding\nneeded for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a\nreinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement\ninto embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful\nclosed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model\nwith structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward\nfunction tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via\nGeneralized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is\nevaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks,\ncovering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show\nthat our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale,\nincluding GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong\ngeneralization to unseen environments.

Its computational complexity remains a\nbottleneck, though, and slicing techniques have been developed to scale OT to\nlarge datasets. Recently, a novel slicing scheme, dubbed min-SWGG, lifts a\nsingle one-dimensional plan back to the original multidimensional space,\nfinally selecting the slice that yields the lowest Wasserstein distance as an\napproximation of the full OT plan. Despite its computational and theoretical\nadvantages, min-SWGG inherits typical limitations of slicing methods: (i) the\nnumber of required slices grows exponentially with the data dimension, and (ii)\nit is constrained to linear projections. Here, we reformulate min-SWGG as a\nbilevel optimization problem and propose a differentiable approximation scheme\nto efficiently identify the optimal slice, even in high-dimensional settings.\nWe furthermore define its generalized extension for accommodating to data\nliving on manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our\napproach in various applications, including gradient flows on manifolds and\nhigh-dimensional spaces, as well as a novel sliced OT-based conditional flow\nmatching for image generation -- where fast computation of transport plans is\nessential.",

In this paper, inspired by existing studies focusing on the\nclustering properties of DNN output features at each layer and the Progressive\nFeedforward Collapse phenomenon, we propose a method for adversarial example\ndetection and image recognition that uses layer-wise features to construct\nfeature paths and computes the correlation between the examples feature paths\nand the class-centered feature paths. Experimental results show that the\nrecognition method achieves 82.77% clean accuracy and 44.17% adversarial\naccuracy on the ResNet-20 with PFC. Compared to the adversarial training method\nwith 77.64% clean accuracy and 52.94% adversarial accuracy, our method exhibits\na trade-off without relying on computationally expensive defense strategies.\nFurthermore, on the standard ResNet-18, our method maintains this advantage\nwith respective metrics of 80.01% and 46.1%. This result reveals inherent\nadversarial robustness in DNNs, challenging the conventional understanding of\nthe weak adversarial robustness in DNNs.",

Through comprehensive analysis of\nthermodynamic behaviors manifested in P-V diagrams, G(T,P) surfaces, and C_P\ncurves, we establish that these black holes exhibit van der Waals-type phase\ntransition behavior. The derived critical exponents governing the phase\ntransition show precise correspondence with both van der Waals gas-liquid\nsystems, reinforcing the connection between black hole thermodynamics and mean\nfield theory statistics. The findings reveal a crucial dependence of phase\ntransition properties on the scalar charge parameter. A critical threshold\nemerges where phase transitions become prohibited when scalar charge exceeds a\nspecific magnitude. However, the transition persists asymptotically as scalar\ncharge approaches zero. The analysis further demonstrates nonlinear\nrelationships between scalar charge and critical parameters: while small scalar\ncharges induce increasing critical volume with charge magnitude, larger values\nproduce an inverse trend. Critical temperature displays complementary behavior,\nmaintaining monotonic variation under certain conditions while exhibiting\ninverse correlation with critical volume in others. Significantly, the\ntransition points governing critical volume and temperature trends occur at\ndistinct scalar charge values for different black holes, indicating a\nnon-trivial parameter dependence. These results highlight the scalar charge's\ndual role as both an enabler and suppressor of phase transitions in EMs black\nholes, providing new insights into the interplay between geometric\nconfigurations and thermodynamic properties in modified gravity theories.",

The explosive nucleosynthesis is then computed in the\nframework of the thermal bomb induced explosion by means of the HYPERION code\n(Limongi and Chieffi 2020). We find that: (1) the yields of the intermediate\nmass elements (i.e., O to P) show a steep decrease as the inital mass\ndecreases; (2) the yields of s-weak component, i.e., those produced by the slow\nneutron captures from Ga to to the first neutron closure shell, decrease almost\nlinearly as a function of the initial mass with respect to the ones produced by\nthe more massive stars; (3) the global contribution of the stars in the mass\nrange 9.22-13 Msun to the yields of a generation of massive stars averaged over\na standard initial mass function is negligible for essentially all the\nisotopes.

However, in real-world scenarios, data annotations\nare often ambiguous or inaccurate, meaning that class labels may not reliably\nindicate whether two examples belong to the same class. This limitation\nrestricts the applicability of supervised contrastive learning. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce the concept of ``continuous semantic similarity'' to\ndefine positive and negative pairs. Instead of directly relying on imprecise\nclass labels, we measure the semantic similarity between example pairs, which\nquantifies how closely they belong to the same category by iteratively refining\nweak supervisory signals. Based on this concept, we propose a graph-theoretic\nframework for weakly-supervised contrastive learning, where semantic similarity\nserves as the graph weights. Our framework is highly versatile and can be\napplied to many weakly-supervised learning scenarios. We demonstrate its\neffectiveness through experiments in two common settings, i.e., noisy label and\npartial label learning, where existing methods can be easily integrated to\nsignificantly improve performance. Theoretically, we establish an error bound\nfor our approach, showing that it can approximate supervised contrastive\nlearning under mild conditions.

    "abstract": "Financial markets exhibit complex dynamics where localized events trigger\nripple effects across entities. Previous event studies, constrained by static\nsingle-company analyses and simplistic assumptions, fail to capture these\nripple effects. While large language models (LLMs) offer emergent reasoning\ncapabilities, their direct application falters due to structural market\nunawareness and limited capacity to analyze ripple effects. We propose\nFinRipple, an elegant framework that empowers LLMs with the ability to analyze\nripple effects through financial theory-guided large-scale reinforcement\nlearning. We begin by relaxing the assumptions of previous methods,\nincorporating a time-varying knowledge graph to accurately represent market\nstructure. By seamlessly integrating classical asset pricing theory, we align\nthe LLM with the market, enabling it to predict ripple effects. To the best of\nour knowledge, we are the first to provide a standardized definition of ripple\neffect prediction, a task that is extremely important yet unexplored in the\nfinancial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinRipple provides a\npromising solution to this task.",

To address the limitations of existing methods confined to\nsingle-degradation restoration or grayscale image processing, we present Global\nwith Local Parametric Generation Enhancement Network (GL-PGENet), a novel\narchitecture designed for multi-degraded color document images, ensuring both\nefficiency and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our solution incorporates\nthree key innovations: First, a hierarchical enhancement framework that\nintegrates global appearance correction with local refinement, enabling\ncoarse-to-fine quality improvement. Second, a Dual-Branch Local-Refine Network\nwith parametric generation mechanisms that replaces conventional direct\nprediction, producing enhanced outputs through learned intermediate parametric\nrepresentations rather than pixel-wise mapping. This approach enhances local\nconsistency while improving model generalization. Finally, a modified NestUNet\narchitecture incorporating dense block to effectively fuse low-level pixel\nfeatures and high-level semantic features, specifically adapted for document\nimage characteristics. In addition, to enhance generalization performance, we\nadopt a two-stage training strategy: large-scale pretraining on a synthetic\ndataset of 500,000+ samples followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of GL-PGENet, achieving\nstate-of-the-art SSIM scores of 0.7721 on DocUNet and 0.9480 on RealDAE.

Here we\nstudy three filament eruptions exhibiting significant mass draining, often\nmanifested as falling threads at a constant speed ranging between 30--300 km/s.\nWe found that most of the falling material lands onto the hooked segments of\nflare ribbons, only a small fraction lands inside the hooks, and almost none\nlands onto the straight segments of ribbons. Based on these observations we\nsurmise that before eruptions most of the filament mass is entrained by field\nlines threading the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), which wrap around the\nfilament field and whose footpoints are mapped by the hooked ribbons, and that\nthe magnetic reconnection involving these field lines is the major cause of the\nmass drainage during eruptions. Additionally, the light curves of the hooked\nribbons suggest that during eruptions the earlier (later) QSL boundary of\nfilaments is threaded by mass-loaded (depleted) field lines. By assuming that\nthe constant-speed motion is due to a drag force balancing the gravity, we\nproposed a simplified analytical model to estimate the density contrast of the\nfalling material. The estimated density contrast is then fed into a numerical\nmodel, in which filament threads fall along vertical magnetic field lines\nthrough a gravitationally stratified atmosphere.

Traditional text-based methods cannot\nhandle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG\napproaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to\nreason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental\ncapabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model\nreasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex\nreasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact\nwith search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning\ntrajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual\noptimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of\nRL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely\nincorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token\nallocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models\ninteract with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant\ninformation due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to\nsuboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space\ntailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling,\nallowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective.\nFurthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the\nretriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query\nrewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward.

By comparing these models with equally sized\ninstruct models, we identify two key causes of this verbosity: (1)\nreinforcement learning reduces the information density of forward reasoning,\nand (2) backward chain-of thought training encourages redundant and often\nunnecessary verification steps. Since LLMs cannot assess the difficulty of a\ngiven problem, they tend to apply the same cautious reasoning strategy across\nall tasks, resulting in inefficient overthinking. To address this, we propose\nCoThink, an embarrassingly simple pipeline: an instruct model first drafts a\nhigh-level solution outline; a reasoning model then works out the solution. We\nobserve that CoThink enables dynamic adjustment of reasoning depth based on\ninput difficulty. Evaluated with three reasoning models DAPO, DeepSeek-R1, and\nQwQ on three datasets GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME24, CoThink reduces total token\ngeneration by 22.3% while maintaining pass@1 accuracy within a 0.42% margin on\naverage.

While\nhuman-object interaction (HOI) detection has made some progress in\ngeneral-purpose video downstream tasks, when applied to recognize the\ninteraction behaviors between a streamer and different objects in\nlivestreaming, it tends to focuses too much on the objects and neglects their\ninteractions with the streamer, which leads to object bias. To solve this\nissue, we propose a prototype embedding optimization for human-object\ninteraction detection (PeO-HOI). First, the livestreaming is preprocessed using\nobject detection and tracking techniques to extract features of the\nhuman-object (HO) pairs. Then, prototype embedding optimization is adopted to\nmitigate the effect of object bias on HOI. Finally, after modelling the\nspatio-temporal context between HO pairs, the HOI detection results are\nobtained by the prediction head. The experimental results show that the\ndetection accuracy of the proposed PeO-HOI method has detection accuracies of\n37.19%@full, 51.42%@non-rare, 26.20%@rare on the publicly available dataset\nVidHOI, 45.13%@full, 62.78%@non-rare and 30.37%@rare on the self-built dataset\nBJUT-HOI, which effectively improves the HOI detection performance in\nlivestreaming.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing vulnerabilities in stripped binary files presents a significant\nchallenge in software security. Although some progress has been made in\ngenerating human-readable information from decompiled binary files with Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), effectively and scalably detecting vulnerabilities\nwithin these binary files is still an open problem. This paper explores the\nnovel application of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities within these binary files.\nWe demonstrate the feasibility of identifying vulnerable programs through a\ncombined approach of decompilation optimization to make the vulnerabilities\nmore prominent and long-term memory for a larger context window, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in binary vulnerability analysis. Our findings\nhighlight the potential for LLMs to overcome the limitations of traditional\nanalysis methods and advance the field of binary vulnerability detection,\npaving the way for more secure software systems. In this paper, we present\nVul-BinLLM , an LLM-based framework for binary vulnerability detection that\nmirrors traditional binary analysis workflows with fine-grained optimizations\nin decompilation and vulnerability reasoning with an extended context. In the\ndecompilation phase, Vul-BinLLM adds vulnerability and weakness comments\nwithout altering the code structure or functionality, providing more contextual\ninformation for vulnerability reasoning later. Then for vulnerability\nreasoning, Vul-BinLLM combines in-context learning and chain-of-thought\nprompting along with a memory management agent to enhance accuracy. Our\nevaluations encompass the commonly used synthetic dataset Juliet to evaluate\nthe potential feasibility for analysis and vulnerability detection in C/C++\nbinaries. Our evaluations show that Vul-BinLLM is highly effective in detecting\nvulnerabilities on the compiled Juliet dataset.",

Advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) offer promising solutions by generating synthetic survey\nresponses informed by qualitative data. This study investigates whether LLMs,\nguided by personal interviews, can reliably predict human survey responses,\nusing the Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ) and\ninterviews from after-school program staff as a case study. Results indicate\nthat LLMs capture overall response patterns but exhibit lower variability than\nhumans. Incorporating interview data improves response diversity for some\nmodels (e.g., Claude, GPT), while well-crafted prompts and low-temperature\nsettings enhance alignment between LLM and human responses. Demographic\ninformation had less impact than interview content on alignment accuracy. These\nfindings underscore the potential of interview-informed LLMs to bridge\nqualitative and quantitative methodologies while revealing limitations in\nresponse variability, emotional interpretation, and psychometric fidelity.\nFuture research should refine prompt design, explore bias mitigation, and\noptimize model settings to enhance the validity of LLM-generated survey data in\nsocial science research.",

The bloat effect happens because\nit is more likely to produce better offspring by adding instructions than by\nremoving them, given an instruction editing distance from the optimal program.\nThe analysis of the minimum hitting time suggests that for a basic LGP genetic\noperator (i.e., freemut), maintaining a necessarily small program size and\nmutating multiple instructions each time can improve LGP performance.

We\nfind our FUV detected galaxies generally have higher specific star formation\nrates than other star forming galaxies. Most of the FUV galaxies with masses\nabove 10$^9 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$,and showing high sSFR have no close neighbors,\npointing at RPS as the dominant mechanism affecting them. In contrast, most of\nthe low-mass FUV objects present at least one companion, suggesting that tidal\ninteractions also play an important role in the triggering of infalling\ngalaxies. Combining the FUV-SFR with the HI properties of the observed galaxies\nin A496 we identify an evolutionary sequence consisting of five stages: (1)\nPre-triggering, (2) Initial SF-triggering, (3) Peak of star-formation, (4)\nSF-fading, and (5) SF-quenching. During this path, normal gas-rich objects\nreach a gas-deficiency phase with SFR well below the main sequence. This\nprocess, prior to becoming a full passive galaxy, can be accomplished within a\nfew 10$^{8}$ yr.",

We insert tracer dyes in\nthe CGM with different gas flows (shearing, coherent, and static) and diverse\nphysical properties to track gas mixing. We correlate the extent and shape of\nthe dye spread with the local gas properties to understand gas mixing. Velocity\ndispersion and traceless symmetric shear tensors (pure shear deformation) in\nsmall regions (<= 5 kpc) around the dye injection locations best predict the\ndye spread extent after 200 Myr. We use this to determine diffusion calibration\nconstants for subgrid-scale mixing models. While the dye shape after 200 Myr\naligns well with the velocity dispersion and magnetic field dispersion, the\nbest alignment occurs with the dispersion of stretching eigenvectors (traceless\nsymmetric shear tensor) and plane-of-rotation (antisymmetric shear or vorticity\ntensor) in large regions (10 kpc) around the dye injection locations.\nTherefore, shear statistics and velocity dispersion best predict the extent and\nshape of mixed gas. The linear temporal dependence of the dye spread suggests\nsuperdiffusion in the CGM, potentially due to turbulent and large-scale\ncoherent flows or numerical diffusion. Despite significant numerical mixing\nfrom our 1 kpc resolution (insufficient to resolve Reynolds numbers ~10^2-10^3,\nwhich require a few hundred pc resolution), our correlation results are robust\nthanks to fixed spatial resolution throughout the CGM.

Given recent advances in diffusion models, it is natural for us to\nconsider their potential applicability to document dewarping. However, it is\nfar from straightforward to adopt diffusion models in document dewarping due to\ntheir unfaithful control on highly complex document images (e.g.,\n2000$\\times$3000 resolution).

However, with the explosive growth of multi-modal information,\ntraditional knowledge graph completion (KGC) models cannot be directly applied.\nThis has attracted a large number of researchers to study multi-modal knowledge\ngraph completion (MMKGC). Since MMKG extends KG to the visual and textual\ndomains, MMKGC faces two main challenges: (1) how to deal with the fine-grained\nmodality information interaction and awareness; (2) how to ensure the dominant\nrole of graph structure in multi-modal knowledge fusion and deal with the noise\ngenerated by other modalities during modality fusion. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel MMKGC model named TSAM, which\nintegrates fine-grained modality interaction and dominant graph structure to\nform a high-performance MMKGC framework. Specifically, to solve the challenges,\nTSAM proposes the Fine-grained Modality Awareness Fusion method (FgMAF), which\nuses pre-trained language models to better capture fine-grained semantic\ninformation interaction of different modalities and employs an attention\nmechanism to achieve fine-grained modality awareness and fusion. Additionally,\nTSAM presents the Structure-aware Contrastive Learning method (SaCL), which\nutilizes two contrastive learning approaches to align other modalities more\nclosely with the structured modality. Extensive experiments show that the\nproposed TSAM model significantly outperforms existing MMKGC models on widely\nused multi-modal datasets.",

While recent vision-language model\n(VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and\nscene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal\ndiscontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations,\nand insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures.

    "abstract": "Sampling-based motion planners such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree* (RRT*)\nand its informed variant IRRT* are widely used for optimal path planning in\ncomplex environments. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence\nand high variance due to their reliance on random sampling, particularly when\ninitial solution discovery is delayed. This paper presents Enhanced SIRRT*\n(E-SIRRT*), a structure-aware planner that improves upon the original SIRRT*\nframework by introducing two key enhancements: hybrid path smoothing and\nbidirectional rewiring. Hybrid path smoothing refines the initial path through\nspline fitting and collision-aware correction, while bidirectional rewiring\nlocally optimizes tree connectivity around the smoothed path to improve cost\npropagation. Experimental results demonstrate that E-SIRRT* consistently\noutperforms IRRT* and SIRRT* in terms of initial path quality, convergence\nrate, and robustness across 100 trials. Unlike IRRT*, which exhibits high\nvariability due to stochastic initialization, E-SIRRT* achieves repeatable and\nefficient performance through deterministic skeleton-based initialization and\nstructural refinement.",

Extensive experiments on\nMS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal\nRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval and\ngeneration quality, while maintaining high efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactive\napplications such as virtual and augmented reality, where first-person\n(egocentric) view captured by head-mounted cameras serves as key input. While\nthis view offers fine-grained cues about user attention and hand-object\ninteractions, their narrow field of view and lack of global context often lead\nto failures on spatially or contextually demanding queries. To address this, we\nintroduce a framework that augments egocentric inputs with third-person\n(exocentric) views, providing complementary information such as global scene\nlayout and object visibility to LVLMs. We present E3VQA, the first benchmark\nfor multi-view question answering with 4K high-quality question-answer pairs\ngrounded in synchronized ego-exo image pairs. Additionally, we propose M3CoT, a\ntraining-free prompting technique that constructs a unified scene\nrepresentation by integrating scene graphs from three complementary\nperspectives. M3CoT enables LVLMs to reason more effectively across views,\nyielding consistent performance gains (4.84% for GPT-4o and 5.94% for Gemini\n2.0 Flash) over a recent CoT baseline. Our extensive evaluation reveals key\nstrengths and limitations of LVLMs in multi-view reasoning and highlights the\nvalue of leveraging both egocentric and exocentric inputs.",

We constructed four broadband SEDs after applying aperture\ncorrection (for the UVIT filter), subtracting host galaxy and emission line\ncontributions from UV flux, and using mean X-ray spectra alongside selected UV\ndata points. First, we fitted the SEDs with KYNSED model assuming various\ncombinations of inclination, $\\theta$, color correction factors, $f_{\\rm col}$,\nand BH spins. Best-fit models were achieved for $\\theta=70^{\\circ}$ (consistent\nwith past estimates for this source) and for spin $\\leq 0.5$, while $f_{\\rm\ncol}$ is not constrained.

Recently proposed zero-determinant\nstrategies enable players to unilaterally enforce linear relations between\npayoffs. Furthermore, based on the mathematics of zero-determinant strategies,\nregional payoff control, in which payoffs are enforced into some feasible\nregions, has been discovered in social dilemma situations. More recently,\ntheory of payoff control was extended to multichannel games, where players\nparallelly interact with each other in multiple channels. However, properties\nof zero-determinant strategies specific to multichannel games are still not\nclear. In this paper, we elucidate properties of zero-determinant strategies in\nmultichannel games. First, we relate the existence condition of\nzero-determinant strategies in multichannel games to that of zero-determinant\nstrategies in each channel. We then show that the existence of zero-determinant\nstrategies in multichannel games requires the existence of zero-determinant\nstrategies in some channels.

However, conventional bit-level transmission strategies\ncannot support the efficiency and adaptability required by modern,\ndata-intensive applications. The concept of semantic communication (SemCom)\naddresses this limitation by focusing on transmitting task-relevant semantic\ninformation instead of raw data. While recent efforts incorporating deep\nlearning and large-scale AI models have improved SemCom's performance, existing\nsystems remain vulnerable to both semantic-level and transmission-level noise\nbecause they often rely on domain-specific architectures that hinder\ngeneralizability. In this paper, a novel and generalized semantic communication\nframework called WaSeCom is proposed to systematically address uncertainty and\nenhance robustness. In particular, Wasserstein distributionally robust\noptimization is employed to provide resilience against semantic\nmisinterpretation and channel perturbations. A rigorous theoretical analysis is\nperformed to establish the robust generalization guarantees of the proposed\nframework. Experimental results on image and text transmission demonstrate that\nWaSeCom achieves improved robustness under noise and adversarial perturbations.\nThese results highlight its effectiveness in preserving semantic fidelity\nacross varying wireless conditions.",

Their intensities are described by\nexcitation temperature $286\\pm2$~K and gas number density $\\geq\n10^9$~cm$^{-3}$. The emission originates from the hot core rather than the warm\ndense envelope surrounding a central young stellar object. The HDO column\ndensity ranges from $(3.9-7.9)\\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$ with a most probable\nvalue $5.6\\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$. The HDO abundance relative to hydrogen\nnuclei is $1.5\\times10^{-9}$. This HDO abundance value is among the lowest\nreported for hot cores. Combined with the non-detection of the H$_2^{18}$O\nline, we conclude that protostellar heating in RCW 120 S2 is still in its early\nstages.",

    "abstract": "Point detection has been developed to locate pedestrians in crowded scenes by\ntraining a counter through a point-to-point (P2P) supervision scheme. Despite\nits excellent localization and counting performance, training a point-based\ncounter still faces challenges concerning annotation labor: hundreds to\nthousands of points are required to annotate a single sample capturing a dense\ncrowd. In this paper, we integrate point-based methods into a semi-supervised\ncounting framework based on pseudo-labeling, enabling the training of a counter\nwith only a few annotated samples supplemented by a large volume of\npseudo-labeled data. However, during implementation, the training encounters\nissues as the confidence for pseudo-labels fails to be propagated to background\npixels via the P2P. To tackle this challenge, we devise a point-specific\nactivation map (PSAM) to visually interpret the phenomena occurring during the\nill-posed training. Observations from the PSAM suggest that the feature map is\nexcessively activated by the loss for unlabeled data, causing the decoder to\nmisinterpret these over-activations as pedestrians. To mitigate this issue, we\npropose a point-to-region (P2R) scheme to substitute P2P, which segments out\nlocal regions rather than detects a point corresponding to a pedestrian for\nsupervision. Consequently, pixels in the local region can share the same\nconfidence with the corresponding pseudo points. Experimental results in both\nsemi-supervised counting and unsupervised domain adaptation highlight the\nadvantages of our method, illustrating P2R can resolve issues identified in\nPSAM.

The typical task for group\nsynchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a\nway that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information\nabout local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on\na hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the\nhyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group\nsynchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image\nprocessing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of\nhigher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations.\nSpecifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions\nwhich establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group\nsynchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general\nhigher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on\nhigher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the capability of off-the-shelf large language models\n(LLMs) to solve the economic dispatch (ED) problem. ED is a hard-constrained\noptimization problem solved on a day-ahead timescale by grid operators to\nminimize electricity generation costs while accounting for physical and\nengineering constraints. Numerous approaches have been proposed, but these\ntypically require either mathematical formulations, face convergence issues, or\ndepend on extensive labeled data and training time. This work implements LLMs\nenhanced with reasoning capabilities to address the classic lossless ED\nproblem. The proposed approach avoids the need for explicit mathematical\nformulations, does not suffer from convergence challenges, and requires neither\nlabeled data nor extensive training. A few-shot learning technique is utilized\nin two different prompting contexts. The IEEE 118-bus system with 19 generation\nunits serves as the evaluation benchmark. Results demonstrate that various\nprompting strategies enable LLMs to effectively solve the ED problem, offering\na convenient and efficient alternative. Consequently, this approach presents a\npromising future solution for ED tasks, particularly when foundational power\nsystem models are available.",

    "abstract": "Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed\ndata patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of\nconcept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and\npreviously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in\nthe accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter\nupdating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss\nof some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of\nknowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully\nutilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool\n(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for\ndifferent concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test\nsample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we\nrefer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it\nindicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the\ncurrent nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.\nSimultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be\ncleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on\ndifferent architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP\neffectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of\nonline forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the\nprediction results.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops an ensemble method for fine-tuning a language model to\nmultiple datasets. Existing methods, such as quantized LoRA (QLoRA), are\nefficient when adapting to a single dataset. When training on multiple datasets\nof different tasks, a common setup in practice, it remains unclear how to\ndesign an efficient adaptation for fine-tuning language models. We propose to\nuse an ensemble of multiple smaller adapters instead of a single adapter per\ntask. We design an efficient algorithm that partitions $n$ datasets into $m$\ngroups, where $m$ is typically much smaller than $n$ in practice, and train one\nadapter for each group before taking a weighted combination to form the\nensemble. The algorithm leverages a first-order approximation property of\nlow-rank adaptation to quickly obtain the fine-tuning performances of dataset\ncombinations since methods like LoRA stay close to the base model. Hence, we\nuse the gradients of the base model to estimate its behavior during\nfine-tuning. Empirically, this approximation holds with less than $1\\%$ error\non models with up to $34$ billion parameters, leading to an estimation of true\nfine-tuning performances under $5\\%$ error while speeding up computation\ncompared to base fine-tuning by $105$ times. When applied to fine-tune Llama\nand GPT models on ten text classification tasks, our approach provides up to\n$10\\%$ higher average test accuracy over QLoRA, with only $9\\%$ more FLOPs.

Leveraging its exceptional Pockels coefficient, barium titanate\n(BTO) in the thin film form has emerged as a promising alternative but the\nelectro-optic coefficients reported in thin-film BTO often fall short of bulk\nvalues due to challenges in film growth and waveguide fabrication. Here, we\nreport, to the best of our knowledge, the largest Pockels coefficient (r42) of\n1268 pm/V in thin film BTO platform, which is very close to the bulk value. We\nmeasure it by using an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, fabricated by an\noptimized wet-etching method for realising single-mode waveguides in\nsingle-crystal barium titanate-on-insulator grown by pulsed laser deposition.\nThis giant r42 is extracted from a device in which the optical mode is fully\nconfined within a single-crystal BTO waveguide. This approach contrasts with\nprevious designs where the core material - typically silicon or silicon nitride\n- supports only partial confinement, resulting in an evanescent overlap with a\nmulti-crystalline BTO layer.

To address this issue, structured pruning is\nan effective solution to compress the parameters of LLMs. Determining the\nimportance of each sub-module in LLMs and minimizing performance loss are\ncritical issues that need to be carefully addressed in structured pruning. In\nthis paper, we propose an effective and fast structured pruning method named\nSlimLLM for large language models. For channel and attention head pruning, we\nevaluate the importance based on the entire channel or head, rather than merely\naggregating the importance of individual elements within a sub-module. This\napproach enables a more holistic consideration of the interdependence among\nelements within the sub-module. In addition, we design a simple linear\nregression strategy for the output matrix to quickly recover performance.

Understanding the flow instabilities and\ntransitions within these dynamical systems is essential for predicting and\ncontrolling their unsteady behaviour. A classic example of time-dependent flow\nis the Stokes layer. To study the transition mechanism in this flow, we employ\nthe Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) to demonstrate that a linear energy\namplification mechanism may explain the intracyclic instability in the\ntransitional Stokes layer, supported by favourable comparisons with\nexperimental measurements of axial turbulence intensity. This complements\nexisting theories applied to the Stokes layer in the literature, including the\nFloquet analysis and the instantaneous/momentary analyses, which have struggled\nto capture this experimental observation accurately. The FTLE analysis is\nclosely related to the transient growth analysis, formulated as an optimisation\nproblem of the disturbance energy growth over time. We found that the energy\namplification weakens as the finite Stokes layer becomes more confined and the\noscillating frequency has a non-monotonic effect on the maximum transient\ngrowth. Based on these results, we recommend future experimental studies to\nvalidate this linear mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models have emerged as the next generation of\nmodels in robotics. However, despite leveraging powerful pre-trained\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), existing end-to-end VLA systems often lose key\ncapabilities during fine-tuning as the model adapts to specific robotic tasks.\nWe argue that a generalizable VLA model should retain and expand upon the VLM's\ncore competencies: 1) Open-world embodied reasoning - the VLA should inherit\nthe knowledge from VLM, i.e., recognize anything that the VLM can recognize, be\ncapable of solving math problems, and possess visual-spatial intelligence, 2)\nReasoning following - effectively translating the open-world reasoning into\nactionable steps for the robot. In this work, we introduce ChatVLA-2, a novel\nmixture-of-expert VLA model coupled with a specialized two-stage training\npipeline designed to preserve the VLM's original strengths while enabling\nactionable reasoning. To validate our approach, we design a math-matching task\nwherein a robot interprets math problems written on a whiteboard and picks\ncorresponding number cards from a table to solve equations. Remarkably, our\nmethod exhibits exceptional mathematical reasoning and OCR capabilities,\ndespite these abilities not being explicitly trained within the VLA.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the VLA possesses strong spatial reasoning\nskills, enabling it to interpret novel directional instructions involving\npreviously unseen objects. Overall, our method showcases reasoning and\ncomprehension abilities that significantly surpass state-of-the-art imitation\nlearning methods such as OpenVLA, DexVLA, and pi-zero. This work represents a\nsubstantial advancement toward developing truly generalizable robotic\nfoundation models endowed with robust reasoning capacities.",

However, this paper reveals that the population-based estimation\nmethod can only work on simple problems but falls short on problems with\nsubstantial bias. The biases in multi-objective optimization problems can be\ndivided into three categories, and an analysis is performed to illustrate how\neach category hinders the estimation of the ideal objective vector.\nSubsequently, a set of test instances is proposed to quantitatively evaluate\nthe impact of various biases on the ideal objective vector estimation method.\nBeyond that, a plug-and-play component called enhanced ideal objective vector\nestimation (EIE) is introduced for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms\n(MOEAs). EIE features adaptive and fine-grained searches over $m$ subproblems\ndefined by the extreme weighted sum method.

The spectral data of fish biomass is useful in fish production, as it\ncarries many important chemistry properties of fish meat.

To\nbetter analyze fish biomass spectral data, this paper models it as a symbolic\nregression problem and solves it by a linear genetic programming method with\nnewly proposed tunable primitives. In the symbolic regression problem, linear\ngenetic programming automatically synthesizes regression models based on the\ngiven primitives and training data. The tunable primitives further improve the\napproximation ability of the regression models by tuning their inherent\ncoefficients.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce SpeechVerifer to\nproactively verify speech integrity using only the published speech itself,\ni.e., without requiring any external references. Inspired by audio\nfingerprinting and watermarking, SpeechVerifier can (i) effectively detect\ntampering attacks, (ii) be robust to benign operations and (iii) verify the\nintegrity only based on published speeches. Briefly, SpeechVerifier utilizes\nmultiscale feature extraction to capture speech features across different\ntemporal resolutions.

We develop a\ntheoretical analysis showing that the stable rank of a quantized adapter is\ntightly linked to that of its full-precision counterpart, motivating the use of\nsuch rank-enhancing functions even under quantization. Our results demonstrate\nthat the expressivity gains from a sinusoidal non-linearity persist after\nquantization, yielding highly compressed adapters with negligible loss in\nperformance. We validate our approach across a range of fine-tuning tasks for\nlanguage, vision and text-to-image generation achieving significant memory\nsavings while maintaining competitive accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic MRI plays a vital role in clinical practice by capturing both spatial\ndetails and dynamic motion, but its high spatiotemporal resolution is often\nlimited by long scan times. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have shown\npromising performance in accelerating dynamic MRI. However, most existing\nalgorithms rely on large fully-sampled datasets for training, which are\ndifficult to acquire. Recently, implicit neural representation (INR) has\nemerged as a powerful scan-specific paradigm for accelerated MRI, which models\nsignals as a continuous function over spatiotemporal coordinates. Although this\napproach achieves efficient continuous modeling of dynamic images and robust\nreconstruction, it faces challenges in recovering fine details and increasing\ncomputational demands for high dimensional data representation. To enhance both\nefficiency and reconstruction quality, we propose TenF-INR, a novel patch-based\nunsupervised framework that employs INR to model bases of tensor decomposition,\nenabling efficient and accurate modeling of dynamic MR images with learnable\ntensor functions. By exploiting strong correlations in similar spatial image\npatches and in the temporal direction, TenF-INR enforces multidimensional\nlow-rankness and implements patch-based reconstruction with the benefits of\ncontinuous modeling. We compare TenF-INR with state-of-the-art methods,\nincluding supervised DL methods and unsupervised approaches. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that TenF-INR achieves high acceleration factors up to 21,\noutperforming all comparison methods in image quality, temporal fidelity, and\nquantitative metrics, even surpassing the supervised methods.",

Recently, it has been extended to diffusion\nmodels through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However,\nexisting approaches such as Diffusion-DPO suffer from two key challenges:\ntimestep-dependent instability, caused by a mismatch between the reverse and\nforward diffusion processes and by high gradient variance in early noisy\ntimesteps, and off-policy bias arising from the mismatch between optimization\nand data collection policies. We begin by analyzing the reverse diffusion\ntrajectory and observe that instability primarily occurs at early timesteps\nwith low importance weights. To address these issues, we first propose\nDPO-C\\&M, a practical strategy that improves stability by clipping and masking\nuninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Building on\nthis, we introduce SDPO (Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization), a\nprincipled framework that incorporates importance sampling into the objective\nto fully correct for off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during\nthe diffusion process. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B, CogVideoX-5B, and\nWan2.1-1.3B demonstrate that both methods outperform standard Diffusion-DPO,\nwith SDPO achieving superior VBench scores, human preference alignment, and\ntraining robustness.

To address these challenges, we propose Quantized\nTransition Diffusion (QTD), a novel approach that integrates data quantization\nwith discrete diffusion dynamics. Our method first transforms the continuous\ndata distribution $p_*$ into a discrete one $q_*$ via histogram approximation\nand binary encoding, enabling efficient representation in a structured discrete\nlatent space. We then design a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with Hamming\ndistance-based transitions as the forward process, which inherently supports\nlong-range movements in the original data space. For reverse-time sampling, we\nintroduce a \\textit{truncated uniformization} technique to simulate the reverse\nCTMC, which can provably provide unbiased generation from $q_*$ under minimal\nscore assumptions.

Recently, 3D reconstruction\nmethods have been used to create implicit neural representations of HSI scenes,\nwhich can help localize the target object's nutrient composition spatially and\nspectrally. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a cutting-edge implicit\nrepresentation that can render hyperspectral channel compositions of each\nspatial location from any viewing direction. However, it faces limitations in\ntraining time and rendering speed.

These\ntasks typically require multiple interactions with similar context. To reduce\nthe computation of repeated historical tokens, cross-request key-value (KV)\ncache reuse, a technique that stores and reuses intermediate computations, has\nbecome a crucial method in multi-round interactive services. However, in\ninfilling tasks, the KV cache reuse is often hindered by the structure of the\nprompt format, which typically consists of a prefix and suffix relative to the\ninsertion point. Specifically, the KV cache of the prefix or suffix part is\nfrequently invalidated as the other part (suffix or prefix) is incrementally\ngenerated. To address the issue, we propose EFIM, a transformed prompt format\nof FIM to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse. Although the\ntransformed prompt can solve the inefficiency, it exposes subtoken generation\nproblems in current LLMs, where they have difficulty generating partial words\naccurately. Therefore, we introduce a fragment tokenization training method\nwhich splits text into multiple fragments before tokenization during data\nprocessing. Experiments on two representative LLMs show that LLM serving with\nEFIM can lower the latency by 52% and improve the throughput by 98% while\nmaintaining the original infilling capability.

To make profits, prosumers equipped with\nphotovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively\nparticipate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in\nreal situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy\npower generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to\nmake optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical\nnetwork can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage\nviolations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first\nformulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally\nconstrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial\nphysical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified\nLyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately\nreformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing\nthe time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online\nmethods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for\nthe real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the\nprosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the\nreformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The\ntheoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online\ndistributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved\nby minimizing the performance gap.

Data-driven machine learning technology can\nsignificantly streamline the complex and time-consuming traditional manual\nprocess of discovering scientific laws, helping us gain insights into\nfundamental issues in modern science. In this work, we introduce a pre-trained\nsymbolic foundation regressor that can effectively compress complex data with\nnumerous interacting variables while producing interpretable physical\nrepresentations. Our model has been rigorously tested on non-network symbolic\nregression, symbolic regression on complex networks, and the inference of\nnetwork dynamics across various domains, including physics, biochemistry,\necology, and epidemiology. The results indicate a remarkable improvement in\nequation inference efficiency, being three times more effective than baseline\napproaches while maintaining accurate predictions. Furthermore, we apply our\nmodel to uncover more intuitive laws of interaction transmission from global\nepidemic outbreak data, achieving optimal data fitting. This model extends the\napplication boundary of pre-trained symbolic regression models to complex\nnetworks, and we believe it provides a foundational solution for revealing the\nhidden mechanisms behind changes in complex phenomena, enhancing\ninterpretability, and inspiring further scientific discoveries.",

Due to the lack of a coherent methodology for updating\nBN statistical parameters, standard BN degrades the federated learning\nperformance. To this end, it is urgent to explore an alternative normalisation\nsolution for federated learning. In this work, we resolve the dilemma of the BN\nlayer in federated learning by developing a customised normalisation approach,\nHybrid Batch Normalisation (HBN). HBN separates the update of statistical\nparameters (i.e. , means and variances used for evaluation) from that of\nlearnable parameters (i.e. , parameters that require gradient updates),\nobtaining unbiased estimates of global statistical parameters in distributed\nscenarios. In contrast with the existing solutions, we emphasise the supportive\npower of global statistics for federated learning. The HBN layer introduces a\nlearnable hybrid distribution factor, allowing each computing node to\nadaptively mix the statistical parameters of the current batch with the global\nstatistics. Our HBN can serve as a powerful plugin to advance federated\nlearning performance.

Moreover, the requirement for extensive camera trajectory\nannotations further increases resource demands. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce EPiC, an efficient and precise camera control learning framework\nthat automatically constructs high-quality anchor videos without expensive\ncamera trajectory annotations. Concretely, we create highly precise anchor\nvideos for training by masking source videos based on first-frame visibility.\nThis approach ensures high alignment, eliminates the need for camera trajectory\nannotations, and thus can be readily applied to any in-the-wild video to\ngenerate image-to-video (I2V) training pairs. Furthermore, we introduce\nAnchor-ControlNet, a lightweight conditioning module that integrates anchor\nvideo guidance in visible regions to pretrained VDMs, with less than 1% of\nbackbone model parameters. By combining the proposed anchor video data and\nControlNet module, EPiC achieves efficient training with substantially fewer\nparameters, training steps, and less data, without requiring modifications to\nthe diffusion model backbone typically needed to mitigate rendering\nmisalignments. Although being trained on masking-based anchor videos, our\nmethod generalizes robustly to anchor videos made with point clouds during\ninference, enabling precise 3D-informed camera control.

While Transformer-based\ndetectors have shown promising performance, their potential for SOD remains\nlargely unexplored. In typical DETR-like frameworks, the CNN backbone network,\nspecialized in aggregating local information, struggles to capture the\nnecessary contextual information for SOD. The multiple attention layers in the\nTransformer Encoder face difficulties in effectively attending to small objects\nand can also lead to blurring of features. Furthermore, the model's lower class\nprediction score of small objects compared to large objects further increases\nthe difficulty of SOD. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\napproach called Cross-DINO. This approach incorporates the deep MLP network to\naggregate initial feature representations with both short and long range\ninformation for SOD. Then, a new Cross Coding Twice Module (CCTM) is applied to\nintegrate these initial representations to the Transformer Encoder feature,\nenhancing the details of small objects. Additionally, we introduce a new kind\nof soft label named Category-Size (CS), integrating the Category and Size of\nobjects. By treating CS as new ground truth, we propose a new loss function\ncalled Boost Loss to improve the class prediction score of the model. Extensive\nexperimental results on COCO, WiderPerson, VisDrone, AI-TOD, and SODA-D\ndatasets demonstrate that Cross-DINO efficiently improves the performance of\nDETR-like models on SOD.

We used light curve\nmodelling, Doppler tomography, and MESA evolutionary models to study the\ncharacteristics of EI Psc.\n  Results: The system contains a relatively low temperature ($T_{\\rm eff} =\n6130\\,\\mathrm{K}$) white dwarf with mass of $M_{\\mathrm WD} =\n0.70(4)\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. The mass of the warm ($T_2 = 4440\\,\\mathrm{K}$)\nsecondary is $M_2 = 0.13\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. The inclination of the system is\n$i= 44.5\\deg(7)$.

The quiescence light\ncurve is double-humped and is formed by the combination of radiation from the\nRoche lobe filling the hot secondary and the hot spot. The radius of the outer\ndisc is about two times smaller than the tidal truncation radius.

In\nthis study, we introduce Hierarchical attention for Language-Image Pre-training\n(HLIP), a scalable pre-training framework for 3D medical imaging. HLIP adopts a\nlightweight hierarchical attention mechanism inspired by the natural hierarchy\nof radiology data: slice, scan, and study.

Moreover, the computational efficiency of HLIP enables\ndirect training on uncurated datasets. Trained on 220K patients with 3.13\nmillion scans for brain MRI and 240K patients with 1.44 million scans for head\nCT, HLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., +32.4% balanced ACC on\nthe proposed publicly available brain MRI benchmark Pub-Brain-5; +1.4% and\n+6.9% macro AUC on head CT benchmarks RSNA and CQ500, respectively.

By combining prompting steps, for extraction and\nrewriting, with principled techniques, for content selection, we consistently\nimprove source coverage on the DiverseSumm benchmark across various LLMs.\nFinally, we also show that by incorporating relevance to a provided user intent\ninto the DPP kernel, we can generate personalized summaries that cover relevant\nsource information while retaining coverage.",

However, its application is often limited by the\nrequirement for long radiofrequency (RF) pulse durations, which are constrained\nby RF hardware capabilities despite remaining within specific absorption rate\n(SAR) safety limits.\n  Methods: To address this challenge, we propose a novel method, MPF mapping\nusing pulsed spin-lock (MPF-PSL). MPF-PSL employs a pulsed spin-lock train with\nintermittent free precession periods, enabling extended total spin-lock\ndurations without exceeding hardware and specific absorption rate limits. A\ncomprehensive analytical framework was developed to model the magnetization\ndynamics of the two-pool MT system under pulsed spin-lock, demonstrating that\nMPF-PSL achieves MT-specific quantification while minimizing confounding\neffects from the water pool. The proposed method is validated with\nBloch-McConnell simulations, phantoms, and in vivo studies at 3T.\n  Results: Both Bloch-McConnell simulations and phantom validation demonstrated\nthat MPF-PSL exhibits robust insensitivity to water pool parameters while\nenabling high-SNR MPF quantification. In vivo validation studies confirmed the\nmethod's clinical utility in detecting collagen deposition in patients with\nliver fibrosis.\n  Conclusion: MPF-PSL presents a practical solution for quantitative MT\nimaging, with strong potential for clinical applications.",

However, existing safe RL paradigms inherently struggle to achieve\nthis objective. We propose a method, called Provably Lifetime Safe RL (PLS),\nthat integrates offline safe RL with safe policy deployment to address this\nchallenge. Our proposed method learns a policy offline using return-conditioned\nsupervised learning and then deploys the resulting policy while cautiously\noptimizing a limited set of parameters, known as target returns, using Gaussian\nprocesses (GPs). Theoretically, we justify the use of GPs by analyzing the\nmathematical relationship between target and actual returns. We then prove that\nPLS finds near-optimal target returns while guaranteeing safety with high\nprobability. Empirically, we demonstrate that PLS outperforms baselines both in\nsafety and reward performance, thereby achieving the longstanding goal to\nobtain high rewards while ensuring the safety of a policy throughout the\nlifetime from learning to operation.",

However, they are\ncomputationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a\ndiffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate\naction trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before\nany actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies\nby treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from\npure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last\naction. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow\nmatching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory.\nThis enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow\nsampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution.\nDespite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal\nbehavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to\nreduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming\nflow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution\nand tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

In this work, we begin by\nanalyzing the impact of adding varying amounts of noise.

This finding\nhighlights a critical opportunity for optimizing the efficiency of large-scale\nViTs by focusing on FFN layers. In this work, we propose a novel channel idle\nmechanism that facilitates post-training structural reparameterization for\nefficient FFN layers during testing. Specifically, a set of feature channels\nremains idle and bypasses the nonlinear activation function in each FFN layer,\nthereby forming a linear pathway that enables structural reparameterization\nduring inference. This mechanism results in a family of ReParameterizable\nVision Transformers (RePaViTs), which achieve remarkable latency reductions\nwith acceptable sacrifices (sometimes gains) in accuracy across various ViTs.\nThe benefits of our method scale consistently with model sizes, demonstrating\ngreater speed improvements and progressively narrowing accuracy gaps or even\nhigher accuracies on larger models.

However, an issue here is\nthat the steady-state HJB equation generally yields multiple solutions; hence\nif PINNs are directly employed to it, they may end up approximating a solution\nthat is different from the optimal value function of the problem. We tackle\nthis by instead applying PINNs to a finite-horizon variant of the steady-state\nHJB that has a unique solution, and which uniformly approximates the optimal\nvalue function as the horizon increases. An algorithm to verify if the chosen\nhorizon is large enough is also given, as well as a method to extend it -- with\nreduced computations and robustness to approximation errors -- in case it is\nnot. Unlike many existing methods, the proposed technique works well with\nnon-polynomial basis functions, does not require prior knowledge of a\nstabilizing controller, and does not perform iterative policy evaluations.\nSimulations are performed, which verify and clarify theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Online safe reinforcement learning (RL) plays a key role in dynamic\nenvironments, with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and\ncybersecurity. The objective is to learn optimal policies that maximize rewards\nwhile satisfying safety constraints modeled by constrained Markov decision\nprocesses (CMDPs). Existing methods achieve sublinear regret under stochastic\nconstraints but often fail in adversarial settings, where constraints are\nunknown, time-varying, and potentially adversarially designed. In this paper,\nwe propose the Optimistic Mirror Descent Primal-Dual (OMDPD) algorithm, the\nfirst to address online CMDPs with anytime adversarial constraints. OMDPD\nachieves optimal regret O(sqrt(K)) and strong constraint violation O(sqrt(K))\nwithout relying on Slater's condition or the existence of a strictly known safe\npolicy. We further show that access to accurate estimates of rewards and\ntransitions can further improve these bounds. Our results offer practical\nguarantees for safe decision-making in adversarial environments.",

    "abstract": "We study circular orbits and accretion structures around symmetric wormholes.\nAs exemplary solutions we choose three different wormhole spacetimes, namely\nrotating traversable wormholes from the Teo class, the rotating Simpson-Visser\nmetric with the parameter spectrum corresponding to wormholes and a static\nwormhole from beyond Horndeski theories. We show the existence of a spectrum of\ncircular orbits at the wormhole throat for each of these wormhole solutions and\nanalyze the boundaries of this spectrum across the respective wormhole\nparameter range. For each of the solutions we identified that vast regions of\nthe parameter space correspond to stable orbits. The presence of this orbit\nspectrum can be linked through accretion disk models to matter accumulations\nwhich may form at the throat. We present here examples of such disk solutions\nby implementing the Polish Doughnut model. In some cases, these matter\naccumulations are encapsulating the throat and could imply central bright\nregions of the wormhole spacetime. Furthermore, the combined analysis of the\nequatorial Keplerian orbits and the throat orbits, leads to a set of different\ndisk configurations, where matter accumulations at the throat may be present\nwith outer tori around them, in some cases also as a connected structure. Our\nresults may hint to possible instabilities of wormholes, especially if they\nhave an ergoregion. Moreover, wormholes with such disks, may appear more\nstar-like when it comes to their observational signature, due to the\ncentralized and more spherical emission profile associated with the possible\nmatter accumulations at the throat.",

The ratio of specific heats is assumed\nto be the same in the shocked ambient medium and the shocked wind. Numerical\nresults are presented for one selected ratio of wind density to ambient\ndensity. Exact ODEs are written for the compressed wind region and approximate\nsolutions are found by fitting the ODE solutions. By analyzing the interactions\nbetween stellar winds and ambient media in the strong compression limit, we\nmodel the formation and evolution of spherical bubbles, highlighting their\nshock fronts and contact discontinuities. Our analytic method provides an\nintuitive approach to calculating the thickness of bubble shells, which is\ncrucial for understanding their dynamics and observational characteristics. A\nnumerical method explores conditions without explicitly requiring the strong\ncompression limit, and then we compare numerical to analytical results under\nvarious conditions.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the robust output regulation problem of second-order\nnonlinear uncertain systems with an unknown exosystem. Instead of the adaptive\ncontrol approach, this paper resorts to a robust control methodology to solve\nthe problem and thus avoid the bursting phenomenon. In particular, this paper\nconstructs generic internal models for the steady-state state and input\nvariables of the system. By introducing a coordinate transformation, this paper\nconverts the robust output regulation problem into a nonadaptive stabilization\nproblem of an augmented system composed of the second-order nonlinear uncertain\nsystem and the generic internal models. Then, we design the stabilization\ncontrol law and construct a strict Lyapunov function that guarantees the\nrobustness with respect to unmodeled disturbances. The analysis shows that the\noutput zeroing manifold of the augmented system can be made attractive by the\nproposed nonadaptive control law, which solves the robust output regulation\nproblem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed nonadaptive\ninternal model approach by its application to the control of the Duffing\nsystem.",

    "abstract": "Motion generation is a cornerstone of computer graphics, animation, gaming,\nand robotics, enabling the creation of realistic and varied character\nmovements. A significant limitation of existing methods is their reliance on\nspecific skeletal structures, which restricts their versatility across\ndifferent characters. To overcome this, we introduce UniMoGen, a novel\nUNet-based diffusion model designed for skeleton-agnostic motion generation.\nUniMoGen can be trained on motion data from diverse characters, such as humans\nand animals, without the need for a predefined maximum number of joints. By\ndynamically processing only the necessary joints for each character, our model\nachieves both skeleton agnosticism and computational efficiency. Key features\nof UniMoGen include controllability via style and trajectory inputs, and the\nability to continue motions from past frames. We demonstrate UniMoGen's\neffectiveness on the 100style dataset, where it outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in diverse character motion generation. Furthermore, when trained on\nboth the 100style and LAFAN1 datasets, which use different skeletons, UniMoGen\nachieves high performance and improved efficiency across both skeletons. These\nresults highlight UniMoGen's potential to advance motion generation by\nproviding a flexible, efficient, and controllable solution for a wide range of\ncharacter animations.",
