    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Remote Sensing (RS) for Change Detection (CD) and\nChange Captioning (CC) have seen substantial success by adopting deep learning\ntechniques. Despite these advances, existing methods often handle CD and CC\ntasks independently, leading to inefficiencies from the absence of synergistic\nprocessing. In this paper, we present ChangeMinds, a novel unified multi-task\nframework that concurrently optimizes CD and CC processes within a single,\nend-to-end model. We propose the change-aware long short-term memory module\n(ChangeLSTM) to effectively capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics from\nextracted bi-temporal deep features, enabling the generation of universal\nchange-aware representations that effectively serve both CC and CD tasks.\nFurthermore, we introduce a multi-task predictor with a cross-attention\nmechanism that enhances the interaction between image and text features,\npromoting efficient simultaneous learning and processing for both tasks.\nExtensive evaluations on the LEVIR-MCI dataset, alongside other standard\nbenchmarks, show that ChangeMinds surpasses existing methods in multi-task\nlearning settings and markedly improves performance in individual CD and CC\ntasks. Codes and pre-trained models will be available online.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection is a crucial step in machine learning, especially for\nhigh-dimensional datasets, where irrelevant and redundant features can degrade\nmodel performance and increase computational costs. This paper proposes a novel\nlarge-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on the search space\nshrinking, termed LMSSS, to tackle the challenges of feature selection\nparticularly as a sparse optimization problem. The method includes a shrinking\nscheme to reduce dimensionality of the search space by eliminating irrelevant\nfeatures before the main evolutionary process. This is achieved through a\nranking-based filtering method that evaluates features based on their\ncorrelation with class labels and frequency in an initial, cost-effective\nevolutionary process. Additionally, a smart crossover scheme based on voting\nbetween parent solutions is introduced, giving higher weight to the parent with\nbetter classification accuracy. An intelligent mutation process is also\ndesigned to target features prematurely excluded from the population, ensuring\nthey are evaluated in combination with other features. These integrated\ntechniques allow the evolutionary process to explore the search space more\nefficiently and effectively, addressing the sparse and high-dimensional nature\nof large-scale feature selection problems. The effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on 15 large-scale\ndatasets, showcasing its potential to identify more accurate feature subsets\ncompared to state-of-the-art large-scale feature selection algorithms.

These concepts\nhelp reveal structures and behaviors in sequential data for better\ndecision-making and forecasting. However, existing models often struggle to\ndetect and track concept drift due to limitations in interpretability and\nadaptability. To address this challenge, inspired by the flexibility of the\nrecent Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we propose WormKAN, a concept-aware\nKAN-based model to address concept drift in co-evolving time series. WormKAN\nconsists of three key components: Patch Normalization, Temporal Representation\nModule, and Concept Dynamics. Patch normalization processes co-evolving time\nseries into patches, treating them as fundamental modeling units to capture\nlocal dependencies while ensuring consistent scaling. The temporal\nrepresentation module learns robust latent representations by leveraging a\nKAN-based autoencoder, complemented by a smoothness constraint, to uncover\ninter-patch correlations. Concept dynamics identifies and tracks dynamic\ntransitions, revealing structural shifts in the time series through concept\nidentification and drift detection. These transitions, akin to passing through\na \\textit{wormhole}, are identified by abrupt changes in the latent space.\nExperiments show that KAN and KAN-based models (WormKAN) effectively segment\ntime series into meaningful concepts, enhancing the identification and tracking\nof concept drift.",

The key idea of GALA is to exploit both\nthe global sparsity of surfaces within a 3D volume and their local surface\nproperties. Sparsity is promoted by covering only the 3D object boundaries, not\nempty space, with an ensemble of tree root voxels. Each voxel contains an\noctree to further limit storage and compute to regions that contain surfaces.\nAdaptivity is achieved by fitting one local and geometry-aware coordinate frame\nin each non-empty leaf node. Adjusting the orientation of the local grid, as\nwell as the anisotropic scales of its axes, to the local surface shape greatly\nincreases the amount of detail that can be stored in a given amount of memory,\nwhich in turn allows for quantization without loss of quality. With our\noptimized C++/CUDA implementation, GALA can be fitted to an object in less than\n10 seconds.

    "abstract": "We address the challenge of representing long captions in vision-language\nmodels, such as CLIP. By design these models are limited by fixed, absolute\npositional encodings, restricting inputs to a maximum of 77 tokens and\nhindering performance on tasks requiring longer descriptions. Although recent\nwork has attempted to overcome this limit, their proposed approaches struggle\nto model token relationships over longer distances and simply extend to a fixed\nnew token length. Instead, we propose a generalizable method, named TULIP, able\nto upgrade the token length to any length for CLIP-like models. We do so by\nimproving the architecture with relative position encodings, followed by a\ntraining procedure that (i) distills the original CLIP text encoder into an\nencoder with relative position encodings and (ii) enhances the model for\naligning longer captions with images. By effectively encoding captions longer\nthan the default 77 tokens, our model outperforms baselines on cross-modal\ntasks such as retrieval and text-to-image generation.

One recognized approach is the conic scalarization method in vector\noptimization in real normed spaces proposed by Kasimbeyli (2010, SIAM J Optim\n20), which is based on augmented dual cones and Bishop-Phelps type\n(norm-linear) scalarizing functions. In this paper, we present new results on\ncone separation in real topological-linear spaces by using Bishop-Phelps type\nseparating cones / separating seminorm-linear functions. Moreover, we study\nsome extensions of known scalarization results in vector optimization (in the\nsense of Eichfelder; Gerstewitz; Jahn; Kasimbeyli; Pascoletti and Serafini). On\nthis basis, we propose a Bishop-Phelps type scalarization method for vector\noptimization problems in real topological-linear spaces, which is based on\nBishop-Phelps type cone representing and cone monotone scalarizing functions\n(e.g., Gerstewitz scalarizing functions or seminorm-linear scalarizing\nfunctions). Thus, our method also extends Kasimbeyli's conic scalarization\nmethod from real normed spaces to real topological-linear spaces.

Compared to previous\nworks, our results improve upon the shortcomings of the well-established\nRademacher complexity-based bounds. Importantly, the bounds we derive in this\npaper are tighter, hold even for neural networks of small width, do not scale\nunfavorably with width, are algorithm-dependent, and consequently capture the\nrole of initialization on the sample complexity of gradient descent for deep\nnets. Specialized to noiseless data separable with margin $\\gamma$ by neural\ntangent kernel (NTK) features of a network of width\n$\\Omega(\\text{poly}(\\log(n)))$, we show the test-error rate to be\n$e^{O(L)}/{\\gamma^2 n}$, where $n$ is the training set size and $L$ denotes the\nnumber of hidden layers.

We take on the challenge of explaining the\nremarkable physics of multilayer cuprates by focusing on the two representative\nCa$_{(1+n)}$Cu$_{n}$O$_{2n}$Cl$_2$ and HgBa$_2$Ca$_{(n-1)}$Cu$_n$O$_{(2n+2)}$\nfamilies. We shed light on the microscopic origin of many salient features of\nmultilayer cuprates, in particular the $n$-dependence of their superconducting\nproperties. The maximum of $T_c$ for the tri-layer compounds is explained by an\nintertwined analysis of the charge-transfer gap, superexchange $J$, and\ninhomogeneous doping between the CuO$_{2}$ planes. We highlight the existence\nof a minimal doping (4\\%) required for superconductivity to emerge.

In this work, we report new constraints on both FXTs, based\non recent JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry, as well as NIRspec spectroscopy for\nCDF-S XT2 that allow us to improve our understanding of their distances,\nenergetics, and host galaxy properties compared to the pre-JWST era. We use the\navailable HST and JWST archival data to determine the host properties and\nconstrain the energetics of each FXT based on spectral energy distribution\n(SED) photometric fitting. The host of CDF-S XT1 is now constrained to lie at\n$z$=2.76, implying a host absolute magnitude $M_R=-19.14$~mag, stellar mass\n$M_{*}=$1.8e8~$M_\\odot$, and star formation rate SFR$=0.62 M_\\odot$/yr. These\nproperties lie at the upper end of previous estimates, leaving CDF-S XT1 with a\npeak X-ray luminosity of 2.8e47 erg/s. We argue that the best progenitor\nscenario for XT1 is a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (GRB), although we do not\nfully rule out a proto-magnetar association or a jetted tidal disruption event\ninvolving a white dwarf and an intermediate-massive black hole. In the case of\nCDF-S XT2, JWST imaging reveals a new highly obscured component of the host\ngalaxy, previously missed in HST images, while NIRspec spectroscopy securely\nplaces the host at $z$=3.4598. The new redshift implies a host with\n$M_R=-21.76$~mag, $M_*=5.5e10 M_\\odot$, SFR=160~$M_\\odot$/yr, and FXT\n$L_{X,peak}=1.4e47$~erg/s. The revised energetics, similarity to X-ray flash\nevent light curves, small host offset, and high host SFR favor a low-luminosity\ncollapsar progenitor for CDF-S XT2. Although a magnetar model is not ruled out,\nit appears improbable. While these HST and JWST observations shed light on the\nhost galaxies of XT1 and XT2, and by extension, on the nature of FXTs, a unique\nexplanation for both sources remains elusive.",

    "abstract": "Digitalization efforts often face a key challenge: business processes must\nnot only be efficient in achieving their goals but also adhere to legal\nregulations. Business process compliance refers to aligning processes with\nthese regulations. Numerous frameworks have been developed to address this,\nwith the earliest dating back to 1981. This study focuses on rigorous\nframeworks using formal methods to verify or ensure compliance. We conducted a\nsystematic literature review (SLR) on process compliance frameworks based on\nformal models. Our goal was to assess the current state of research on process\nmodel compliance and identify gaps and opportunities for future work. Starting\nwith 5018 candidate studies from 1981 to the establishment of GDPR, we selected\n46 primary studies. These frameworks were categorized by their phases, the\nlanguages used for processes and compliance, and their reasoning techniques. We\nalso examined their practical applicability, the case studies they were tested\non, the types of users involved, and the skills needed for compliance. Also, we\nassessed the maturity of each framework. Our findings reveal strong consensus\naround verification techniques as central to process compliance, though there\nis less agreement on the earlier and later phases of compliance. Model checking\nis the dominant technique, but the compliance and process languages have\nevolved. Most frameworks are still conceptual with prototype implementations,\noften failing to account for compliance professionals like legal experts or law\nchanges. In conclusion, there is a need for comprehensive empirical studies to\nbetter understand the anatomy and maturity of regulatory compliance frameworks,\nand for robust evaluation methods to benchmark these frameworks. This review\noffers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in process\ncompliance.",

Existing approaches, typically based on diffusion\nmodels, often produce results lacking realism and fidelity. In this work, we\nintroduce InterMask, a novel framework for generating human interactions using\ncollaborative masked modeling in discrete space. InterMask first employs a\nVQ-VAE to transform each motion sequence into a 2D discrete motion token map.\nUnlike traditional 1D VQ token maps, it better preserves fine-grained\nspatio-temporal details and promotes spatial awareness within each token.\nBuilding on this representation, InterMask utilizes a generative masked\nmodeling framework to collaboratively model the tokens of two interacting\nindividuals. This is achieved by employing a transformer architecture\nspecifically designed to capture complex spatio-temporal inter-dependencies.\nDuring training, it randomly masks the motion tokens of both individuals and\nlearns to predict them. For inference, starting from fully masked sequences, it\nprogressively fills in the tokens for both individuals. With its enhanced\nmotion representation, dedicated architecture, and effective learning strategy,\nInterMask achieves state-of-the-art results, producing high-fidelity and\ndiverse human interactions. It outperforms previous methods, achieving an FID\nof $5.154$ (vs $5.535$ of in2IN) on the InterHuman dataset and $0.399$ (vs\n$5.207$ of InterGen) on the InterX dataset.

We present SmoothSegNet, a novel deep\nlearning framework that addresses these challenges with the three key designs:\n(1) A novel knowledge-informed label smoothing technique that distills\nknowledge from clinical data to generate smooth labels, which are used to\nregularize model training, reducing the overfitting risk and enhancing model\nperformance; (2) A global and local segmentation framework that breaks down the\nmain task into two simpler sub-tasks, allowing optimized preprocessing and\ntraining for each; and (3) Pre- and post-processing pipelines customized to the\nchallenges of each subtask aimed to enhance tumor visibility and refines tumor\nboundaries. We apply the proposed model on a challenging HCC-TACE-Seg dataset\nand show that SmoothSegNet outperformed various benchmarks in segmentation\nperformance, particularly at smaller tumors (<10cm). Our ablation studies show\nthat the three design components complementarily contribute to the model\nimproved performance.

    "abstract": "In the partially ionized material of stellar interiors, the strongest forces\nacting on electrons and ions are the Coulomb interactions between charges. The\ndynamics of the plasma as a whole depend on the magnitudes of the average\nelectrostatic interactions and the average kinetic energies of the particles\nthat constitute the stellar material. An important question is how these\ninteractions of real gases are related to the observable stellar properties.\nSpecifically, the relationships between rotation, magnetic activity, and the\nthermodynamic properties of stellar interiors are still not well understood.\n  In this study, we investigate the electrostatic effects within the interiors\nof low-mass main sequence (MS) stars. Specifically, we introduce a global\nquantity, a global plasma parameter, which allows us to compare the importance\nof electrostatic interactions across a range of low-mass theoretical models\n($0.7 - 1.4 \\, M_\\odot$) with varying ages and metallicities. We then correlate\nthe electrostatic properties of the theoretical models with the observable\nrotational trends on the MS. We use the open-source 1D stellar evolution code\nMESA to compute a grid of main-sequence stellar models. Our models span the\n$\\log g - T_{\\text{eff}}$ space of a set of 66 Kepler main-sequence stars.\n  We identify a correlation between the prominence of electrostatic effects in\nstellar interiors and stellar rotation rates. The variations in the magnitude\nof electrostatic interactions with age and metallicity further suggest that\nunderstanding the underlying physics of the collective effects of plasma can\nclarify key observational trends related to the rotation of low-mass stars on\nthe MS. These results may also advance our understanding of the physics behind\nthe observed weakened magnetic braking in stars.",

Traditionally, the principle\nrequires that the number of valid equations (TOA measurements) must be equal to\nor greater than the number of unknown variables (sensor and source locations).\nState-of-the-art literature suggests that the minimum numbers of sensors and\nsources needed for localization are four to six and six to four, respectively.\nHowever, these stringent configurations limit the application of JSSL in\nscenarios with an insufficient number of sensors and sources. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a numerical method that reduces the required number of\nsensors and sources, enabling more flexible JSSL configurations. First, we\nformulate the JSSL task as a series of triangles and apply the law of cosines\nto determine four unknown distances associated with one pair of sensors and\nthree pairs of sources. Next, by utilizing triangle inequalities, we establish\nthe lower and upper boundaries for these unknowns based on the known TOA\nmeasurements. The numerical method then searches within these boundaries to\nfind the global optimal solutions, demonstrating that JSSL in 3D space is\nachievable with only four sensors and four sources, thus significantly relaxing\nthe minimal configuration requirements. Theoretical proofs and simulation\nresults confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The model consists of four independent compartments: individuals who\nare not at risk of committing a crime, individuals at risk of committing a\ncrime, individuals committing a crime, and individuals convicted and jailed for\na crime. The model is analyzed using the basic reproduction number. The\nanalysis shows the system has a locally asymptotically stable crime-free\nequilibrium when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The model\nexhibits a backward bifurcation in which two endemic equilibria coexist with\nthe crime-free equilibrium. When the basic reproduction number exceeds unity,\nthe system has a locally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium, and the\ncrime-free becomes unstable. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify\nthe analytical results. The sensitivity analysis shows that the relapse rate\nhighly influences the basic reproduction number of our model.

In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for\ndetermining the position of an emitter transmitting an unknown signal in a\ndense multipath environment with a given power-delay profile.

The optimization\nproblem is non-convex and has no known analytical solutions, which makes it\ncomputationally infeasible for multidimensional brute-force search. To address\nthis challenge, we developed a practical optimization algorithm that overcomes\nthe computational complexity, using reasonable approximations, that provides a\nfeasible position estimator.

    "abstract": "Large language models have driven significant progress in natural language\nprocessing, but their deployment requires substantial compute and memory\nresources. As models scale, compression techniques become essential for\nbalancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning,\nwhich removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy\nfor reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant\nquality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To\nrecover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it\ncan lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data\ndistribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT\nis essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we utilize\nself-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach\nleverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that\npreserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by\nmaintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate that self-data distillation consistently outperforms standard SFT,\nimproving average accuracy by up to 8% on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard\nv1. Specifically, when pruning six decoder blocks on Llama3.1-8B Instruct\n(i.e., 32 to 26 layers, reducing the model size from 8.03B to 6.72B\nparameters), our method retains 91.2% of the original model's accuracy compared\nto 81.7% with SFT, while reducing real-world FLOPs by 16.3%. Furthermore,\ncombining self-data distilled models through model merging yields enhanced\nquality retention. Additionally, leveraging these pruned models in speculative\ndecoding increases token acceptance rates, thereby improving inference\nefficiency in applied settings.",

Our results reveal that photochemical hazes can\nbe produced at high enough mass fluxes in the atmosphere of GJ1214 b to explain\nboth type of observations. These hazes have a drastic impact on the atmospheric\nthermal structure, which has further ramifications on the emitted radiation of\nthe planet, as well as, its Bond albedo. Clouds of KCL, NaCL and ZnS\ncomposition also form in this atmosphere but their opacity is too small to\nexplain the observed flatness of the transit spectrum. We find that\nmetallicities in the range 2000-3000x solar provide atmospheric structures that\nare closest to the observations for haze mass fluxes in the range of\n(1-3)x1E-11 g cm-2 s-1.

Despite improved data efficiency, it\nremains challenging to train MBRL agents with generalizable perception.\nTraining in the presence of visual distractions is particularly difficult due\nto the high variation they introduce to representation learning. Building on\nDREAMER, a popular MBRL method, we propose a simple yet effective auxiliary\ntask to facilitate representation learning in distracting environments. Under\nthe assumption that task-relevant components of image observations are\nstraightforward to identify with prior knowledge in a given task, we use a\nsegmentation mask on image observations to only reconstruct task-relevant\ncomponents. In doing so, we greatly reduce the complexity of representation\nlearning by removing the need to encode task-irrelevant objects in the latent\nrepresentation. Our method, Segmentation Dreamer (SD), can be used either with\nground-truth masks easily accessible in simulation or by leveraging potentially\nimperfect segmentation foundation models. The latter is further improved by\nselectively applying the reconstruction loss to avoid providing misleading\nlearning signals due to mask prediction errors. In modified DeepMind Control\nsuite (DMC) and Meta-World tasks with added visual distractions, SD achieves\nsignificantly better sample efficiency and greater final performance than prior\nwork. We find that SD is especially helpful in sparse reward tasks otherwise\nunsolvable by prior work, enabling the training of visually robust agents\nwithout the need for extensive reward engineering.",

We introduce a model for\nthe production of NIR and X-ray flares from an active region in Sgr A$^\\star$,\nwhere particle acceleration takes place intermittently. In contrast to other\nradiation models for Sgr A$^\\star$ flares, the particle acceleration is not\nassumed to be instantaneous. We studied the evolution of the particle\ndistribution and the emitted electromagnetic radiation from the flaring region\nby numerically solving the kinetic equations for electrons and photons. Our\ncalculations took the finite duration of particle acceleration, radiative\nenergy losses, and physical escape from the flaring region into account. To\ngain better insight into the relation of the model parameters, we complemented\nour numerical study with analytical calculations. Flares are produced when the\nacceleration episode has a finite duration. The rising part in the light curve\nof a flare is related to the particle acceleration timescale, while the decay\nis controlled by the cooling or escape timescale of particles. Bright X-ray\nflares, such as the one observed in 2014, have $\\gamma$-ray counterparts that\nmight be detected by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. Our model for\nNIR and X-ray flares favors an interpretation of diffusive nonresonant particle\nacceleration in magnetized turbulence. If direct acceleration by the\nreconnection electric field in macroscopic current sheets causes the\nenergization of particles during flares in Sgr A$^\\star$, then models\nconsidering the injection of preaccelerated particles into a blob where\nparticles cool and/or escape would be appropriate to describe the flare.",

The algorithm\nb-suitor [Khan et al., SISC2016] is able to compute a (1/2)-approximation of a\nmaximum weight b-matching in O(|E|) time.

Learning-based techniques are regarded as a promising\napproach for addressing such a nonconvex optimization problem. By taking the\ntopology of cell-free MIMO systems into consideration, we propose a\nheterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), namely SACGNN, for ISAC beamforming\ndesign. The proposed SACGNN framework models the cell-free MIMO system for\ncooperative ISAC as a heterogeneous graph and employs a transformer-based\nheterogeneous message passing scheme to capture the important information of\nsensing and communication channels and propagate the information through the\ngraph network. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gain of the\nproposed SACGNN framework over a conventional null-space projection based\nscheme and a deep neural network (DNN)-based baseline scheme.",

    "abstract": "Hallucination, a phenomenon where multimodal large language models~(MLLMs)\ntend to generate textual responses that are plausible but unaligned with the\nimage, has become one major hurdle in various MLLM-related applications.\nSeveral benchmarks have been created to gauge the hallucination levels of\nMLLMs, by either raising discriminative questions about the existence of\nobjects or introducing LLM evaluators to score the generated text from MLLMs.\nHowever, the discriminative data largely involve simple questions that are not\naligned with real-world text, while the generative data involve LLM evaluators\nthat are computationally intensive and unstable due to their inherent\nrandomness. We propose LongHalQA, an LLM-free hallucination benchmark that\ncomprises 6K long and complex hallucination text. LongHalQA is featured by\nGPT4V-generated hallucinatory data that are well aligned with real-world\nscenarios, including object/image descriptions and multi-round conversations\nwith 14/130 words and 189 words, respectively, on average. It introduces two\nnew tasks, hallucination discrimination and hallucination completion, unifying\nboth discriminative and generative evaluations in a single\nmultiple-choice-question form and leading to more reliable and efficient\nevaluations without the need for LLM evaluators. Further, we propose an\nadvanced pipeline that greatly facilitates the construction of future\nhallucination benchmarks with long and complex questions and descriptions.\nExtensive experiments over multiple recent MLLMs reveal various new challenges\nwhen they are handling hallucinations with long and complex textual data.\nDataset and evaluation code are available at\nhttps://github.com/hanqiu-hq/LongHalQA.",

While\nsignificant strides have been made, particularly in areas like computer vision,\nthe progress of AI algorithms appears to have outpaced hardware development, as\nspecialized hardware struggles to keep up with the ever-expanding algorithmic\nlandscape. To address this gap, we propose a new accelerator architecture,\ncalled messaging-based intelligent processing unit (m-IPU), capable of runtime\nconfiguration to cater to various AI tasks. Central to this hardware is a\nprogrammable interconnection mechanism, relying on message passing between\ncompute elements termed Sites. While the messaging between compute elements is\na known concept for Network-on-Chip or multi-core architectures, our hardware\ncan be categorized as a new class of coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture\n(CGRA), specially optimized for AI workloads. In this paper, we highlight\nm-IPU's fundamental advantages for machine learning applications. We illustrate\nthe efficacy through implementations of a neural network, matrix\nmultiplications, and convolution operations, showcasing lower latency compared\nto the state-of-the-art. Our simulation-based experiments, conducted on the\nTSMC 28nm technology node, reveal minimal power consumption of 44.5 mW with\n94,200 cells utilization. For 3D convolution operations on (32 x 128) images,\neach (256 x 256), using a (3 x 3) filter and 4,096 Sites at a frequency of 100\nMHz, m-IPU achieves processing in just 503.3 milliseconds.

However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and\ninstrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain\ntone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a\nheterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural\nrepresentations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled\nLearning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that\ndisentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from\nintracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we\ncollected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants\nreading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all\nMandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a\nunified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional\nheterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that\nH2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural\nrepresentation learning.",

    "abstract": "Privacy regulations like the GDPR in Europe and the CCPA in the US allow\nusers the right to remove their data ML applications. Machine unlearning\naddresses this by modifying the ML parameters in order to forget the influence\nof a specific data point on its weights. Recent literature has highlighted that\nthe contribution from data point(s) can be forged with some other data points\nin the dataset with probability close to one. This allows a server to falsely\nclaim unlearning without actually modifying the model's parameters. However, in\ndistributed paradigms such as FL, where the server lacks access to the dataset\nand the number of clients are limited, claiming unlearning in such cases\nbecomes a challenge. This paper introduces an efficient way to achieve\nfederated unlearning, by employing a privacy model which allows the FL server\nto plausibly deny the client's participation in the training up to a certain\nextent. We demonstrate that the server can generate a Proof-of-Deniability,\nwhere each aggregated update can be associated with at least x number of client\nupdates. This enables the server to plausibly deny a client's participation.\nHowever, in the event of frequent unlearning requests, the server is required\nto adopt an unlearning strategy and, accordingly, update its model parameters.\nWe also perturb the client updates in a cluster in order to avoid inference\nfrom an honest but curious server. We show that the global model satisfies\ndifferential privacy after T number of communication rounds. The proposed\nmethodology has been evaluated on multiple datasets in different privacy\nsettings. The experimental results show that our framework achieves comparable\nutility while providing a significant reduction in terms of memory (30 times),\nas well as retraining time (1.6-500769 times).

In an epoxy impregnated REBCO magnet, thermal strain alone\ncould delaminate the conductor. Even for dry wound REBCO coil, a conductor with\nvery low delamination strength is still a concern. Therefore, it is important\nto characterize the delamination strength of the conductor. In the past decade,\nsignificant progresses have been made in the characterization of REBCO\ndelamination strength. Among several developed characterization methods, the 90\ndegree peel test is simple to setup and seems to offer reproducible results.\nTherefore, this test could be used as a reliable method to characterize the\nrelative delamination strength of REBCO tapes for quality control purposes.\nThis paper presents our development of 90 degree peel test method for quality\nassurance test of the 40 T all-superconducting magnet project at the National\nHigh Magnetic Field Laboratory. We investigated the factors that influence the\ntest results, such as thickness and RRR of the copper layer. We found that peel\nstrength increases with decreasing Cu thickness.

However, sampling from the\nresulting denoising posterior distributions remains a challenge as it involves\nintractable terms. To tackle this issue, state-of-the-art approaches formulate\nthe problem as that of sampling from a surrogate diffusion model targeting the\nposterior and decompose its scores into two terms: the prior score and an\nintractable guidance term. While the former is replaced by the pre-trained\nscore of the considered diffusion model, the guidance term has to be estimated.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilises a decomposition of the\ntransitions which, in contrast to previous methods, allows a trade-off between\nthe complexity of the intractable guidance term and that of the prior\ntransitions. We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on\nlinear and nonlinear inverse problems, including challenging cases with latent\ndiffusion models as priors.

Prior evaluations do not properly distinguish between\ncorrect and incorrect merges, are not evaluated on a realistic set of merge\nscenarios, and/or do not compare to state-of-the-art tools. We have performed a\nmore realistic evaluation. The results differ significantly from previous\nclaims, setting the record straight and enabling better future research. Our\nnovel experimental methodology combines running test suites, examining merges\non deleted branches, and accounting for the cost of incorrect merges.\n  Based on these evaluations, we created a merge tool that out-performs all\nprevious tools under most assumptions. It handles the most common merge\nscenarios in practice.",

The problem is NP-hard and UGC-hard to\napproximate within any constant even when r=|R|=2, so we focus on parameterized\napproximability with solution size as the parameter. For a large class of\ninfinite rings R called Euclidean domains, Dabrowski et al. [SODA-2023]\nobtained an FPT-algorithm for MIN-2-LIN(R) using an LP-based approach based on\nwork by Wahlstr\\\"om [SODA-2017]. Here, we consider MIN-r-LIN(R) for finite\ncommutative rings R, initiating a line of research with the ultimate goal of\nproving dichotomy theorems that separate problems that are FPT-approximable\nwithin a constant from those that are not. A major motivation is that our\nproject is a promising step for more ambitious classification projects\nconcerning finite-domain MinCSP and VCSP.\n  Dabrowski et al.'s algorithm is limited to rings without zero divisors, which\nare only fields among finite commutative rings. Handling zero divisors seems to\nbe an insurmountable obstacle for the LP-based approach. In response, we\ndevelop a constant-factor FPT-approximation algorithm for a large class of\nfinite commutative rings, called Bergen rings, and thus prove approximability\nfor chain rings, principal ideal rings, and Z_m for all m>1. We complement the\nalgorithmic result with powerful lower bounds. For r>2, we show that the\nproblem is not FPT-approximable within any constant (unless FPT=W[1]). We\nidentify the class of non-Helly rings for which MIN-2-LIN(R) is not\nFPT-approximable. Under ETH, we also rule out (2-e)-approximation for every e>0\nfor non-lineal rings, which includes e.g. rings Z_{pq} where p and q are\ndistinct primes. Towards closing the gaps between upper and lower bounds, we\nlay the foundation of a geometric approach for analysing rings.",

This\nsystem is composed of 56 narrow-band filters that provide an spectral\nresolution comparable to low-resolution spectroscopy. We study the effect of\nenvironment using two approaches. First, we study the spatially resolved\ngalaxies from miniJPAS. Secondly, we studied the galaxy population in the most\nmassive galaxy cluster detected in the miniJPAS footprint, that is, the cluster\nmJPC2470-1771. We have developed a tool that automatises all the required\nprocesses for the analysis of the data. After probing the accuracy and\nreliability of the photmetry obtained with our tool, we apply it to a miniJPAS\nsample of spatially resolved galaxies, divided into four sub-samples according\nto their spectral-type (red/quiescent and blue/star forming), and environment\n(field or galaxy group). We find that redder, denser regions are usually older,\nmore metal rich, and show lower values of the intensity of the star formation\nrate and the specific star formation rate than bluer and less dense regions.\nRegarding the mJPC2470-1771 cluster, our results point that more massive,\nredder and older galaxies typically populate the inner regions of the cluster.\nAs a conclusion, our results suggest that galaxies in clusters are formed at a\nsimilar epoch, but have experienced different star formation histories. We\nconclude that the environment plays a role on galaxy evolution, but it is\nmainly reflected through the galaxy populations found in high density\nenvironments, such as galaxy clusters and groups, where the fraction of red,\nquiescent galaxies is larger in comparison to the field.",

Motion plans must be safe to ensure that the\nrobot does not harm humans or damage any nearby objects. Generating these\nmotion plans in real-time is also important to ensure that the robot can adapt\nto sudden changes in its environment. Many trajectory optimization methods\nintroduce heuristics that balance safety and real-time performance, potentially\nincreasing the risk of the robot colliding with its environment. This paper\naddresses this challenge by proposing Conformalized Reachable Sets for Obstacle\nAvoidance With Spheres (CROWS). CROWS is a novel real-time, receding-horizon\ntrajectory planner that generates probalistically-safe motion plans. Offline,\nCROWS learns a novel neural network-based representation of a spherebased\nreachable set that overapproximates the swept volume of the robot's motion.\nCROWS then uses conformal prediction to compute a confidence bound that\nprovides a probabilistic safety guarantee on the learned reachable set. At\nruntime, CROWS performs trajectory optimization to select a trajectory that is\nprobabilstically-guaranteed to be collision-free.

Numerous previous research has demonstrated that these metrics can\ninfluence human visual processing. However, these studies often did not fully\naccount for contextual information or employ the recent deep learning models\nfor more accurate computation. This study investigates human visual perception\nand processing by introducing the metrics of contextual semantic relevance. We\nevaluate semantic relationships between target objects and their surroundings\nfrom both vision-based and language-based perspectives. Testing a large\neye-movement dataset from visual comprehension, we employ state-of-the-art deep\nlearning techniques to compute these metrics and analyze their impacts on\nfixation measures on human visual processing through advanced statistical\nmodels. These metrics could also simulate top-down and bottom-up processing in\nvisual perception. This study further integrates vision-based and\nlanguage-based metrics into a novel combined metric, addressing a critical gap\nin previous research that often treated visual and semantic similarities\nseparately. Results indicate that all metrics could precisely predict fixation\nmeasures in visual perception and processing, but with distinct roles in\nprediction. The combined metric outperforms other metrics, supporting theories\nthat emphasize the interaction between semantic and visual information in\nshaping visual perception/processing. This finding aligns with growing\nrecognition of the importance of multi-modal information processing in human\ncognition.

    "abstract": "Residual resistance ratio (RRR) of Cu stabilizer in REBCO coated conductor is\nan important design parameter for REBCO magnets. In this work, we measured RRR\nof electroplated Cu stabilizer in commercial REBCO tapes. Over 130 samples were\nmeasured for the quality assurance programs of REBCO magnet projects at the\nNational High Magnetic Field Laboratory, USA (NHMFL). The average RRR value was\nabove 50. In order to investigate the factors that influence RRR, several\nsamples were analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy, secondary ion mass\nspectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. We found that,\nin our samples, RRR was strongly correlated with the grain size. We\ndemonstrated that RRR was primarily determined by grain boundary resistivity.\nLower RRR was also strongly correlated with higher concentration of chlorine\nimpurity. This is explained by that higher chlorine impurity hindered the grain\ngrowth in the room temperature self annealing process resulting smaller grain.\nSmaller grain resulted in lower RRR. In addition, thermal annealing\nsignificantly enhanced RRR. An activation energy of 0.4 eV was obtained from\nthe annealing experiment which corresponds to the activation of Cu grain\ngrowth.",

    "abstract": "Estimation of near-wall turbulence in channel flow from outer observations is\ninvestigated using adjoint-variational data assimilation. We first consider\nfully resolved velocity data, starting at a distance from the wall. By\nenforcing the estimated flow to exactly satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, we\nseek a statistically stationary turbulent state that reproduces the\ninstantaneous outer measurements. Such an estimated state provides full access\nto the unknown near-wall turbulence, including the wall shear stresses and\npressure. When the first observation is within fifty viscous units from the\nwall, the correlation coefficient between the true and estimated state exceeds\n95%. As the observations are further separated from the wall, at ninety viscous\nunits, the accuracy of the assimilated wall stresses decreases to 40% at the\nwall. This trend is nearly independent of the Reynolds number. The Fourier\nspectrum of the estimation error is qualitatively consistent with the coherence\nspectrum between the outer and the inner state variables: observed long\nwavelength structures in the outer flow have deeper coherence into the\nunobserved near-wall region, and therefore the error is lowest at large scales.\nNevertheless, the adjoint-variational approach provides a more rigorous\nquantification of the capacity to accurately predict the instantaneous\nnear-wall turbulence from outer measurements. Lastly, we demonstrate the\nrobustness of the estimation accuracy using filtered and sub-sampled outer\nobservations.",

In this paper, we introduce the Stratified Domain\nAdaptation (StrDA) approach, which examines the gradual escalation of the\ndomain gap for the learning process. The objective is to partition the training\ndata into subsets so that the progressively self-trained model can adapt to\ngradual changes.

In this work, we propose a novel sparse\nstatistical learning approach for chemical reaction mechanism reduction.\nSpecifically, the reduced mechanism is learned to explicitly reproduce the\ndynamical evolution of detailed chemical kinetics, while constraining on the\nsparsity of the reduced reactions at the same time. Compact reduced mechanisms\nare be achieved as the collection of species that participate in the identified\nimportant reactions. We validate our approach by reducing oxidation mechanisms\nfor $n$-heptane (194 species) and 1,3-butadiene (581 species). The results\ndemonstrate that the reduced mechanisms show accurate predictions for the\nignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, species mole fraction profiles and\nturbulence-chemistry interactions across a wide range of operating conditions.\nComparative analysis with directed relation graph (DRG)-based methods and the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods reveals that our sparse learning approach\nproduces reduced mechanisms with fewer species while maintaining the same error\nlimits. The advantages are particularly evident for detailed mechanisms with a\nlarger number of species and reactions. The sparse learning strategy shows\nsignificant potential in achieving more substantial reductions in complex\nchemical reaction mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Over the past three decades, describing the reality surrounding us using the\nlanguage of complex networks has become very useful and therefore popular. One\nof the most important features, especially of real networks, is their\ncomplexity, which often manifests itself in a fractal or even multifractal\nstructure. As a generalisation of fractal analysis, multifractal analysis of\ncomplex networks is a useful tool for the identification and quantitative\ndescription of the spatial hierarchy of both theoretical and numerical fractal\npatterns. Nowadays, there are many methods of multifractal analysis. However,\nall these methods take into account only the fact of connection between nodes\n(and eventually the weight of edges) and do not take into account the real\npositions (coordinates) of nodes in space. However, intuition suggests that the\ngeometry of network nodes' position should have a significant impact on its\ntrue fractal structure. Many networks identified in nature (e.g. air connection\nnetworks, energy networks, social networks, mountain ridge networks, networks\nof neurones in the brain, street networks) have their own often unique and\ncharacteristic geometry, which is not taken into account in the identification\nprocess of multifractality in commonly used methods. In this paper, we propose\na multifractal network analysis method that takes into account both connections\nbetween nodes and the location coordinates of nodes (network geometry). We show\nthe results for different geometrical variants of the same network and reveal\nthat this method, contrary to the commonly used method, is sensitive to changes\nin network geometry.

    "abstract": "The optical fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) has been widely\ninvestigated as a potential temperature sensor. To function as a temperature\nsensor, the cavity of the FPI is typically constructed from either silica\nfibers or polymers. The silica cavity FPIs can function at temperatures\nexceeding 1000{\\deg}C. However, its temperature sensitivity is constrained by\nits relatively low thermal optical coefficient and thermal expansion of silica\nmaterials. Although the polymer cavity FPI exhibits a high temperature\nsensitivity, its cavity is susceptible to deterioration in high-temperature\nenvironments. Here, to overcome this challenge and achieve high-sensitivity\ntemperature sensing in a high-temperature environment, we propose a new type of\ntemperature FPI sensor by inserting and sealing a section of Cr20Ni80 metal\nmicrowire inside a section of silica hollow core fiber (HCF) spliced to\nstandard single-mode fiber (SMF). The FPIs exhibit a high degree of temperature\nsensitivity due to the high thermal expansion of the Cr20Ni80 metal microwire.\nSince the Cr20Ni80 metal has a high melting temperature of 1400{\\deg}C, such\nFPIs can function in high-temperature environments. Moreover, the temperature\nsensitivity of this FPI can be modified without affecting its reflection\nspectrum by changing the length of the metallic microwire situated within the\nhollow core fiber. The experimental results indicate that the proposed FPIs\nexhibit a temperature sensitivity greater than -0.35nm/{\\deg}C within the\ntemperature range of 50{\\deg}C to 440{\\deg}C. Our proposed metal\nmicrowire-based FPIs are economical, robust, simple to fabricate, and capable\nof functioning in high-temperature environments, rendering them appealing\noptions for practical applications",

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of\nvarious nonconformity measures (absolute error-based, normalized absolute\nerror-based, and quantile-based measures) in terms of validity and efficiency\nwhen used in inductive conformal prediction. The focus is on small datasets,\nwhich is still a common setting in many real-world applications.

Our results show that although there are\ndifferences, no single nonconformity measure consistently outperforms the\nothers, as the effectiveness of each nonconformity measure is heavily\ninfluenced by the specific nature of the data.

    "abstract": "Point clouds, as a primary representation of 3D data, can be categorized into\nscene domain point clouds and object domain point clouds. Point cloud\nself-supervised learning (SSL) has become a mainstream paradigm for learning 3D\nrepresentations. However, existing point cloud SSL primarily focuses on\nlearning domain-specific 3D representations within a single domain, neglecting\nthe complementary nature of cross-domain knowledge, which limits the learning\nof 3D representations. In this paper, we propose to learn a comprehensive Point\ncloud Mixture-of-Domain-Experts model (Point-MoDE) via a block-to-scene\npre-training strategy. Specifically, we first propose a\nmixture-of-domain-expert model consisting of scene domain experts and multiple\nshared object domain experts. Furthermore, we propose a block-to-scene\npretraining strategy, which leverages the features of point blocks in the\nobject domain to regress their initial positions in the scene domain through\nobject-level block mask reconstruction and scene-level block position\nregression. By integrating the complementary knowledge between object and\nscene, this strategy simultaneously facilitates the learning of both\nobject-domain and scene-domain representations, leading to a more comprehensive\n3D representation. Extensive experiments in downstream tasks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our model.",

Multiple telescopes can be deployed at each\nobservation site, so intra-site observation task scheduling is crucial for\nenhancing observation efficiency and quality. Efficient use of observable time\nand rapid response to special situations are critical to maximize scientific\ndiscovery in time domain surveys. Besides, the competing scientific priorities,\ntime-varying observation conditions, and capabilities of observation equipment,\nlead to a vast search space of the scheduling. So with the increasing number of\ntelescopes and observation fields, balancing computational time with solution\nquality in observation scheduling poses a significant challenge. Informed by\nthe seminal contributions of earlier studies on a multilevel scheduling model\nand global scheduler for time domain telescope array, this study is devoted to\nfurther exploring the site scheduler. Formulating the observation scheduling of\nmultiple telescopes at the site as a cooperative decision-making problem, this\npaper proposes GRRIS, a real-time intra-site observation scheduling scheme for\ntelescope array using graph and reinforcement learning. It employs a graph\nneural network to learn node features that can embed the spatial structure of\nthe observation scheduling. An algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning is designed to efficiently learn the optimum allocation policy of\ntelescope agents to field nodes.

Specifically, the skipping\nstrategy is guided by the third-order latent difference that indicates the\nstability between timesteps during the denoising process, which benefits the\nreusing of previous noise prediction results. Extensive experiments on image\nand video diffusion models demonstrate that our method can significantly speed\nup the denoising process while generating identical results to the original\nprocess, achieving up to an average 2~5x speedup without quality degradation.",

    "abstract": "A deep learning system typically suffers from a lack of reproducibility that\nis partially rooted in hardware or software implementation details. The\nirreproducibility leads to skepticism in deep learning technologies and it can\nhinder them from being deployed in many applications. In this work, the\nirreproducibility issue is analyzed where deep learning is employed in\ncompression systems while the encoding and decoding may be run on devices from\ndifferent manufacturers. The decoding process can even crash due to a single\nbit difference, e.g., in a learning-based entropy coder. For a given deep\nlearning-based module with limited resources for protection, we first suggest\nthat reproducibility can only be assured when the mismatches are bounded. Then\na safeguarding mechanism is proposed to tackle the challenges. The proposed\nmethod may be applied for different levels of protection either at the\nreconstruction level or at a selected decoding level. Furthermore, the overhead\nintroduced for the protection can be scaled down accordingly when the error\nbound is being suppressed. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach for learning-based compression systems, e.g., in image\ncompression and point cloud compression.",

To\novercome this, we introduce ChroKnowBench, a benchmark dataset designed to\nevaluate chronologically accumulated knowledge across three key aspects:\nmultiple domains, time dependency, temporal state. Our benchmark distinguishes\nbetween knowledge that evolves (e.g., personal history, scientific discoveries,\namended laws) and knowledge that remain constant (e.g., mathematical truths,\ncommonsense facts). Building on this benchmark, we present ChroKnowledge\n(Chronological Categorization of Knowledge), a novel sampling-based framework\nfor evaluating LLMs' non-parametric chronological knowledge. Our evaluation led\nto the following observations: (1) The ability of eliciting temporal knowledge\nvaries depending on the data format that model was trained on. (2) LLMs\npartially recall knowledge or show a cut-off at temporal boundaries rather than\nrecalling all aspects of knowledge correctly. Thus, we apply our\nChroKnowPrompt, an in-depth prompting to elicit chronological knowledge by\ntraversing step-by-step through the surrounding time spans.

We show that the statistical analysis of a temporary\nsignal generated by cargos that have diffusively passed through the complex\ndendritic structure yields vital information about dendrite morphology.

    "abstract": "Blind face restoration (BFR) is a fundamental and challenging problem in\ncomputer vision. To faithfully restore high-quality (HQ) photos from\npoor-quality ones, recent research endeavors predominantly rely on facial image\npriors from the powerful pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models.\nHowever, such priors often lead to the incorrect generation of non-facial\nfeatures and insufficient facial details, thus rendering them less practical\nfor real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,\nnamely AuthFace that achieves highly authentic face restoration results by\nexploring a face-oriented generative diffusion prior. To learn such a prior, we\nfirst collect a dataset of 1.5K high-quality images, with resolutions exceeding\n8K, captured by professional photographers. Based on the dataset, we then\nintroduce a novel face-oriented restoration-tuning pipeline that fine-tunes a\npretrained T2I model. Identifying key criteria of quality-first and\nphotography-guided annotation, we involve the retouching and reviewing process\nunder the guidance of photographers for high-quality images that show rich\nfacial features. The photography-guided annotation system fully explores the\npotential of these high-quality photographic images. In this way, the potent\nnatural image priors from pretrained T2I diffusion models can be subtly\nharnessed, specifically enhancing their capability in facial detail\nrestoration. Moreover, to minimize artifacts in critical facial areas, such as\neyes and mouth, we propose a time-aware latent facial feature loss to learn the\nauthentic face restoration process. Extensive experiments on the synthetic and\nreal-world BFR datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.",

A technique for hand image normalization is implemented at the\npreprocessing stage that decomposes the main hand contour into finger-level\nshape representation. This normalization technique follows subtraction of\ntransformed binary image from binary hand contour image to generate the left\nside of finger profiles (LSFP). Then, XOR is applied to LSFP image and hand\ncontour image to produce the right side of finger profiles (RSFP). During\nfeature extraction, initially, thirty geometric features are computed from\nevery normalized finger. The rank-based forward-backward greedy algorithm is\nfollowed to select relevant features and to enhance classification accuracy.\nTwo different subsets of features containing nine and twelve discriminative\nfeatures per finger are selected for two separate experimentations those use\nthe kNN and the Random Forest (RF) for classification on the Bosphorus hand\ndatabase. The experiments with the selected features of four fingers except the\nthumb have obtained improved performances compared to features extracted from\nfive fingers and also other existing methods evaluated on the Bosphorus\ndatabase. The best identification accuracies of 96.56% and 95.92% using the RF\nclassifier have been achieved for the right- and left-hand images of 638\nsub-jects, respectively.

When the system\ndescription is highly complicated, the modeling task can become particularly\nchallenging and time-consuming. Large language Models(LLMs) can assist by\nautomatically generating an initial object model from the system description.\nAlthough LLMs have demonstrated remarkable code-generation ability, they still\nstruggle with model-generation using a single prompt. In real-world domain\nmodeling, engineers usually decompose complex tasks into easily solvable\nsub-tasks, significantly controlling complexity and enhancing model quality.\nInspired by this, we propose an LLM-based domain modeling approach via question\ndecomposition, similar to developer's modeling process. Following conventional\nmodeling guidelines, we divide the model generation task into several\nsub-tasks, i.e., class generation, association and aggregation generation, and\ninheritance generation. For each sub-task, we carefully design the prompt by\nchoosing more efficient query words and providing essential modeling knowledge\nto unlock the modeling potential of LLMs. To sum up all the sub-tasks\nsolutions, we implemente a proof-of-object tool integrated into the standard\nEcore editor that asks LLMs to generate an object model from the system\ndescription.

This approach provides a more\ncomprehensive evaluation of disparities between LLMs and human experts, while\noffering valuable insights into specific areas where LLMs may have room for\nimprovement. For example, using ELF-Gym we empirically demonstrate that, in the\nbest-case scenario, LLMs can semantically capture approximately 56% of the\ngolden features, but at the more demanding implementation level this overlap\ndrops to 13%. Moreover, in other cases LLMs may fail completely, particularly\non datasets that require complex features, indicating broad potential pathways\nfor improvement.",

    "abstract": "ALMA-IMF observed 15 massive protoclusters capturing multiple spectral lines\nand the continuum emission. We focus on the G351.77 protocluster ($\\sim$ 2500\nM$_{\\odot}$, estimated from single-dish continuum observations) located at 2\nkpc. We trace the dense gas emission and kinematics with N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) at\n$\\sim$ 4 kau resolution. We estimate an N$_2$H$^+$ relative abundance $\\sim\n(1.7 \\pm 0.5) \\times 10^{-10}$. We decompose the N$_2$H$^+$ emission into up to\ntwo velocity components, highlighting the kinematic complexity in the dense\ngas. By examining the position-velocity (PV) diagrams on small scales, we\nobserve clear inflow signatures (V-shapes) associated with dense cores. The\nmost prominent V-shape has a mass inflow rate of $\\sim 13.5 \\times 10^{-4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a short timescale of $\\sim$ 11.4 kyr. We also observe\nV-shapes without associated cores. This suggests both that cores or centers of\naccretion exist below the 1.3 mm detection limit, and that the V-shapes may be\nviable tracers of very early accretion and star formation on $\\sim$ 4 kau\nscales. The large-scale PV diagram shows that the protocluster is separated\ninto 2 principal velocity structures. Combined with smaller scale DCN and\nH$_2$CO emission, we propose a scenario of larger scale slow contraction with\nrotation in the center based on simple toy models. This scenario leads the\nsuggestion of outside-in evolution of the protocluster as it collapses. The gas\ndepletion times implied by the V-shapes are short ($\\sim$ 0.3 Myr), requiring\neither very fast cluster formation, and/or continuous mass feeding of the\nprotocluster. The latter is possible via the Mother Filament G351.77 is forming\nout of. The similarities in the properties of G351.77 and the recently\npublished work in G353.41 indicate that many of the physical conditions\ninferred via the ALMA-IMF N$_2$H$^+$ observations may be generic to\nprotoclusters.",

In extreme astrophysical systems, such as black hole coronae\nand neutron star magnetospheres, radiative cooling modifies the energy\npartition by rapidly removing internal energy. In this thesis, we perform\nexperimental and computational studies of magnetic reconnection in a\nradiatively cooled regime, previously unexplored in reconnection studies. The\nMagnetic Reconnection on Z (MARZ) experiments consist of a dual exploding wire\narray, driven by a 20 MA peak, 300 ns rise time current generated by the Z\npulsed-power machine (Sandia National Labs). The load generates\noppositely-directed supersonic, super-Alfv\\'enic, collisional plasma flows with\nanti-parallel magnetic fields, that generate a reconnection layer, in which the\ntotal cooling rate far exceeds the Alfv\\'enic transit rate. Two- and\nthree-dimensional simulations of the MARZ experiments are performed in GORGON,\nan Eulerian resistive magnetohydrodynamic code. The experiments confirm\nnumerical predictions by providing evidence of plasmoid formation and strong\nradiative cooling. The findings in this thesis are of particular relevance to\nthe generation of radiative emission from reconnection-driven astrophysical\nevents, and to the global dynamics of reconnection in strongly cooled systems.\nThe MARZ experiments also provide a novel platform for investigating radiative\neffects in high-energy-density and laboratory astrophysics experiments, and for\nvalidation of radiation magnetohydrodynamic and atomic spectroscopy codes.",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as\nthey allow attackers to manipulate model predictions with backdoor triggers. To\naddress these security vulnerabilities, various backdoor purification methods\nhave been proposed to purify compromised models. Typically, these purified\nmodels exhibit low Attack Success Rates (ASR), rendering them resistant to\nbackdoored inputs. However, Does achieving a low ASR through current safety\npurification methods truly eliminate learned backdoor features from the\npretraining phase? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this\nquestion by thoroughly investigating the Post-Purification Robustness of\ncurrent backdoor purification methods. We find that current safety purification\nmethods are vulnerable to the rapid re-learning of backdoor behavior, even when\nfurther fine-tuning of purified models is performed using a very small number\nof poisoned samples. Based on this, we further propose the practical\nQuery-based Reactivation Attack (QRA) which could effectively reactivate the\nbackdoor by merely querying purified models. We find the failure to achieve\nsatisfactory post-purification robustness stems from the insufficient deviation\nof purified models from the backdoored model along the backdoor-connected path.\nTo improve the post-purification robustness, we propose a straightforward\ntuning defense, Path-Aware Minimization (PAM), which promotes deviation along\nbackdoor-connected paths with extra model updates. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PAM significantly improves post-purification robustness while\nmaintaining a good clean accuracy and low ASR. Our work provides a new\nperspective on understanding the effectiveness of backdoor safety tuning and\nhighlights the importance of faithfully assessing the model's safety.",

However, real-world time series often exhibit complex non-uniform\ndistribution with varying patterns across segments, such as season, operating\ncondition, or semantic meaning, making accurate forecasting challenging.\nExisting approaches, which typically train a single model to capture all these\ndiverse patterns, often struggle with the pattern drifts between patches and\nmay lead to poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose\n\\textbf{TFPS}, a novel architecture that leverages pattern-specific experts for\nmore accurate and adaptable time series forecasting. TFPS employs a dual-domain\nencoder to capture both time-domain and frequency-domain features, enabling a\nmore comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics. It then uses subspace\nclustering to dynamically identify distinct patterns across data patches.\nFinally, pattern-specific experts model these unique patterns, delivering\ntailored predictions for each patch. By explicitly learning and adapting to\nevolving patterns, TFPS achieves significantly improved forecasting accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TFPS outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-term forecasting, through its\ndynamic and pattern-aware learning approach.

    "abstract": "Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is essential for numerous computer vision\ntasks, including object detection, tracking, segmentation, and scene\nunderstanding. Despite substantial research on improving low-quality images\ncaptured in underexposed conditions, clear vision remains critical for\nautonomous vehicles, which often struggle with low-light scenarios, signifying\nthe need for continuous research. However, paired datasets for LLIE are scarce,\nparticularly for street scenes, limiting the development of robust LLIE\nmethods. Despite using advanced transformers and/or diffusion-based models,\ncurrent LLIE methods struggle in real-world low-light conditions and lack\ntraining on street-scene datasets, limiting their effectiveness for autonomous\nvehicles. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a new dataset LoLI-Street\n(Low-Light Images of Streets) with 33k paired low-light and well-exposed images\nfrom street scenes in developed cities, covering 19k object classes for object\ndetection. LoLI-Street dataset also features 1,000 real low-light test images\nfor testing LLIE models under real-life conditions. Furthermore, we propose a\ntransformer and diffusion-based LLIE model named \"TriFuse\". Leveraging the\nLoLI-Street dataset, we train and evaluate our TriFuse and SOTA models to\nbenchmark on our dataset. Comparing various models, our dataset's\ngeneralization feasibility is evident in testing across different mainstream\ndatasets by significantly enhancing images and object detection for practical\napplications in autonomous driving and surveillance systems.

In the\npast, semianalytic meridionally self-similar models have proven highly\nsuccessful in deciphering the intricate mechanisms that determine their\nacceleration, collimation, and morphological characteristics. In this work, we\npresent a modification of this formalism based on the angular expansion of the\nequations of general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics in the\nvicinity of the jet axis for the description of resistive relativistic spine\njets. Our paraxial formalism allows for the inclusion of resistivity and of a\nrealistic, variable adiabatic index equation of state in the mathematical\nformulation. The electric potential gradient along poloidal magnetic field\nlines, caused by a gradient in the rotational angular velocity of the field\nlines, was identified as the mechanism behind the emergence of Ohmic\ndissipation in resistive jets. The semianalytic solutions that we present\ndemonstrate that Ohmic dissipation is significant only over localized\ndissipation regions in resistive jets. Over the extent of these regions, Ohmic\ndissipation weakens the thermal acceleration mechanism and can even lead to the\ndeceleration of these outflows. Additionally, the resistive jets display\nenhanced collimation and a strengthening of their toroidal magnetic fields over\nthe dissipation regions, resulting in smaller asymptotic opening angles and a\nmore helical magnetic field structure compared to their nonresistive\ncounterparts.",

We\nleverage the directed acyclic graph of the task-based Cholesky factorization\nand map it onto a static scheduler that promotes data reuse while supporting\nstrategies for reducing data movement with the CPU host when the GPU memory is\nexhausted. The CPU-GPU interconnect may become the main performance bottleneck\nas the gap between the GPU execution rate and the traditional PCIe bandwidth\ncontinues to widen. While the surface-to-volume effect of compute-bound kernels\npartially mitigates the overhead of data motion, deploying mixed-precision\n(MxP) computations exacerbates the throughput discrepancy. Using static task\nscheduling, we evaluate the performance capabilities of the new ultra-fast\nNVIDIA chip interconnect technology, codenamed NVLink-C2C, that constitutes the\nbackbone of the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip (GH200), against a new\nfour-precision (FP64/FP32/FP16/FP8) left-looking Cholesky factorization. We\nreport the performance results of a benchmarking campaign on various NVIDIA GPU\ngenerations and interconnects. We highlight 20% performance superiority against\ncuSOLVER on a single GH200 with FP64 while hiding the cost of OOC task-based\nCholesky factorization, and we scale almost linearly on four GH200 superships.\nWith MxP enabled, our statically scheduled four-precision tile-based Cholesky\nfactorization scores a 3X performance speedup against its FP64-only\ncounterpart, delivering application-worthy FP64 accuracy when modeling a\nlarge-scale geospatial statistical application.",

By generating features in a\ndata-driven manner, AFE enables the discovery of important features that may\nnot be apparent through human experience or intuition. On the other hand, since\nAFE generates features based on data, there is a risk that these features may\nbe overly adapted to the data, making it essential to assess their reliability\nappropriately. Unfortunately, because most AFE problems are formulated as\ncombinatorial search problems and solved by heuristic algorithms, it has been\nchallenging to theoretically quantify the reliability of generated features. To\naddress this issue, we propose a new statistical test for generated features by\nAFE algorithms based on a framework called selective inference. As a proof of\nconcept, we consider a simple class of tree search-based heuristic AFE\nalgorithms, and consider the problem of testing the generated features when\nthey are used in a linear model. The proposed test can quantify the statistical\nsignificance of the generated features in the form of $p$-values, enabling\ntheoretically guaranteed control of the risk of false findings.",

This is because they haven't been extensively pre-trained with\nparallel multilingual code, which code translation heavily depends on.\nMoreover, existing benchmarks only cover a limited subset of common programming\nlanguages, and thus cannot reflect the full potential of LLMs in code\ntranslation. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to exploit\nthe capabilities and incapabilities of LLMs in code translation tasks. We first\ncraft a novel benchmark called PolyHumanEval by extending HumanEval to a\nmultilingual benchmark of 14 languages. With PolyHumanEval, we then perform\nover 110,000 translations with bleeding-edge code LLMs. The result shows LLMs'\nsuboptimal performance on Python to other languages and the negligible impact\nof widely adopted LLM optimization techniques such as conventional pre-training\nand instruction tuning on code translation. To further uncover the potential of\nLLMs in code translation, we propose two methods: (1) intermediary translation\nwhich selects an intermediary language between the source and target ones; and\n(2) self-training which fine-tunes LLMs on self-generated parallel data.\nEvaluated with CodeLlama-13B, our approach yields an average improvement of\n11.7% computation accuracy on Python-to-other translations.

The embedding method\nwe propose can also be efficiently used for subsequent inference tasks.

Although modifying image features to\ngenerate robust semantic patterns of the target class is a promising approach,\nexisting methods heavily rely on large-scale additional data. This dependence\nundermines the fair evaluation of TTA threats, potentially leading to a false\nsense of security or unnecessary overreactions. In this paper, we introduce two\nblind measures, surrogate self-alignment and self-transferability, to analyze\nthe effectiveness and correlations of basic transformations, to enhance\ndata-free attacks under strict black-box constraints. Our findings challenge\nconventional assumptions: (1) Attacking simple scaling transformations uniquely\nenhances targeted transferability, outperforming other basic transformations\nand rivaling leading complex methods; (2) Geometric and color transformations\nexhibit high internal redundancy despite weak inter-category correlations.\nThese insights drive the design and tuning of S4ST (Strong, Self-transferable,\nfaSt, Simple Scale Transformation), which integrates dimensionally consistent\nscaling, complementary low-redundancy transformations, and block-wise\noperations. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet-Compatible dataset\ndemonstrate that S4ST achieves a 77.7% average targeted success rate (tSuc),\nsurpassing existing transformations (+17.2% over H-Aug with only 26%\ncomputational time) and SOTA TTA solutions (+6.2% over SASD-WS with 1.2M\nsamples for post-training). Notably, it attains 69.6% and 55.3% average tSuc\nagainst three commercial APIs and vision-language models, respectively. This\nwork establishes a new SOTA for TTAs, highlights their potential threats, and\ncalls for a reevaluation of the data dependency in achieving targeted\ntransferability.",

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across\nvarious tasks, they encounter potential security risks such as jailbreak\nattacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to bypass security measures and generate\nharmful outputs. Existing jailbreak strategies mainly focus on maximizing\nattack success rate (ASR), frequently neglecting other critical factors,\nincluding the relevance of the jailbreak response to the query and the level of\nstealthiness. This narrow focus on single objectives can result in ineffective\nattacks that either lack contextual relevance or are easily recognizable. In\nthis work, we introduce BlackDAN, an innovative black-box attack framework with\nmulti-objective optimization, aiming to generate high-quality prompts that\neffectively facilitate jailbreaking while maintaining contextual relevance and\nminimizing detectability. BlackDAN leverages Multiobjective Evolutionary\nAlgorithms (MOEAs), specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, to optimize jailbreaks\nacross multiple objectives including ASR, stealthiness, and semantic relevance.\nBy integrating mechanisms like mutation, crossover, and Pareto-dominance,\nBlackDAN provides a transparent and interpretable process for generating\njailbreaks. Furthermore, the framework allows customization based on user\npreferences, enabling the selection of prompts that balance harmfulness,\nrelevance, and other factors. Experimental results demonstrate that BlackDAN\noutperforms traditional single-objective methods, yielding higher success rates\nand improved robustness across various LLMs and multimodal LLMs, while ensuring\njailbreak responses are both relevant and less detectable.",

Despite these efforts, they incur quadratic memory\nand computational costs for establishing dense correspondence, resulting in\nlimited versatility and performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach termed Exemplar-guided Image Translation with Brownian-Bridge\nDiffusion Models (EBDM). Our method formulates the task as a stochastic\nBrownian bridge process, a diffusion process with a fixed initial point as\nstructure control and translates into the corresponding photo-realistic image\nwhile being conditioned solely on the given exemplar image. To efficiently\nguide the diffusion process toward the style of exemplar, we delineate three\npivotal components: the Global Encoder, the Exemplar Network, and the Exemplar\nAttention Module to incorporate global and detailed texture information from\nexemplar images. Leveraging Bridge diffusion, the network can translate images\nfrom structure control while exclusively conditioned on the exemplar style,\nleading to more robust training and inference processes.

Here we take advantage of\nthe hierarchical nature of b-EMRI systems to transform the internal motion of\nthe small binary into global trajectories around the SMBH. This allows us to\nuse black hole perturbation theory to calculate both the low-frequency\ngravitational waveform due to its EMRI nature and the high-frequency waveform\ngenerated by the inner motion of the BBH. When the inner binary's separation\nvanishes, our calculation recovers the standard relativistic adiabatic EMRI\nwaveform. Furthermore, by including the high-frequency perturbation, we find a\ncorrection to the waveform as large as the adiabatic order when the frequency\nmatches the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the SMBH, therefore supporting an\nearlier proof-of-concept study claiming that the small BBH can resonantly\nexcite the QNMs of the SMBH. More importantly, we find that b-EMRIs can evolve\nfaster than regular EMRIs due to this resonant dissipation through the\nhigh-frequency modes.

    "abstract": "The incompressible Euler equations are an important model system in\ncomputational fluid dynamics. Fast high-order methods for the solution of this\ntime-dependent system of partial differential equations are of particular\ninterest: due to their exponential convergence in the polynomial degree they\ncan make efficient use of computational resources. To address this challenge we\ndescribe a novel timestepping method which combines a hybridised Discontinuous\nGalerkin method for the spatial discretisation with IMEX timestepping schemes,\nthus achieving high-order accuracy in both space and time. The computational\nbottleneck is the solution of a (block-) sparse linear system to compute\nupdates to pressure and velocity at each stage of the IMEX integrator.\nFollowing Chorin's projection approach, this update of the velocity and\npressure fields is split into two stages. As a result, the hybridised equation\nfor the implicit pressure-velocity problem is reduced to the well-known system\nwhich arises in hybridised mixed formulations of the Poisson- or diffusion\nproblem and for which efficient multigrid preconditioners have been developed.\nSplitting errors can be reduced systematically by embedding this update into a\npreconditioned Richardson iteration. The accuracy and efficiency of the new\nmethod is demonstrated numerically for two time-dependent testcases that have\nbeen previously studied in the literature.",

    "abstract": "In a seminal paper, F. Delbaen and W. Schachermayer proved that the classical\nNA (\"no arbitrage\") condition implies the existence of an \"absolutely\ncontinuous local martingale measure\" (ACLMM). It is known that in general the\nexistence of an ACLMM alone is not sufficient for NA. In this paper we\ninvestigate how close these notions are for single asset general diffusion\nmarket models. We show that NA is equivalent to the existence of an ACLMM plus\na mild regularity condition on the scale function and the absence of reflecting\nboundaries. For infinite time horizon scenarios, the regularity assumption and\nthe requirement on the boundaries can be dropped, showing equivalence between\nNA and the existence of an ACLMM. By means of counterexamples, we show that our\ncharacterization of NA for finite time horizons is sharp in the sense that\nneither the regularity condition on the scale function nor the absence of\nreflecting boundaries can be dropped.",

    "abstract": "Interactive portrait matting refers to extracting the soft portrait from a\ngiven image that best meets the user's intent through their inputs. Existing\nmethods often underperform in complex scenarios, mainly due to three factors.\n(1) Most works apply a tightly coupled network that directly predicts matting\nresults, lacking interpretability and resulting in inadequate modeling. (2)\nExisting works are limited to a single type of user input, which is ineffective\nfor intention understanding and also inefficient for user operation. (3) The\nmulti-round characteristics have been under-explored, which is crucial for user\ninteraction. To alleviate these limitations, we propose DFIMat, a decoupled\nframework that enables flexible interactive matting. Specifically, we first\ndecouple the task into 2 sub-ones: localizing target instances by understanding\nscene semantics and the flexible user inputs, and conducting refinement for\ninstance-level matting. We observe a clear performance gain from decoupling, as\nit makes sub-tasks easier to learn, and the flexible multi-type input further\nenhances both effectiveness and efficiency. DFIMat also considers the\nmulti-round interaction property, where a contrastive reasoning module is\ndesigned to enhance cross-round refinement. Another limitation for multi-person\nmatting task is the lack of training data. We address this by introducing a new\nsynthetic data generation pipeline that can generate much more realistic\nsamples than previous arts. A new large-scale dataset SMPMat is subsequently\nestablished. Experiments verify the significant superiority of DFIMat. With it,\nwe also investigate the roles of different input types, providing valuable\nprinciples for users. Our code and dataset can be found at\nhttps://github.com/JiaoSiyi/DFIMat.",

Space\nmissions such as CoRoT, \\kep, K2, and TESS have already been observing millions\nof stars providing high-precision photometric data. With these data, it is\npossible to study the convection of stars through the convective background in\nthe power spectrum density of the light curves. The properties of the\nconvective background or granulation has been shown to be correlated to the\nsurface gravity of the stars. In addition, when we have enough resolution (so\nlong enough observations) and a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nindividual modes can be characterized in particular to study the internal\nrotational splittings and magnetic field of stars. Finally, the surface\nmagnetic activity also impacts the amplitude and hence detection of the\nacoustic modes. This effect can be seen as a double-edged sword. Indeed, modes\ncan be studied to look for magnetic activity changes. However, this also means\nthat for stars too magnetically active, modes can be suppressed, preventing us\nfrom detecting them.

Two distinct studies are presented.\n  The first study examines the properties of compact stars, including neutron\nstars, using an equation of state from a core-envelope model. By solving\nEinstein's equations with pseudo-spheroidal and spherically symmetric\ngeometries, the mass-radius relationship is derived, leading to the\nclassification of compact stars into three categories: highly compact\nself-bound stars (radii $<$ 9 km), normal neutron stars (radii 9--12 km), and\nsoft matter neutron stars (radii 12--20 km). Other parameters such as Keplerian\nfrequency, surface gravity, and gravitational redshift are also computed,\noffering insights into highly compact neutron stars with exotic compositions.\n  The second study investigates the impact of density perturbations and local\nanisotropy on stellar stability. Using the cracking concept and a core-envelope\nmodel with anisotropic pressure in the envelope, we explore the potential of\nthese configurations as progenitors for starquakes. The buildup of strain\nenergy in the envelope, linked to anisotropy, can reach up to $10^{50}$ erg --\ncomparable to energy released in giant gamma-ray bursts. This study thus\ncontributes to understanding the relationship between starquakes and gamma-ray\nbursts.\n  Overall, this work advances the understanding of neutron stars by classifying\nthem based on their radii and investigating the stability of their matter\nstructures, providing new insights into starquakes and their possible\nconnections with gamma-ray bursts.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a LargE-scale Annotator's labels for sound event\nDetection (LEAD) dataset, which is the dataset used to gain a better\nunderstanding of the variation in strong labels in sound event detection (SED).\nIn SED, it is very time-consuming to collect large-scale strong labels, and in\nmost cases, multiple workers divide up the annotations to create a single\ndataset. In general, strong labels created by multiple annotators have large\nvariations in the type of sound events and temporal onset/offset. Through the\nannotations of multiple workers, uniquely determining the strong label is quite\ndifficult because the dataset contains sounds that can be mistaken for similar\nclasses and sounds whose temporal onset/offset is difficult to distinguish. If\nthe strong labels of SED vary greatly depending on the annotator, the SED model\ntrained on a dataset created by multiple annotators will be biased. Moreover,\nif annotators differ between training and evaluation data, there is a risk that\nthe model cannot be evaluated correctly. To investigate the variation in strong\nlabels, we release the LEAD dataset, which provides distinct strong labels for\neach clip annotated by 20 different annotators. The LEAD dataset allows us to\ninvestigate how strong labels vary from annotator to annotator and consider SED\nmodels that are robust to the variation of strong labels. The LEAD dataset\nconsists of strong labels assigned to sound clips from TUT Sound Events\n2016/2017, TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016, and URBAN-SED. We also analyze variations\nin the strong labels in the LEAD dataset and provide insights into the\nvariations.",

In this work, we focus on the generation of entity-centric\ninformation-seeking questions from videos.

Our work addresses three key challenges:\nidentifying question-worthy information, linking it to entities, and\neffectively utilizing multimodal signals. Further, to the best of our\nknowledge, there does not exist a large-scale dataset for this task. Most video\nquestion generation datasets are on TV shows, movies, or human activities or\nlack entity-centric information-seeking questions. Hence, we contribute a\ndiverse dataset of YouTube videos, VideoQuestions, consisting of 411 videos\nwith 2265 manually annotated questions. We further propose a model architecture\ncombining Transformers, rich context signals (titles, transcripts, captions,\nembeddings), and a combination of cross-entropy and contrastive loss function\nto encourage entity-centric question generation.

For small values of Da we show that the\nmigration velocity is controlled mostly by $\\Phi_s$ and affected by an ion\nrelease only slightly.

    "abstract": "Disk galaxies viewed as thin planar structures resulting from the\nconservation of angular momentum of an initially rotating pre-galactic cloud\nallow merely a first-order model of galaxy formation. Still, the presence of\nvertically extended structures has allowed us to gather a deeper understanding\nof the richness in astrophysical processes (e.g., minor mergers, secular\nevolution) that ultimately result in the observed diversity in disk galaxies\nand their vertical extensions. We measure the stellar disk scale height of 46\nedge-on spiral galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in\nGalaxies (S$^{4}$G) project. This paper aims to investigate the radial\nvariation of the stellar disk vertical scale height and the existence of the\nso-called thick disk component in our sample. The measurements were done using\none-, two-, and three-dimensional profile fitting techniques using simple\nmodels. We found that two-thirds of our sample shows the presence of a thick\ndisk, suggesting that these galaxies have been accreting gaseous material from\ntheir surroundings. We found an average thick-to-thin disk scale height ratio\nof 2.65, which agrees with previous studies. Our findings also support the disk\nflaring model, which suggests that the vertical scale height increases with\nradius. We further found good correlations: between the scale height $h_{z}$\nand the scale length and between $h_z$ and the optical de Vaucouleurs radius\n$R_{25}$.",

However, existing methods for chart knowledge mining mainly focus\non converting chart images into raw data and often ignore their visual\nencodings and semantic meanings, which can result in information loss for many\ndownstream tasks. In this paper, we propose ChartKG, a novel knowledge graph\n(KG) based representation for chart images, which can model the visual elements\nin a chart image and semantic relations among them including visual encodings\nand visual insights in a unified manner. Further, we develop a general\nframework to convert chart images to the proposed KG-based representation. It\nintegrates a series of image processing techniques to identify visual elements\nand relations, e.g., CNNs to classify charts, yolov5 and optical character\nrecognition to parse charts, and rule-based methods to construct graphs. We\npresent four cases to illustrate how our knowledge-graph-based representation\ncan model the detailed visual elements and semantic relations in charts, and\nfurther demonstrate how our approach can benefit downstream applications such\nas semantic-aware chart retrieval and chart question answering.

Vaccine, a recent alignment-stage defense, applies uniform\nperturbation to all layers of embedding to make the model robust to the\nsimulated embedding drift. However, applying layer-wise uniform perturbation\nmay lead to excess perturbations for some particular safety-irrelevant layers,\nresulting in defense performance degradation and unnecessary memory\nconsumption. To address this limitation, we propose Targeted Vaccine\n(T-Vaccine), a memory-efficient safety alignment method that applies\nperturbation to only selected layers of the model. T-Vaccine follows two core\nsteps: First, it uses gradient norm as a statistical metric to identify the\nsafety-critical layers. Second, instead of applying uniform perturbation across\nall layers, T-Vaccine only applies perturbation to the safety-critical layers\nwhile keeping other layers frozen during training. Results show that T-Vaccine\noutperforms Vaccine in terms of both defense effectiveness and resource\nefficiency. Comparison with other defense baselines, e.g., RepNoise and TAR\nalso demonstrate the superiority of T-Vaccine.

Several\nstate-of-the-art methods for few-shot segmentation have emerged, including\ntext-based prompting for the task but suffer from sub-optimal performance for\nmedical images. Leveraging sub-pixel level features of existing Vision\nTransformer (ViT) based foundation models for identifying similar region of\ninterest (RoI) based on a single template image have been shown to be very\neffective for one shot segmentation and localization in medical images across\nmodalities.

In practice, however such an approach can fail to generalize\nin clinical data due to patient pose changes, inter-protocol variations even\nwithin a single modality or extend to 3D data using single template image.\nMoreover, for multi-label tasks, the RoI identification has to be performed\nsequentially.

Among these methods,\nweight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) is a promising approach that\ndecomposes weight matrices into magnitude and direction components to mimic\nfull fine-tuning (FT) better. However, DoRA's simultaneous optimization of\nthese components makes it over-expressive, increases the risk of overfitting,\nand creates a coupled updating pattern that limits its learning capacity. To\naddress these issues, we propose Bi-level Optimization-Based Weight-Decomposed\nLow-Rank Adaptation (BiDoRA), a novel PEFT method based on a bi-level\noptimization framework. BiDoRA fundamentally differs from DoRA by optimizing\nthe magnitude and direction in two separate, asynchronous loops using distinct\ntraining and validation data splits. This decoupled optimization process\neffectively mitigates overfitting and allows for more flexible updates that\nalign even more closely with FT. For instance, weight decomposition analysis\nshows BiDoRA achieves a magnitude-direction update correlation of $-8.042$,\nsignificantly closer to the FT ideal compared to $-1.784$ for DoRA. Evaluation\nof BiDoRA on diverse tasks spanning natural language understanding, generation,\ntoken classification, and extremely small biomedical datasets reveals that it\nconsistently outperforms DoRA and a wide range of leading PEFT methods. This\nimprovement is statistically significant, as demonstrated on the GLUE benchmark\nwhere BiDoRA surpasses DoRA with a p-value of $2.4\\times10^{-4}$ in terms of\nthe Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Our experiments demonstrate\nthat Surgical-LLaVA exhibits impressive multi-modal chat abilities in surgical\ncontexts, occasionally displaying multi-modal behaviors on unseen instructions.\nWe conduct a quantitative evaluation of visual question-answering datasets for\nsurgical scenarios.

    "abstract": "Deep learning technologies have significantly improved performance in the\nfield of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image target recognition compared to\ntraditional methods. However, the inherent ``black box\" property of deep\nlearning models leads to a lack of transparency in decision-making processes,\nmaking them difficult to be widespread applied in practice. To tackle this\nissue, this study proposes a physically explainable framework for\ncomplex-valued SAR image recognition, designed based on the physical process of\nmicrowave propagation. This framework utilizes complex-valued SAR data to\nexplore the amplitude and phase information and its intrinsic physical\nproperties. The network architecture is fully parameterized, with all learnable\nparameters endowed with clear physical meanings. Experiments on both the\ncomplex-valued MSTAR dataset and a self-built Qilu-1 complex-valued dataset\nwere conducted to validate the effectiveness of framework. The de-overlapping\ncapability of EMWaveNet enables accurate recognition of overlapping target\ncategories, whereas other models are nearly incapable of performing such\nrecognition. Against 0dB forest background noise, it boasts a 20\\% accuracy\nimprovement over traditional neural networks. When targets are 60\\% masked by\nnoise, it still outperforms other models by 9\\%. An end-to-end complex-valued\nsynthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) algorithm is\nconstructed to perform recognition tasks in interference SAR scenarios. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method possesses a strong physical\ndecision logic, high physical explainability and robustness, as well as\nexcellent de-aliasing capabilities. Finally, a perspective on future\napplications is provided.",

    "abstract": "Lossless Convexification (LCvx) is a modeling approach that transforms a\nclass of nonconvex optimal control problems, where nonconvexity primarily\narises from control constraints, into convex problems through convex\nrelaxations. These convex problems can be solved using polynomial-time\nnumerical methods after discretization, which converts the original\ninfinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. However, existing\nLCvx theory is limited to continuous-time optimal control problems, as the\nequivalence between the relaxed convex problem and the original nonconvex\nproblem holds only in continuous time. This paper extends LCvx to discrete-time\noptimal control problems by classifying them into normal and long-horizon\ncases. For normal cases, after an arbitrarily small perturbation to the system\ndynamics (recursive equality constraints), applying the existing LCvx method to\ndiscrete-time problems results in optimal controls that meet the original\nnonconvex constraints at all but no more than $n_x - 1$ temporal grid points,\nwhere $n_x$ is the state dimension. For long-horizon cases, the existing LCvx\nmethod fails, but we resolve this issue by integrating it with a bisection\nsearch, leveraging the continuity of the value function from the relaxed convex\nproblem to achieve similar results as in normal cases. This paper improves the\ntheoretical foundation of LCvx, expanding its applicability to real-world\ndiscrete-time optimal control problems.",

Because, for example,\nlidars have various resolutions and failures of radars may occur, such\nvariability often results in significant performance degradation in fusion. To\nthis end, we present tREADi, an adaptive inference system that accommodates the\nvariability of multimodal sensory data and thus enables robust and efficient\nperception. t-READi identifies variation-sensitive yet structure-specific model\nparameters; it then adapts only these parameters while keeping the rest intact.\nt-READi also leverages a cross-modality contrastive learning method to\ncompensate for the loss from missing modalities.

The FP collision model has several desirable properties,\nincluding its ability to preserve the quadratic nonlinearity of the CBE, unlike\nthat based on the common Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model. Rather than using an\nequivalent Langevin equation as a proxy, we construct our approach by directly\nmatching the changes in different discrete central moments independently\nsupported by the lattice under collision to those given by the CBE under the\nFP-guided collision model. This can be interpreted as a new path for the\ncollision process in terms of the relaxation of the various central moments to\n'equilibria', which we term as the Markovian central moment attractors that\ndepend on a diffusion coefficient tensor. The construction of the method using\ncentral moments rather than via distribution functions facilitates its\nnumerical implementation and analysis.

Existing GNNs usually rely on message\npassing, i.e., computing node representations by gathering information from the\nneighborhood, to build their underlying computational graphs. They are known\nfairly limited in expressive power, and often fail to capture global\ncharacteristics of graphs. To overcome the issue, a popular solution is to use\nLaplacian eigenvectors as additional node features, as they contain global\npositional information of nodes, and can serve as extra node identifiers aiding\nGNNs to separate structurally similar nodes. For such an approach, properly\nhandling the orthogonal group symmetry among eigenvectors with equal eigenvalue\nis crucial for its stability and generalizability. However, using a naive\northogonal group invariant encoder for each separate eigenspace may not keep\nthe full expressivity in the Laplacian eigenvectors. Moreover, computing such\ninvariants inevitably entails a hard split of Laplacian eigenvalues according\nto their numerical identity, which suffers from great instability when the\ngraph structure is perturbed.

Meanwhile, to guarantee\nthe operational reliability of the affine policy, a distributionally robust\njoint chance constraint (DRJCC) is introduced, which limits the violation\nprobability of operational constraints under the uncertainties of renewable\nenergy volatility. Furthermore, in the solving process, to mitigate the\nover-conservation in DRJCC decomposition, an improved risk allocation method is\nproposed, utilizing the correlations among violations under the affine policy.\nMoreover, to tackle the non-convexities arising from the variable HVF,\ncustomized approximations for HCNG flow formulations are developed. The problem\nis finally reformulated into a mix-integer second-order cone programming\nproblem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated both in\nsmall-scale and large-scale experiments.",

Many\nmethodologies were developed to save computational requirements and energy by\nreducing the precision of network weights at inference time and introducing\ntechniques such as rounding, stochastic rounding, and quantization. However,\nmost of these techniques still require full gradient precision at training\ntime, which makes training such models prohibitive on edge devices. This work\npresents a novel technique for training neural networks without needing\ngradients. This enables a training process where all the weights are one or two\nbits, without any hidden full precision computations. We show that it is\npossible to train models without gradient-based optimization techniques by\nidentifying erroneous contributions of each neuron towards the expected\nclassification and flipping the relevant bits using logical operations.

Despite\nVLMs' superior capabilities, researchers lack a comprehensive understanding of\ntheir compositionality -- the ability to understand and produce novel\ncombinations of known visual and textual components. Prior benchmarks provide\nonly a relatively rough compositionality evaluation from the perspectives of\nobjects, relations, and attributes while neglecting deeper reasoning about\nobject interactions, counting, and complex compositions. However,\ncompositionality is a critical ability that facilitates coherent reasoning and\nunderstanding across modalities for VLMs. To address this limitation, we\npropose MMCOMPOSITION, a novel human-annotated benchmark for comprehensively\nand accurately evaluating VLMs' compositionality. Our proposed benchmark serves\nas a complement to these earlier works. With MMCOMPOSITION, we can quantify and\nexplore the compositionality of the mainstream VLMs. Surprisingly, we find\nGPT-4o's compositionality inferior to the best open-source model, and we\nanalyze the underlying reasons.

For instance,\n\"express robbery\" has become a common crime committed by armed thieves, in\nwhich they drive motorcycles and assault people in public in a matter of\nseconds. Recent research has approached the problem by embedding weapon\ndetectors in surveillance cameras; however, these systems are prone to false\npositives if no counterpart confirms the event. In light of this, we present a\ndistributed IoT system that integrates a computer vision pipeline and object\ndetection capabilities into multiple end-devices, constantly monitoring for the\npresence of firearms and sharp weapons. Once a weapon is detected, the\nend-device sends a series of frames to a cloud server that implements a 3DCNN\nto classify the scene as either a robbery or a normal situation, thus\nminimizing false positives. The deep learning process to train and deploy\nweapon detection models uses a custom dataset with 16,799 images of firearms\nand sharp weapons. The best-performing model, YOLOv5s, optimized using\nTensorRT, achieved a final mAP of 0.87 running at 4.43 FPS. Additionally, the\n3DCNN demonstrated 0.88 accuracy in detecting abnormal situations.

It is known\nthat in the near-field airflow of a quadrotor, the aerodynamic effects induced\nby the propellers are complex and difficult to characterize. Although machine\nlearning tools can potentially be used to derive models that capture these\neffects, these data-driven approaches can be sample inefficient and the\nresulting models often do not generalize as well as their first-principles\ncounterparts. In this work, we propose a framework that combines the benefits\nof first-principles modeling and data-driven approaches to construct an\naccurate and sample efficient representation of the complex aerodynamic effects\nresulting from quadrotors flying in formation. The data-driven component within\nour model is lightweight, making it amenable for optimization-based control\ndesign. Through simulations and physical experiments, we show that\nincorporating the model into a novel learning-based nonlinear model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) framework results in substantial performance improvements in\nterms of trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. In particular, our\nframework significantly outperforms nominal MPC in physical experiments,\nachieving a 40.1% improvement in the average trajectory tracking errors and a\n57.5% reduction in the maximum vertical separation errors. Our framework also\nachieves exceptional sample efficiency, using only a total of 46 seconds of\nflight data for training across both simulations and physical experiments.\nFurthermore, with our proposed framework, the quadrotors achieve an\nexceptionally tight formation, flying with an average separation of less than\n1.5 body lengths throughout the flight.

    "abstract": "Understanding the mountain pine beetle's dispersal patterns is critical for\nevaluating its threat to Canada's boreal forests. It is generally believed that\nhigher beetle densities lead to increased long-distance dispersal due to\naggregation pheromones becoming repellent at high densities, causing beetles to\nseek areas with less competition. However, using helicopter surveys of infested\ntrees, along with statistical models, we find no evidence supporting a positive\nrelationship. Instead, we observe a weak negative association between\npopulation density and dispersal at all spatial scales. A possible explanation\nis that at low population densities, beetles cannot successfully attack healthy\ntrees and must travel farther to find weakened hosts. Even so, the influence of\nbeetle density on dispersal is minor compared to the spatiotemporal variation\nin the overall (density-independent) scale of dispersal, as revealed by our\nmodels. This variation accounts for the MPB's erratic range expansion across\nwestern Alberta, which varied from 20 km to 220 km annually.",

While previous studies\npoint out the overconfidence phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nshow that LLMs trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\nare overconfident with a more sharpened output probability, in this study, we\nreveal that RLHF tends to lead models to express verbalized overconfidence in\ntheir own responses. We investigate the underlying cause of this overconfidence\nand demonstrate that reward models used for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\nexhibit inherent biases towards high-confidence scores regardless of the actual\nquality of responses. Building upon this insight, we propose two PPO variants:\nPPO-M: PPO with Calibrated Reward Modeling and PPO-C: PPO with Calibrated\nReward Calculation. PPO-M integrates explicit confidence scores in reward model\ntraining, which calibrates reward models to better capture the alignment\nbetween response quality and verbalized confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward\nscore during PPO based on the difference between the current reward and the\nexponential average of past rewards. Both PPO-M and PPO-C can be seamlessly\nintegrated into the current PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden\nlabels.

It maintains a nearly\nconstant blackbody temperature of $\\sim$22,000 K in the late time. Its optical\nand UV spectra show hydrogen and helium broad emission lines with full width at\nhalf maxima of 7,000--21,000 km s$^{-1}$ and He II/H$\\alpha$ ratio of 0.3--2.3.\nIt shows weak X-ray emission relative to UV emission, with X-ray flares lasting\nfor $<2-3$ weeks, during which the spectrum is soft with a power-law index\n$\\Gamma=4.4^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$. These characters are consistent with a tidal\ndisruption event (TDE), ruling out the possibilities of a supernova or an\nactive galactic nuclei flare. With a TDE model, we infer a peak UV luminosity\nof $3.3\\pm0.2\\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and an energy budget of\n$4.5\\pm0.2\\times10^{51}$ erg. The two optical flares separated by $10.3\\pm0.3$\nyears can be interpreted as repeating partial TDEs, double TDEs, or two\nindependent TDEs. Although no definitive conclusion can be drawn, the partial\nTDEs interpretation predicts a third flare around 2033, and the independent\nTDEs interpretation predicts a high TDE rate of $\\gtrsim10^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ in\nF01004-2237, both of which can be tested by future observations.",

The penetration of tidal energy in the electrical grid\ndepends on the accuracy of tidal current speed forecasting. Modeling\ninaccuracies hinder forecast accuracy. Previous research has primarily used\nphysical models to forecast tidal current speed. However, tidal current\nvariations influenced by the orbital periods of celestial bodies make accurate\nphysical modeling challenging. Researching the multi-periodicity of tides is\ncrucial for accurately forecasting tidal current speed. In this article, we\npropose the Wavelet-Enhanced Convolutional Network (WCN) to learn\nmulti-periodicity. The framework embeds intra-period and inter-period\nvariations of one-dimensional tidal current data into the rows and columns of a\ntwo-dimensional tensor. Then, the two-dimensional variations of the sequence\ncan be processed by convolutional kernels. We integrate a time-frequency\nanalysis method into the framework to further address local periodic features.\nAdditionally, to enhance the framework's stability, we optimize the framework's\nhyperparameters with the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator algorithm. The\nproposed framework avoids the lack of learning multi-periodicity.

    "abstract": "Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained significant recognition in the field\nof semantic segmentation due to its versatile capabilities and impressive\nperformance. Despite its success, SAM faces two primary limitations: (1) it\nrelies heavily on meticulous human-provided prompts like key points, bounding\nboxes or text messages, which is labor-intensive; (2) the mask decoder's\nfeature representation is sometimes inaccurate, as it solely employs dot\nproduct operations at the end of mask decoder, which inadequately captures the\nnecessary correlations for precise segmentation. Current solutions to these\nproblems such as fine-tuning SAM often require retraining a large number of\nparameters, which needs huge amount of time and computing resources. To address\nthese limitations, we propose an automated prompting and mask calibration\nmethod called AM-SAM based on a bi-level optimization framework. Our approach\nautomatically generates prompts for an input image, eliminating the need for\nhuman involvement with a good performance in early training epochs, achieving\nfaster convergence. Additionally, we freeze the main part of SAM, and modify\nthe mask decoder with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enhancing the mask decoder's\nfeature representation by incorporating advanced techniques that go beyond\nsimple dot product operations to more accurately capture and utilize feature\ncorrelations. Our experimental results demonstrate that AM-SAM achieves\nsignificantly accurate segmentation, matching or exceeding the effectiveness of\nhuman-generated and default prompts.

Traditional IR systems, while effective in\ndomains like web search, are constrained by their reliance on static,\npre-defined information items. To this end, this paper introduces agentic\ninformation retrieval (Agentic IR), a transformative next-generation paradigm\nfor IR driven by large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. The central shift\nin agentic IR is the evolving definition of ``information'' from static,\npre-defined information items to dynamic, context-dependent information states.\nInformation state refers to a particular information context that the user is\nright in within a dynamic environment, encompassing not only the acquired\ninformation items but also real-time user preferences, contextual factors, and\ndecision-making processes. In such a way, traditional information retrieval,\nfocused on acquiring relevant information items based on user queries, can be\nnaturally extended to achieving the target information state given the user\ninstruction, which thereby defines the agentic information retrieval. We\nsystematically discuss agentic IR from various aspects, i.e., task formulation,\narchitecture, evaluation, case studies, as well as challenges and future\nprospects. We believe that the concept of agentic IR introduced in this paper\nnot only broadens the scope of information retrieval research but also lays the\nfoundation for a more adaptive, interactive, and intelligent next-generation IR\nparadigm.",

In this\narticle, we introduce random effects SDR, where cluster-specific random effect\ncentral subspaces are assumed to follow a distribution on the Grassmann\nmanifold, and the random effects distribution is characterized by a covariance\nmatrix that captures the heterogeneity between clusters in the SDR process\nitself. We incorporate random effect SDR within a model-based inverse\nregression framework. Specifically, we propose a random effects principal\nfitted components model, where a two-stage algorithm is used to estimate the\noverall fixed effect central subspace, and predict the cluster-specific random\neffect central subspaces. We demonstrate the consistency of the proposed\nestimators, while simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of\nthe proposed approach compared to global and cluster-specific SDR approaches.\nWe also present extensions of the above model to handle mixed predictors,\ndemonstrating how random effects SDR can be achieved in the case of mixed\ncontinuous and binary covariates. Applying the proposed methods to study the\nlongitudinal association between the life expectancy of women and socioeconomic\nvariables across 117 countries, we find log income per capita, infant\nmortality, and income inequality are the main drivers of a two-dimensional\nfixed effect central subspace, although there is considerable heterogeneity in\nhow the country-specific central subspaces are driven by the predictors.",

Early warning signals for these events are crucial for\ndecision-making in fields such as ecology, biology and climate science. Generic\nearly warning signals motivated by dynamical systems theory have had mixed\nsuccess on real noisy data. More recent studies found that deep learning\nclassifiers trained on synthetic data could improve performance. However,\nneither of these methods take advantage of historical, system-specific data.\nHere, we introduce an approach that trains machine learning classifiers\ndirectly on surrogate data of past transitions, namely surrogate data-based\nmachine learning (SDML). The approach provides early warning signals in\nempirical and experimental data from geology, climatology, sociology, and\ncardiology with higher sensitivity and specificity than two widely used generic\nearly warning signals -- variance and lag-1 autocorrelation. Since the approach\nis trained directly on surrogates of historical data, it is not bound by the\nrestricting assumption of a local bifurcation like previous methods. This\nsystem-specific approach can contribute to improved early warning signals to\nhelp humans better prepare for or avoid undesirable critical transitions.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting the representation and generalization powers has been a\nlong-standing issue in the field of machine learning (ML) and artificial\nintelligence. This work contributes to uncovering the emergence of universal\nscaling laws in quantum-probabilistic ML. We take the generative tensor network\n(GTN) in the form of a matrix product state as an example and show that with an\nuntrained GTN (such as a random TN state), the negative logarithmic likelihood\n(NLL) $L$ generally increases linearly with the number of features $M$, i.e.,\n$L \\simeq k M + const$. This is a consequence of the so-called ``catastrophe of\northogonality,'' which states that quantum many-body states tend to become\nexponentially orthogonal to each other as $M$ increases. We reveal that while\ngaining information through training, the linear scaling law is suppressed by a\nnegative quadratic correction, leading to $L \\simeq \\beta M - \\alpha M^2 +\nconst$. The scaling coefficients exhibit logarithmic relationships with the\nnumber of training samples and the number of quantum channels $\\chi$. The\nemergence of the quadratic correction term in NLL for the testing (training)\nset can be regarded as evidence of the generalization (representation) power of\nGTN. Over-parameterization can be identified by the deviation in the values of\n$\\alpha$ between training and testing sets while increasing $\\chi$. We further\ninvestigate how orthogonality in the quantum feature map relates to the\nsatisfaction of quantum probabilistic interpretation, as well as to the\nrepresentation and generalization powers of GTN. The unveiling of universal\nscaling laws in quantum-probabilistic ML would be a valuable step toward\nestablishing a white-box ML scheme interpreted within the quantum probabilistic\nframework.",

To\nachieve this, we conduct synthetic experiments where the objective is to learn\nOOD mathematical functions through ICL using a GPT-2 model. We reveal that\nTransformers may struggle to learn OOD task functions through ICL.\nSpecifically, ICL performance resembles implementing a function within the\npretraining hypothesis space and optimizing it with gradient descent based on\nthe in-context examples. Additionally, we investigate ICL's well-documented\nability to learn unseen abstract labels in context. We demonstrate that such\nability only manifests in the scenarios without distributional shifts and,\ntherefore, may not serve as evidence of new-task-learning ability. Furthermore,\nwe assess ICL's performance on OOD tasks when the model is pretrained on\nmultiple tasks. Both empirical and theoretical analyses demonstrate the\nexistence of the \\textbf{low-test-error preference} of ICL, where it tends to\nimplement the pretraining function that yields low test error in the testing\ncontext.

This suggests that significant\nimprovements could be achieved through effective coordination of neural solvers\nat the instance level. In this work, we propose the first general framework to\ncoordinate the neural solvers, which involves feature extraction, selection\nmodel, and selection strategy, aiming to allocate each instance to the most\nsuitable solvers.

We evaluated our framework on two\nextensively studied combinatorial optimization problems, Traveling Salesman\nProblem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Experimental\nresults show that the proposed framework can effectively distribute instances\nand the resulting composite solver can achieve significantly better performance\n(e.g., reduce the optimality gap by 0.88\\% on TSPLIB and 0.71\\% on CVRPLIB)\nthan the best individual neural solver with little extra time cost.",

    "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the bread and butter of Large Language Model\n(LLM) finetuning. LoRA learns an additive low-rank perturbation, $AB$, of a\npretrained matrix parameter $W$ to align the model to a new task or dataset\nwith $W+AB$. We identify three core limitations to LoRA for finetuning--a\nsetting that employs limited amount of data and training steps. First, LoRA\nemploys Dropout to prevent overfitting. We prove that Dropout is only suitable\nfor long training episodes but fails to converge to a reliable regularizer for\nshort training episodes. Second, LoRA's initialization of $B$ at $0$ creates a\nslow training dynamic between $A$ and $B$. That dynamic is also exacerbated by\nDropout that further slows the escape from $0$ for $B$ which is particularly\nharmful for short training episodes. Third, the scaling factor multiplying each\nLoRA additive perturbation creates ``short-sighted'' interactions between the\nLoRA modules of different layers. Motivated by principled analysis of those\nlimitations, we find an elegant solution: a Dropout-free, scaling-free, LoRA\nwith Adaptive Learning rate--coined ALLoRA. By scaling the per sample and per\nparameter gradients with a coefficient inversely proportional to parameters'\n$\\ell_2$ norm, ALLoRA alleviates those three limitations. As a by-product,\nALLoRA removes two hyper-parameters from LoRA: the scaling factor and the\ndropout rate. Empirical results show that ALLoRA admits better accuracy than\nLoRA on various settings, including against recent LoRA variants such as\nWeight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA).

An expert takes the form of\na lightweight adapter added on the top of a frozen base model. During\ninference, an incoming query is first routed to the most relevant expert which\nis then loaded onto the base model for the forward pass. Unlike typical Mixture\nof Experts (MoE) models, the experts in our method do not work with other\nexperts for a single query. Hence, we dub them \"introvert\" experts.

Training of all experts can be done\nin parallel without any communication channels between them. Similarly, the\ninference can also be heavily parallelized by distributing experts on different\nGPUs and routing each request to the GPU containing its relevant expert.

To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce a new hierarchical RL framework that enhances\nthe efficiency and optimality of task generalization. At the high level, we\npresent an implicit planner specifically designed for generalizing\ncompositional tasks. This planner selects the next sub-task and estimates the\nmulti-step return for completing the remaining task to complete from the\ncurrent state. It learns a latent transition model and performs planning in the\nlatent space by using a graph neural network (GNN). Subsequently, the\nhigh-level planner's selected sub-task guides the low-level agent to\neffectively handle long-horizon tasks, while the multi-step return encourages\nthe low-level policy to account for future sub-task dependencies, enhancing its\noptimality.

The method we\ndeveloped applies to a special class of constrained manifold optimization\nproblems and is one of the first which generates a sequence of feasible points\nwhich converges to a KKT point. We validate our model and method through\nnumerical experimentation. Our first experiment presents a generalized version\nof semidefinite programming which allows novel eigenvalue constraints, and our\nsecond numerical experiment compares our method to the classical semidefinite\nrelaxation approach for solving QCQPs. For the QCQP numerical experiments, we\ndemonstrate our method is able to dominate the classical state-of-the-art\napproach, solving more than ten times as many problems compared to the standard\nsolution procedure.",

    "abstract": "Distribution shifts between operational domains can severely affect the\nperformance of learned models in self-driving vehicles (SDVs). While this is a\nwell-established problem, prior work has mostly explored naive solutions such\nas fine-tuning, focusing on the motion prediction task. In this work, we\nexplore novel adaptation strategies for differentiable autonomy stacks\nconsisting of prediction, planning, and control, perform evaluation in\nclosed-loop, and investigate the often-overlooked issue of catastrophic\nforgetting. Specifically, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques: a\nlow-rank residual decoder (LoRD) and multi-task fine-tuning. Through\nexperiments across three models conducted on two real-world autonomous driving\ndatasets (nuPlan, exiD), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and\nhighlight a significant performance gap between open-loop and closed-loop\nevaluation in prior approaches. Our approach improves forgetting by up to\n23.33% and the closed-loop OOD driving score by 9.93% in comparison to standard\nfine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and sustainable crop production process management is crucial to\nmeet the growing global demand for food, fuel, and feed while minimizing\nenvironmental impacts. Traditional crop management practices, often developed\nthrough empirical experience, face significant challenges in adapting to the\ndynamic nature of modern agriculture, which is influenced by factors such as\nclimate change, soil variability, and market conditions. Recently,\nreinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) bring\ntransformative potential, with RL providing adaptive methodologies to learn\noptimal strategies and LLMs offering vast, superhuman knowledge across\nagricultural domains, enabling informed, context-specific decision-making. This\npaper systematically examines how the integration of RL and LLMs into crop\nmanagement decision support systems (DSSs) can drive advancements in\nagricultural practice. We explore recent advancements in RL and LLM algorithms,\ntheir application within crop management, and the use of crop management\nsimulators to develop these technologies. The convergence of RL and LLMs with\ncrop management DSSs presents new opportunities to optimize agricultural\npractices through data-driven, adaptive solutions that can address the\nuncertainties and complexities of crop production. However, this integration\nalso brings challenges, particularly in real-world deployment. We discuss these\nchallenges and propose potential solutions, including the use of offline RL and\nenhanced LLM integration, to maximize the effectiveness and sustainability of\ncrop management. Our findings emphasize the need for continued research and\ninnovation to unlock the full potential of these advanced tools in transforming\nagricultural systems into optimal and controllable ones.",

    "abstract": "Recent work introduced the concept of human teleoperation (HT), where the\nremote robot typically considered in conventional bilateral teleoperation is\nreplaced by a novice person wearing a mixed reality head mounted display and\ntracking the motion of a virtual tool controlled by an expert. HT has\nadvantages in cost, complexity, and patient acceptance for telemedicine in\nlow-resource communities or remote locations. However, the stability,\ntransparency, and performance of bilateral HT are unexplored. In this paper, we\ntherefore develop a mathematical model and simulation of the HT system using\ntest data. We then analyze various control architectures with this model and\nimplement them with the HT system to find the achievable performance,\ninvestigate stability, and determine the most promising teleoperation scheme in\nthe presence of time delays. We show that instability in HT, while not\ndestructive or dangerous, makes the system impossible to use. However, stable\nand transparent teleoperation are possible with small time delays (<200 ms)\nthrough 3-channel teleoperation, or with large time delays through\nmodel-mediated teleoperation with local pose and force feedback for the novice.",

    "abstract": "The information exponent (Ben Arous et al. [2021]) -- which is equivalent to\nthe lowest degree in the Hermite expansion of the link function for Gaussian\nsingle-index models -- has played an important role in predicting the sample\ncomplexity of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in various learning\ntasks. In this work, we demonstrate that, for multi-index models, focusing\nsolely on the lowest degree can miss key structural details of the model and\nresult in suboptimal rates.\n  Specifically, we consider the task of learning target functions of form\n$f_*(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{P} \\phi(\\mathbf{v}_k^* \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$, where\n$P \\ll d$, the ground-truth directions $\\{ \\mathbf{v}_k^* \\}_{k=1}^P$ are\northonormal, and only the second and $2L$-th Hermite coefficients of the link\nfunction $\\phi$ can be nonzero. Based on the theory of information exponent,\nwhen the lowest degree is $2L$, recovering the directions requires\n$d^{2L-1}\\mathrm{poly}(P)$ samples, and when the lowest degree is $2$, only the\nrelevant subspace (not the exact directions) can be recovered due to the\nrotational invariance of the second-order terms. In contrast, we show that by\nconsidering both second- and higher-order terms, we can first learn the\nrelevant space via the second-order terms, and then the exact directions using\nthe higher-order terms, and the overall sample and complexity of online SGD is\n$d \\mathrm{poly}(P)$.",

However,\ntraditional studies predominantly consider a static crystal lattice, focusing\nexclusively on the pure-electronic quantum geometry of the Hilbert space\nparameterized by electronic wave vectors, thereby overlooking the dynamic\neffects arising from phonons and their coupling with electrons. In this work,\nwe reveal the intrinsic quantum geometry of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC),\nwhich resides in the hybrid Hilbert space parameterized by both the electronic\nwave vectors and phonon displacements. The EPC quantum metric, EPC Berry\ncurvature and EPC shift vector, as central elements, quantify the EPC-induced\nvelocity, polarization, and anomalous charge-center shift, respectively. We\nfurther connect this geometry to phonon-mediated optical responses,\nparticularly in-gap resonances, enabling experimental detection and\ncharacterization of EPC quantum geometry.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning enables the collaborative learning of a global model on\ndiverse data, preserving data locality and eliminating the need to transfer\nuser data to a central server. However, data privacy remains vulnerable, as\nattacks can target user training data by exploiting the updates sent by users\nduring each learning iteration. Secure aggregation protocols are designed to\nmask/encrypt user updates and enable a central server to aggregate the masked\ninformation. MicroSecAgg (PoPETS 2024) proposes a single server secure\naggregation protocol that aims to mitigate the high communication complexity of\nthe existing approaches by enabling a one-time setup of the secret to be\nre-used in multiple training iterations. In this paper, we identify a security\nflaw in the MicroSecAgg that undermines its privacy guarantees. We detail the\nsecurity flaw and our attack, demonstrating how an adversary can exploit\npredictable masking values to compromise user privacy. Our findings highlight\nthe critical need for enhanced security measures in secure aggregation\nprotocols, particularly the implementation of dynamic and unpredictable masking\nstrategies. We propose potential countermeasures to mitigate these\nvulnerabilities and ensure robust privacy protection in the secure aggregation\nframeworks.",
