    "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) -- each\noptimized for different strengths, style, or latency/cost profile -- routing\nhas become an essential technique to operationalize the use of different\nmodels. However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways:\nthey evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human\npreferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select\nfrom a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned\nrouting framework that guides model selection by matching queries to\nuser-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) --\noffering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions.\nSpecifically, we introduce \\textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that\nlearns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions.\nOur approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without\nrequiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on\nconversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top\nproprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and\nmakes routing decisions more transparent and flexible.

    "abstract": "Graph machine learning has led to a significant increase in the capabilities\nof models that learn on arbitrary graph-structured data and has been applied to\nmolecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation, among\nother domains. Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be\nconstructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) -\na new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without\ntraditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data,\nrelational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by\nprimary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables, (ii)\nthe structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a\ndatabase, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in\nnature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first\nintroducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity\ngraphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to\ndevelop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges\nincluding large-scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling\ntemporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational\nneural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for\nrelational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these\ndistinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple\nsub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models\nthat can transform the processing of relational data.",

For instance, the instruction \"Hang a mug on the mug\ntree\" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches\nto choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on\nend-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and\nlow-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to\ntheir lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks\nspecified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a\nVision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language\ninstructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable\nintermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception\nmodule to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by\nintegrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities\nin instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of\ncurrent imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and\nenvironmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging\nmanipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and\nmulti-object interactions.",

Distributional\nassumptions facilitate the design of efficient algorithms but also limit their\nreach and relevance. Towards addressing this, we prove a distributional-lifting\ntheorem: This upgrades a learner that succeeds with respect to a limited\ndistribution family $\\mathcal{D}$ to one that succeeds with respect to any\ndistribution $D^\\star$, with an efficiency overhead that scales with the\ncomplexity of expressing $D^\\star$ as a mixture of distributions in\n$\\mathcal{D}$.\n  Recent work of Blanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan considered the special case of\nlifting uniform-distribution learners and designed a lifter that uses a\nconditional sample oracle for $D^\\star$, a strong form of access not afforded\nby the standard PAC model. Their approach, which draws on ideas from\nsemi-supervised learning, first learns $D^\\star$ and then uses this information\nto lift.\n  We show that their approach is information-theoretically intractable with\naccess only to random examples, thereby giving formal justification for their\nuse of the conditional sample oracle. We then take a different approach that\nsidesteps the need to learn $D^\\star$, yielding a lifter that works in the\nstandard PAC model and enjoys additional advantages: it works for all base\ndistribution families, preserves the noise tolerance of learners, has better\nsample complexity, and is simpler.",

In\nparticular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level\nissue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been\nsignificant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving\nsuch issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately\nsuspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper\nunderstanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics.\nConsequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user\nissue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue,\ncode, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete -\nidentifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through\na novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant\ncontext, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c)\nisolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d)\nleverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that\nproposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant\nfixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our\nmethodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark\nbeating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of\n7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding.\nWe note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring\nmulti-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that\nincorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust\nand semantically consistent repairs.",

    "abstract": "Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to\ntheir high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for recovery\nof large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by\nreformulating the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using the\nBurer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a non-convex but low-rank\nparameterization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained\nformulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive semidefinite\nconstraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during\noptimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with\nthe unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The\nresulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we\ndemonstrate its tractability using limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). Importantly,\nwe also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover\ncertain large quantum states with Pauli-based POVM measurements. Our low-memory\nalgorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require\nthe density matrix to have a matrix product state (MPS) or other tensor\nstructure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm\nrequires just $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log d)$ complexity per iteration to recover a $d\n\\times d$ density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can\nbe used to give a rigorous termination criterion.

To compare the properties and\nprogenitor galaxies of the Intracluster Light (ICL) and Brightest Cluster\nGalaxies (BCGs) of clusters and groups at redshift z = 0, and determine how\nthey coevolve. Methods. We select 127 clusters and groups in the hydrodynamic\nIllustris-TNG100 simulation above a mass of $10^{13} M_\\odot$. We divide the\nICL from the BCG by applying a surface brightness cut at the Holmberg radius of\n26.5 mag/arcsec$^{-2}$, where star particles within this radius are defined as\nbeing attached to the BCG, and outside, the ICL. We then study the properties\nand formation history of the ICL and BCG. Results. We find the ICL is generally\ncomposed of material from stripped or merged intermediate mass galaxies, with a\nsmaller in-situ component, while the BCG is composed of more massive merged\ngalaxies and has a larger in-situ fraction. The ICL mass fraction increases\nweakly with cluster mass, declines with concentration and increases with time\nsince the BCGs most recent major merger. The ICL is bluer and more metal-poor\nthan the BCG, but there is no significant difference in the age of the\nmaterial. Universally, BCG+ICL systems have negative colour and metallicity\ngradients. The ICL and BCG share a high fraction of progenitor galaxies, but\nthe most significant progenitor is frequently not shared. Conclusions. ICL\nproperties and formation are tied to the formation histories of the host\ncluster and BCG, and thus their properties are individual to each system.\nAlthough the ICL and BCG coevolve, they have distinct formation histories and\nproperties.",

Employing scanning\ntunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we visualize a tetragonal\nsymmetry breaking of heavy electronic states around the Fermi level. Through\nsystematically investigating the temperature and energy dependence of\nspectroscopic data, we find that the nematic state coincides with the formation\nof heavy quasi-particles driven by band hybridization. Remarkably, using spin\npolarized STM, we demonstrate that the nematic state is spin polarized, which\nnot only suggests its intrinsically electronic nature, but also represents the\nunique magnetic texture of nematic heavy fermions. Our findings unveil a novel\ncorrelation-mediated order whose mechanism is inherently tied to Kondo-lattice\nphysics.

    "abstract": "Requirements over strings, commonly represented using natural language (NL),\nare particularly relevant for software systems due to their heavy reliance on\nstring data manipulation. While individual requirements can usually be analyzed\nmanually, verifying properties (e.g., satisfiability) over sets of NL\nrequirements is particularly challenging. Formal approaches (e.g., SMT solvers)\nmay efficiently verify such properties, but are known to have theoretical\nlimitations. Additionally, the translation of NL requirements into formal\nconstraints typically requires significant manual effort. Recently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal\nreasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings\nis less studied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that verifies\nthe satisfiability of NL requirements over strings by using LLMs (1) to derive\na satisfiability outcome (and a consistent string, if possible), and (2) to\ngenerate declarative (i.e., SMT) and imperative (i.e., Python) checkers, used\nto validate the correctness of (1). In our experiments, we assess the\nperformance of four LLMs. Results show that LLMs effectively translate natural\nlanguage into checkers, even achieving perfect testing accuracy for\nPython-based checkers. These checkers substantially help LLMs in generating a\nconsistent string and accurately identifying unsatisfiable requirements,\nleading to more than doubled generation success rate and F1-score in certain\ncases compared to baselines without generated checkers.",

Although\nthere are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still\nhave limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different\nlevels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little\ndiscussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the\ngap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely\nGeoGuess.

A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be\nable to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate\nwith vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability\nto reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge.

    "abstract": "Geospatial datasets on the long-term evolution of road networks are scarce,\nhampering our quantitative understanding of how the contemporary road network\nhas evolved over the course of the 20th century. However, such information is\ncrucial to better understand the dynamics of road network growth and expansion,\nand to shed light on the consequences of (sub-) urbanization processes, such as\nincreasing mobility, traffic congestion, land take and transportation\ninequality. Herein, we describe CHRONEX-US ('City-level historical road network\nexpansion dataset for the conterminous United States'), a geospatial vector\ndataset reporting estimates of the construction year for each road segment in\ndensely and semi-densely built-up spaces within 693 core-based statistical\nareas (i.e., Metropolitan and Micropolitan statistical areas) in the\nconterminous US. CHRONEX-US is based on the USGS National Transportation\nDataset (NTD), integrated with the historical settlement compilation for the US\n(HISDAC-US). CHRONEX-US reports model-based construction epoch estimates for\nlocal residential road network segments within urban and peri-urban areas,\nusing different model-based scenarios. The vector data inherit topological\nintegrity from the NTD data allowing for routing and other connectivity-based\nanalyses within temporal strata of urban road networks. CHRONEX-US vector\ngeometries are attributed with the US Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER Feature Class\nCode (MTFCC), enabling stratification of the data by road category.

This limits\ncontextual understanding and leads to practical issues like repetitive\nnavigation behaviors.

    "abstract": "Effectively engaging the public with science is vital for fostering trust and\nunderstanding in our scientific community. Yet, with an ever-growing volume of\ninformation, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will\nperceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a\ncomputational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,\nsuch as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,\nwe create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations\nfrom 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable\ninsights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We\nfurther develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong\nperformance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of\nscience from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors\naffect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a\npredictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement\nwith science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption\nis the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal\ninfluence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully\ndesigned natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public\nperception of scientific information has direct connections with the final\nengagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive\nsignificantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different\nscientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.\nOverall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception\nmodeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public\ninterest and engagement with scientific content.",

To better\nunderstand this mechanism in CLMRs, a data driven thermal model is developed to\nanalyze localized heating effects within the resonator body, which are known to\naccelerate electromigration. Based on insights from this model, Aluminum\nSilicon Copper (AlSiCu) was selected for the IDTs due to its superior thermal\nstability and resistance to electromigration. Devices fabricated with AlSiCu\nexhibited no signs of performance degradation, with the best-performing\nresonator achieving a mechanical quality factor (Qm) of 360, a maximum Bode\nquality factor (QBode) of 500, and an electromechanical coupling coefficient\n(kt2) of 6.3%. Moreover, the use of AlSiCu significantly increased the maximum\ninput power the device can withstand, showing an improvement of up to 6 dBm\nover previous devices.

Understanding how the outputs of galaxy model fitting\nrespond to weak-lensing shear distortions is crucial for accurate shear\nestimation and mitigating shear-related systematics in weak lensing image\nanalyses. In this paper, we investigate how the fitted parameters -\nspecifically flux, size, and shape - respond to weak-lensing shear distortions\nwithin the AnaCal framework. To achieve this, we introduce quintuple numbers, a\nnovel algebraic system inspired by dual numbers from automatic differentiation.\nQuintuple numbers enable the propagation of shear response information\nthroughout the entire model-fitting process by linking analytical pixel shear\nresponses to those of the fitted parameters. We integrate quintuple numbers\ninto the AnaCal framework to derive the shear responses of shapes estimated\nwith model fitting and validate the pipeline using image simulations that\ninclude realistic blending.

However, they have had limited use in representing\npatterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in\nsubgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience.\nNeural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult\nto decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph\nFourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or\nspectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown\npromise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly\nconfined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that\nuses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian\nharmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant\nsubgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce\ncanonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing\nenergy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated\nSlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and\ntwo traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional\nGNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines\nin all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns\nfrom SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns,\nand thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here\nwe have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for\nother downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both\nfor prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data.",

The\nmodel performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss\nfunction to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an\nensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models.\nExperimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD,\nKonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021.

Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the\ngeneralizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721\nto 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets.

    "abstract": "Spintronics has emerged as a key technology for fast and non-volatile memory\nwith great CMOS compatibility. As the building blocks for these cutting-edge\ndevices, magnetic materials require precise characterization of their critical\nproperties, such as the effective anisotropy field ($H_{\\rm{k,eff}}$, related\nto magnetic stability) and damping ($\\alpha$ key factor in device energy\nefficiency). Accurate measurements of these properties are essential for\ndesigning and fabricating high-performance spintronic devices. Among advanced\nmetrology techniques, Time-resolved Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (TR-MOKE)\nstands out for its superb temporal and spatial resolutions, surpassing\ntraditional methods like ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). However, the full\npotential of TR-MOKE has not yet been fully pledged due to the lack of\nsystematic optimization and robust operational guidelines. In this study, we\naddress this gap by developing experimentally validated guidelines for\noptimizing TR-MOKE metrology across materials with perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy (PMA) and in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Our work identifies\nthe optimal ranges of the field angle to simultaneously achieve high signal\namplitudes and improve measurement sensitivities to $H_{\\rm{k,eff}}$ and\n$\\alpha$. By suppressing the influence of inhomogeneities and boosting\nsensitivity, our work significantly enhances TR-MOKE capability to extract\nmagnetic properties with high accuracy and reliability. This optimization\nframework positions TR-MOKE as an indispensable tool for advancing spintronics,\npaving the way for energy-efficient and high-speed devices that will redefine\nthe landscape of modern computing and memory technologies.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores how zero-knowledge proofs can enhance Bitcoin's\nfunctionality and privacy. First, we consider Proof-of-Reserve schemes: by\nusing zk-STARKs, a custodian can prove its Bitcoin holdings are more than a\npredefined threshold X, without revealing addresses or actual balances. We\noutline a STARK-based protocol for Bitcoin UTXOs and discuss its efficiency.\nSecond, we examine ZK Light Clients, where a mobile or lightweight device\nverifies Bitcoin's proof-of-work chain using succinct proofs. We propose a\nprotocol for generating and verifying a STARK-based proof of a chain of block\nheaders, enabling trust-minimized client operation. Third, we explore\nPrivacy-Preserving Rollups via BitVM: leveraging BitVM, we design a conceptual\nrollup that keeps transaction data confidential using zero-knowledge proofs. In\neach case, we analyze security, compare with existing approaches, and discuss\nimplementation considerations. Our contributions include the design of concrete\nprotocols adapted to Bitcoin's UTXO model and an assessment of their\npracticality. The results suggest that while ZK proofs can bring powerful\nfeatures (e.g., on-chain reserve audits, trustless light clients, and private\nlayer-2 execution) to Bitcoin, each application requires careful trade-offs in\nefficiency and trust assumptions.",

We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether\nan LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing\nconsistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing\nbetween prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs\nacross diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater\nshare of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more\nrobust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do\nnot consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their\nadvantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the\nimportance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic\ndiagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's\ninternal understanding of the world.",

While\nrecent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient\nfacial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical\nand privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable\nmodels across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a\nnovel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving\nessential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a\npretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics\nof real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains\ndiagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'\nidentities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population\npre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a\nconditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input\nspace of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to\nfine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including\nquantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that\nSafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant\nfacial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage. Our evaluations also show\nthat SafeTriage provides robust privacy protection while maintaining diagnostic\naccuracy, offering a secure and ethically sound foundation for data sharing and\nAI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.",

Despite their\npromise, these models remain brittle when encountering novel visual distractors\nsuch as objects and background elements rarely seen during training.\nSpecifically, novel distractors can corrupt action outcome predictions, causing\ndownstream failures when robots rely on the world model imaginations for\nplanning or action verification. In this work, we propose Reimagination with\nObservation Intervention (ReOI), a simple yet effective test-time strategy that\nenables world models to predict more reliable action outcomes in open-world\nscenarios where novel and unanticipated visual distractors are inevitable.\nGiven the current robot observation, ReOI first detects visual distractors by\nidentifying which elements of the scene degrade in physically implausible ways\nduring world model prediction. Then, it modifies the current observation to\nremove these distractors and bring the observation closer to the training\ndistribution. Finally, ReOI \"reimagines\" future outcomes with the modified\nobservation and reintroduces the distractors post-hoc to preserve visual\nconsistency for downstream planning and verification. We validate our approach\non a suite of robotic manipulation tasks in the context of action verification,\nwhere the verifier needs to select desired action plans based on predictions\nfrom a world model. Our results show that ReOI is robust to both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution visual distractors.

Unfortunately,\nexisting theoretical guarantees for OFO assumes that the controller operates on\na slower timescale than the plant, which can affect responsiveness and\ntransient performance. In this paper, we focus on relaxing this ``timescale\nseparation'' assumption.

    "abstract": "Dense retrievers play a vital role in accessing external and specialized\nknowledge to augment language models (LMs). Training dense retrievers typically\nrequires annotated query-document pairs, which are costly and hard to obtain in\nspecialized domains such as code-motivating growing interest in self-supervised\nretriever learning. Since LMs are trained to capture token-level dependencies\nthrough a self-supervised learning objective (i.e., next-token prediction), we\ncan analogously cast retrieval as learning dependencies among chunks of tokens.\nThis analogy naturally leads to the question: How can we adapt self-supervised\nlearning objectives in the spirit of language modeling to train retrievers?\n  To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training\nframework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela\nmodels semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next-token\nprediction on both local and cross-document context through an in-batch\nattention mechanism. This attention is weighted by retriever-computed\nsimilarity scores, enabling the retriever to be optimized as part of language\nmodeling. We evaluate Revela on both general-domain (BEIR) and domain-specific\n(CoIR) benchmarks across various retriever backbones. At a comparable parameter\nscale, Revela outperforms the previous best method with absolute improvements\nof 5.2 % (18.3 % relative) and 5.6 % (14.4 % relative) on NDCG@10,\nrespectively, underscoring its effectiveness. Performance increases with model\nsize, highlighting both the scalability of our approach and its promise for\nself-supervised retriever learning.",

Their dynamics encode information about their formation and\ngrowth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of\ngalaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc\nhave been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed.\nIdentifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the ``final\nparsec'' until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show\nthat SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and\ncharacterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located\nbehind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' -- regions where\nsources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral --\nleads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing\nmagnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in\nthe host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH\nbinary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by\npulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance\nwarning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections.\nSMBH population models predict $1-50\\; [190-5,000] \\left({n_\\star}/{\\rm\npc}^{-3}\\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\\; [40]$ yr with\ncomparable masses and $z<0.3$, where $n_\\star$ is the stellar number density.\nAdditionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of\nsingle/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods.

The thermodynamic state point for the study is chosen such that both\nsystems are investigated at the same level of supercooling and pressure. Under\nthese conditions, we find that the nucleation rate for both systems is\ncomparable. Interestingly, the nucleation pathways and resulting crystal\nstructures are different. In the 12-6 system, nucleation and growth occur\npredominantly through the FCC structure. Softening the potential alters the\ncritical nucleus composition and introduces two distinct nucleation pathways.\nOne pathway predominantly leads to the nucleus with a body-centered cubic (BCC)\nstructure, while the other favors the face-centered cubic (FCC) arrangement.\nOur study illustrates that polymorph selection can be achieved through\nmodifications to intermolecular interactions without impacting nucleation\nkinetics.

The observed spectrum shows a flattening at lower\nfrequencies that can be explained by a population of eccentric BHBs. This study\naims to determine the dynamical evolution and merger timescales of the most\nmassive BHBs, which are potential sources of the GWB. We select successive\ngalactic major mergers from the IllustrisTNG100-1 cosmological simulation and\nre-simulate them at high resolution with the N-body code Griffin, down to\nbinary separations of the order of a parsec. Coalescence timescales are\nestimated using a semi-analytical model that incorporates gravitational wave\nemission and stellar hardening. Throughout our investigation, we consider the\nimpact of prior mergers on the remnant galaxy in the form of core scouring and\nanisotropy, which can influence the subsequent formation and evolution of BHBs.\nWe find that all the binaries in our sample enter the PTA band with an\neccentricity e>0.85: such a large eccentricity can impact the shape of the PTA\nobserved GWB spectrum, and it highlights the importance of including the\neccentricity of binaries when interpreting the PTA signal. Furthermore, we find\nthat: (i) starting from initial separations of a few tens of kpcs, the\ndynamical friction phase lasts for a few hundred Myrs; (ii) the binary\nformation time is not resolution dependent; (iii) the scatter on the\neccentricity at binary formation decreases with increasing resolution; (iv)\ntriple systems form whenever a third galaxy interacts with a binary which\nhasn't yet reached coalescence.",

Standard codecs allocate bits uniformly, wasting\nbitrate on noise components that do not contribute to intelligibility. This\npaper introduces a Variable Bitrate RVQ (VRVQ) framework for noise-robust\nspeech coding, dynamically adjusting bitrate per frame to optimize\nrate-distortion trade-offs. Unlike constant bitrate (CBR) RVQ, our method\nprioritizes critical speech components while suppressing residual noise.\nAdditionally, we integrate a feature denoiser to further improve noise\nrobustness. Experimental results show that VRVQ improves rate-distortion\ntrade-offs over conventional methods, achieving better compression efficiency\nand perceptual quality in noisy conditions.

This work investigates the Mott metal-insulator transition in a\nmodified periodic Anderson model that may be viewed as a three-orbital lattice\nmodel including an interacting, localized orbital coupled to a delocalized\nconduction orbital via a second conduction orbital. This model could also be\nviewed as a bilayer model involving a conventional periodic Anderson model\nlayer coupled to a metallic layer. Within the dynamical mean field theory, this\nmodel possesses a strictly zero temperature quantum critical point separating a\nFermi liquid and a Mott insulating phase. By employing a simplified version of\nthe dynamical mean field theory, namely, the two-site or linearized dynamical\nmean field theory, we provide an analytical estimate of the critical parameter\nstrengths at which the transition occurs at zero temperature.

Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,\nemergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent\naccuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and\nrequiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on\nhigh-activation samples can partially reverse these effects.

In the nematic phase, contractile activity induces\nthickness instabilities, which in turn drive geometric deformations. Our\nresults highlight the crucial interplay between activity, thickness variations,\nand curvature, providing new insights into the behavior of active nematic films\nbeyond the conventional two dimensional paradigm that has been studied to date.",

We develop a general mechanism for operator-space fragmentation\nof mixed states, undergoing Lindbladian evolution generated by frustration-free\nHamiltonians and Pauli-string jump operators. The interplay of generator\nalgebras of dissipative and unitary dynamics leads to a hierarchical\npartitioning of operator and real space into dynamically disconnected\nsubspaces, which we elucidate using the bond and commutant algebras of\nsuperoperators. This fragmentation fundamentally constrains information\nspreading in open systems and provides new mechanisms to control highly\nentangled quantum states and dynamics.

    "abstract": "Analog quantum simulators have provided key insights into quantum many-body\ndynamics. However, in such systems, both coherent and incoherent errors limit\ntheir scalability, hindering simulations in regimes that challenge classical\nsimulations. In this work, we introduce an error mitigation technique that\naddresses and effectively suppresses a key source of error in leading simulator\nplatforms: shot-to-shot fluctuations in the parameters for the Hamiltonian\ngoverning the system dynamics. We rigorously prove that amplifying this\nshot-to-shot noise and extrapolating to the zero-noise limit recovers noiseless\nresults for realistic noise distributions. Experimentally, we demonstrate this\ntechnique on a 27-ion trapped-ion quantum simulator, extending the two-qubit\nexchange oscillation lifetime threefold. Numerically, we predict a significant\nenhancement in the effective many-body coherence time for Rydberg atom arrays\nunder realistic conditions. Our scheme provides a possible route towards\nextending the effective coherence time in analog quantum experiments, enabling\ndeeper explorations of quantum many-body dynamics.",

    "abstract": "While bursty star formation in low-mass galaxies has been observed in local\npopulations and reproduced in simulations, the dormant phase of the burst cycle\nhas not been well studied beyond the local Universe due to observational\nlimitations. We present a unique sample of 41 JWST PRISM spectra of low-mass\ngalaxies ($M_\\star < 10^{9.5}\\,M_\\odot$) at cosmic noon ($1<z<3$), uniformly\nselected on F200W magnitude and precise photometric redshifts enabled by\n20-band JWST photometry from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. The spectra\nreveal numerous strong Balmer breaks, which are negatively correlated with the\ngalaxies' H$\\alpha$ equivalent width. By comparing these observations to\nsynthetic samples of spectra generated using a simple parametrization of bursty\nstar formation histories, we show that star formation in low-mass galaxies at\ncosmic noon is likely dominated by burst cycles with long timescales ($\\gtrsim\n100$ Myr) and large deviations below the star-forming main sequence ($\\gtrsim\n0.8$ dex). Our results suggest that galaxies in this population--at least those\nwithin our detection limits--should not be classified solely by their current\nstar formation rates, but instead viewed as a unified population undergoing\ndynamic movement above and below the star-forming main sequence. The derived\nconstraints demonstrate that long-timescale fluctuations are important for this\nclass of galaxies, indicating that galaxy-scale gas cycles--rather than\nmolecular-cloud-scale stochasticity--are the primary regulators of star\nformation variability in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon.",

They tend to\nlatch on to superficial or spurious attributes, such as response length or\nformatting, mistaking these cues learned from correlations in training data for\nthe true causal drivers of quality (e.g., factuality, relevance). This occurs\nbecause standard training objectives struggle to disentangle these factors,\nleading to brittle RMs and misaligned policies. We introduce Crome (Causally\nRobust Reward Modeling), a novel framework grounded in an explicit causal model\ndesigned to mitigate reward hacking. Crome employs the following synthetic\ntargeted augmentations during training: (1) Causal Augmentations, which are\npairs that differ along specific causal attributes, to enforce sensitivity\nalong each causal attribute individually, and (2) Neutral Augmentations, which\nare tie-label pairs varying primarily in spurious attributes, to enforce\ninvariance along spurious attributes. Notably, our augmentations are produced\nwithout any knowledge of spurious factors, via answer interventions only along\ncausal rubrics, that are identified by querying an oracle LLM. Empirically,\nCrome significantly outperforms standard baselines on RewardBench, improving\naverage accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in\nspecific categories. The robustness of Crome is further testified by the\nconsistent gains obtained in a Best-of-N inference setting across increasing N,\nacross various benchmarks, including the popular RewardBench (covering chat,\nchat-hard, safety, and reasoning tasks), the safety-focused WildGuardTest, and\nthe reasoning-specific GSM8k.",

To address\nthis challenge, we propose RELIC, a novel in-context learning framework for\nreward modeling in low-resource Indic languages.

However, prior studies have mostly targeted\ntask- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature\ncoding across diverse large models largely unexplored. In this paper, we\npresent the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large\nmodels. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally\nincompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example,\nfeatures from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while\nthose from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This\ndistributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and\ncross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned\npeaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed\nfeature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation\nis non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of\nheterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this\nalignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can\neffectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate\nour approach on three representative large models (LLaMA3, DINOv2, and SD3)\nacross multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our\nmethod achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and\ncross-model generalization over task-specific baselines.

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of android-based mobile IoT systems has significantly\nincreased the susceptibility of devices to cyberattacks, particularly in smart\nhomes, UAVs, and other connected mobile environments. This article presents a\nfederated learning-based intrusion detection framework called AndroIDS that\nleverages system call traces as a personalized and privacy-preserving data\nsource. Unlike conventional centralized approaches, the proposed method enables\ncollaborative anomaly detection without sharing raw data, thus preserving user\nprivacy across distributed nodes. A generalized system call dataset was\ngenerated to reflect realistic android system behavior and serves as the\nfoundation for experimentation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the\neffectiveness of the FL model under both IID and non-IID conditions, achieving\nan accuracy of 96.46 % and 92.87 %, and F1-scores of 89 % and 86 %,\nrespectively. These results highlight the models robustness to data\nheterogeneity, with only a minor performance drop in the non-IID case. Further,\na detailed comparison with centralized deep learning further illustrates\ntrade-offs in detection performance and deployment feasibility. Overall, the\nresults validate the practical applicability of the proposed approach for\nsecure and scalable intrusion detection in real-world mobile IoT scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart\nactivity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring\ncardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and\nprone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for\nautomated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations\nin ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable models. ECG signals\ncan vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow\ndifferent labeling standards and may be biased, all of which greatly hinder\nsupervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component\nanalysis, prioritize large (and often obvious) variances in the data and\ntypically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. If labels are\nmissing and/or variations are significant but small, both approaches fail.\nHere, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) can accommodate\nthese issues and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals, with no\nneed for training or prior information. Using the MLII and V1 leads of the\nMIT-BIH dataset, we demonstrate that t-distributed stochastic neighbor\nembedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection can discriminate\nindividual recordings in mixed populations with >= 90% accuracy and distinguish\ndifferent arrhythmias in individual patients with a median accuracy of 98.96%\nand a median F1-score of 91.02%.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a macroscopic theory, alongside its numerical\nimplementation, aimed at describing, explaining, and predicting the nucleation\nand propagation of fracture in viscoelastic materials subjected to quasistatic\nloading conditions. The focus is on polymers, in particular, on elastomers. To\nthis end, the starting point of this work is devoted to summarizing the large\nbody of experimental results on how elastomers deform, nucleate cracks, and\npropagate cracks when subjected to mechanical loads. When viewed collectively,\nthe experiments make it plain that there are three basic ingredients that any\nattempt at a complete macroscopic theory of fracture in elastomers ought to\naccount for: i) the viscoelasticity of the elastomer; ii) its strength; and\niii) its fracture energy. A theory is then introduced that accounts for all\nthese three basic ingredients by extending the phase-field theory initiated by\nKumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 112 (2018), 523--551)\nfor elastic brittle materials to seamlessly incorporate viscous energy\ndissipation by deformation, a generalized strength surface that is a\nhypersurface in stress-deformation space (and not just in stress space as for\nelastic brittle materials), and the pertinent Griffith criticality condition\nfor materials that dissipate energy not just by the creation of surface but\nalso by deformation, in this case, by viscous deformation (Shrimali and\nLopez-Pamies (2023) Extreme Mech. Lett. 58, 101944). From an applications point\nof view, the proposed theory amounts to solving an initial-boundary-value\nproblem comprised of two nonlinear PDEs coupled with a nonlinear ODE for the\ndeformation field, a tensorial internal variable, and the phase field. A robust\nscheme is presented to generate solutions for these equations.",

A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of\namortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from\nstate-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing\ndiffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at\nthe scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose\nProgressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn\ndiffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation\ntechniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion\nsmoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low\ntemperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher\ntemperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the\ntemperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables\nsimulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower\ntemperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using\na novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA\nenables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems,\nAlanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically\nlower energy function evaluations.

Leveraging\nthe Reduced Basis (RB) method, at each timestep we project the high-fidelity\nproblem onto a suitable low-dimensional subspace and integrate its dynamics\nimplicitly. Following the IMEX paradigm, the resulting solution then serves as\nan educated guess within a full-order explicit step. Notably, compared to the\ncanonical RB method, IMEX-RB neither requires a parametrization of the\nunderlying PDE nor features an offline-online splitting, since the reduced\nsubspace is built dynamically, exploiting the high-fidelity solution history.\nWe present the first-order formulation of IMEX-RB, demonstrating and showcasing\nits convergence and stability properties. In particular, under appropriate\nconditions on the method's hyperparameters, IMEX-RB is unconditionally stable.\nThe theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical experiments performed on\nrepresentative model problems in two and three dimensions. The results\ndemonstrate that our approach can outperform conventional time integration\nschemes like backward Euler. Indeed, IMEX-RB yields high-fidelity accurate\nsolutions, provided that its main hyperparameters - namely the reduced basis\nsize and the stability tolerance - are suitably tuned. Moreover, IMEX-RB\nrealizes computational gains over backward Euler for a range of timestep sizes\nabove the forward Euler stability threshold.",

We found that all our participants with SCI (2 with chronic SCI and\n3 with acute SCI) retained distinct spared EMG activity for at least three\nankle movements, which allowed them to reliably control a digital cursor using\ntheir spared tibialis anterior and triceps surae MU activity. Movement\nseparability was further reconfirmed by extracting task-modulated MU activity\nduring foot flexion/extension (3-7 modulated MUs/participant). Three\nparticipants were further able to modulate and maintain their foot\nflexion/extension EMG levels with an accuracy of >70%. Lastly, we show that\nreal-time control of a FES system using EMG from the affected limb can restore\nfoot movements in a highly intuitive way, significantly improving the lost or\npathological foot range of motion. Our system provides an intuitive approach\nfor closed-loop control of FES that has the potential to assist individuals\nwith SCI in regaining lost motor functions.",

In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different\nsources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors\nor sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field\noverwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To\nfulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,\nefficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and\ndata quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ\nlayer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework\naims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a\ncase study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that\npartially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8\nobject detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and\nLiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a\nrange of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task\norchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs.

    "abstract": "Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that leverages\nsimilarities among multiple learning tasks, each with insufficient samples to\ntrain a standalone model, to solve them simultaneously while minimizing data\nsharing across users and organizations. MTL typically accomplishes this goal by\nlearning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks\nby embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being\ndesigned to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively\nlearn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can\ninadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were\ntrained on.\n  In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared\nrepresentations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose\na novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the\nembedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples\nfrom a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when\ntraining the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box\nattacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between\nembeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled\nreference data. We evaluate our attacks across vision and language domains for\nmultiple use cases of MTL and demonstrate that even with access only to fresh\ntask samples rather than training data, a black-box adversary can successfully\ninfer a task's inclusion in training. To complement our experiments, we provide\ntheoretical analysis of a simplified learning setting and show a strict\nseparation between adversaries with training samples and fresh samples from the\ntarget task's distribution.",

Then, we apply this method to the informative\nreviews, identify the top 10 user-discussed topics (e.g., AI Performance,\nContent Quality, and Content Policy & Censorship) and analyze the key\nchallenges and emerging opportunities. Finally, we examine how these topics\nevolve over time, offering insight into shifting user expectations and\nengagement patterns with Gen-AI apps.

    "abstract": "Backdoor unalignment attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the\nstealthy compromise of safety alignment using a hidden trigger while evading\nnormal safety auditing. These attacks pose significant threats to the\napplications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service\n(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can\nonly interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the\nattack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the\nbackdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden\ntrigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce\nBEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to\ndeactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed\nthe probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples\nsignificantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious\nprobe, while non-triggered samples have little effect. Specifically, BEAT\nidentifies whether an input is triggered by measuring the degree of distortion\nin the output distribution of the probe before and after concatenation with the\ninput. Our method addresses the challenges of sample-dependent targets from an\nopposite perspective. It captures the impact of the trigger on the refusal\nsignal (which is sample-independent) instead of sample-specific successful\nattack behaviors. It overcomes black-box access limitations by using multiple\nsampling to approximate the output distribution. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on various backdoor attacks and LLMs (including the closed-source\nGPT-3.5-turbo), verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our defense.\nBesides, we also preliminarily verify that BEAT can effectively defend against\npopular jailbreak attacks, as they can be regarded as 'natural backdoors'.",

To overcome this issue,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived\nknowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three\nstages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes\na significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is\nmapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nalgorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant\nitems. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement\noverheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these\noverheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that\naccelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing\nworks that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to\nISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected\nby ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting\nperformance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system\ntailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.\nFirst, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to\ntheir associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables\nefficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that\ndistributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a\nlightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that\nuses the existing computational resources inside the storage system.

The first parts gives a convolution formula for the second-order\nEulerian polynomials, which simplifies a result of Gessel. As an application, a\ndeterminantal expression for the second-order Eulerian polynomials is obtained.\nWe then investigate the convolution formula of the trivariate second-order\nEulerian polynomials.

In this approach,\nlight clusters can exist only if the total nucleon phase-space occupation of\nthe surrounding nuclear medium -- including explicit contributions from light\nclusters -- is sufficiently low. The distribution functions of nucleons and\nlight clusters are determined self-consistently by accounting for the interplay\nbetween in-medium effects and thermodynamic properties. By employing standard\nSkyrme energy-density functionals to model the nuclear mean-field potential,\nthe approach enables the evaluation of the Mott momentum and the fraction of\nlight clusters in nuclear matter.

In this work, we introduce a fast and flexible\nframework to extract the scale-dependent matter power spectrum $P(k, z)$ from\ncosmic shear and CMB lensing measurements, parameterizing deviations from the\nPlanck $\\Lambda$CDM prediction as a free function $\\alpha(k)$. Using public\ndata from DES Y3, KiDS-1000, HSC Y3, and ACT DR6, we constrain $\\alpha(k)$ with\nfast Hamiltonian Monte Carlo inference, employing multipoles up to $\\ell_{\\rm\nmax}\\sim2000$ for the galaxy lensing surveys. Our results show a consistent\n15-30% suppression in the matter power spectrum at intermediate scales ($k \\sim\n0.1-1{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) in galaxy-lensing data relative to a Planck $\\Lambda$CDM\nprediction with a CDM-only (no baryonic feedback) power spectrum, with combined\ntensions reaching up to $4\\sigma$.

To address this limitation, we introduce EFormer, an Edge-based\nTransformer model that uses edge as the sole input for VRPs. Our approach\nemploys a precoder module with a mixed-score attention mechanism to convert\nedge information into temporary node embeddings. We also present a parallel\nencoding strategy characterized by a graph encoder and a node encoder, each\nresponsible for processing graph and node embeddings in distinct feature\nspaces, respectively. This design yields a more comprehensive representation of\nthe global relationships among edges. In the decoding phase, parallel context\nembedding and multi-query integration are used to compute separate attention\nmechanisms over the two encoded embeddings, facilitating efficient path\nconstruction. We train EFormer using reinforcement learning in an\nautoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem\n(TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) reveal that EFormer\noutperforms established baselines on synthetic datasets, including large-scale\nand diverse distributions.

This brings new possibilities for investigating\nfundamental interactions between excitons and a correlated spin environment,\nparticularly pronounced in CrSBr. Here, we demonstrate that CrSBr hosts both\nlocalised Frenkel-like and delocalised Wannier-Mott-like excitons a duality\nrare among other magnetic or nonmagnetic 2D materials. Our combined theoretical\nand experimental high magnetic field studies reveal that these two exciton\ntypes exhibit strikingly different responses to magnetic and lattice\nperturbations. We show that the high-energy exciton (XB) is an order of\nmagnitude more sensitive to magnetic order changes than XA, establishing XB as\na highly effective optical probe of the magnetic state. The presented\nself-consistent many-body perturbation theory provides detailed insight into\ntheir electronic and spatial structure, quantitatively explaining the observed\ndifferences, based on their relative Wannier-Mott and Frenkel characters. By\nprobing the diamagnetic response in magnetic fields up to 85 T, we estimate the\nrelative spatial extent of the two excitons, with results aligning well with\nthe predictions of our many-body perturbation theory. Furthermore, we observe\nexceptionally distinct coupling of the two excitons to lattice vibrations: a\nstrong temperature dependent redshift for XB between antiferromagnetic and\nferromagnetic phases, which is almost temperature-invariant for XA. This is\nattributed to XBs tendency for out-of-plane delocalisation in the FM phase,\nleading to enhanced coupling with Ag phonon modes.

Fast agglomerative methods such\nas GLASS, STEAC, and METAL combine multi-locus information via distance-based\nclustering. We derive the exact covariance matrix of these pairwise distance\nestimates under a joint MSC-plus-substitution model and leverage it for\nreliable confidence estimation, and we algebraically decompose it into\ncomponents attributable to coalescent variation versus sequence-level\nstochasticity. Our theory identifies parameter regimes where one source of\nvariance greatly exceeds the other. For both very low and very high mutation\nrates, substitutional noise dominates, while coalescent variance is the primary\ncontributor at intermediate mutation rates. Moreover, the interval over which\ncoalescent variance dominates becomes narrower as the species-tree height\nincreases. These results imply that in some settings one may legitimately\nignore the weaker noise source when designing methods or collecting data. In\nparticular, when gene-tree variance is dominant, adding more loci is most\nbeneficial, while when substitution noise dominates, longer sequences or\nimputation are needed.

Two structures are considered equivalent if one can be obtained from\nthe other through row permutation and/or global relabeling. Under this notion,\nit is shown that for $n=4$ there exists a single non-trivial structure, and for\n$n=6$ there are exactly two non-equivalent ones. Harmonic matrices are\nconstructed using specially designed permutators whose properties guarantee\nsymmetry and complete coverage.

In this study, we examine the translational dynamics of a\nmicrobubble with unprecedented accuracy by simultaneously time-resolving both\nits radial and translational responses and by using optical tweezers to study\nthe bubble in free space. Our experimental results show excellent agreement\nwith theoretical predictions for the bubble sizes considered, provided the\nhistory drag force is included in the force balance. For Reynolds numbers\nconsidered (up to Re = 2), the zero-Reynolds-number history force performs as\nwell as its finite-Reynolds-number extension. Although non-spherical modes may\narise at larger bubble expansions, they do not appear to significantly\ninfluence the bubble translational motion. A major finding is that the\nnormalised transport distance of the bubble scales linearly with the normalised\nvolumetric expansion during its oscillation, greatly simplifying the design and\nanalysis of transport strategies. We also investigated bubble stability during\ntransport and observed a marked increase in dissolution rate once a threshold\nin bubble expansion is exceeded.

    "abstract": "Forecasting cosmological constraints from halo-based statistics often suffers\nfrom instability in derivative estimates, especially when the number of\nsimulations is limited. This instability reduces the reliability of Fisher\nforecasts and machine learning based approaches that use derivatives. We\nintroduce a general framework that addresses this challenge by stabilizing the\ninput statistic and then systematically identifying the optimal subset of\nsummary statistics that maximizes cosmological information while simultaneously\nminimizing the instability of predicted constraints. We demonstrate this\nframework using the Voronoi volume function (VVF), a summary statistic that\ncaptures beyond two-point clustering information. Applying our two-step\nprocedure -- random sub-sampling followed by optimization -- improves the\nconstraining power by up to a factor of 2, while also enhancing the stability\nof the forecasts across realizations. As surveys like Euclid, DESI, and LSST\npush toward tighter constraints, the ability to produce stable and accurate\ntheoretical predictions is essential. Our results suggest that new summary\nstatistics such as the VVF, combined with careful data curation and\nstabilization strategies, can play a key role in next-generation precision\ncosmology.",

The curvature of the potential and\nthus the epicyclic frequencies change $\\Omega_r$ shows up to 25% deviation for\ntypical $b$ values, underscoring sensitivity to quantum effects. 3.

Because synthetic analogues of these shapes could\nbe valuable platforms for nanotechnologies, including drug delivery and\nplasmonics, controllable synthesis of variable-curvature structures of various\nmaterial systems, from fullerenes to supramolecular assemblies, has been a\nlong-standing goal. Like two-dimensional crystals, these structures have a\ntwo-periodic symmetry, but unlike standard two-dimensional crystals, they are\nembedded in three dimensions with complex, spatially-varying curvatures that\ncause the structures to close upon themselves in one or more dimensions.

We survey the modular\ngeometry of these curved crystals and infer the addressable subunit\ninteractions required to assemble them from triangular subunits.

To bridge this critical gap,\nwe propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive\nemergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We\nthus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive\nsafety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks\ninstantiated in a high-fidelity simulator.

To do so, it queries a VLM to\nidentify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to\nrank them using pairwise comparisons. Unlike prior work, GoalLadder does not\ntrust VLM's feedback completely; instead, it uses it to rank potential goal\nstates using an ELO-based rating system, thus reducing the detrimental effects\nof noisy VLM feedback. Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with\nminimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,\nwhich is trained on unlabelled visual data. This key feature allows us to\nbypass the need for abundant and accurate feedback typically required to train\na well-shaped reward function. We demonstrate that GoalLadder outperforms\nexisting related methods on classic control and robotic manipulation\nenvironments with the average final success rate of $\\sim$95% compared to only\n$\\sim$45% of the best competitor.",

To address these\nproblems, we propose a new paradigm of multi-model cooperative annotation and\ndesign a fully automatic annotation framework AutoAnnotator based on this.\nSpecifically, AutoAnnotator consists of two layers. The upper-level\nmeta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to\nselect SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify\ndifficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple\nSLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting. In addition, we use\nthe difficult samples obtained by the secondary review of the meta-controller\nlayer as the reinforcement learning set and fine-tune the SLMs in stages\nthrough a continual learning strategy, thereby improving the generalization of\nSLMs. Extensive experiments show that AutoAnnotator outperforms existing\nopen-source/API LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings.\nNotably, AutoAnnotator reduces the annotation cost by 74.15% compared to\ndirectly annotating with GPT-3.5-turbo, while still improving the accuracy by\n6.21%.

We\nfirst consider a pair of two sterile neutrinos forming a pseudo-Dirac pair,\nthen we consider a low-scale seesaw realization, that we name ``Linear-Inverse\nSeesaw\" model. This scenario features two nearly degenerate sterile neutrino\nstates at the keV scale, characterized by a small mass splitting arising from a\nsmall amount of lepton number violation. In this scenario, the oscillation\nbehavior can be described in three distinct regimes depending on the\nsterile-sterile mass-squared difference : low ($< 1\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2$), resonant\n($1$--$100\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2$), and high ($> 100\\,\\mathrm{eV}^2$) regimes,\nrecovering in both low- and high-mass regimes an effective non-unitarity of the\nleptonic mixing matrix. A distinctive feature of this framework is that\nobservable effects persist even in the low-mass limit, unlike the case of\nstandard $3+1$ scenarios, due to rapid oscillation averaging from larger\nkeV-scale splittings. We leverage the complementarity of both near and far\ndetectors to explore the sensitivity for $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_\\mu$ disappearance\nand $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_{\\tau}$ appearance oscillation probabilities.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel system for monitoring cattle behavior and\ndetecting estrus (heat) periods using sensor data and machine learning. We\ndesigned and deployed a low-cost Bluetooth-based neck collar equipped with\naccelerometer and gyroscope sensors to capture real-time behavioral data from\nreal cows, which was synced to the cloud. A labeled dataset was created using\nsynchronized CCTV footage to annotate behaviors such as feeding, rumination,\nlying, and others. We evaluated multiple machine learning models -- Support\nVector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN) -- for behavior classification. Additionally, we implemented a Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) model for estrus detection using behavioral patterns\nand anomaly detection. Our system achieved over 93% behavior classification\naccuracy and 96% estrus detection accuracy on a limited test set. The approach\noffers a scalable and accessible solution for precision livestock monitoring,\nespecially in resource-constrained environments.",

    "abstract": "Cloud service providers commonly use standard benchmarks like TPC-H and\nTPC-DS to evaluate and optimize cloud data analytics systems. However, these\nbenchmarks rely on fixed query patterns and fail to capture the real execution\nstatistics of production cloud workloads. Although some cloud database vendors\nhave recently released real workload traces, these traces alone do not qualify\nas benchmarks, as they typically lack essential components like the original\nSQL queries and their underlying databases. To overcome this limitation, this\npaper introduces a new problem of workload synthesis with real statistics,\nwhich aims to generate synthetic workloads that closely approximate real\nexecution statistics, including key performance metrics and operator\ndistributions, in real cloud workloads. To address this problem, we propose\nPBench, a novel workload synthesizer that constructs synthetic workloads by\njudiciously selecting and combining workload components (i.e., queries and\ndatabases) from existing benchmarks. This paper studies the key challenges in\nPBench. First, we address the challenge of balancing performance metrics and\noperator distributions by introducing a multi-objective optimization-based\ncomponent selection method. Second, to capture the temporal dynamics of real\nworkloads, we design a timestamp assignment method that progressively refines\nworkload timestamps. Third, to handle the disparity between the original\nworkload and the candidate workload, we propose a component augmentation\napproach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate additional\nworkload components while maintaining statistical fidelity. We evaluate PBench\non real cloud workload traces, demonstrating that it reduces approximation\nerror by up to 6x compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

This is done via the mathematical theory of\nalgebraic operads: we start by endowing the collection of all cooperative games\nwith any number of players with an operad structure, and we show that it\ngeneralises all the previous notions of sums, products and compositions of\ngames considered by Owen, Shapley, von Neumann and Morgenstern, and many\nothers. Furthermore, we explicitly compute this operad in terms of generators\nand relations, showing that the M\\\"obius transform map induces a canonical\nisomorphism between the operad of cooperative games and the operad that encodes\ncommutative triassociative algebras. In other words, we prove that any\ncooperative game is a linear combination of iterated compositions of the\n2-player bargaining game and the 2-player dictator games. We show that many\ninteresting classes of games (simple, balanced, capacities a.k.a fuzzy measures\nand convex functions, totally monotone, etc) are stable under compositions, and\nthus form suboperads. In the convex case, this gives by the submodularity\ntheorem a new operad structure on the family of all generalized permutahedra.\nFinally, we focus on how solution concepts in cooperative game theory behave\nunder composition: we study the core of a composite and describe it in terms of\nthe core of its components, and we give explicit formulas for the Shapley value\nand the Banzhaf index of a compound game.",

    "abstract": "The PMCHWT integral equation enables the modelling of scattering of\ntime-harmonic fields by penetrable, piecewise homogeneous, systems. They have\nbeen generalised to include the modelling of composite systems that may contain\njunctions, i.e. lines along which three or more materials meet. Linear systems\nresulting upon discretisation of the PMCHWT are, because of their large\ndimension, typically solved by Krylov iterative methods. The number of\niterations required for this solution critically depends on the eigenvalue\ndistribution of the system matrix. For systems that do not contain junction\nlines, Calder\\'on preconditioning, which was first applied to the electric\nfield integral equation, has been generalised to the PMCHWT equation. When\njunctions are present, this approach cannot be applied. Alternative approaches,\nsuch as the global multi-trace method, conceptually remove the junction lines\nand as a result are amenable to Calder\\'on preconditioning. This approach\nentails a doubling of the degrees of freedom, and the solution that is produced\nonly approximately fulfils the continuity conditions at interfaces separating\ndomains. In this contribution, a single trace quasi-local PMCHWT equation is\nintroduced that requires a number of iterations for its solution that only\nslowly increases as the mesh size tends to zero. The method is constructed as a\ngeneralisation of the classic PMCHWT, and its discretisation is thoroughly\ndiscussed. A comprehensive suite of numerical experiments demonstrates the\ncorrectness, convergence behaviour, and efficiency of the method. The integral\nequation is demonstrated to be free from interior resonances.",

We analyze all\navailable NuSTAR observations of 4U 1538-52. We decompose energy-resolved pulse\nprofiles into Fourier harmonics to study their energy dependence. Specifically,\nwe compute pulsed fraction spectra, cross-correlation and lag spectra,\nidentifying discontinuities and linking them to features in the phase-averaged\nspectra. We perform phase-averaged and phase-resolved spectral analyses to\nprobe spectral variability and its relation to pulse profile changes. Finally,\nwe interpret our findings via physical modeling of energy- and angle-dependent\npulse profile emission, performing radiative transfer in a homogeneous\nslab-like atmosphere under conditions relevant to 4U 1538-52. The emission is\nprojected onto the observer's sky plane to derive expected observables. In\ncontrast to the dips in pulsed fraction spectra observed in other sources\n(e.g., Her X-1), we find a broad bump near the cyclotron resonance energy in 4U\n1538-52. This increase is driven primarily by phase-dependent spectral\nvariability, especially by strong variations in cyclotron line depth across\ndifferent phase intervals. We interpret the observed contrast between dips and\nbumps in various sources as arising from phase-dependent variations of\ncyclotron line depth relative to the phase-modulated flux. We model the X-ray\nemission from an accreting neutron star and find that our simulations indicate\nhigh values of both the observer's inclination and the magnetic obliquity,\nalong with a 10-15 degrees asymmetry between the locations of the magnetic\npoles.

Quasi-Direct-Drive (QDD) actuators with\nsingle-stage planetary gearboxes offer low inertia, high efficiency, and\ntransparency. Among planetary gearbox architectures, Internal (ISSPG) and\nExternal Single-Stage Planetary Gearbox (ESSPG) are the two predominant\ndesigns. While ISSPG is often preferred for its compactness and high torque\ndensity at certain gear ratios, no objective comparison between the two\narchitectures exists. Additionally, existing designs rely on heuristics rather\nthan systematic optimization. This paper presents a design framework for\noptimally selecting actuator parameters based on given performance requirements\nand motor specifications. Using this framework, we generate and analyze various\noptimized gearbox designs for both architectures. Our results demonstrate that\nfor the T-motor U12, ISSPG is the superior choice within the lower gear ratio\nrange of 5:1 to 7:1, offering a lighter design. However, for gear ratios\nexceeding 7:1, ISSPG becomes infeasible, making ESSPG the better option in the\n7:1 to 11:1 range.

Similar periodic structures also arise\nin continuum field theories, such as chiral soliton lattices (CSLs), which\nappear in condensed matter systems like chiral magnets and in high-energy\ncontexts such as quantum chromodynamics in strong magnetic field or under rapid\nrotation. This work investigates whether dislocations can dynamically form\nwithin such emergent CSLs. The chiral sine-Gordon model, reduced from the\naforementioned examples by certain truncations, is useful to determine the\nground state but it cannot describe time evolution, lacks dynamical formation\nor leads to singular dislocations, because its equations of motion do not\ncontain a topological term. We propose a field-theoretical model including the\ntopological term coupled to external fields resolving these issues by modifying\nthe topological term so it affects the dynamics. Using numerical simulations,\nwe study the real-time formation of CSLs in two and three spatial dimensions.\nIn 2D, edge dislocations emerge spontaneously, guiding soliton growth and later\nannihilating to leave a stable CSL. In 3D, both edge and screw dislocations\nform; the latter exhibits helical structure influenced by the external field.\nWe find stable double helical screw dislocations looking like a double helix\nstaircase or DNA.

Finally, we meticulously\ndesign an adaptive feature enhancement module to increase feature diversity and\nenhance the visual representation capability of the model. We have conducted\ncomprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets: CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and\nIMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the\nstate-of-the-art deep hashing methods, our proposed MambaHash has well\nefficiency and superior performance to effectively accomplish large-scale image\nretrieval tasks.

In this work we present a study of synchronization\nmethods in an attempt to improve the performance of the data structure. In\nparticular, we study a handshake technique that is commonly used with\nconcurrent garbage collection, an optimistic technique, and a lock-based\ntechnique. Evaluation against the state-of-the-art size methodology\ndemonstrates that the overhead can be significantly reduced by selecting the\nappropriate synchronization approach, but there is no one-size-fits-all method.\nDifferent scenarios call for different synchronization methods, as rigorously\nshown in this study.

In scenarios characterized by low contention, optimistic\nand lock-based approaches work best, whereas under high contention, the most\neffective solutions are the handshake approach and the wait-free approach.",

A sacrificial template is used to create\nchannels of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) with an optimized diameter of 4-5\nnm, inside of which SnS2 NTs are formed with the high yield and structural\npurity. Atomic resolution imaging and nano-area electron diffraction reveal\nthat these synthesized SnS2 NTs prefer to have an armchair configuration with a\nprobability of approximately 85%. Calculations using density functional theory\n(DFT) reveal a negligible difference in the formation energy between armchair\nand zigzag NTs, suggesting that structural stability does not play a key role\nin this chirality-selective growth. However, a detailed TEM investigation\nrevealed that some SnS2 nanoribbons are found connected to the ends of SnS2\nNTs, and that these nanoribbons primarily have a zigzag configuration.\nSubsequent DFT and machine learning potential molecular dynamic simulations\nverify that nanoribbons with zigzag configurations are more stable than\narmchair ones, and indeed zigzag nanoribbons aligned along the BNNT axis tend\nto roll up to form an armchair SnS2 NTs. Finally, this \"zigzag nanoribbon to\narmchair nanotube\" transition hypothesis is verified by in-situ high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy, in which the transformation of SnS2\nnanoribbons into a nanotube is reproduced in real time.

To this purpose we employ a diverse set of suitable operators, an\nanisotropic action, smearing techniques, and solve the generalized eigenvalue\nproblem. We compare our findings with predictions from the Nambu-Goto string\nmodel to assess potential tensions indicative of novel phenomena such as the\nexistence of axion-like state along the flux-tube world-sheet. Notably, we\nprovide undoubted evidence of the existence of a massive axion-like particle\nwith the same mass as the corresponding axion extracted within the context of\nclosed flux-tube.

Moreover, our\nstudy reveals that AI investments complement LSM in innovation, with\neffectiveness varying by the type of innovation and AI capability. We\ndifferentiate between discovery-oriented AI, which reduces uncertainty in novel\nareas of innovation, and optimization-oriented AI, which refines and optimizes\nexisting processes. Within the framework of LSM, we further distinguish between\nprototyping focused on developing minimum viable products, and controlled\nexperimentation, focused on rigorous testing such as AB testing. We find that\nLSM complements discovery oriented AI by utilizing AI to expand the search for\nmarket opportunities and employing prototyping to validate these opportunities,\nthereby reducing uncertainties and facilitating the development of the first\nrelease of products. Conversely, LSM complements optimization-oriented AI by\nusing AB testing to experiment with the universe of input features and using AI\nto streamline iterative refinement processes, thereby accelerating the\nimprovement of iterative releases of products. As a result, when firms use AI\nand LSM for product development, they are able to generate more high quality\nproduct in less time.

Early experimental proposals, such as the\nrestarting and rewinding protocols, relied on repeating previous steps of the\nquantum map to avoid backaction. However, this approach compromises real-time\nprocessing and increases computational overhead. Recent developments have\nintroduced alternative protocols that address these limitations. These include\nonline, mid-circuit measurement, and feedback techniques, which enable\nreal-time computation while preserving the input history. Among these, the\nfeedback protocol stands out for its ability to process temporal information\nwith comparatively fewer components. Despite this potential advantage, the\ntheoretical foundations of feedback-based quantum reservoir computing remain\nunderdeveloped, particularly with regard to the universality and the\napproximation capabilities of this approach. This paper addresses this issue by\npresenting a recurrent quantum neural network architecture that extends a class\nof existing feedforward models to a dynamic, feedback-driven reservoir setting.\nWe provide theoretical guarantees for variational recurrent quantum neural\nnetworks, including approximation bounds and universality results. Notably, our\nanalysis demonstrates that the model is universal with linear readouts, making\nit both powerful and experimentally accessible.

Fortunately, the widespread\ndeployment of diverse non-RF sensors such as cameras and LiDAR, along with the\nintegration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication systems, offers\nnew opportunities to improve the synergy between sensing and communication.\nMotivated by this, this work develops a novel and robust communication\nframework that leverages multi-modal sensing data and advanced AI technologies\nto assist beamforming in dynamic and realistic vehicular scenarios.\nSpecifically, we propose a multi-modal learning framework for predictive\nbeamforming that integrates modality-specific branches and employs hierarchical\nTransformer to capture cross-modal features.

Audit logs provide a detailed and chronological record of all\nactivities in the system. Unfortunately, K8s auditing suffers from several\npractical limitations: it generates large volumes of data continuously, as all\ncomponents within the cluster interact and respond to user actions.

    "abstract": "Space complexity is a key field of study in theoretical computer science. In\nthe quantum setting there are clear motivations to understand the power of\nspace-restricted computation, as qubits are an especially precious and limited\nresource.\n  Recently, a new branch of space-bounded complexity called catalytic computing\nhas shown that reusing space is a very powerful computational resource,\nespecially for subroutines that incur little to no space overhead. While\nquantum catalysis in an information theoretic context, and the power of\n``dirty'' qubits for quantum computation, has been studied over the years,\nthese models are generally not suitable for use in quantum space-bounded\nalgorithms, as they either rely on specific catalytic states or destroy the\nmemory being borrowed.\n  We define the notion of catalytic computing in the quantum setting and show a\nnumber of initial results about the model. First, we show that quantum\ncatalytic logspace can always be computed quantumly in polynomial time; the\nclassical analogue of this is the largest open question in catalytic computing.\nThis also allows quantum catalytic space to be defined in an equivalent way\nwith respect to circuits instead of Turing machines. We also prove that quantum\ncatalytic logspace can simulate log-depth threshold circuits, a class which is\nknown to contain (and believed to strictly contain) quantum logspace, thus\nshowcasing the power of quantum catalytic space. Finally we show that both\nunitary quantum catalytic logspace and classical catalytic logspace can be\nsimulated in the one-clean qubit model.",

It is\nfound that if spherical coordinates give the FLRW model, the energy-momentum\ntensor (EMT) of the spinor field possesses nontrivial non-diagonal components.\nThese non-diagonal components of EMT neither depend on the spinor field\nnonlinearity nor the value of the parameter $k$ defining the type of curvature\nof the FLRW model.

    "abstract": "The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and\nphysical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy\nentertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive\ninteractions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At\nthe same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to\nthe demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth\noptimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social\nMetaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent\nProximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which\nintegrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to\ndynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy.\nExperimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14%\ncompared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions.\nTherefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless\nand immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks,\nwhile ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.",

This, in turn,\nhas led to an explosion of theoretical investigations and insights that aim to\ndevelop new fundamental theories, methods and algorithms better suited for\nmachine learning-based compressors.\n  In this thesis, I contribute to this trend by investigating relative entropy\ncoding, a mathematical framework that generalises classical source coding\ntheory. Concretely, relative entropy coding deals with the efficient\ncommunication of uncertain or randomised information. One of its key advantages\nis that it extends compression methods to continuous spaces and can thus be\nintegrated more seamlessly into modern machine learning pipelines than\nclassical quantisation-based approaches. Furthermore, it is a natural\nfoundation for developing advanced compression methods that are\nprivacy-preserving or account for the perceptual quality of the reconstructed\ndata.\n  The thesis considers relative entropy coding at three conceptual levels:\nAfter introducing the basics of the framework, (1) I prove results that provide\nnew, maximally tight fundamental limits to the communication and computational\nefficiency of relative entropy coding; (2) I use the theory of Poisson point\nprocesses to develop and analyse new relative entropy coding algorithms, whose\nperformance attains the theoretic optima and (3) I showcase the strong\npractical performance of relative entropy coding by applying it to image,\naudio, video and protein data compression using small, energy-efficient,\nprobabilistic neural networks called Bayesian implicit neural representations.",

Mid-transit times were\nextracted from these data, and an additional 98 mid-transit times compiled from\nthe literature were incorporated, resulting in a combined dataset spanning\napproximately 14 years. After excluding light curves significantly impacted by\nstellar activity, such as starspot anomalies, the final dataset consisted of\n252 high-quality mid-transit times. Initial inspection of the transit timing\nresiduals using an apsidal precession model suggested the possible presence of\nan additional planetary companion.

We also considered\nalternative mechanisms, including the Applegate mechanism and the Shklovskii\neffect.

In this paper, we present a mean-field-approximation-based\ninvestigation on two out of six use case scenarios defined by IMT-2030, namely,\nmassive communication and ubiquitous connectivity.

Distinctly different results are obtained for the\nlinear and nonlinear couplings, especially when there are two-photon\ncorrelations present in the modes.

Despite their significance,\naccurate predictive tools for these compressible flows remain scarce. For\nengineering applications, the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation\nstands out as the most practical approach due to its outstanding computational\nefficiency. However, the majority of RANS mixing studies reported have\nconcentrated on incompressible scenarios, with quite limited attention given to\ncompressible cases. Moreover, most of the existing RANS mixing models\ndemonstrate significantly inaccurate predictions for compressible mixing flow.\nThis study develops a novel compressible RANS mixing model by incorporating\nphysical compressibility corrections into the incompressible K-L-y mixing\ntransition model recently proposed by Xie et al.

Specifically, taking the density-stratified Rayleigh-Taylor mixing flows\nas representative compressible cases, we firstly analyze the limitations of the\nexisting model for compressible flows, based on high-fidelity data and local\ninstability criteria. Subsequently, the equation of state for a perfect gas and\nthe thermodynamic Gibbs relation are employed to derive comprehensive\ncompressibility corrections. The crucial turbulent entropy and heat flux are\nintegrated into the closure of the key turbulent mass flux term of the\nturbulent kinetic energy equation. These corrections enable the model to\naccurately depict compressible mixing flows. Systematic validations confirm the\nefficacy of the proposed modeling scheme. This study offers a promising\nstrategy for modeling compressible mixing flows, paving the way for more\naccurate predictions in complex scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The Bayesian approach to clustering is often appreciated for its ability to\nprovide uncertainty in the partition structure. However, summarizing the\nposterior distribution over the clustering structure can be challenging, due\nthe discrete, unordered nature and massive dimension of the space. While recent\nadvancements provide a single clustering estimate to represent the posterior,\nthis ignores uncertainty and may even be unrepresentative in instances where\nthe posterior is multimodal. To enhance our understanding of uncertainty, we\npropose a WASserstein Approximation for Bayesian clusterIng (WASABI), which\nsummarizes the posterior samples with not one, but multiple clustering\nestimates, each corresponding to a different part of the space of partitions\nthat receives substantial posterior mass. Specifically, we find such clustering\nestimates by approximating the posterior distribution in a Wasserstein distance\nsense, equipped with a suitable metric on the partition space. An interesting\nbyproduct is that a locally optimal solution to this problem can be found using\na k-medoids-like algorithm on the partition space to divide the posterior\nsamples into different groups, each represented by one of the clustering\nestimates. Using both synthetic and real datasets, we show that our proposal\nhelps to improve the understanding of uncertainty, particularly when the data\nclusters are not well separated or when the employed model is misspecified.",

We formalize this intuition, particularly for linear units with\nGaussian inputs, linking the condition number and the transformation's\nlog-volume scaling factor to the characteristics of the output entropy and the\ngeometric properties of the learned transformation.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the potential of intracluster light (ICL) as\na dark matter tracer. Moreover, the ICL co-evolves with the brightest cluster\ngalaxy (BCG) and the host cluster, making it a valuable tool for understanding\ncluster dynamics. In this study, we utilize 426 galaxy clusters (with total\nmass $M_{\\rm tot}>10^{14} M_{\\odot}$ at $z=0$) simulated in the cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulation Illustris TNG300 to compare the spatial distributions\nof dark matter, member galaxies, gas, and ICL and assess their effectiveness as\ndark matter tracers in the central regions of clusters at $R_{\\rm vir}<0.3$. We\napply the Weighted Overlap Coefficient (WOC), a methodology for quantifying the\nsimilarity of two-dimensional spatial distributions, to various components of\nthe galaxy clusters at different dynamical stages. Our findings reveal that the\nspatial distributions of both ICL combined with the BCG and gas closely\nresemble the dark matter distribution, with higher fidelity observed in more\nrelaxed galaxy clusters with earlier half-mass epochs. These results\ndemonstrate that the BCG+ICL component serves as an effective tracer of dark\nmatter, consistent with previous observational studies linking cluster light to\nmass. Moreover, the degree of spatial similarity between the BCG+ICL and dark\nmatter distributions appears to reflect the dynamical state of the cluster.",

Clinicians visually\nevaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score\nbased on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective\nevaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer\ninsights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This\npaper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD\nmotor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant\nfeatures are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence\neffect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and\nclinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.\nPrincipal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based\nfeatures corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis\nhas allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect\nand hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to\ntrain machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society\nUnified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.\nCompared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy\nin MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable\nquantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,\nthe proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective\nassessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both\nclinical and remote settings.

We\npresent rest-frame radio SEDs of a sample of 160 starburst galaxies at\nredshifts 1.5 to 3.5 in the COSMOS field, as part of the MeerKAT International\nGHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) project. MeerKAT observations,\ncombined with archival VLA and GMRT data, allow us to determine the integrated\nmid-radio (1-10 GHz) continuum (MRC) luminosity and magnetic field strength. A\nBayesian method is used to model the SEDs and separate free-free and\nsynchrotron emission. We calibrate the star formation rate (SFR) in radio both\ndirectly through SED analysis and indirectly via the infrared-radio correlation\n(IRRC). With a mean synchrotron spectral index of approximately 0.7, we find\nthat the index flattens with redshift and specific SFR, suggesting that cosmic\nrays are more energetic in the early universe due to higher star formation\nactivity. The magnetic field strength increases with redshift (B is\nproportional to (1 + z)^0.7) and with star formation rate (B is proportional to\nSFR^0.3), indicating a small-scale dynamo as the dominant amplification\nmechanism. Accounting for SED evolution, the IRRC remains redshift-invariant\nand does not vary with stellar mass at 1.5 < z < 3.5, though the correlation\ndeviates from linearity. Similarly, we show that SFR estimates based on\nintegrated MRC luminosity are also redshift-invariant.",

    "abstract": "Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning\ndiscriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar\nfine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two\nregimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding\nspace, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model.\nHowever, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting\nthe knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their\ngeneralization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation\n(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform\nFGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we\ndesign Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the\npre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that\nare helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context\nAdaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation\nwithout modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using\nthese adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training.\nAdditionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose\nDiscrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in\nthe object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge\ndistillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable\nparameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three\nout-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.",

The\nglobal tripartite entanglement is quantified using the geometric mean of all\nthree bipartite contributions, evaluated through negativity. We precisely map\nthe regions of parameter space in which the trimer system exhibits spontaneous\nglobal entanglement. In addition, we classify the nature of the tripartite\nentangled states based on the distribution of reduced bipartite negativities\namong the spin dimers in the trimer. We further examine the thermal stability\nof global tripartite entanglement throughout the full parameter space. Special\nattention is given to the theoretical prediction of thermal robustness in a\nreal three-spin complex, [Ni(bapa)(H$_2$0)]$_2$Cu(pba)(ClO$_4$)$_2$, where bapa\nstands for bis($3$-aminopropyl)amine, and pba denotes\n$1$,$3$-propylenebis(oxamato), which serves as an experimental realization of\nthe mixed-spin ($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer. Notably, global entanglement\nin this system is predicted to persist up to approximately $100$ K and magnetic\nfields approaching $210$ T. Moreover, we uncover a thermally induced activation\nof robust global entanglement in regions where the ground state is biseparable.\nThe magnitude of this thermal entanglement is remarkably high, nearly reaching\na value of $1/2$, which has not been reported before. Finally, we propose a\nconnection between the theoretically predicted tripartite entanglement,\nquantified via negativity derived from the density matrix, and the quantities\nmeasured directly or indirectly from various experiments.",

However, existing point cloud-based methods typically rely on\neither geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D\ndisplacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical\npartition-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and\nco-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. We\nconstruct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features.\nThese matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid\ntransformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world\nlandslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement\nestimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy.\nDeviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements\n(total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets,\nrespectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived\nreferences. These values are below the average scan resolutions (0.08 m and\n0.30 m). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial\ncoverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach offers a practical\nand adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to\nother types of point clouds and monitoring tasks.

    "abstract": "For standard factor graphs (S-FGs) with non-negative real-valued local\nfunctions, Vontobel provided a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe\napproximation of the partition function, also known as the Bethe partition\nfunction, using finite graph covers. The proof of this characterization, i.e.,\nthe graph-cover theorem for S-FGs, heavily relied on the method of types.\n  In this paper, we study double-edge factor graphs (DE-FGs), a class of factor\ngraphs where each local function takes complex values and satisfies some\npositive semi-definiteness constraints. DE-FGs and their partition functions\nare particularly relevant for quantum information processing. Approximating the\npartition function of a DE-FG is more difficult than for an S-FG, as it\ninvolves summing complex values instead of non-negative real values. We develop\nthe sum-product algorithm (SPA) fixed-point-based Bethe approximation of the\npartition function. However, one cannot directly apply the method of types to\nprove a similar combinatorial characterization as in the case of S-FGs.\n  We provide a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function\nin terms of finite graph covers for a class of DE-FGs that satisfy a specific,\neasily checkable condition. Towards proving this characterization, we apply a\nsuitable loop-calculus transform (LCT) to these graphs. Originally, the LCT was\nintroduced by Chertkov and Chernyak as a special linear transform for S-FGs and\nlater extended by Mori. Our proposed LCT is applicable for both DE-FGs and\nS-FGs and generalizes prior versions by handling zero-valued SPA fixed-point\nmessage components, which are common in DE-FGs.\n  Supported by numerical results, we conjecture that this combinatorial\ncharacterization of the Bethe partition function in terms of finite graph\ncovers holds more broadly for DE-FGs.",

In this work, we present a fundamentally\nnew and environmentally sustainable aqueous thixotropic colloidal gel of silica\nnanoparticles formed in the presence of NaCl. We conducted a systematic and\ndetailed investigation of their rheological and tribological characteristics.\nThe tribological performance was evaluated against dry and water-lubricated\nconditions for steel-steel interface. Our experiments demonstrate that the\ntribological performance of the formulated nanoparticle gel can be optimized by\ntuning its rheological properties. A combination of super-low friction and\nnegligible wear was observed. The friction coefficient reduced by up to 97.46%\n(from 0.63 to 0.016) compared to dry sliding, and by 97.04% (from 0.541 to\n0.016) compared to water lubrication. Similarly, the specific wear rate\ndecreased by up to 99.62% and 96.10% under dry conditions and water lubrication\nrespectively. This performance is attributed to a thixotropic, chemically\nrobust gel formed via van der Waals interactions between silica flocs, enabling\nself-repairing properties, continuous tribo-film formation, and a nano-bearing\neffect from silica nanoparticles. These attributes enable the gel to maintain\nand regain its structure during periods of non-shear while also forming a thin\nfilm with sufficiently low viscosity to slip into the interfacial contact zone\nand continuously replenish it with lubricant.",

In this\nwork, we introduce a new active BED procedure that leverages diffusion-based\ngenerative models to handle the high dimensionality of the images and employs\nstochastic optimization to select among a variety of patterns while meeting the\nacquisition process constraints and budget. So doing, we show how our setting\ncan optimize, not only standard image reconstruction, but also any associated\nimage analysis task. The versatility and performance of our approach are\ndemonstrated on several MRI acquisitions.",

While machine learning (ML) increasingly\nautomates this process, models often struggle with generalization in\nlarge-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets\n-- whether from simulations or human annotation -- a challenge pronounced for\nrare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a\nconditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for\naugmenting ML training data. Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains\nvisual feature -- galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate\nthat our model generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images closely adhere to\nthe specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables\ngenerative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and\nadvancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML\npipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting\ncompleteness and purity by up to 30\\% across key metrics.

Now that spectra from both\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are\navailable, we can reveal the atmospheric properties in unprecedented detail. In\nthis study, we perform a new data reduction and analysis of the original\nHST/WFC3 spectrum, accounting for the wavelength dependence of the instrument\nsystematics that was not considered in previous analyses. This allows us to\nprecisely and robustly measure the much-debated H$_2$O abundance in HD\n209458b's atmosphere. We combine the newly reduced spectrum with archival\nJWST/NIRCam data and run free chemistry atmospheric retrievals over the 1.0 -\n5.1 $\\mu$m wavelength range, covering possible features of multiple absorbing\nspecies, including CO$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, HCN, Na, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S. We\ndetect H$_2$O and CO$_2$ robustly at above 7 $\\sigma$ significance, and find a\n3.6 $\\sigma$ preference for cloudy models compared to a clear atmosphere. For\nall other absorbers we tested, only upper limits of abundance can be measured.\nWe use Bayesian model averaging to account for a range of different assumptions\nabout the cloud properties, resulting in a water volume mixing ratio of\n$0.95^{+0.35}_{-0.17} \\:\\times$ solar and a carbon dioxide abundance of\n$0.94^{+0.16}_{-0.09} \\:\\times$ solar. Both results are consistent with solar\nvalues and comparable to predictions from the VULCAN 1D photochemistry model.\nCombining these values with a prior on the CO abundance from ground-based\nmeasurements, we derive an overall atmospheric composition comparable to solar\nmetallicity of $\\mathrm{[M/H]} = 0.10^{+0.41}_{-0.40}$ and very low C/O of\n$0.054^{+0.080}_{-0.034}$ with a 3 $\\sigma$ upper limit of 0.454.

Experimental results on denoising, dereverberation,\nbandwidth extension, and multi distortion enhancement tasks show that EDNet\nconsistently achieves strong performance across conditions, demonstrating its\narchitectural flexibility and adaptability to diverse task settings.",

    "abstract": "Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a risk measure widely used to quantify\nthe impact of extreme losses. Owing to the lack of representative samples CVaR\nis sensitive to the tails of the underlying distribution. In order to combat\nthis sensitivity, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), which evaluates\nthe worst-case CVaR measure over a set of plausible data distributions is often\ndeployed. Unfortunately, an improper choice of the DRO formulation can lead to\na severe underestimation of tail risk. This paper aims at leveraging extreme\nvalue theory to arrive at a DRO formulation which leads to representative\nworst-case CVaR evaluations in that the above pitfall is avoided while\nsimultaneously, the worst case evaluation is not a gross over-estimate of the\ntrue CVaR. We demonstrate theoretically that even when there is paucity of\nsamples in the tail of the distribution, our formulation is readily\nimplementable from data, only requiring calibration of a single scalar\nparameter. We showcase that our formulation can be easily extended to provide\nrobustness to tail risk in multivariate applications as well as in the\nevaluation of other commonly used risk measures.

In drug discovery, scientists aim to select\npotent drugs from a library of unsynthesized candidates, but recognize that it\nis wasteful to repeatedly synthesize highly similar compounds. In job hiring,\nrecruiters may wish to hire candidates who will perform well on the job, while\nalso considering factors such as socioeconomic background, prior work\nexperience, gender, or race. We study the problem of using any prediction model\nto construct a maximally diverse selection set of candidates while controlling\nthe false discovery rate (FDR) in a model-free fashion. Our method,\ndiversity-aware conformal selection (DACS), achieves this by designing a\ngeneral optimization procedure to construct a diverse selection set subject to\na simple constraint involving conformal e-values which depend on carefully\nchosen stopping times. The key idea of DACS is to use optimal stopping theory\nto adaptively choose the set of e-values which (approximately) maximizes the\nexpected diversity measure. We give an example diversity metric for which our\nprocedure can be run exactly and efficiently.

These measurements validate the\nSweet-Parker scaling, consistent with previous studies. To study energy\nconversion processes, we calculate Ohmic dissipation, crucial for understanding\nhow energy is converted between plasma and electromagnetic fields. Decomposing\nelectric field components relative to velocity field, we find that energy\nconversion is initially dominated by the resistive electric field, but\nconvective electric fields take over as reconnection progresses. Plasma\nprimarily gains energy within the current sheet and near the separatrix. We\nperform a scan of magnetization for mildly relativistic plasma to examine\nscaling laws previously derived for non-relativistic inflow. We find the inflow\nis slower than predicted, due to conversion of magnetic energy mostly into\nthermal energy, causing strong compressibility. We calculate and verify the\nscaling of the compressibility factor, providing a more accurate representation\nof inflow dynamics. We analyze the impact of a guide field on reconnection and\nenergy partition, finding that a stronger guide field reduces the reconnection\nrate but has minimal effect on the relative distribution of kinetic, magnetic,\nand thermal energy.

For the observational constraints we\nconsider the Supernova data of Pantheon+ collaboration, the Cosmic\nChronometers, the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillators of DESI DR2 collaboration and\nthe gamma-ray bursts. We find that Weyl Integrable Spacetime fits the data in a\nbetter way than the $\\Lambda$CDM. When all datasets are considered, the\nstatistical comparison indicates a weak to moderate preference for Weyl\nIntegrable Spacetime according to the Akaike Information Criterion and\nJeffrey's scale for the Bayesian evidence.",

The methodology used to obtain this new model associates\ntwo fully non-linear algorithms, a complete exploration of the $V_p$ and $V_s$\nmodel space combined with a grid search method for earthquake locations to\nminimize the P and S arrival time residuals. We calculated the misfit function\nfor approximately 2.10 6 velocity models.

The main features of this new\nmodel compared to other studies is a significant decrease of $V_p$ and $V_s$\nvelocities from surface down to a depth of approximately 3 km and a variable\n$V_p/V_s$ ratio decreasing from 1.86 at the surface to 1.78 at a depth of 8 km.\nThe major influence on the locations of events is a global decrease of focal\ndepths that range from a few hundred metres for deep events to more than one\nkilometre for shallow earthquakes.",

In this paper we investigate\nwhether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye\nview (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories\nthat correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end,\nwe propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as\ntraining data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of\ntraffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object\ndetection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN\narchitecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to\ndiffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training,\nwith inference times under 20\\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the\nproposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic\nparameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion\nDataset.",

    "abstract": "Over-the-air computation (OAC) harnesses the natural superposition of\nwireless signals to compute aggregate functions during transmission, thereby\ncollapsing communication and computation into a single step and significantly\nreducing latency and resource usage. In Part I, digital OAC was formulated as a\nnoise-aware constellation design problem by casting encoder design as a max-min\noptimization that aligns minimum Euclidean distances between superimposed\nconstellation points with squared differences of their corresponding function\noutputs.\n  In this paper, Part II, we address the prohibitive complexity and\nquantization challenges inherent in digital OAC constellation design for\nlarge-scale edge networks. More precisely, we introduce a pyramid sampling\nstrategy that judiciously selects a subset of superimposed constellation points\nto reduce the encoder design complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(q^K)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(q^{K-p+1})$, where $p\\in\\{1,\\dots, K\\}$ denotes the sampling\norder, $q$ levels of modulation, and $K$ denotes the number nodes in the\nnetwork. Under the assumption of symmetric aggregation, this approach enables a\ncontrolled trade-off between computational complexity and function computation\naccuracy. As a special case, we propose majority-based sampling ($p=K$), which\nconfines aggregation to only $q$ consensus points, inherently avoiding\ndestructive overlaps and permitting the use of standard digital modulations\n(e.g., QAM, PSK, ASK) without bespoke constellation designs. We also show via\nseveral simulations, across various aggregation functions, modulation levels,\nand noise levels, that moderate sampling orders attain acceptable performance\nwith orders-of-magnitude fewer constraints than exhaustive designs.",

Just as algebraic\nvarieties provide semantics for many non-classical propositional logics, models\ndefined over algebras in a variety provide the semantics for the corresponding\nnon-classical predicate logics. In particular models defined over varieties of\nresiduated lattices represent the model theory for first-order substructrual\nlogics.\n  In this paper we study the extent to which the classical locality theorems\nfrom Hanf and Gaifman hold true in the residuated lattice setting. We\ndemonstrate that the answer is sensitive both to how locality is understood in\nthe generalised context and the behaviour of the truth-defining algebra. In the\ncase of Hanf's theorem, we will show that the theorem fails for the natural\nunderstanding of local neighbourhoods, but is recoverable in one special case\nfor well-connected residuated lattices. For Gaifman's theorem, rather than\nconsider Gaifman normal forms directly we focus on the main lemma of the\ntheorem from textbook proofs. We prove that for a number of different\nunderstandings of locality, provided the algebra is well-behaved enough to\nexpress locality in its syntax, this main lemma can be recovered.

Both approaches are based on solving multiple groups\nof BGK equations at discrete frequency points. The UGKWP method constructs\nmultiscale macroscopic fluxes at cell interfaces through the integral solution\nof the unsteady BGK equation and efficiently captures non-equilibrium transport\nusing statistical particles. Its wave-particle adaptive framework ensures\ncomputational efficiency across different regimes: in the diffusive limit, it\nmatches the cost of explicit diffusion equation solutions, while in the\nballistic limit, it performs comparably to pure particle methods. The IUGKP\nmethod, specifically designed for steady-state problems, determines the\nparticle evolution scale based on the physical mean free path. This approach\nenables rapid convergence at both large and small Knudsen numbers, with the\nlatter facilitated by a newly constructed macroscopic prediction equation. Both\nmethods incorporate an adaptive frequency-space sampling technique that\nmaintains particle counts per cell comparable to single-frequency methods,\nsignificantly improving computational efficiency and memory usage. The accuracy\nand efficiency of both methods are validated through various numerical tests,\nincluding large-scale three-dimensional conduction heat transfer simulations.\nResults demonstrate their effectiveness in handling complex phonon transport\nphenomena across multiple scales.",

We verify the effectiveness of\nthe FlowRAM in the RLBench, an established manipulation benchmark, and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate that FlowRAM achieves a\nremarkable improvement, particularly in high-precision tasks, where it\noutperforms previous methods by 12.0% in average success rate.

This is because they can encode information from more training samples\nwhile minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context\nwindow for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to\nthe LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This\nconstraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning\nprompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs\ncontinue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally,\nsoft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider.\nFor instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these\nissues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that\nenables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently\ntransfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to\nderive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt\ntransferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential\nprivacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small\npublic dataset.

    "abstract": "Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are space weather phenomena capable of causing\nsignificant disruptions to both space- and ground-based infrastructure. The\ntimely and accurate detection and prediction of CMEs is a crucial steps towards\nimplementing strategies to minimize the impacts of such events. CMEs are\ncommonly observed using coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers (HIs), with some\nforecasting methods relying on manually tracking CMEs across successive images\nin order to provide an estimate of their arrival time and speed. This process\nis time-consuming and results may exhibiting considerable interpersonal\nvariation.\n  We investigate the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to the\nproblem of automated CME detection, focusing on data from the HI instruments\naboard the STEREO spacecraft. HI data facilitates the tracking of CMEs through\ninterplanetary space, providing valuable information on their evolution.\nBuilding on advances in image segmentation, we present the Solar Transient\nRecognition Using Deep Learning (STRUDL) model. STRUDL is designed to\nautomatically detect and segment CME fronts in HI data. We address the\nchallenges inherent to this task and evaluate the model's performance across a\nrange of solar activity conditions. To complement segmentation, we implement a\nbasic tracking algorithm that links CME detections across successive frames,\nthus allowing us to automatically generate time-distance profiles.\n  Our results demonstrate the feasibility of applying ML-based segmentation\ntechniques to HI data, while highlighting areas for future improvement,\nparticularly regarding the accurate segmentation and tracking of faint and\ninteracting CMEs.",

The OSM for the monolithic as well as the block\napproach allows the optimized combination of different coarse spaces for the\nvelocity and pressure component, enabling the use of tailored coarse spaces.\nThe numerical and parallel performance of the different preconditioning methods\nfor finite element discretizations of stationary as well as time-dependent\nincompressible fluid flow problems is investigated and compared. Their\nrobustness is analyzed for a range of Reynolds and Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy\n(CFL) numbers with respect to a realistic problem setting.",

We study the spectra of the one-particle density matrix $\\gamma$ and\nof the one-particle kinetic energy density matrix $\\tau$ associated with\n$\\psi$. The paper contains two results. First, we obtain the bounds\n$\\lambda_k(\\gamma)\\le C_1 k^{-8/3}$ and $\\lambda_k(\\tau)\\le C_2 k^{-2}$ with\nsome positive constants $C_1, C_2$ that depend explicitly on the eigenfunction\n$\\psi$. The sharpness of these bounds is confirmed by the asymptotic results\nobtained by the author in earlier papers. The advantage of these bounds over\nthe ones derived by the author previously, is their explicit dependence on the\neigenfunction. Moreover, their new proofs are more elementary and direct. The\nsecond result is new and it pertains to the case where the eigenfunction $\\psi$\nvanishes at the particle coalescence points. In particular, this is true for\ntotally antisymmetric $\\psi$. In this case the eigenfunction $\\psi$ exhibits\nenhanced regularity at the coalescence points which leads to the faster decay\nof the eigenvalues: $\\lambda_k(\\gamma)\\le C_3 k^{-10/3}$ and\n$\\lambda_k(\\tau)\\le C_4 k^{-8/3}$.\n  The proofs rely on the estimates for the derivatives of the eigenfunction\n$\\psi$ that depend explicitly on the distance to the coalescence points. Some\nof these estimates are borrowed directly from, and some are derived using the\nmethods of a recent paper by S. Fournais and T. \\O. S\\o rensen.",

    "abstract": "Human decision-making belongs to the foundation of our society and\ncivilization, but we are on the verge of a future where much of it will be\ndelegated to artificial intelligence. The arrival of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) has transformed the nature and scope of AI-supported decision-making;\nhowever, the process by which they learn to make decisions, compared to humans,\nremains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the decision-making\nbehavior of five leading LLMs across three core dimensions of real-world\ndecision-making: uncertainty, risk, and set-shifting. Using three\nwell-established experimental psychology tasks designed to probe these\ndimensions, we benchmarked LLMs against 360 newly recruited human participants.\nAcross all tasks, LLMs often outperformed humans, approaching near-optimal\nperformance. Moreover, the processes underlying their decisions diverged\nfundamentally from those of humans. On the one hand, our finding demonstrates\nthe ability of LLMs to manage uncertainty, calibrate risk, and adapt to\nchanges. On the other hand, this disparity highlights the risks of relying on\nthem as substitutes for human judgment, calling for further inquiry.",

Our results reveal\nthat coalitions tend to shrink over time as temperatures rise, owing to\npotential free-ridings, despite a large size of initial coalition. The threat\nof climate tipping reduces the size of stable coalitions compared to the case\nwhere tipping is ignored. However, at post-tipping period, coalitions\ntemporarily expand as regions respond to the shock, though this cooperation is\nshort-lived and followed by further shrink. Notably, technology-sharing\ngenerates greater collective benefits than sanctions, suggesting that the\nproposed dynamic technology-sharing pathway bolsters coalition resilience\nagainst free-riding while limiting the global warming.

Moreover, in practical open-world scenarios, users\ntypically issue multiple, diverse referring expressions to interact with the\nsame image, highlighting the need for adversarial examples that generalize\nacross varied textual inputs. To address these multimodal challenges, we\npropose a novel adversarial attack strategy termed \\textbf{Multimodal\nBidirectional Attack}, tailored for RES models.

Paths generated by fractional Brownian motions can exhibit\nsignificant irregularity, particularly when the Hurst parameter is small. As a\nresult, classical regression methods may not perform effectively. Signatures,\ndefined as iterated path integrals of continuous and discrete-time processes,\noffer a universal nonlinearity property that simplifies the challenge of\nfeature selection in time series data analysis by effectively linearizing it.\nConsequently, we employ Lasso regression techniques for regularization when\nhandling irregular data. To evaluate the performance of signature Lasso on\nfractional Brownian motion (fBM), we study its consistency when the Hurst\nparameter $ H \\ne \\frac{1}{2} $. This involves deriving bounds on the first and\nsecond moments of the signature. For the case $ H > \\frac{1}{2} $, we use the\nsignature defined in the Young sense, while for $ H < \\frac{1}{2} $, we use the\nStratonovich interpretation.

Here, we\npresent an extended SMBH--Bulge mass scaling relationship using these lower\nmass TDE black holes and their host galaxies. Bulge masses are derived using\nProspector fits to UV-MIR spectral energy distributions for the hosts of 40\nTDEs that have a detected late-time UV/optical plateau emission, from which a\nSMBH mass is derived. Overall, we find that TDE plateaus are a successful\nmethod for probing BH scaling relations. We combine the observed TDE sample\nwith a higher mass SMBH sample and extend the known relationship, recovering a\nsteeper slope ($m = 1.34 \\pm 0.03$) than current literature estimates, which\nfocus on the high mass regime. For the TDE only sample, we measure an equally\nsignificant but shallower relationship with a power-law slope of $m = 1.17 \\pm\n0.10$ and significance $<0.001$. Forward modelling is used to determine whether\nknown selection effects can explain both the comparatively flatter TDE only\nrelation and the overall steepening across the full SMBH mass range. We find\nthat the flattening at TDE masses can be accounted for, however the steepening\ncan not.

If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning\nsucceeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned\nabstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface\nform. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface\nlinguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language.\nRooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time\nempirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.",

There have been\nintensive investigations ongoing into the development of optical quantum\ncomputers, however, they are limited to small-scale, special-purpose, or\nlow-quality systems. Error correction for fault tolerance is still very\nchallenging, making a full-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer a long-term\ngoal. However, practical testbeds for quantum computers, without the difficulty\nin error correction, are in high demand. Here we present an innovative analog\noptical quantum computer utilising continuous variables. Our analog optical\nquantum computer is based on sequential measurements of time-domain-multiplexed\nlarge-scale two-dimensional entanglement. Accumulated Gaussian noise and\nspurious bias caused by the imperfection of analog computing can be suppressed\nthrough careful calibration and repeated trials without complicated error\ncorrection. Our system achieves a hundred analog inputs and operates at a clock\nfrequency of 100 MHz with a comprehensive full-stack architecture featuring a\ncloud interface and a Python software development kit (SDK) for enhanced\naccessibility and scalability. We demonstrate the detailed characterisation of\nour optical quantum computer and quantum state sorting as its example\napplication. This development marks a significant step forward in the\nexploration of analog quantum computing, with a potential to accelerate both\nfundamental research and practical applications such as fast and large-scale\noptical neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Given the vast scale of the Web, crawling prioritisation techniques based on\nlink graph traversal, popularity, link analysis, and textual content are\nfrequently applied to surface documents that are most likely to be valuable.\nWhile existing techniques are effective for keyword-based search, both\nretrieval methods and user search behaviours are shifting from keyword-based\nmatching to natural language semantic matching. The remarkable success of\napplying semantic matching and quality signals during ranking leads us to\nhypothesize that crawling could be improved by prioritizing Web pages with high\nsemantic quality. To investigate this, we propose a semantic quality-driven\nprioritisation technique to enhance the effectiveness of crawling and align the\ncrawler behaviour with recent shift towards natural language search. We embed\nsemantic understanding directly into the crawling process -- leveraging recent\nneural semantic quality estimators to prioritise the crawling frontier -- with\nthe goal of surfacing content that is semantically rich and valuable for modern\nsearch needs. Our experiments on the English subset of ClueWeb22-B and the\nResearchy Questions query set show that, compared to existing crawling\ntechniques, neural crawling policies significantly improve harvest rate,\nmaxNDCG, and search effectiveness during the early stages of crawling.\nMeanwhile, crawlers based on our proposed neural policies maintain comparable\nsearch performance on keyword queries from the MS MARCO Web Search query set.\nWhile this work does not propose a definitive and complete solution, it\npresents a forward-looking perspective on Web crawling and opens the door to a\nnew line of research on leveraging semantic analysis to effectively align\ncrawlers with the ongoing shift toward natural language search.",

We first performed a cross-match to a deep\nChandra source list, for which the X-ray sensitivity can be accurately\nquantified, before exploiting available X-ray data further through direct\nextraction of X-ray counts at the positions of COSMOS2020 galaxies.

To address the lack\nof rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce\nSEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced\nperception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates\ngeneralization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution,\ncross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1,\nwe find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces\nlogical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%\nconsistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final\nanswers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To\naddress this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing\nboth answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.\nGRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer\ncorrectness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the\nmodel's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)\nagainst group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths\nthat are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with\nthis adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,\nachieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%\nimprovement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving\nmodel performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks.

For $\\alpha$\nelements O, Mg, Si and Ca, the scatters are 0.05 dex, 0.04 dex, 0.03 and 0.04\ndex, respectively. For C and N elements, the scatters are 0.07 dex and 0.05\ndex.

This is due to the complexity of\nground-state preparation and the long time required to reach the steady state\nnear the critical points. Here we experimentally demonstrate\ncriticality-enhanced quantum sensitivity in a non-Hermitian topological system.\nOur photonic quantum walk setup supports two distinct topological phase\ntransitions at which quantum-enhanced sensitivity is observed even at the\ntransient times, where the system has not yet reached its steady state. Indeed,\nour theoretical analysis shows that the detected enhancement is a direct\nimplication of the steady-state behavior.

The vast amounts of data generated from relevant\nsystems can be processed in different ways revealing important information.\nThis is especially true in the era of edge computing, when advanced data\nanalysis and decision-making is gradually moving to the edge of the network\nwhere devices are generally characterised by low computing resources. In this\ncontext, one of the emerging main challenges is related to maintaining data\nanalysis accuracy even with less data that can be efficiently handled by low\nresource devices. The present work focuses on correlation analysis of data\nretrieved from a pilot IoT network installation monitoring a small smart office\nby means of environmental and energy consumption sensors. The research\nmotivation was to find statistical correlation between the monitoring variables\nthat will allow the use of machine learning (ML) prediction algorithms for\nenergy consumption reducing input parameters. For this to happen, a series of\nhypothesis tests for the correlation of three different environmental variables\nwith the energy consumption were carried out. A total of ninety tests were\nperformed, thirty for each pair of variables. In these tests, p-values showed\nthe existence of strong or semi-strong correlation with two environmental\nvariables, and of a weak correlation with a third one.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex, dynamic\nenvironments necessitates robust and efficient mechanisms for managing shared\nknowledge. A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain\nsynchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or\ninconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations\nin a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's\nefficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%\nvoting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a\n92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an\n82% cache hit rate for memory access.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents FinCoT, a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting\nframework that embeds domain-specific expert financial reasoning blueprints to\nguide large language models' behaviors. We identify three main prompting styles\nin financial NLP (FinNLP): (1) standard prompting (zero-shot), (2) unstructured\nCoT (free-form reasoning), and (3) structured CoT (with explicitly structured\nreasoning steps). Prior work has mainly focused on the first two, while\nstructured CoT remains underexplored and lacks domain expertise incorporation.\nTherefore, we evaluate all three prompting approaches across ten CFA-style\nfinancial domains and introduce FinCoT as the first structured finance-specific\nprompting approach incorporating blueprints from domain experts. FinCoT\nimproves the accuracy of a general-purpose model, Qwen3-8B-Base, from 63.2% to\n80.5%, and boosts Fin-R1 (7B), a finance-specific model, from 65.7% to 75.7%,\nwhile reducing output length by up to 8.9x and 1.16x compared to structured CoT\nmethods, respectively. We find that FinCoT proves most effective for models\nlacking financial post-training. Our findings show that FinCoT does not only\nimprove performance and reduce inference costs but also yields more\ninterpretable and expert-aligned reasoning traces.",

However, real-world graphs may contain noise or\nincomplete information, leading to overly restrictive conditions when employing\nthe biclique model. To mitigate this, we focus on a new relaxed subgraph model,\ncalled the $k$-defective biclique, which allows for up to $k$ missing edges\ncompared to the biclique model. We investigate the problem of finding the\nmaximum edge $k$-defective biclique in a bipartite graph, and prove that the\nproblem is NP-hard. To tackle this computation challenge, we propose a novel\nalgorithm based on a new branch-and-bound framework, which achieves a\nworst-case time complexity of $O(m\\alpha_k^n)$, where $\\alpha_k < 2$. We\nfurther enhance this framework by incorporating a novel pivoting technique,\nreducing the worst-case time complexity to $O(m\\beta_k^n)$, where $\\beta_k <\n\\alpha_k$. To improve the efficiency, we develop a series of optimization\ntechniques, including graph reduction methods, novel upper bounds, and a\nheuristic approach.

This study systematically evaluates\ncommon and medical VLMs across disease diagnosis and visual question answering\n(VQA). Using CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models, we examine (1) off-the-shelf\nperformance gaps in in-domain (ID) settings, (2) whether fine-tuning bridges\nthese gaps, and (3) generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks on unseen\nmedical modalities.

To identify\nmeaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a\nfunction that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the\nliterature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the\nmost appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to\nprovide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically\nfocuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most\nwidespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we\npresent a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We\ncharacterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We\nleverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a\nmethod to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these\nresources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of\npattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a\nclustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the\nsame graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to\nbe processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that\nsome popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the\nbest results.",

    "abstract": "Particles at fluid-fluid interfaces have a wide range of important\napplications in industry, technology and science. Questions remain about what\ngoverns adsorption dynamics and inter-particle interactions, and how mixtures\n-- both of different-sized particles, and particles and surfactants -- behave.\nI probe the dynamics of nanoparticles at oil-water interfaces using high-speed\ntotal-internal-reflection dark-field (TIR-DF) microscopy, comparing gold\nparticles of diameters 20, 40 and 80 nanometers, and investigating the effect\nof an added surfactant. I built a TIR-DF microscope with a spatiotemporal\nresolution of up to 1 nanometer at 20 microseconds, and characterized the\nparticle motion by direct imaging for the diffusive motion within the\ninterfacial plane, and attenuation of light scattering and in-plane motion for\nout-of-plane motion. The addition of surfactant was found to qualitatively\nalter the interaction between the particles and the interface: Adsorptions\nbecame reversible and the size trend in diffusivity was reversed (larger\nparticles diffused faster than smaller ones). The combination of this and the\nrarity of adsorption events of larger particles leads me to propose\nsize-dependent barriers to adsorption at surfactant interfaces. In addition, at\nsurfactant interfaces, many particles' diffusive behavior changed over the\ncourse of a trajectory, indicating several different immersion states that are\nstable on the experimental timescale (approximately 1 second). This study shows\nthat there remain qualitatively new dynamics of nanoparticles at oil-water\ninterfaces to be explored. These dynamics can only be resolved at a high\nspatial resolution, and many of them only at high imaging speed, underlining\nthe importance of novel imaging approaches probing the barriers of achievable\nspatiotemporal resolution.",

Despite significant advances in safety alignment, we\nobserve that minor latent shifts can still trigger unsafe responses in aligned\nmodels. We argue that this stems from the shallow nature of existing alignment\nmethods, which focus on surface-level refusal behaviors without sufficiently\naltering internal representations. Consequently, small shifts in hidden\nactivations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To\nexplore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we\nintroduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the\noriginal response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local\nsensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying\nvulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak\ntrajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA). More\nimportantly, these insights offer a principled foundation for improving\nalignment robustness. To this end, we introduce Layer-wise Adversarial Patch\nTraining~(LAPT), a fine-tuning strategy that inject controlled perturbations\ninto hidden representations during training.

Recent research indicates that these orders can\nintertwine, with the superconducting order parameter coupling to modulations in\nthe electronic density. To elucidate this interplay, we study a two-dimensional\nXY model with a periodic modulation of the coupling strength in one spatial\ndirection. Using a combination of tensor network methods and Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we reveal a non-monotonic, dome-like dependence of $T_c$ on the\nmodulation wavelength, with the peak $T_c$ shifting to longer wavelengths as\nthe modulation strength grows. The origin of this phenomenon is traced back to\nan effective pinning of vortices in the valleys of the modulation, confirmed by\na comparison to modulated $q$-state clock models. These findings shed new light\non the phase behavior of intertwined superconducting and charge-ordered states,\noffering a deeper understanding of their complex interactions.",

A recent result\nshows that neural networks also enjoy a more general interval universal\napproximation (IUA) theorem, in the sense that the abstract interpretation\nsemantics of the network using the interval domain can approximate the direct\nimage map of $f$ (i.e., the result of applying $f$ to a set of inputs) with\narbitrary accuracy. These theorems, however, rest on the unrealistic assumption\nthat the neural network computes over infinitely precise real numbers, whereas\ntheir software implementations in practice compute over finite-precision\nfloating-point numbers. An open question is whether the IUA theorem still holds\nin the floating-point setting.\n  This paper introduces the first IUA theorem for floating-point neural\nnetworks that proves their remarkable ability to perfectly capture the direct\nimage map of any rounded target function $f$, showing no limits exist on their\nexpressiveness. Our IUA theorem in the floating-point setting exhibits material\ndifferences from the real-valued setting, which reflects the fundamental\ndistinctions between these two computational models.

To overcome this\nchallenge, this paper tackles the problem through two complementary directions.\nIt conducts a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of ten widely used large\nlanguage models, including both proprietary and open-weight models from OpenAI,\nMeta, and Google. In parallel, it proposes a novel prompting strategy,\nself-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting. The key idea behind this\nstrategy is enabling models to self-critique and refine their responses without\nadditional training. The proposed method extends the curiosity-driven prompting\nstrategy by incorporating two lightweight in-context steps including\nself-critique step and refinement step.\n  The experiment results on the HONESET dataset evaluated using the framework\n$\\mathrm{H}^2$ (honesty and helpfulness), which was executed with GPT-4o as a\njudge of honesty and helpfulness, show consistent improvements across all\nmodels. The approach reduces the number of poor-quality responses, increases\nhigh-quality responses, and achieves relative gains in $\\mathrm{H}^2$ scores\nranging from 1.4% to 4.3% compared to curiosity-driven prompting across\nevaluated models.

They are called super-Earths,\nhot Earths, mini-Neptunes, hot Neptunes, sub-Neptunes, Saturns, Jupiters, hot\nJupiters, gas giants, ice giants, rocky, terran, subterran, superterran, and so\non. This prompted the emergence of many recent works on taxonomy, or\nclassification, of exoplanets. However, there is still no basic, fundamental\ndefinition of 'What is a planet?'. IAU has forwarded a definition in 2006\nwhich, however, raised more questions than it solved. The first ambitious task\nhere is to establish if there are limits on the size/mass of planets. The lower\nmass limit may be assumed as of Mimas - approximately minimum mass required to\nattain a nearly spherical hydrostatic equilibrium shape. The upper mass limit\nmay be easier - there is a natural lower limit to what constitutes a star:\n~0.08 SU. But then there are brown dwarfs: IAU has defined brown dwarfs as\nobjects that exceed the deuterium burning limit (~13 JU), and giant exoplanets\ngenerally have masses of ~0.3 to ~60 JU. The resolution requires assembling the\nbasic physical parameters that define planets quantitatively. Mass and radius\nare the two fundamental properties, and we propose to use a third correlated\nparameter: the moment of inertia. Based on this, we create the fundamental\nplanet plane where the two parameters are correlated with the third, similar to\na fundamental galactic plane. The fundamental planetary plane with turn-off\npoint diagrams is constructed for the first time in this work. We define a\nplanet as 'A celestial spherical object, bound to a star or unbound, that lies\non the fundamental planetary plane, within a mass range between 0.02 EU to 13\nJU'.",

While\nsuch a trend was anticipated by planetesimal-based planet formation models, it\nremains unclear what kind of atmospheric metallicity trends emerge from\npebble-based planet formation. Moreover, while recent studies of solar system\nJupiter suggest that uppermost observable atmosphere may not represent the bulk\nenvelope composition, it remains uncertain how the envelope inhomogeneity\ninfluences the atmospheric metallicity trend. In this study, we develop disk\nevolution and planet formation models to investigate the possible atmospheric\nmetallicity trends of giant exoplanets formed via pebble accretion and how they\ndepend on the metallicity inhomogeneity within the envelope. We find that\npebble-based planet formation produces two distinct mass-metallicity relations\ndepending on planetary birthplace. Planets formed beyond the H2O snowline\nexhibit a mass-metallicity anti-correlation similar to that predicted by\nplanetesimal-based models if their atmospheres are fully convective. This\nanti-correlation disappears if the convective mixing is inefficient. In\ncontrast, planets formed inside the H2O snowline show a shallower\nmass-metallicity anti-correlation, regardless of the efficiency of atmospheric\nmixing. Many gas giants observed by JWST observations lie around the\nmass-metallicity relation predicted for formation at close-in orbits, although\nsome planets with sub-stellar atmospheric metallicity appear to require unmixed\nenvelopes and formation beyond the H2O snowline.

    "abstract": "In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms\nresults in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token\nsequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To\naddress this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and\nquantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low\ndensity and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that\nthe core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of\nvisual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized\nsparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose\nan alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the\nchallenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature\nextraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)**\ntechnique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a\nhardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies\nand enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the\nperformance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a\nmethodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**,\nachieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical\nresults from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower\ndensity (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to\n**2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.",

To\nimprove support for high-level languages without incurring significant code\nsize or performance overheads, Wasm continuously evolves by integrating\nhigh-level features such as Garbage Collection and Stack Switching. However,\nexisting compilation approaches either lack reusable design -- requiring\nredundant implementation efforts for each language -- or lose abstraction by\nlowering high-level constructs into low-level shared representations like LLVM\nIR, which hinder the adoption of high-level features. MLIR compiler\ninfrastructure provides the compilation pipeline with multiple levels of\nabstraction, preserving high-level abstractions throughout the compilation\npipeline, yet the current MLIR pipeline relies on the LLVM backend for Wasm\ncode generation, thereby inheriting LLVM's limitations.\n  This paper presents a novel compilation pipeline for Wasm, featuring Wasm\ndialects explicitly designed to represent high-level Wasm constructs within\nMLIR. Our approach enables direct generation of high-level Wasm code from\ncorresponding high-level MLIR dialects without losing abstraction, providing a\nmodular and extensible way to incorporate high-level Wasm features. We\nillustrate this extensibility through a case study that leverages Stack\nSwitching, a recently introduced high-level feature of Wasm.

    "abstract": "Inference-time scaling has proven effective in boosting large language model\n(LLM) performance through increased test-time computation. Yet, its practical\napplication is often hindered by reliance on external verifiers or a lack of\noptimization for realistic computational constraints. We propose DynScaling,\nwhich addresses these limitations through two primary innovations: an\nintegrated parallel-sequential sampling strategy and a bandit-based dynamic\nbudget allocation framework. The integrated sampling strategy unifies parallel\nand sequential sampling by constructing synthetic sequential reasoning chains\nfrom initially independent parallel responses, promoting diverse and coherent\nreasoning trajectories. The dynamic budget allocation framework formulates the\nallocation of computational resources as a multi-armed bandit problem,\nadaptively distributing the inference budget across queries based on the\nuncertainty of previously sampled responses, thereby maximizing computational\nefficiency. By combining these components, DynScaling effectively improves LLM\nperformance under practical resource constraints without the need for external\nverifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that DynScaling consistently\nsurpasses existing verifier-free inference scaling baselines in both task\nperformance and computational cost.",

However, these systems are\npractically unusable due to extremely high end-to-end latency (e.g., tens of\nminutes) for tasks that typically take humans just a few minutes to complete.\nTo understand the cause behind this and to guide future developments of\ncomputer agents, we conduct the first study on the temporal performance of\ncomputer-use agents on OSWorld, the flagship benchmark in computer-use AI. We\nfind that large model calls for planning and reflection account for the\nmajority of the overall latency, and as an agent uses more steps to complete a\ntask, each successive step can take 3x longer than steps at the beginning of a\ntask. We then construct OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of the\noriginal OSWorld dataset that contains a human-determined trajectory for each\ntask. We evaluate 16 agents on their efficiency using OSWorld-Human and found\nthat even the highest-scoring agents on OSWorld take 1.4-2.7x more steps than\nnecessary.",

The proximity-induced band deformations produce phenomena\nsuch as bulk-like dispersion that coexist with Landau levels and\nvalley-polarized current paths. It is shown that edge state coupling can be\nenhanced by continuously varying the magnetic field between two non-trivial\ntopological phases. The mechanism by which neighboring edge states modify the\nband structure is addressed by tracking their wave-functions over isolated\nbands and by analyzing the magnetic confinement potential near the domain wall.\nBy calculating the local current density, we show that the coexistence of\ntopological edge states with bulk-like dispersion can lead to the appearance of\nanti-chirality, in which co-propagating currents appear in the edges while the\nrest of the nanoribbon is occupied with bulk states.

Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where\nprofit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore,\nwhen the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly\ncollude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same\nmechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where\nmutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both\nprisoners in one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game,\na class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much\nattention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are\nautocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players. There were\nmany attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend\nthem so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show\nthat zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly\ngame. Especially, we prove that an averagely unbeatable zero-determinant\nstrategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the\nopponents. Second, we numerically show that the averagely unbeatable\nzero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used\nagainst an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when\nit is used against two adaptively learning players. Our findings elucidate some\nnegative impact of zero-determinant strategies in oligopoly market.",

Although recent research has increasingly focused on\nnon-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable\ndevices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the\nlimitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or\nmmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.\nThese limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,\nincluding system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading\nin WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based\nmethods.

On\ngalaxy cluster scale, the most recent parametric study based on 303 multiple\nimages features a LUMC, in the south of the cluster. On galaxy scale, the most\nrecent GRALE non-parametric study based on 237 multiple images features two\nLUMCs, M1 and M2. Given the implications of these findings in the context of\nstructure formation and evolution, we test these features parametrically, using\nLENSTOOL. First, we show that a mass model where each large scale DM component\nintroduced in the modelling is associated with a stellar counterpart can\nreproduce the 303 multiple images, removing the need for any cluster scale LUMC\nin \\lens. We then update the GRALE model using the 303 multiple images, finding\nthat one of the two galaxy scale LUMC, M1, is no longer significant, while M2\nremains. We test M2 by explicitely including it in our parametric model. We\nfind that the inclusion of this LUMC does not improve the global RMS, but\nmildly improves locally the RMS for one multiple image located close to M2.\nBesides, the preferred mass for M2 corresponds to the lowest mass allowed by\nthe adopted prior. M2 is therefore not strongly favoured by a parametric\napproach but it is not ruled out. We present a comparison of parametric and\nnon-parametric models in the M2 area. Both approaches show very similar surface\nmass density at this location, with a 5-6 % difference between the mass maps.\nThe difference is that GRALE favors a distinct mass substructure when LENSTOOL\nfavors a more diffuse mass distribution. We have been able to propose a\nparametric mass model without including any LUMCs, providing further evidences\nfor DM being associated with light in clusters.",

Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis\nacross domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum\nphysics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is\nto optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as\ngradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and\ntensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly\nnonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing\nsignificant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.\n  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach\nto solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging\nthe canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained\nto be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient\ndescent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold.\nUnder a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian\nregularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges\nto the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized.

    "abstract": "We present the monitoring of the TeV-emitting radio galaxies M87, NGC~1275,\n3C~264, and IC~310 with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC)\nover a period of approximately $7.5$ years. The analysis includes light curves\nat daily, weekly and monthly time scales for the four sources. We report the\ndetection of gamma-ray emission from M87 with a significance exceeding\n5$\\sigma$. Due to its significant detection, this work reports the integrated\nTeV spectrum of M87 from the longest temporal coverage up to date. The source\nis well described as a point-like source modeled by a power law spectrum with\nspectral index $\\alpha = 2.53\\pm0.29$ and a flux of $(7.09\\pm\n1.24)\\times10^{-13}$ $\\rm{cm}^{-2}\\,{s}^{-1}\\,{TeV}^{-1}$ at $1\\,\\rm{TeV}$. The\nmaximum energy of the detected emission in M87, at 1$\\sigma$ confidence level\n(C.L.), reaches 26.5 TeV. HAWC's observation of M87 reveals a low flux spectrum\nfor the longest observation to date of this radio galaxy. 3C~264 is marginally\ndetected with a significance slightly below 4$\\sigma$, while NGC~1275 and\nIC~310 are not detected. The weekly light curves show an increased number of\nfluxes above $2\\sigma$ for M87 starting in 2019, and for 3C~264 starting in\n2018, which can be interpreted as the moment for which these sources start to\nexhibit an enhanced steady TeV emission. Overall, in the four radio galaxies,\nthe cumulative significance over time indicates a behavior that resembles that\nof a gamma-ray variable active galaxy, such as the blazar Markarian 421. This\nsupports the importance of monitoring radio galaxies to identify periods of\nhigher activity and flares, enabling further multi-messenger studies.",

However, great uncertainty surrounds our current understanding of CO\nemission. We investigate the implications of this modeling uncertainty on CMB\nsurveys. Using a range of star formation rate and luminosity relations, we\ngenerate a suite of CO simulations across cosmic time, together with the\nbroadband cosmic infrared background (CIB). From these, we quantify the power\nspectrum signatures of CO that we would observe in a CMB experiment at 90, 150,\nand 220 GHz. We find that the resulting range of CO auto-spectra spans up to\ntwo orders of magnitude and that while CO on its own is unlikely to be\ndetectable in current CMB experiments, its cross-correlation with the CIB will\nbe a significant CMB foreground in future surveys. We then forecast the bias on\nCMB foregrounds that would result if CO were neglected in a CMB power spectrum\nanalysis, finding shifts that can be comparable to some of the uncertainties on\nCMB foreground constraints from recent surveys, particularly for the thermal\nand kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and radio sources, and many times\ngreater than the expected uncertainties expected for future data. Finally, we\nassess how the broad range of multifrequency CO$\\times$CIB spectra we obtain is\ncaptured by a reduced parameter set by performing a principal component\nanalysis, finding that three amplitude parameters suffice for a CMB-S4-like\nsurvey. Our results demonstrate the importance for future CMB experiments to\naccount for a wide range of CO modeling, and that high-precision CMB\nexperiments may help constrain extragalactic CO models.",

We have developed a\nhigh-speed imaging system called the Imager of MPPC-based Optical photoN\ncounter from Yamagata (IMONY). The system uses a customized Multi-Pixel Photon\nCounter (MPPC), which independently reads out signals from all $8\\times8$\npixels and functions as an imager based on a Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode\narray. This system assigns timestamps to detected photons with a time\nresolution of 100 ns. We installed IMONY on the 3.8 m aperture Seimei Telescope\nin Okayama, Japan. We have successfully detected the 34-ms period of the Crab\nPulsar and imaged stars in the sensor's field of view. However, we have also\nfound that a small fraction of the pixels have shown double or multiple pulses\nthat are used for photon arrival timing. This situation is likely due to\ncircuit noise and may unfortunately result in overestimating the number of\nphotons detected. In order to precisely estimate the photon flux of targets or\nthe sky background, calibration of such over-counts is important. We measured\nthe number of detected photons relative to the light intensity of each pixel in\na laboratory environment. We estimated the number of spurious hit pulses caused\nby signal tail fluctuations exceeding the comparator threshold, based on the\nexponential distribution of time intervals between pulses. These are distinct\nfrom typical SiPM afterpulses and originate from electronic effects in our\nreadout system.

In this paper, we propose a generic\nblockchain-based steganography framework (GBSF). The sender generates the\nrequired fields such as amount and fees, where the additional covert data is\nembedded to enhance the channel capacity. Based on GBSF, we design a reversible\ngenerative adversarial network (R-GAN) that utilizes the generative adversarial\nnetwork with a reversible generator to generate the required fields and encode\nadditional covert data into the input noise of the reversible generator. We\nthen explore the performance flaw of R-GAN. To further improve the performance,\nwe propose R-GAN with Counter-intuitive data preprocessing and Custom\nactivation functions, namely CCR-GAN. The counter-intuitive data preprocessing\n(CIDP) mechanism is used to reduce decoding errors in covert data, while it\nincurs gradient explosion for model convergence. The custom activation function\nnamed ClipSigmoid is devised to overcome the problem. Theoretical justification\nfor CIDP and ClipSigmoid is also provided.

    "abstract": "Recent cosmological parameter analyses combining DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) data with external probes, such as Pantheon+ Supernovae (SNe)\nobservations, have reported deviations of the dark energy equation-of-state\nparameters ($\\oo, \\oa$) from the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model predictions\n($\\oo=-1, \\oa=0$). A notable aspect of these results is the role of $\\Omo$\nprior information from SNe, which is known to exhibit tension with BAO-only\nconstraints. In this study, we rigorously investigate this effect through a\nstatistical analysis using 100 mock DESI DR2 BAO data realizations. We\ndemonstrate that the strong degeneracy between $\\oo$, $\\oa$, and $\\Omo$ causes\nsignificant biases in the estimated dark energy parameters when the $\\Omo$\nprior mean deviates from its true underlying value. Specifically, applying an\n$\\Omo$ prior mean of 0.33 (consistent with some SNe-only constraints) to mock\ndata, assuming a true $\\Lambda$CDM universe ($\\Omo=0.30, \\oo=-1, \\oa=0$),\nyields biased estimates such as $\\oo \\approx -0.82 \\pm 0.06$ and $\\oa \\approx\n-0.82 \\pm 0.4$. This systematic shift, driven by the $\\Omo$ prior, moves the\nestimated parameters towards the non-$\\Lambda$CDM region, offering a\nqualitative resemblance to outcomes reported in current combined DESI DR2 BAO +\nPantheon+ SNe analyses (e.g., $\\oo = -0.888^{+0.055}_{-0.064}$, $\\oa = -0.17\n\\pm 0.46$). Our findings suggest that these observed non-$\\Lambda$CDM\nparameters may largely arise from statistical biases due to $\\Omo$ prior\ntensions between datasets.

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation and ego-motion estimation are significant tasks\nfor scene perception and navigation in stable, accurate and efficient\nrobot-assisted endoscopy. To tackle lighting variations and sparse textures in\nendoscopic scenes, multiple techniques including optical flow, appearance flow\nand intrinsic image decomposition have been introduced into the existing\nmethods. However, the effective training strategy for multiple modules are\nstill critical to deal with both illumination issues and information\ninterference for self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy. Therefore, a\nnovel framework with multistep efficient finetuning is proposed in this work.\nIn each epoch of end-to-end training, the process is divided into three steps,\nincluding optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition and\nmultiple transformation alignments. At each step, only the related networks are\ntrained without interference of irrelevant information. Based on\nparameter-efficient finetuning on the foundation model, the proposed method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised depth estimation on\nSCARED dataset and zero-shot depth estimation on Hamlyn dataset, with\n4\\%$\\sim$10\\% lower error.

    "abstract": "Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL), whether imposed via the\nreward function or the model architecture, often degrade policy performance.\nLagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but often\nrequire intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we\nextend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to\npropose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we\naddress: (1) the Reach-Always-Avoid problem - of achieving distinct reward and\npenalty thresholds - and (2) the Reach-Reach problem - of achieving thresholds\nof two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which\ntypically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable\nBellman forms in this context by decomposing our problem into reach, avoid, and\nreach-avoid problems, as to leverage these aforementioned recent advances. From\na mathematical perspective, the Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems are\ncomplementary and fundamentally different from standard sum-of-rewards problems\nand temporal logic problems, providing a new perspective on constrained\ndecision-making. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (DO-HJ-PPO), which solves these problems. Across a range of\ntasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement, we demonstrate that\nDO-HJ-PPO produces qualitatively distinct behaviors from previous approaches\nand out-competes a number of baselines in various metrics.",

Our results indicate that the evolution of the density parameters\ncorresponding to dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), particularly for\n$\\alpha=1.01$, along with the transition at $z_{t} = 0.55$ of the deceleration\nparameter $q$ from positive values to $-1$, reflects a phase of accelerated\nexpansion that closely resembles the $\\Lambda$CDM model. The behavior of the\nequation of state (EoS) parameter further demonstrates that the Universe's\nevolution aligns well with the framework of the fractional holographic dark\nenergy (FHDE) model, suggesting its compatibility with scenarios of late-time\ncosmology. Moreover, the analysis of the statefinder diagnostics ${(r,s)}$ and\nthe present value of ${(r,s)} = (0.74,0.07)$ reveal characteristics that\nconverge towards the $\\Lambda$CDM fixed point. A comparison between the\nobservational constraints on our model parameters and those of the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel exhibits a strong degree of agreement, thereby reinforcing the physical\nplausibility and consistency of the proposed cosmological model.",

However, most existing models focus on node-level\nrepresentation or isolated edge attributes, underutilizing the relational\nstructure between interactions. We propose SEP-GCN, a novel graph-based\nrecommendation framework that learns from pairs of contextually similar\ninteraction edges, each representing a user-item check-in event. By identifying\nedge pairs that occur within similar temporal windows or geographic proximity,\nSEP-GCN augments the user-item graph with contextual similarity links. These\nlinks bridge distant but semantically related interactions, enabling improved\nlong-range information propagation. The enriched graph is processed via an\nedge-aware convolutional mechanism that integrates contextual similarity into\nthe message-passing process. This allows SEP-GCN to model user preferences more\naccurately and robustly, especially in sparse or dynamic environments.\nExperiments on benchmark data sets show that SEP-GCN consistently outperforms\nstrong baselines in both predictive accuracy and robustness.",

Current ISAC systems\npredominantly rely on deterministic pilot signals within the signal frame to\naccomplish sensing tasks. However, these pilot signals typically occupy only a\nsmall portion, e.g., 0.15% to 25%, of the time-frequency resources. To enhance\nthe system utility, a promising solution is to repurpose the extensive random\ndata payload signals for sensing tasks. In this paper, we analyze the ISAC\nperformance of a multi-antenna system where both deterministic pilot and random\ndata symbols are employed for sensing tasks. By capitalizing on random matrix\ntheory (RMT), we first derive a semi-closed-form asymptotic expression of the\nergodic linear minimum mean square error (ELMMSE). Then, we formulate an ISAC\nprecoding optimization problem to minimize the ELMMSE, which is solved via a\nspecifically tailored successive convex approximation (SAC) algorithm. To\nprovide system insights, we further derive a closed-form expression for the\nasymptotic ELMMSE at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our analysis reveals\nthat, compared with conventional sensing implemented by deterministic signals,\nthe sensing performance degradation induced by random signals is critically\ndetermined by the ratio of the transmit antenna size to the data symbol length.\nBased on this result, the ISAC precoding optimization problem at high SNRs is\ntransformed into a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved.\nSimulation results validate the accuracy of the derived asymptotic expressions\nof ELMMSE and the performance of the proposed precoding schemes. Particularly,\nby leveraging data payload signals for sensing tasks, the sensing error is\nreduced by up to 5.6 dB compared to conventional pilot-based sensing.",

The process of injecting\nCO$_2$ requires reliable predictions of the stress in the formation and the\nfluid pressure distributions -- particularly since monitoring of the CO$_2$\nmigration is difficult -- to mitigate leakage, prevent induced seismicity, and\nanalyze wellbore stability. A key aspect of CO$_2$ is the gas-liquid phase\ntransition at the temperatures and pressures of relevance to leakage and\nsequestration, which has been recognized as being critical for accurate\npredictions but has been challenging to model without \\textit{ad hoc}\nempiricisms.\n  This paper presents a robust multiphase thermodynamics-based poromechanics\nmodel to capture the complex phase transition behavior of CO$_2$ and predict\nthe stress and pressure distribution under super- and sub- critical conditions\nduring the injection process. A finite element implementation of the model is\napplied to analyze the behavior of a multiphase porous system with CO$_2$ as it\ndisplaces the fluid brine phase. We find that if CO$_2$ undergoes a phase\ntransition in the geologic reservoir, the spatial variation of the density is\nsignificantly affected, and the migration mobility of CO$_2$ decreases in the\nreservoir. A key feature of our approach is that we do not \\textit{a priori}\nassume the location of the CO$_2$ gas/liquid interface -- or even if it occurs\nat all -- but rather, this is a prediction of the model, along with the spatial\nvariation of the phase of CO$_2$ and the change of the saturation profile due\nto the phase change.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive study of jet substructure modifications in\nhigh-energy heavy-ion collisions using both inclusive jets and $\\gamma$-tagged\njets, based on a multi-stage jet evolution model within the Monte Carlo\nframework JETSCAPE. To investigate hard parton splittings inside jets, we focus\non Soft Drop observables. Our results for the groomed splitting radius and\ngroomed jet mass distributions of inclusive jets show a slight narrowing\ncompared to proton-proton baselines. We demonstrate that this apparent\nnarrowing is primarily a selection bias from energy loss, rather than a direct\nmodification of the splitting structure, by analyzing $\\gamma$-tagged jets,\nwhere such bias is eliminated or significantly reduced. We also show that quark\njets exhibit genuine modifications in their splitting structure, which is not\nseen in gluon jets. These effects are clearly visible in the substructure of\n$\\gamma$-tagged jets, which are dominated by quark jets, but are not apparent\nfor inclusive jets. This demonstrates that $\\gamma$-tagged jets offer a\npowerful probe of medium-induced modifications to the hard splitting structure\nof jets.",

The results indicate that there are 18 deep contact\nbinaries, 39 moderate contact binaries, and 27 shallow contact binaries.

Based on\nthe relationship between the period and semi-major axis of contact binaries,\ntheir absolute physical parameters such as mass, radius, and luminosity were\nderived. The evolutionary status of these 84 targets was studied using the\nmass-luminosity and mass-radius relation diagrams. Their initial masses were\nalso estimated. Our results are compared with those of targets that have been\nhistorically studied.

Specifically, GATE formulates\nthe critical problem to identify an optimal entry point in the proximity graph\nfor a given query, facilitating faster online search. By leveraging the\ninherent clusterability of high-dimensional data, GATE first extracts a small\nset of hub nodes V as candidate entry points. Then, resorting to a contrastive\nlearning-based two-tower model, GATE encodes both the structural semantics\nunderlying G and the query-relevant features into the latent representations of\nthese hub nodes V. A navigation graph index on V is further constructed to\nminimize the model inference overhead.

However, inferring nuclear\nmicrophysics from GW observations necessitates the sampling of EOS model\nparameters that serve as input for each EOS used during the GW data analysis.\nThe sampling of the EOS parameters requires solving the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations a large number of times -- a process\nthat slows down each likelihood evaluation in the analysis on the order of a\nfew seconds. Here, we employ emulators for the TOV equations built using\nmultilayer perceptron neural networks to enable direct inference of nuclear EOS\nparameters from GW strain data. Our emulators allow us to rapidly solve the TOV\nequations, taking in EOS parameters and outputting the associated tidal\ndeformability of a neutron star in only a few tens of milliseconds. We\nimplement these emulators in \\texttt{PyCBC} to directly infer the EOS\nparameters using the event GW170817, providing posteriors on these parameters\ninformed solely by GWs. We benchmark these runs against analyses performed\nusing the full TOV solver and find that the emulators achieve speed ups of\nnearly \\emph{two orders of magnitude}, with negligible differences in the\nrecovered posteriors.

    "abstract": "As the frontline data for cancer diagnosis, microscopic pathology images are\nfundamental for providing patients with rapid and accurate treatment. However,\ndespite their practical value, the deep learning community has largely\noverlooked their usage. This paper proposes a novel approach to classifying\nmicroscopy images as time series data, addressing the unique challenges posed\nby their manual acquisition and weakly labeled nature. The proposed method fits\nimage sequences of varying lengths to a fixed-length target by leveraging\nDynamic Time-series Warping (DTW). Attention-based pooling is employed to\npredict the class of the case simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach by comparing performance with various baselines and showcasing\nthe benefits of using various inference strategies in achieving stable and\nreliable results. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each\ncomponent. Our approach contributes to medical image analysis by not only\nembracing microscopic images but also lifting them to a trustworthy level of\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting\nrecurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a\nlinearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its\nunidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous\nstates and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision\nmethods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward\nscan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a\nfull receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,\neroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To\neliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM\nblock that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward\nselective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on\nLBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan\ndirections every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra\nbackward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural\nimages and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers\na superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput,\nLBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K\nclassification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic\nsegmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection\ndataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance\nlearning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan.\nExperiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method\nachieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1,\n1.67% better accuracy.",

It is well known that, due to the strength of the nuclear interaction,\nthe problem cannot be treated on the basis of Wigner-Brioullin perturbation\ntheory. Recently, high-angular-momentum Rydberg states of exotic atomic systems\nwith hadronic constituents have been identified as promising candidates for the\nsearch of New Physics in the low-energy sector of the Standard Model. In order\nto render this endeavor feasible, it is necessary to estimate the\nstrong-interaction correction to the atomic energy levels. We thus derive a\ngeneralized Deser-Trueman formula for the induced energy shift for a general\nhydrogenic bound state with principal quantum number $n$ and orbital angular\nmomentum quantum number~$\\ell$, and find that the energy shift is given by the\nformula delta E = 2 alpha_{n, L} beta_L (a_h/a_0)^(2 L + 1) E_h/n^3, where\nalpha_{n,0} = 1, alpha_{n,L} is the product from s=1 to s=L of the expression\n(s^(-2) - n^(-2)), beta_L = (2 L + 1)/[(2 L + 1)!!]^2, where E_h is the Hartree\nenergy, a_h is the hadronic radius and a_0 is the generalized Bohr radius.

It can be observed that the near-field channel capacity gain is\nrelatively obvious when large-scale MIMO is adopted at both receiving and\ntransmitter ends, but the near-field channel capacity gain may be limited in\nthe actual communication system with the small antenna array at receiving end.\nThis work will give some reference to the near-field communication systems.",

In this paper, through theoretical analysis, we for the first time\npropose the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs (SAEs\nthat learn unique and ground truth monosemantic features), including 1) extreme\nsparsity of the ground truth feature, 2) sparse activation of SAEs, and 3)\nenough hidden dimensions of SAEs. Moreover, when the identifiable conditions\nare not fully met, we propose a reweighting strategy to improve the\nidentifiability. Specifically, following the theoretically suggested weight\nselection principle, we prove that the gap between the loss functions of SAE\nreconstruction and monosemantic feature reconstruction can be narrowed, so that\nthe reweighted SAEs have better reconstruction of the ground truth monosemantic\nfeatures than the uniformly weighted ones. In experiments, we validate our\ntheoretical findings and show that our weighted SAE significantly improves\nfeature monosemanticity and interpretability.",

Existing works confirm the\nexistence of this phenomenon and provide useful insights. However, the\nliterature lacks efforts to precisely identify when critical periods occur. In\nthis work, we fill this gap by introducing a systematic approach for\nidentifying critical periods during the training of deep neural networks,\nfocusing on eliminating computationally intensive regularization techniques and\neffectively applying mechanisms for reducing computational costs, such as data\npruning. Our method leverages generalization prediction mechanisms to pinpoint\ncritical phases where training recipes yield maximum benefits to the predictive\nability of models. By halting resource-intensive recipes beyond these periods,\nwe significantly accelerate the learning phase and achieve reductions in\ntraining time, energy consumption, and CO$_2$ emissions. Experiments on\nstandard architectures and benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method.\nSpecifically, we achieve significant milestones by reducing the training time\nof popular architectures by up to 59.67%, leading to a 59.47% decrease in\nCO$_2$ emissions and a 60% reduction in financial costs, without compromising\nperformance. Our work enhances understanding of training dynamics and paves the\nway for more sustainable and efficient deep learning practices, particularly in\nresource-constrained environments.

In some\ncircumstances it is possible for an observer, say Alice, to recover that\ninformation, as a classical measurement record, in a variety of different ways,\nusing different experimental setups. The optimal way for Alice to estimate the\nquantum state at time $t$ from the record before $t$ is known as quantum\nfiltering. Recently, a version of quantum smoothing, in which Alice estimates\nthe state at time $t$ using her record on both sides of $t$, has been\ndeveloped. It requires Alice to make optimal inferences about the pre-$t$\nrecord of a second observer, say Bob, who recovers whatever information Alice\ndoes not. But for Alice to make this inference, she needs to know Bob's setup.\nIn this paper we consider what happens if Alice is mistaken in her assumption\nabout Bob's setup. We show that the accuracy -- as measured by the\nTrace-Squared-Deviation, of Alice's estimate of the true state (i.e., the state\nconditioned on her and Bob's pre-$t$ records) -- depends strongly on her setup,\nBob's actual setup, and the wrongly assumed setup. Using resonance fluorescence\nas a model system, we show numerically that in some cases the wrong smoothing\nis almost as accurate as the right smoothing, but in other cases much less\naccurate, even being less accurate than Alice's filtered estimate. Curiously,\nin some of the latter cases the fidelity of Alice's wrong estimate with the\ntrue state is actually higher than that of her right estimate. We explain this,\nand other features we observe numerically, by some simple analytical arguments.",

We first investigate two emerging nonlinear data\ntransformation frameworks for image compression: Implicit Neural\nRepresentations (INRs) and 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS). We analyze their\nrepresentational properties, behavior under lossy compression, and convergence\ndynamics. Our results highlight key trade-offs between INR's compact,\nresolution-flexible neural field representations and GS's highly\nparallelizable, spatially interpretable fitting, providing insights for future\nhybrid and compression-aware frameworks. Next, we introduce the textual\ntransform that enables efficient compression at ultra-low bitrate regimes and\nsimultaneously enhances human perceptual satisfaction. When combined with the\nconcept of denoising via lossy compression, the textual transform becomes a\npowerful tool for denoising tasks. Finally, we present a Lempel-Ziv (LZ78)\n\"transform\", a universal method that, when applied to any member of a broad\ncompressor family, produces new compressors that retain the asymptotic\nuniversality guarantees of the LZ78 algorithm. Collectively, these three\ntransforms illuminate the fundamental trade-offs between coding efficiency and\ncomputational cost.

To satisfy low-latency and high-computation demands, the\nintegration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)\nsystems plays a vital role, which offloads computing tasks from terminal\ndevices to nearby UAVs, enabling flexible and resilient service provisions for\nground users. To promote the development of LAENets, it is significant to\nachieve low-carbon multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks. However, several challenges\nhinder this implementation, including the complexity of multi-dimensional UAV\nmodeling and the difficulty of multi-objective coupled optimization. To this\nend, this paper proposes a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based\nLarge Language Model (LLM) agent framework for model formulation. Specifically,\nwe develop HybridRAG by combining KeywordRAG, VectorRAG, and GraphRAG,\nempowering LLM agents to efficiently retrieve structural information from\nexpert databases and generate more accurate optimization problems compared with\ntraditional RAG-based LLM agents. After customizing carbon emission\noptimization problems for multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks, we propose a Double\nRegularization Diffusion-enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (R\\textsuperscript{2}DSAC)\nalgorithm to solve the formulated multi-objective optimization problem. The\nR\\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm incorporates diffusion entropy\nregularization and action entropy regularization to improve the performance of\nthe diffusion policy.

In this paper,\nwe investigate how acceleration influences the interaction between two\nground-state atoms that are synchronously and uniformly accelerated in vacuum\nwith proper acceleration $a$ and coupled to a fluctuating electromagnetic\nfield. We find that the resulting interaction potential comprises both diagonal\ncomponents $(\\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j=k$, which are present in both inertial and\nacceleration cases, and off-diagonal components $(\\delta E)^{jk}$ with $j\\neq\nk$, which arise exclusively due to acceleration and vanish in the inertial\ncase. The dependence of each component on acceleration and interatomic\nseparation $L$ generally differs. For small accelerations, the leading-order\ndiagonal components of the van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir-Polder (CP)\ninteraction potentials remain unchanged from their inertial counterparts,\nexhibiting the standard scaling behaviors $\\sim L^{-6}$ and $\\sim L^{-7}$,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Joy's law describes the tilt of bipolar active regions on the Sun away from\nan east-west orientation, where the flux of the polarity concentrated at the\nprograde side tends to be closer to the equator than the polarity on the\nretrograde side. Joy's law is attributed to the Coriolis force because of the\nobserved increase in tilt angle at higher latitudes. This tilt plays a crucial\nrole in some solar dynamo models. Our goal is to model the effects of the\nCoriolis force on a flux tube as it rises through the near-surface convection\nzone. We use a three-dimensional Cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an\nuntwisted flux tube ascending from a depth of 11 Mm. We model the Coriolis\neffect using the f-plane approximation, that only considers and acts on\nhorizontal flows. On the Sun, Joy's law is weak and is only evident as an\naverage over many active regions. To achieve a measurable effect in a single\nsimulation, we consider a rotation rate 110 times faster than the Sun. The\nsimulation shows that the flux tube emerges at the surface with a tilt angle\nconsistent with Joy's law when scaled to the Sun's slower rotation, and the\ntilt angle does not substantially change after emergence. This shows that the\nCoriolis force acting on flows horizontal to the surface within the\nnear-surface convection zone is consistent with Joy's law.",

However, the atomic-scale origins of the\ndefect states responsible for these properties are not yet fully understood. In\nthis study, we use molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by\nmachine-learning interatomic potentials to investigate defects in amorphous\nGeSe. We begin by benchmarking several potential architectures-including\ndescriptor-based models and graph neural network (GNN) models-and show that\nfaithfully representing amorphous GeSe requires capturing higher-order\ninteractions (at least four-body correlations) and medium-range structural\norder. We find that GNN architectures with multiple interaction layers\nsuccessfully capture these correlations and structural motifs, preventing the\nspurious defects that less expressive models introduce. With our optimized GNN\npotential, we examine twenty independent 960-atom amorphous GeSe structures and\nidentify two distinct defect motifs: aligned Ge chains, which give rise to\ndefect states near the conduction band, and overcoordinated Ge chains, which\nproduce defect states near the valence band. We further correlate these\nelectronic defect levels with specific structural features-namely, the average\nalignment of bond angles in the aligned chains and the degree of local Peierls\ndistortion around overcoordinated Ge atoms. These findings provide a\ntheoretical framework for interpreting experimental observations and deepen our\nunderstanding of defect-driven OTS phenomena in amorphous GeSe.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in generating\nhigh-quality and diverse synthetic data. However, their success typically\nassumes a class-balanced training distribution. In real-world settings,\nmulti-class data often follow a long-tailed distribution, where standard\ndiffusion models struggle -- producing low-diversity and lower-quality samples\nfor tail classes. While this degradation is well-documented, its underlying\ncause remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the behavior of\ndiffusion models trained on long-tailed datasets and identify a key issue: the\nlatent representations (from the bottleneck layer of the U-Net) for tail class\nsubspaces exhibit significant overlap with those of head classes, leading to\nfeature borrowing and poor generation quality. Importantly, we show that this\nis not merely due to limited data per class, but that the relative class\nimbalance significantly contributes to this phenomenon. To address this, we\npropose COntrastive Regularization for Aligning Latents (CORAL), a contrastive\nlatent alignment framework that leverages supervised contrastive losses to\nencourage well-separated latent class representations. Experiments demonstrate\nthat CORAL significantly improves both the diversity and visual quality of\nsamples generated for tail classes relative to state-of-the-art methods.",
