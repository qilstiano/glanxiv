    "abstract": "Disease progression models are widely used to inform the diagnosis and\ntreatment of many progressive diseases. However, a significant limitation of\nexisting models is that they do not account for health disparities that can\nbias the observed data. To address this, we develop an interpretable Bayesian\ndisease progression model that captures three key health disparities: certain\npatient populations may (1) start receiving care only when their disease is\nmore severe, (2) experience faster disease progression even while receiving\ncare, or (3) receive follow-up care less frequently conditional on disease\nseverity. We show theoretically and empirically that failing to account for any\nof these disparities can result in biased estimates of severity (e.g.,\nunderestimating severity for disadvantaged groups). On a dataset of heart\nfailure patients, we show that our model can identify groups that face each\ntype of health disparity, and that accounting for these disparities while\ninferring disease severity meaningfully shifts which patients are considered\nhigh-risk.",

    "abstract": "The accurate treatment of non-covalent interactions is necessary to model a\nwide range of applications, from molecular crystals to surface catalysts to\naqueous solutions and many more. Quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and\ncoupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations\n[CCSD(T)] are considered two widely-trusted methods for treating non-covalent\ninteractions. However, while they have been well-validated for small molecules,\nrecent work has indicated that these two methods can disagree by more than 7.5\nkcal/mol for larger systems. The origin of this discrepancy remains unknown.\nMoreover, the lack of systematic comparisons, particularly for medium-sized\ncomplexes, has made it difficult to identify which systems may be prone to such\ndisagreements and the potential scale of these differences. In this work, we\nleverage the latest developments in DMC to compute interaction energies for the\nentire S66 dataset, containing 66 medium-sized complexes with a balanced\nrepresentation of dispersion and electrostatic interactions. Comparison to\nprevious CCSD(T) references reveals systematic trends, with DMC predicting\nstronger binding than CCSD(T) for electrostatic-dominated systems, while the\nbinding becomes weaker for dispersion-dominated systems. We show that the\nrelative strength of this discrepancy is correlated to the ratio of\nelectrostatic and dispersion interactions, as obtained from energy\ndecomposition analysis methods. Finally, we have pinpointed model systems: the\nhydrogen-bonded acetic acid dimer (ID 20) and dispersion-dominated\nuracil-cyclopentane dimer (ID 42), where these discrepancies are particularly\nprominent. These systems offer cost-effective benchmarks to guide future\ndevelopments in DMC, CCSD(T) as well as the wider electronic structure theory\ncommunity.",

However,\ngeneralized model-based uncertainty estimation for spatial aggregates requires\ncomputationally expensive processes like iterative bootstrapping and computing\npixel covariances. Uncertainty estimation for map subregions is critical for\nenhancing practicality and eventual adoption of model-based data products, as\nthis capability would empower users to produce estimates at scales most germane\nto management: individual forest stands and ownership parcels. In this study we\nproduced estimates of standard error (SE) associated with spatial averages of\nAGB predictions for ownership parcels in New York State (NYS). This represents\nthe first model-based uncertainty estimation study to include all four types of\nuncertainty (reference data, sample variability, residual variability, and\nauxiliary data), incorporate spatial autocorrelation of model residuals, and\nuse methods compatible with algorithmic modeling. We found that uncertainty\nattributed to residual variance, largely resulting from spatial correlation of\nresiduals, dominated all other sources for most parcels in the study. These\nresults suggest that improvements to model accuracy will yield the greatest\nreductions to total uncertainty in regions like the northeastern and midwestern\nUnited States where forests are divided into smaller spatial units. Further, we\ndemonstrated that log-log regression relating parcel characteristics (area,\nperimeter, AGB density, forest cover) to parcel-level SE can accurately\nestimate uncertainty for map subregions, thus providing a convenient means to\nempower map users. These findings support transparency in future regional-scale\nmodel-based forest carbon accounting and monitoring efforts.",

This paper examines both\nthe capabilities and challenges of these models within creative workflows.\nWhile they deliver high performance in generating content with creativity,\ndiversity, and technical precision, they also raise significant ethical\nconcerns. Our study addresses two key research questions: (a) how these models\nperform in terms of creativity, diversity, accuracy, and computational\nefficiency, and (b) the ethical risks they present, particularly concerning\nbias, authenticity, and potential misuse. Through a structured series of\nexperiments, we analyze their technical performance and assess the ethical\nimplications of their outputs, revealing that although generative models\nenhance creative processes, they often reflect biases from their training data\nand carry ethical vulnerabilities that require careful oversight.

When studying critical phenomena, approximations are often\nrequired, and the framework of the nonperturbative, or functional\nrenormalization group is no exception. The derivative expansion is one of the\nmost popular approximation schemes within this framework, due to its great\nperformance on multiple systems, as evidenced in the last decades.\nNevertheless, it has the downside of breaking conformal symmetry at a finite\norder. This breaking is not observed at the leading order of the expansion,\ndenoted LPA approximation, and only appears once one considers, at least, the\nnext-to-leading order of the derivative expansion ($\\mathcal{O}(\\partial^2)$)\nwhen including composite operators. In this work, we study the constraints\narising from conformal symmetry for the $O(N)$ models using the derivative\nexpansion at order $\\mathcal{O}(\\partial^2)$. We explore various values of $N$\nand minimize the breaking of conformal symmetry to fix the non-physical\nparameters of the approximation procedure.

    "abstract": "The emerging problem of joint community detection and group synchronization,\nwith applications in signal processing and machine learning, has been\nextensively studied in recent years. Previous research has predominantly\nfocused on a statistical model that extends the stochastic block model~(SBM) by\nincorporating additional group transformations. In its simplest form, the model\nrandomly generates a network of size $n$ that consists of two equal-sized\ncommunities, where each node $i$ is associated with an unknown group element\n$g_i^* \\in G_M$ for some finite group $G_M$ of order $M$. The connectivity\nbetween nodes follows a probability $p$ if they belong to the same community,\nand a probability $q$ otherwise. Moreover, a group transformation $g_{ij} \\in\nG_M$ is observed on each edge $(i,j)$, where $g_{ij} = g_i^* - g_j^*$ if nodes\n$i$ and $j$ are within the same community, and $g_{ij} \\sim\n\\text{Uniform}(G_M)$ otherwise. The goal of the problem is to recover both the\nunderlying communities and group elements. Under this setting, when $p = a\\log\nn /n$ and $q = b\\log n /n $ with $a, b > 0$, we establish the following sharp\ninformation-theoretic threshold for exact recovery by maximum likelihood\nestimation~(MLE): $$ (i):\\enspace \\frac{a + b}{2} -\\sqrt{\\frac{ab}{M}} > 1\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad (ii):\\enspace a > 2$$ where the exact recovery of\ncommunities is possible only if $(i)$ is satisfied, and the recovery of group\nelements is achieved only if both $(i)$ and $(ii)$ are satisfied. Our theory\nindicates the recovery of communities greatly benefits from the extra group\ntransformations. Also, it demonstrates a significant performance gap exists\nbetween the MLE and all the existing approaches, including algorithms based on\nsemidefinite programming and spectral methods.",

Another\ncommon feature of contracts is limited liability, which means that payments can\ngo only from the principal -- who has the deep pocket -- to the agents.\n  With classic applications of contract theory moving online, growing in scale,\nand becoming more data-driven, tools from contract theory become increasingly\nimportant for incentive-aware algorithm design. At the same time, algorithm\ndesign offers a whole new toolbox for reasoning about contracts, ranging from\nadditional tools for studying the tradeoff between simple and optimal\ncontracts, through a language for discussing the computational complexity of\ncontracts in combinatorial settings, to a formalism for analyzing data-driven\ncontracts.\n  This survey aims to provide a computer science-friendly introduction to the\nbasic concepts of contract theory.

To address these anomalies, the work introduces an Iterative\nEncoding-Decoding Variational Autoencoders (Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs)\nmodel to improve the quality of DART time series. Unlike traditional filtering\nand thresholding methods that risk distorting inherent signal characteristics,\nIterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs progressively remove anomalies while\npreserving the data's latent structure. A hybrid thresholding approach further\nretains genuine oceanographic features near boundaries. Applied to complex DART\ndatasets, this approach yields reconstructions that better maintain key oceanic\nproperties compared to classical statistical techniques, offering improved\nrobustness against spike removal and subtle step changes.

Existing methods aim to address these\nbiases by mitigating sensitive attributes in image data; however, these\nattributes often carry clinically relevant information, and their removal can\ncompromise model performance-a highly undesirable outcome. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Fair Re-fusion After Disentanglement (FairREAD), a novel,\nsimple, and efficient framework that mitigates unfairness by re-integrating\nsensitive demographic attributes into fair image representations. FairREAD\nemploys orthogonality constraints and adversarial training to disentangle\ndemographic information while using a controlled re-fusion mechanism to\npreserve clinically relevant details. Additionally, subgroup-specific threshold\nadjustments ensure equitable performance across demographic groups.\nComprehensive evaluations on a large-scale clinical X-ray dataset demonstrate\nthat FairREAD significantly reduces unfairness metrics while maintaining\ndiagnostic accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for fairness and performance\nin medical image classification.",

This rate is higher\nthan the rate of energy loss due to phonon emission (typically, ~1 eV/ps or\nless), so Mn-QD interactions could in principle be used to capture and utilize\nthe kinetic energy of the hot carrier before it is lost to phonons. Here, we\ndemonstrate that by using Mn-doped CdSe/HgSe core/shell QDs, we can efficiently\nconvert the kinetic energy of a hot exciton into an additional electron-hole\npair (exciton). This carrier multiplication process occurs through rapid\ncapture of a hot exciton by a Mn ion, which then undergoes spin flip\nrelaxation, producing two excitons near the QD band edge. Due to the inverted\ngeometry of the CdSe/HgSe QDs, both electrons and holes resulting from carrier\nmultiplication occupy the QD shell, allowing them to be easily extracted from\nthe QD for potential use in electro-optical devices or chemical reactions.",

Data\nextraction focused on privacy concerns, data-sharing practices, the balance\nbetween privacy and utility, trust factors in AI, transparency expectations,\nand strategies to enhance user control over personal data. Findings reveal\nsignificant privacy concerns among young users, including a perceived lack of\ncontrol over personal information, potential misuse of data by AI, and fears of\ndata breaches and unauthorized access. These issues are worsened by unclear\ndata collection practices and insufficient transparency in AI applications. The\nintention to share data is closely associated with perceived benefits and data\nprotection assurances. The study also highlights the role of parental mediation\nand the need for comprehensive education on data privacy. Balancing privacy and\nutility in AI applications is crucial, as young digital citizens value\npersonalized services but remain wary of privacy risks. Trust in AI is\nsignificantly influenced by transparency, reliability, predictable behavior,\nand clear communication about data usage. Strategies to improve user control\nover personal data include access to and correction of data, clear consent\nmechanisms, and robust data protection assurances.

Accurately simulating the chemical kinetics of\nthermal runaway, commonly represented by systems of Arrhenius-based Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (ODEs), requires fitting kinetic parameters to\nexperimental calorimetry data, such as Accelerating Rate Calorimetry (ARC)\nmeasurements. However, existing fitting methods often rely on empirical\nassumptions and simplifications that compromise generality or require manual\ntuning during the fitting process. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) offers a\npromising approach for directly fitting kinetic parameters to experimental\ndata. Yet, for systems created by multiple Arrhenius ODEs, the computational\ncost of fitting using a brute-force approach that searches the entire parameter\nspace simultaneously can become prohibitive. This work introduces a\ndivide-and-conquer approach based on PSO to fit N-equation Arrhenius ODE models\nto ARC data. The proposed method achieves more accurate parameter fitting\ncompared to the brute-force method while maintaining low computational costs.\nThe method is analyzed using two distinct ARC datasets, and the resulting\nmodels are further validated through simulations of 3D ARC and oven tests,\nshowing excellent agreement with experimental data and alignment with expected\ntrends.",

We\nreport here on the measurement and characterization of non-linear behavior and\nspurious response of a Rydberg atomic heterodyne receiver.

For a predetermined set of\natomic receiver parameters and RF carrier wave in the SHF band near-resonant to\na cesium Rydberg transition, we measure and characterize atomic receiver\nselectivity, bandwidth, roll-off, compression point (P1dB), second-order (IP2)\nand third-order (IP3) intercepts, and spur-free dynamic range.

    "abstract": "Integrated photonic microresonators have become an essential resource for\ngenerating photonic qubits for quantum information processing, entanglement\ndistribution and networking, and quantum communications. The pair generation\nrate is enhanced by reducing the microresonator radius, but this comes at the\ncost of increasing the frequency mode spacing and reducing the quantum\ninformation spectral density. Here, we circumvent this rate-density trade-off\nin an AlGaAs-on-insulator photonic device by multiplexing an array of 20\nsmall-radius microresonators each producing a 650-GHz-spaced comb of\ntime-energy entangled-photon pairs. The resonators can be independently tuned\nvia integrated thermo-optic heaters, enabling control of the mode spacing from\ndegeneracy up to a full free spectral range. We demonstrate simultaneous\npumping of five resonators with up to $50$ GHz relative comb offsets, where\neach resonator produces pairs exhibiting time-energy entanglement visibilities\nup to 95$\\%$, coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 5,000, and an on-chip\npair rate up to 2.6 GHz/mW$^2$ per comb line -- more than 40 times improvement\nover prior work. As a demonstration, we generate frequency-bin qubits in a\nmaximally entangled two-qubit Bell state with fidelity exceeding 87$\\%$ (90$\\%$\nwith background correction) and detected frequency-bin entanglement rates up to\n7 kHz ($\\sim 70$ MHz on-chip pair rate) using $\\sim 250$ $\\mu$W pump power.\nMultiplexing small-radius microresonators combines the key capabilities\nrequired for programmable and dense photonic qubit encoding while retaining\nhigh pair-generation rates, heralded single-photon purity, and entanglement\nfidelity.",

    "abstract": "As the AI systems become deeply embedded in social media platforms, we've\nuncovered a concerning security vulnerability that goes beyond traditional\nadversarial attacks. It becomes important to assess the risks of LLMs before\nthe general public use them on social media platforms to avoid any adverse\nimpacts. Unlike obvious nonsensical text strings that safety systems can easily\ncatch, our work reveals that human-readable situation-driven adversarial\nfull-prompts that leverage situational context are effective but much harder to\ndetect. We found that skilled attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in\nopen-source and proprietary LLMs to make a malicious user query safe for LLMs,\nresulting in generating a harmful response. This raises an important question\nabout the vulnerabilities of LLMs. To measure the robustness against\nhuman-readable attacks, which now present a potent threat, our research makes\nthree major contributions. First, we developed attacks that use movie scripts\nas situational contextual frameworks, creating natural-looking full-prompts\nthat trick LLMs into generating harmful content. Second, we developed a method\nto transform gibberish adversarial text into readable, innocuous content that\nstill exploits vulnerabilities when used within the full-prompts. Finally, we\nenhanced the AdvPrompter framework with p-nucleus sampling to generate diverse\nhuman-readable adversarial texts that significantly improve attack\neffectiveness against models like GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125 and Gemma-7b. Our findings\nshow that these systems can be manipulated to operate beyond their intended\nethical boundaries when presented with seemingly normal prompts that contain\nhidden adversarial elements. By identifying these vulnerabilities, we aim to\ndrive the development of more robust safety mechanisms that can withstand\nsophisticated attacks in real-world applications.",

The traditional RIS is a\nmonolithic structure containing a large number of reflecting elements (passive\nor active).

A joint coordinated optimization\nof phase shifts of all the passive RIS elements on the participating UEs is\nenvisioned to enhance the performance of wireless communication between an\nintended transmitter and receiver in the MSE sense. Given that the RIS elements\nare mounted on the UEs, the challenging channel estimation problem with RIS is\nsignificantly simplified. For the case when there is a line-of-sight (LOS)\nchannel and with a large number of participating RIS-mounted UEs, the LOS is\nconverted into a multipath-rich-scattering channel even for millimeter wave and\nTerahertz operating ranges that enable higher spatial multiplexing gains,\nthereby significantly improving the MSE performance compared to traditional RIS\nchannels.

We believe that over-reliance on such a reactive approach to\ncircumvention has given the censors the upper hand in the censorship arms race,\nbecoming a key reason for the inefficacy of in-the-wild circumvention systems.\nTherefore, we argue for a proactive approach to censorship research: the\nanti-censorship community should be able to proactively develop circumvention\nmechanisms against hypothetical or futuristic censorship strategies. To\nfacilitate proactive censorship research, we design and implement CensorLab, a\ngeneric platform for emulating Internet censorship scenarios. CensorLab aims to\ncomplement currently reactive circumvention research by efficiently emulating\npast, present, and hypothetical censorship strategies in realistic network\nenvironments. Specifically, CensorLab aims to (1) support all censorship\nmechanisms previously or currently deployed by real-world censors; (2) support\nthe emulation of hypothetical (not-yet-deployed) censorship strategies\nincluding advanced data-driven censorship mechanisms (e.g., ML-based traffic\nclassifiers); (3) provide an easy-to-use platform for researchers and\npractitioners enabling them to perform extensive experimentation; and (4)\noperate efficiently with minimal overhead.

Specifically, whenever the dependence structure tends to negative\nvalues, the OP decreases and the efficiency of the channel increases. Finally,\nthe efficiency of the analytical results is illustrated numerically.",

Through\nsystematic testing of training examples within the prompts, we identified that\nincluding 10 example scenarios in the model prompts yielded optimal\nclassification performance. Processing speeds varied significantly between\nplatforms, ranging from 0.05 to 2.2 seconds per request.

These differences can create bias in machine learning\nalgorithms, with higher levels of performance for better-represented groups.\nOne promising solution to this problem is to generate synthetic data to\nmitigate potential adverse effects of non-representative data sets.\n  Methods. We build on recent advances in LLM-based synthetic data generation\nto create a pipeline where the synthetic data is generated separately for each\ndemographic group. We conduct our study using MIMIC-IV and Framingham\n\"Offspring and OMNI-1 Cohorts\" datasets. We prompt GPT4-Turbo to create\ngroup-specific data, providing training examples and the dataset context. An\nexploratory analysis is conducted to ascertain the quality of the generated\ndata. We then evaluate the utility of the synthetic data for augmentation of a\ntraining dataset in a downstream machine learning task, focusing specifically\non model performance metrics across groups.\n  Results. The performance of GPT4-Turbo augmentation is generally superior but\nnot always. In the majority of experiments our method outperforms standard\nmodeling baselines, however, prompting GPT-4-Turbo to produce data specific to\na group provides little to no additional benefit over a prompt that does not\nspecify the group.\n  Conclusion. We developed a method for using LLMs out-of-the-box to synthesize\ngroup-specific data to address imbalances in demographic representation in\nmedical datasets. As another \"tool in the toolbox\", this method can improve\nmodel fairness and thus health equity.

    "abstract": "Monitoring animal populations is crucial for assessing the health of\necosystems. Traditional methods, which require extensive fieldwork, are\nincreasingly being supplemented by time-lapse camera-trap imagery combined with\nan automatic analysis of the image data. The latter usually involves some\nobject detector aimed at detecting relevant targets (commonly animals) in each\nimage, followed by some postprocessing to gather activity and population data.\nIn this paper, we show that the performance of an object detector in a single\nframe of a time-lapse sequence can be improved by including spatio-temporal\nfeatures from the prior frames. We propose a method that leverages temporal\ninformation by integrating two additional spatial feature channels which\ncapture stationary and non-stationary elements of the scene and consequently\nimprove scene understanding and reduce the number of stationary false\npositives. The proposed technique achieves a significant improvement of 24\\% in\nmean average precision (mAP@0.05:0.95) over the baseline (temporal\nfeature-free, single frame) object detector on a large dataset of breeding\ntropical seabirds. We envisage our method will be widely applicable to other\nwildlife monitoring applications that use time-lapse imaging.",

We consider solving games played on temporal graphs\nwhere one player aims to explore the graph, i.e., visit all vertices. The\ncomplexity depends majorly on two factors: the presence of an adversary and how\nedge availability is specified.\n  We demonstrate that on static graphs, where edges are always available,\nsolving explorability games is just as hard as solving reachability games. In\ncontrast, on temporal graphs, the complexity of explorability coincides with\ngeneralized reachability (NP-complete for one-player and PSPACE- complete for\ntwo player games). We further show that if temporal graphs are given\nsymbolically, even one-player reachability and thus explorability and\ngeneralized reachability games are PSPACE-hard.

While uncommon in traditional\nenterprise settings that have been the focus of much of the query optimization\nwork to date, such queries are seen frequently in other contexts such as graph\nworkloads. This has led to much work on developing join algorithms for handling\ncyclic queries, on compressed (factorized) representations for more efficient\nstorage of intermediate results, and on use of semi-joins or predicate transfer\nto avoid generating large redundant intermediate results. In this paper, we\naddress a core query optimization problem in this context.

We present an\nextensive experimental evaluation, that compares the factorized representation\napproach with a full semi-join reduction approach as well as to an approach\nthat uses bitvectors to eliminate tuples early through sideways information\npassing.

While\nthe benefits of UHDR irradiation have been well highlighted experimentally, the\nbiological mechanism underlying the FLASH effect is still unclear and highly\ndebated. Nonetheless, to effectively use UHDR radiotherapy in clinics,\nunderstanding the driving biological mechanism is paramount.

We resolve this discrepancy by\nproposing a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics model for active\nelectromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating\nthe minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane.\nActive membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out\nspecific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central\nidea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different\nsources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric\nfields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics.\nOur model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental\ndata available in the literature by varying the activity.

Motivated by such settings, we model a self-interested learning agent\nwith exploration behaviors who iteratively updates reward estimates and either\nselects an arm that maximizes the estimated reward plus incentive or explores\narbitrarily with a certain probability. As a warm-up, we first consider a\nself-interested learning agent without exploration.

The measured shot noise\nFano factor (F) of the partitioned quasiparticles in each of the\ninterferometers quantum point contacts (QPCs), was found to be, $F={\\nu}$[17],\nand not that of the elementary charge, $F=e^*/e$[18,19]. These observations\npoint to interference of bunched (clustered) elementary quasiparticles as\ncoherent pairs, triples, and quadruplets, respectively. A small metallic gate\n(top gate, TG), deposited in the center of the interferometer bulk, forming an\nantidot (or a dot) when charged, thus introducing local quasiparticles at the\n(anti)dots perimeter. Surprisingly, such charging led to a dissociation of the\nbunched quasiparticles and thus recovered the conventional flux periodicity set\nby the elementary quasiparticles charge. However, the shot noise Fano factor\n(of each QPC) consistently remained at $F={\\nu}$, possibly due to the neutral\nmodes accompanied the conjugated states. The two observations - bunching and\ndebunching (or dissociation) - are not expected by current theories. Similar\neffects may likely arise in Jains particle states (at lower temperatures) and\nat even denominator FQH states[20]",

Both utilize a large-sized gaseous TPC,\nnecessitating that the corresponding readout plane is also large.\n  Both also employ microbulk Micromegas readout planes. This technology has\nbecome established in recent years and is continuously improving. Due to the\nsize limitation during manufacturing and the concurrent increase in the size of\ndouble beta experiments, there arose a need to develop a tiled readout plane,\nusing a mosaic of modules with microbulk Micromegas, conforming the first part\nof this thesis, in the context of the PandaX-III experiment. The second part,\nfeaturing a single readout plane of 25 x 25 cm2 installed in TREX-DM, focuses\non the specifications that define a Micromegas and its response in a\nhigh-pressure gaseous detector.\n  Additionally, during the work on TREX-DM, the need to reduce the energy\nthreshold of the experiment emerged, leading to the development of another\ncomposite readout plane, the GEM-Micromegas system, in which a GEM specifically\nmanufactured for this system was installed above the Micromegas.

Traditional\nmethods often rely on fluorescence intensity measurements or manual image\nprocessing, which are time-intensive and fail to capture continuous dynamics.\nThis paper presents a novel computational framework that integrates automated\nimage processing to analyze time-lapse fluorescent microscopy data of endosomal\nescape, hierarchical Bayesian inference, and stochastic simulations. Our method\nemploys image segmentation techniques such as binary masks, Gaussian filters,\nand multichannel color quantification to extract precise spatial and temporal\ndata from microscopy images. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we\nestimate the parameters of a compartmental model that describes endosomal\nescape dynamics, accounting for variability over time. These parameters inform\na Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm, ensuring realistic simulations of\nsiRNA release events over time. Our framework provides a scalable and\nreproducible method for quantifying endosomal escape. The model captures\nuncertainty and variability in parameter estimation, and endosomal escape\ndynamics. Additionally, synthetic data generation allows researchers to\nvalidate experimental findings and explore alternative conditions without\nextensive laboratory work.

However,\nthese idealized simulations are typically performed over an ocean surface with\na high near-surface relative humidity (RH) that stays roughly constant with\nwarming. Over land, near-surface RH is lower than over ocean and is projected\nto decrease by global climate models. Here, we investigate the dependence of\nprecipitation extremes on near-surface RH in convection-resolving simulations\nof RCE. We reduce near-surface RH by increasing surface evaporative resistance\nwhile holding free-tropospheric temperatures fixed by increasing surface\ntemperature. This ``top-down'' approach produces an RCE state with a deeper,\ndrier boundary layer, which weakens convective precipitation extremes in three\ndistinct ways. First, the lifted condensation level is higher, leading to a\nsmall thermodynamic weakening of precipitation extremes. Second, the higher\nlifted condensation level also reduces positive buoyancy in the lower\ntroposphere, leading to a dynamic weakening of precipitation extremes. Third,\nprecipitation re-evaporates more readily when falling through a deeper, drier\nboundary layer, leading to a substantial decrease in precipitation efficiency.\nThese three effects all follow from changes in near-surface relative humidity\nand are physically distinct from the mechanism that underpins the\nClausius-Clapeyron scaling rate. Overall, our results suggest that changes in\nrelative humidity must be taken into account when seeking to understand and\npredict changes in convective precipitation extremes over land.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in NLP have spurred significant interest in analyzing\nsocial media text data for identifying linguistic features indicative of mental\nhealth issues. However, the domain of Expressive Narrative Stories (ENS)-deeply\npersonal and emotionally charged narratives that offer rich psychological\ninsights-remains underexplored. This study bridges this gap by utilizing a\ndataset sourced from Reddit, focusing on ENS from individuals with and without\nself-declared depression. Our research evaluates the utility of advanced\nlanguage models, BERT and MentalBERT, against traditional models. We find that\ntraditional models are sensitive to the absence of explicit topic-related\nwords, which could risk their potential to extend applications to ENS that lack\nclear mental health terminology. Despite MentalBERT is design to better handle\npsychiatric contexts, it demonstrated a dependency on specific topic words for\nclassification accuracy, raising concerns about its application when explicit\nmental health terms are sparse (P-value<0.05). In contrast, BERT exhibited\nminimal sensitivity to the absence of topic words in ENS, suggesting its\nsuperior capability to understand deeper linguistic features, making it more\neffective for real-world applications. Both BERT and MentalBERT excel at\nrecognizing linguistic nuances and maintaining classification accuracy even\nwhen narrative order is disrupted. This resilience is statistically\nsignificant, with sentence shuffling showing substantial impacts on model\nperformance (P-value<0.05), especially evident in ENS comparisons between\nindividuals with and without mental health declarations. These findings\nunderscore the importance of exploring ENS for deeper insights into mental\nhealth-related narratives, advocating for a nuanced approach to mental health\ntext analysis that moves beyond mere keyword detection.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a recent low-cost and\nenergy-efficient technology with potential applicability for future wireless\ncommunications. Performance gains achieved by employing RIS directly depend on\naccurate channel estimation (CE). It is common in the literature to assume\nchannel reciprocity due to the facilities provided by this assumption, such as\nno channel feedback, beamforming simplification, and latency reduction.\nHowever, in practice, due to hardware limitations at the RIS and transceivers,\nthe channel non-reciprocity may occur naturally, so such behavior needs to be\nconsidered. In this paper, we focus on the CE problem in a non-reciprocal\nRIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication\nsystem. Making use of a novel closed-loop three-phase protocol for\nnon-reciprocal CE estimation, we propose a two-stage fourth-order Tucker\ndecomposition-based CE algorithm. In contrast to classical time-division\nduplexing (TDD) and frequency-division duplexing (FDD) approaches the proposed\nmethod concentrates all the processing burden for CE on the base station (BS)\nside, thereby freeing hardware-limited user terminal (UT) from this task. Our\nsimulation results show that the proposed method has satisfactory performance\nin terms of CE accuracy compared to benchmark FDD LS-based and tensor-based\ntechniques.",

In this article we show\nthat it is possible to make atomic resolution maps of the direction and\nmagnitude of La displacements at ~30{\\deg} to the imaging plane in a La2CoMnO6\nthin film on (111) LSAT (LaAlO3-La(Sr,Ta)O3) using a 4-dimensional STEM\n(4DSTEM) methodology.

These details would be completely\ninvisible to all prior techniques in electron microscopy and this sheds light\non why this particular substrate in this orientation best promotes double\nperovskite cation ordering, and the consequent optimal magnetic ordering for\nthis thin film system.

Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of structural\nstability up to sizes as large as $3~ 10^5$ atoms. The developed Al-BFF\npredicts an icosahedral stability range of up to 2000 atoms, approximately 2\nnm, followed by a region of stability for decahedra, up to 25000 atoms. Beyond\nthis size, the expected structure favours face-centred cubic (FCC) shapes. At a\nfixed heating/cooling rate of 100K/ns, we consistently observe a hysteresis\nloop, where the melting temperatures are higher than those associated with\nsolidification. The annealing of a liquid droplet further stabilizes\nicosahedral structures, extending their stability range to 5000 atoms.

    "abstract": "Constraining the physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds is\nessential to our understanding of star formation. These investigations often\nnecessitate knowledge of some local representative number density of the gas\nalong the line of sight. However, constraining the number density is a\ndifficult endeavor. Robust constraints of the number density often require line\nobservations of specific molecules along with radiation transfer modeling,\nwhich provides densities traced by that specific molecule. Column density maps\nof molecular clouds are more readily available, with many high-fidelity maps\ncalculated from dust emission and extinction, in particular from surveys\nconducted with the Herschel Space Observatory. We introduce a new probabilistic\nmodel which is based on the assumption that the total hydrogen nuclei column\ndensity along a line of sight can be decomposed into a turbulent component and\na gravitationally-dominated component. Therefore, for each pixel in a column\ndensity map, the line of sight is decomposed into characteristic diffuse\n(dubbed ``turbulent'') and dense (dubbed ``gravitational'') gas number\ndensities from column density maps. The method thus exploits a physical model\nof turbulence to decouple the random turbulent column from gas in dense bound\nstructures empirically using the observed column density maps. We find the\nmodel produces reasonable turbulent and gravitational densities in the Taurus\nL1495/B213 and Polaris Flare clouds. The model can also be used to infer an\neffective attenuating column density into the cloud, which is useful for\nastrochemical models of the clouds. We conclude by demonstrating an application\nof this method by predicting the emission of the [C II], [C I], and CO (J =\n1-0) lines across the Taurus L1495/B213 region at the native resolution of the\ncolumn density map utilizing a grid of photodissociation-region models.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic skyrmions are spatially localized whirls of spin moments in two\ndimension, featuring a nontrivial topological charge and a well-defined\ntopological charge density. We demonstrate that the quantum dynamics of\nmagnetic skyrmions is governed by a dipole conservation law associated with the\ntopological charge, akin to that in fracton theories of excitations with\nconstrained mobility. The dipole conservation law enables a natural definition\nof the collective coordinate to specify the skymion's position, which\nultimately leads to a greatly simplified equation of motion in the form of the\nThiele equation. In this formulation, the skyrmion mass, whose existence is\noften debated, actually vanishes. As a result, an isolated skyrmion is\nintrinsically pinned to be immobile and cannot move at a constant velocity. In\na spin-wave theory, we show that such dynamics corresponds to a precise\ncancellation between a highly nontrivial motion of the quasi-classical skyrmion\nspin texture and a cloud of quantum fluctuations in the form of spin waves.\nGiven this quenched kinetic energy of quantum skyrmions, we identify close\nanalogies to the bosonic quantum Hall problem. In particular, the topological\ncharge density is shown to obey the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra that\ndescribes neutral modes of the lowest Landau level in the fractional quantum\nHall problem. Consequently, the conservation of the topological dipole suggests\nthat magnetic skyrmion materials offer a promising platform for exploring\nfractonic phenomena with close analogies to fractional quantum Hall states.",

Monolithic VLMs, which avoid\nmodality-specific encoders, offer a promising alternative to the compositional\nones but face the challenge of inferior performance. Most existing monolithic\nVLMs require tuning pre-trained LLMs to acquire vision abilities, which may\ndegrade their language capabilities. To address this dilemma, this paper\npresents a novel high-performance monolithic VLM named HoVLE. We note that LLMs\nhave been shown capable of interpreting images, when image embeddings are\naligned with text embeddings. The challenge for current monolithic VLMs\nactually lies in the lack of a holistic embedding module for both vision and\nlanguage inputs. Therefore, HoVLE introduces a holistic embedding module that\nconverts visual and textual inputs into a shared space, allowing LLMs to\nprocess images in the same way as texts. Furthermore, a multi-stage training\nstrategy is carefully designed to empower the holistic embedding module. It is\nfirst trained to distill visual features from a pre-trained vision encoder and\ntext embeddings from the LLM, enabling large-scale training with unpaired\nrandom images and text tokens. The whole model further undergoes next-token\nprediction on multi-modal data to align the embeddings. Finally, an\ninstruction-tuning stage is incorporated. Our experiments show that HoVLE\nachieves performance close to leading compositional models on various\nbenchmarks, outperforming previous monolithic models by a large margin.

    "abstract": "Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) generation aims to generate a video from an image\nfollowing a text description, which is also referred to as text-guided image\nanimation. Most existing methods struggle to generate videos that align well\nwith the text prompts, particularly when motion is specified. To overcome this\nlimitation, we introduce MotiF, a simple yet effective approach that directs\nthe model's learning to the regions with more motion, thereby improving the\ntext alignment and motion generation. We use optical flow to generate a motion\nheatmap and weight the loss according to the intensity of the motion. This\nmodified objective leads to noticeable improvements and complements existing\nmethods that utilize motion priors as model inputs. Additionally, due to the\nlack of a diverse benchmark for evaluating TI2V generation, we propose TI2V\nBench, a dataset consists of 320 image-text pairs for robust evaluation. We\npresent a human evaluation protocol that asks the annotators to select an\noverall preference between two videos followed by their justifications. Through\na comprehensive evaluation on TI2V Bench, MotiF outperforms nine open-sourced\nmodels, achieving an average preference of 72%. The TI2V Bench and additional\nresults are released in https://wang-sj16.github.io/motif/.",

This work explores the use of deep learning\nmodels to automate the process of seagrass detection and coverage estimation\nfrom underwater video data.

The proposed methodology allows for the\nefficient processing of large volumes of video data, enabling the acquisition\nof much more detailed information on seagrass distributions in comparison to\ncurrent manual methods.

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise\nin aligning LLMs with human preferences, it is less suitable for multi-step\nreasoning tasks because (1) DPO relies on paired preference data, which is not\nreadily available for multi-step reasoning tasks, and (2) it treats all tokens\nuniformly, making it ineffective for credit assignment in multi-step reasoning\ntasks, which often come with sparse reward. In this work, we propose OREO\n(Offline Reasoning Optimization), an offline RL method for enhancing LLM\nmulti-step reasoning. Building on insights from previous works of maximum\nentropy reinforcement learning, it jointly learns a policy model and value\nfunction by optimizing the soft Bellman Equation.

    "abstract": "Federated training methods have gained popularity for graph learning with\napplications including friendship graphs of social media sites and\ncustomer-merchant interaction graphs of huge online marketplaces. However,\nprivacy regulations often require locally generated data to be stored on local\nclients. The graph is then naturally partitioned across clients, with no client\npermitted access to information stored on another. Cross-client edges arise\nnaturally in such cases and present an interesting challenge to federated\ntraining methods, as training a graph model at one client requires feature\ninformation of nodes on the other end of cross-client edges. Attempting to\nretain such edges often incurs significant communication overhead, and dropping\nthem altogether reduces model performance. In simpler models such as Graph\nConvolutional Networks, this can be fixed by communicating a limited amount of\nfeature information across clients before training, but GATs (Graph Attention\nNetworks) require additional information that cannot be pre-communicated, as it\nchanges from training round to round. We introduce the Federated Graph\nAttention Network (FedGAT) algorithm for semi-supervised node classification,\nwhich approximates the behavior of GATs with provable bounds on the\napproximation error. FedGAT requires only one pre-training communication round,\nsignificantly reducing the communication overhead for federated GAT training.\nWe then analyze the error in the approximation and examine the communication\noverhead and computational complexity of the algorithm. Experiments show that\nFedGAT achieves nearly the same accuracy as a GAT model in a centralised\nsetting, and its performance is robust to the number of clients as well as data\ndistribution.",

In\nparticular, we calculate the Keldysh contributions to the leading order\nbispectrum from past infinity, showing that the squeezed limit is dominated by\nthe on-shell evolution. By truncating the time integrals in the analytic\nexpressions for contributions to the bispectrum, we define a `quantum\ninteractivity' and quantitatively identify scales and times for which it is\nsufficient to only assume classical evolution, given a fixed precision. In\ncontrast to typical perceptions inspired by free two-point functions, we show\nthat common non-linear contributions to inflationary perturbations can be\nwell-described by classical evolution even prior to horizon crossing. The\ninsights gained here can pave the way for quantitative criteria for justifying\nthe validity of numerically simulating the generation and evolution of quantum\nfluctuations in inflation.

To implement this simulation-driven design\nprocess, the possible design space of a slender soft pneumatic actuator is\ngeneralized to the design of the circular cross-section. We perform a black-box\ntopology optimization using genetic algorithms to obtain a cross-sectional\ndesign of a soft pneumatic actuator that is capable of reaching a target\nworkspace defined by the end-effector positions at different pressure values.\nThis design method is evaluated for three different case studies and target\nworkspaces, which were either randomly generated or specified by the operator\nof the design assistant. The black-box topology optimization based on genetic\nalgorithms proves to be capable of finding good designs under given plausible\ntarget workspaces. We considered a simplified simulation model to verify the\nefficacy of the employed method. An experimental validation has not yet been\nperformed. It can be concluded that the employed black-box topology\noptimization can assist in the design process for slender soft pneumatic\nactuators. It supports at searching for possible design prototypes that reach\npoints specified by corresponding actuation pressures. This helps reduce the\ntrial-and-error driven iterative manual design process and enables the operator\nto focus on prototypes that already offer a good viable solution.",

This work\nconsiders scenarios where the sensor data comes from images captured by an\ninexpensive camera mounted on the vehicle and where the vehicle contains a fine\nglobal map. Such localization algorithms typically involve finding the section\nin the global map that best matches the captured image. In harsh environments,\nboth the global map and the captured image can be noisy. Because of physical\nconstraints on camera placement, the image captured by the camera can be viewed\nas a noisy perspective transformed version of the road in the global map. Thus,\nan optimal algorithm should take into account the unequal noise power in\nvarious regions of the captured image, and the intrinsic uncertainty in the\nglobal map due to environmental variations. This article briefly reviews two\nmatching methods: (i) standard inner product (SIP) and (ii) normalized mutual\ninformation (NMI). It then proposes novel and principled modifications to\nimprove the performance of these algorithms significantly in noisy\nenvironments. These enhancements are inspired by the physical constraints\nassociated with autonomous vehicles. They are grounded in statistical signal\nprocessing and, in some context, are provably better.

However, reconstructing firm-to-firm networks from available\ninformation poses several practical and theoretical challenges: the lack of\npublicly available data, the complexity of meso-scale structures, and the high\nlevel of heterogeneity of firms. With this work we contribute to the literature\non economic network reconstruction by proposing a novel methodology based on a\nrecently developed multi-scale model. This approach has three main advantages\nover other methods: its parameters are defined to maintain statistical\nconsistency at different scales of node aggregation, it can be applied in a\nmulti-scale setting, and it is computationally more tractable for very large\ngraphs. The consistency at different scales of aggregation, inherent to the\nmodel definition, is preserved for any hierarchy of coarse-grainings. The\narbitrariness of the aggregation allows us to work across different scales,\nmaking it possible to estimate model parameters even when node information is\ninconsistent, such as when some nodes are firms while others are countries or\nregions. Finally, the model can be fitted at an aggregate scale with lower\ncomputational requirements, since the parameters are invariant to the grouping\nof nodes. We assess the advantages and limitations of this approach by testing\nit on two complementary datasets of Dutch firms constructed from inter-client\ntransactions on the bank accounts of two major Dutch banking institutions. We\nshow that the model reliably predicts important topological properties of the\nobserved network in several scenarios of practical interest and is therefore a\nsuitable candidate for reconstructing firm-to-firm networks at scale.",

    "abstract": "Focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy is a promising tool for optimally targeted\ntreatment of spinal cord injuries (SCI), offering submillimeter precision to\nenhance blood flow at injury sites while minimizing impact on surrounding\ntissues. However, its efficacy is highly sensitive to the placement of the\nultrasound source, as the spinal cord's complex geometry and acoustic\nheterogeneity distort and attenuate the FUS signal. Current approaches rely on\ncomputer simulations to solve the governing wave propagation equations and\ncompute patient-specific pressure maps using ultrasound images of the spinal\ncord anatomy. While accurate, these high-fidelity simulations are\ncomputationally intensive, taking up to hours to complete parameter sweeps,\nwhich is impractical for real-time surgical decision-making. To address this\nbottleneck, we propose a convolutional deep operator network (DeepONet) to\nrapidly predict FUS pressure fields in patient spinal cords. Unlike\nconventional neural networks, DeepONets are well equipped to approximate the\nsolution operator of the parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) that\ngovern the behavior of FUS waves with varying initial and boundary conditions\n(i.e., new transducer locations or spinal cord geometries) without requiring\nextensive simulations. Trained on simulated pressure maps across diverse\npatient anatomies, this surrogate model achieves real-time predictions with\nonly a 2% loss on the test set, significantly accelerating the modeling of\nnonlinear physical systems in heterogeneous domains.

To gain insight into the different fluctuation\nmechanisms underlying the neural variability of populations of spiking neurons,\nwe derive and analyze a stochastic mean-field model for finite-size networks of\nPoisson neurons with random, non-full connectivity, external noise and\ndisordered mean inputs.

Comparing to microscopic simulations,\nwe find that the mesoscopic model describes the fluctuations and nonlinearities\nwell and outperforms previous mesoscopic models that neglected the recurrent\nnoise effect caused by the non-full connectivity.

    "abstract": "Tilt-rotor aerial robots are more dynamic and versatile than fixed-rotor\nplatforms, since the thrust vector and body orientation are decoupled. However,\nthe coordination of servos and propellers (the allocation problem) is not\ntrivial, especially accounting for overactuation and actuator dynamics. We\nincrementally build and present three novel allocation methods for tiltrotor\naerial robots, comparing them to state-of-the-art methods on a real system\nperforming dynamic maneuvers. We extend the state-of-the-art geometric\nallocation into a differential allocation, which uses the platform's redundancy\nand does not suffer from singularities. We expand it by incorporating actuator\ndynamics and propeller power dynamics. These allow us to model dynamic\npropeller acceleration limits, bringing two main advantages: balancing\npropeller speed without the need of nullspace goals and allowing the platform\nto selectively turn-off propellers during flight, opening the door to new\nmanipulation possibilities. We also use actuator dynamics and limits to\nnormalize the allocation problem, making it easier to tune and allowing it to\ntrack 70% faster trajectories than a geometric allocation.",

    "abstract": "Load uncertainty must be accounted for during design to ensure building\nenergy systems can meet energy demands during operation. Reducing building load\nuncertainty allows for improved designs with less compromise to be identified,\nreducing the cost of decarbonizing energy usage. However, the building\nmonitoring required to reduce load uncertainty is costly.\n  This study uses Value of Information analysis (VoI) to quantify the economic\nbenefit of practical building monitoring for supporting energy system design\ndecisions, and determine if its benefits outweigh its cost. An extension of the\nVoI framework, termed 'On-Policy' VoI, is proposed, which admits complex\ndecision making tasks where decision policies are required. This is applied to\na case study district energy system design problem, where a Linear Program\nmodel is used to size solar-battery systems and grid connection capacity under\nuncertain building loads, modelled using historic electricity metering data.\n  Load uncertainty is found to significantly impact both system operating costs\n($\\pm$30%) and the optimal system design ($\\pm$20%). However, using building\nmonitoring data to improve the design of the district reduces overall costs by\nless than 1.5% on average. As this is less than the cost of measurement, using\nmonitoring is not economically worthwhile in this case. This provides the first\nnumerical evidence to support the sufficiency of using standard building load\nprofiles for energy system design. Further, reducing only uncertainty in mean\nload is found to provide most of the available decision support benefit,\nmeaning using hourly measurement data provides little benefit for energy\nretrofit design.",

Here, synchrotron X-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Se K-edge sheds light on the impact of\ncarrier-doping on the local structure of the high-$T_c$ (~39 K)\n$Li_{1.0}(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$ phase.

Metrics, such as, a reduced filling\nof Se $4p$ orbitals and shorter Fe-Se bonds in the annealed phase, corroborate\nto a lower electron doping level with respect to the as-made one. Analysis of\nthe metal-ligand thermal motion, based on the correlated Debye model, further\nrelates the higher $T_c$ intercalates with the softening of the local Fe-Se\nbond. Beyond electronic effects, intercalation brings forth host-guest\ninteractions that mediate the dynamics of the bulk crystal structure. For this,\nneutron time-of-flight spectroscopy on the annealed derivative, corroborates to\nthe Se-Fe-Se layer being sensitive to chemical pressure effects imposed by the\nconfined organic guests. This reflects in the phonon density of states, where\nharder low-energy transverse acoustic matrix phonons and molecular vibrations\nare witnessed, with respect to the pristine inorganic ($\\beta$-FeSe) and\norganic ($C_5D_5N$) counterparts. On cooling through $T_c$, these excitations\narrive without a collective magnetic-resonance mode - essential in\nunconventional, spin-mediated mechanisms - enquiring about deviations from\noptimal doping. The work highlights that when the Fe-square planes are tuned\nfar apart, carrier-doping leveraged by intercalation plays a key role in the\n$T_c$ parametrization.",

Consequently, existing research focuses on simple\nparaphrasing-based consistency assessment of LLMs, and ignores complex queries\nthat necessitate an even better understanding of logical reasoning by an LLM.\nOur work therefore addresses the logical inconsistency of LLMs under complex\nlogical queries with primitive logical operators, e.g., negation, conjunction,\nand disjunction. As a test bed, we consider retrieval-augmented LLMs on a\nfact-checking task involving propositional logic queries from knowledge graphs\n(KGs). Our contributions are threefold. Benchmark: We introduce three logical\nfact-checking datasets over KGs for community development towards logically\nconsistent LLMs. Assessment: We propose consistency measures of LLMs on\npropositional logic queries and demonstrate that existing LLMs lack logical\nconsistency, especially on complex queries. Improvement: We employ supervised\nfine-tuning to improve the logical consistency of LLMs on the complex\nfact-checking task with KG contexts.

From these papers, we extracted variables related\nto perception and behaviour generation challenges, as well as factors related\nto the environment, group, and robot capabilities that influence these\nchallenges. Our findings show that key computational challenges in perception\nincluded detection of groups, engagement, and conversation information, while\nchallenges in behaviour generation involved developing approaching and\nconversational behaviours. We also identified research gaps, such as improving\ndetection of subgroups and interpersonal relationships, and recommended future\nwork in group HRI to help researchers address these computational challenges",

Sufficient noise characterization and modeling can provide key\ninsights into the effect of noise on quantum algorithms and inform the design\nof targeted error protection protocols. However, constructing effective noise\nmodels that are sparse in model parameters, yet predictive can be challenging.\nIn this work, we present an approach for effective noise modeling of\nmulti-qubit operations on transmon-based devices. Through a comprehensive\ncharacterization of seven devices offered by the IBM Quantum Platform, we show\nthat the model can capture and predict a wide range of single- and two-qubit\nbehaviors, including non-Markovian effects resulting from spatio-temporally\ncorrelated noise sources. The model's predictive power is further highlighted\nthrough multi-qubit dynamical decoupling demonstrations and an implementation\nof the variational quantum eigensolver. As a training proxy for the hardware,\nwe show that the model can predict expectation values within a relative error\nof 0.5%; this is a 7$\\times$ improvement over default hardware noise models.\nThrough these demonstrations, we highlight key error sources in superconducting\nqubits and illustrate the utility of reduced noise models for predicting\nhardware dynamics.",

In this work, we overcome this\nconstraint and present a blueprint for an error-corrected fermionic quantum\ncomputer that can be implemented using current experimental capabilities. To\nachieve this, we first consider an ancillary set of fermionic modes and design\na fermionic reference, which we then use to construct superpositions of\ndifferent numbers of referenced fermions. This allows us to build logical\nfermionic modes that can be error corrected using standard atomic operations.\nHere, we focus on phase errors, which we expect to be a dominant source of\nerrors in neutral-atom quantum processors. We then construct logical fermionic\ngates, and show their implementation for the logical particle-number conserving\nprocesses relevant for quantum simulation.

However, the\ninherent fluctuations in the active volume impose severe constraints on the\nweight resolution. In order to understand and push these limits, a\ncomprehensive noise benchmarking and noise reduction protocol is introduced.\nOur approach goes beyond the measurement of steady-state readout noise levels\nand tracks the voltage-dependent noise characteristics all along the resistive\nswitching $I(V)$ curves. Furthermore, we investigate the tunability of the\nnoise level by dedicated voltage cycling schemes in our filamentary Ta$_2$O$_5$\nmemristors. This analysis highlights a broad, order-of-magnitude variability of\nthe possible noise levels behind seemingly reproducible switching cycles. Our\nnonlinear noise spectroscopy measurements identify a subthreshold voltage\nregion with voltage-boosted fluctuations. This voltage range enables the\nreconfiguration of the fluctuators without resistive switching, yielding a\nhighly denoised state within a few subthreshold cycles.",

At these energy scales, the Standard\nModel Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework provides an enhanced sensitivity\nto potential new physics effects. This motivates the inclusion of EW\ncorrections not only for SM predictions but also for analyses within SMEFT. In\nthis work, we compute EW corrections in the high-energy limit for a selected\nset of dimension-six operators, specifically the class of four-fermion contact\ninteractions, in key hard-scattering processes relevant to both current and\nfuture colliders: top-quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nand in a muon collider scenario, as well as the Drell-Yan process at the LHC.\nWe first discuss the technical details and challenges associated with\nevaluating EW Sudakov logarithms in SMEFT, contrasting them with the SM case.\nWe then present phenomenological results for the aforementioned processes,\nhighlighting the non-trivial effects introduced by EW corrections arising from\nthe insertion of dimension-six, four-fermion operators. Importantly, the\nresulting $K$-factors exhibit significant deviations from their SM\ncounterparts, with dependencies not only on the process but also on the\nspecific operators considered.

    "abstract": "DNA data storage is rapidly emerging as a promising solution for long-term\ndata archiving, largely due to its exceptional durability. However, the\nsynthesis of DNA strands remains a significant bottleneck in terms of cost and\nspeed. To address this, new methods have been developed that encode information\nby concatenating long data-carrying DNA sequences from pre-synthesized DNA\nsubsequences - known as motifs - from a library.\n  Reading back data from DNA storage relies on basecalling - the process of\ntranslating raw nanopore sequencing signals into DNA base sequences using\nmachine learning models. These sequences are then decoded back into binary\ndata. However, current basecalling approaches are not optimized for decoding\nmotif-carrying DNA: they first predict individual bases from the raw signal and\nonly afterward attempt to identify higher-level motifs. This two-step,\nmotif-agnostic process is both imprecise and inefficient.\n  In this paper we introduce Motif Caller, a machine learning model designed to\ndirectly detect entire motifs from raw nanopore signals, bypassing the need for\nintermediate basecalling. By targeting motifs directly, Motif Caller leverages\nricher signal features associated with each motif, resulting in significantly\nimproved accuracy.

However, current AMP classification\nmethods, primarily relying on sequence-based data, neglect the spatial\nstructure of peptides, thereby limiting the accurate classification of AMPs.\nAdditionally, the number of known AMPs is significantly lower than that of\nnon-AMPs, leading to imbalanced datasets that reduce predictive accuracy for\nAMPs. To alleviate these two limitations, we first employ Omegafold to predict\nthe three-dimensional spatial structures of AMPs and non-AMPs, constructing\npeptide graphs based on the amino acids' C$_\\alpha$ positions. Building upon\nthis, we propose a novel classification model named Spatial GNN-based AMP\nClassifier (SGAC). Our SGAC model employs a graph encoder based on Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to process peptide graphs, generating high-dimensional\nrepresentations that capture essential features from the three-dimensional\nspatial structure of amino acids. Then, to address the inherent imbalanced\ndatasets, SGAC first incorporates Weight-enhanced Contrastive Learning, which\nclusters similar peptides while ensuring separation between dissimilar ones,\nusing weighted contributions to emphasize AMP-specific features. Furthermore,\nSGAC employs Weight-enhanced Pseudo-label Distillation to dynamically generate\nhigh-confidence pseudo labels for ambiguous peptides, further refining\npredictions and promoting balanced learning between AMPs and non-AMPs.\nExperiments on publicly available AMP and non-AMP datasets demonstrate that\nSGAC significantly outperforms traditional sequence-based methods and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among graph-based models, validating its\neffectiveness in AMP classification.",

Previous studies alleviated this tension with a blue tilted\nprimordial power spectrum ($P(k)\\propto k^{m_s}$ with $m_s>1$ at small scales\n$>1~{\\rm cMpc}^{-1}$). In this study, we examine whether the blue tilted model\ncan boost dark matter substructures especially at low redshift, thereby\naddressing other potential challenges to the standard cosmology. First,\nsubstructures in the standard cosmological model may not be sufficient to\nexplain the anomalous flux ratio problem observed in strong gravitational\nlensing. Second, the number of observed nearby satellite galaxies could be\nhigher than the theoretical predictions of the standard cosmology, after\ncompleteness correction and tidal stripping by baryonic disks. To study the\nimpact of a blue tilted primordial power spectrum on substructures, we perform\nhigh-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way\nhost mass halos, evolving to redshift $z=0$. At $z=0$, we find that the\nblue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two\nfor subhalo masses $M_{\\rm sub} \\lesssim 10^{10} ~M\\odot$, whereas the subhalo\n$V_{\\rm max}$ functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum\ncircular velocities $V_{\\rm max}\\lesssim 30 ~{\\rm km/s}$. The blue-tilted\nscaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at\n$\\sim$10\\% of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher\ncentral densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same $V_{\\rm max}$\nat a smaller distance $R_{\\rm max}$ from the center.

Using the two-point correlation function of the Oxygen abundance, we\nfind that, similar to other spiral galaxies, M31 is well-mixed on sub-kpc\nscales but less so on larger (kpc) scales, which could be a result of an\nexponential decrease in mixing speed with spatial scale, and the aforementioned\nrecent merger. Finally, the MMT spectroscopy is complemented by a dust\ncontinuum and CO survey of individual Giant Molecular Clouds, conducted with\nthe Submillimeter Array. By combining the MMT and SMA observations, we obtain a\nunique direct test of the Oxygen abundance dependence of the\n$\\alpha^{\\prime}(^{12}\\mathrm{CO})$ factor which is crucial to convert CO\nemission to dust mass. Our results suggest that within our sample there is no\ntrend of the $\\alpha^{\\prime}(^{12}\\mathrm{CO})$ with Oxygen abundance.",

    "abstract": "The very high-energy afterglow in GRB 221009A, known as the ``brightest of\nall time'' (BOAT), has been thoroughly analyzed in previous studies. In this\npaper, we conducted a statistical analysis of the waiting time behavior of 172\nTeV photons from the BOAT observed by LHAASO-KM2A. The following results were\nobtained: (I) The waiting time distribution (WTD) of these photons deviates\nfrom the exponential distribution. (II) The behavior of these photons exhibits\ncharacteristics resembling those of a self-organized critical system, such as a\npower-law distribution and scale-invariance features in the WTD. The power-law\ndistribution of waiting times is consistent with the prediction of a\nnonstationary process. (III) The relationship between the power-law slopes of\nthe WTD and the scale-invariant characteristics of the Tsallis q-Gaussian\ndistribution deviates from existing theory. We suggest that this deviation is\ndue to the photons not being completely independent of each other. In summary,\nthe power-law and scale-free characteristics observed in these photons imply a\nself-organized critical process in the generation of teraelectronvolt photons\nfrom GRB 221009A. Based on other relevant research, we propose that the\ninvolvement of a partially magnetically dominated component and the continuous\nenergy injection from the central engine can lead to deviations in the\ngeneration of teraelectronvolt afterglow from the simple external\nshock-dominated process, thereby exhibiting the self-organized critical\ncharacteristics mentioned above.",

Although deep learning\nmethods have demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in wire segmentation,\nthey require substantial annotated datasets for generalizability, underscoring\nthe need for extensive labeled data to enhance model performance. To address\nthis challenge, we propose the Segmentation-guided Frame-consistency Video\nDiffusion Model (SF-VD) to generate large collections of labeled fluoroscopy\nvideos, augmenting the training data for wire segmentation networks. SF-VD\nleverages videos with limited annotations by independently modeling scene\ndistribution and motion distribution. It first samples the scene distribution\nby generating 2D fluoroscopy images with wires positioned according to a\nspecified input mask, and then samples the motion distribution by progressively\ngenerating subsequent frames, ensuring frame-to-frame coherence through a\nframe-consistency strategy. A segmentation-guided mechanism further refines the\nprocess by adjusting wire contrast, ensuring a diverse range of visibility in\nthe synthesized image. Evaluation on a fluoroscopy dataset confirms the\nsuperior quality of the generated videos and shows significant improvements in\nguidewire segmentation.",

    "abstract": "A generalization of Wilson line operators at subleading power in the soft\nexpansion has been recently introduced as an efficient building block of\ngravitational scattering amplitudes for non-spinning objects. The classical\nlimit in this picture corresponds to the strict Regge limit, where the\nPost-Minkowskian (PM) expansion corresponds to the soft expansion, interpreted\nas a sum over correlations of soft emissions. Building on the well-studied\nworldline model with ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry, in this work we extend the\ngeneralized Wilson line (GWL) approach to the case of spinning gravitating\nbodies. Specifically, at the quantum level we derive from first-principles a\nrepresentation for the spin $1/2$ GWL that is relevant for the all-order\nfactorization of next-to-soft gravitons with fermionic matter, thus\ngeneralizing the exponentiation of single-emission next-to-soft theorems. At\nthe classical level, we identity the suitable generalization of Wilson line\noperators that enables the generation of classical spin observables at linear\norder in spin. Thanks to the crucial role played by the soft expansion, the map\nfrom Grassmann variables to classical spin is manifest. We also comment on the\nrelation between the GWL approach and the Worldline Quantum Field Theory as\nwell as the Heavy Mass Effective Theory formalism. We validate the approach by\nrederiving known results in the conservative sector at 2PM order.",

    "abstract": "The fact that the standard dispersion relation for photons in vacuum could be\nmodified because of their interaction with the quantum nature of spacetime has\nbeen proposed more than two decades ago. A quantitative model [Jacob \\& Piran,\nJCAP 01, 031 (2008)], has been tested extensively using distant highly\nenergetic astrophysical sources, searching for energy-dependent time delays in\nphoton arrival times. Since no delay was firmly measured, lower limits were set\non the energy scale $\\Lambda$ related to these effects. In recent years,\nhowever, different but equally well-grounded expressions beyond the Jacob \\&\nPiran model were obtained for the photon dispersion relation, leading to\ndifferent expressions for the dependence of lag versus redshift. This article\nintroduces a general parameterization of modified dispersion relations in\ncosmological symmetry, which directly leads to a general parameterized lag\nversus redshift dependence encompassing both existing and new models. This\nparameterization could be used in the future to compare the predicted time lags\nof the different models and test them against observations. To investigate this\npossibility, realistic data sets are simulated, mimicking different types of\nextragalactic sources as detected by current and future instruments. When no\nlag is injected in the simulated data, each lag-redshift model leads, as\nexpected, to a different value for the limit on $\\Lambda$, and the Jacob \\&\nPiran model gives the most stringent bound. When a lag at $\\Lambda \\sim E_P$ in\nthe Jacob \\& Piran model is injected, it is detected for all the other\nlag-redshift relations considered, although leading to different values.\nFinally, the possibility to discriminate between several lag-redshift models is\ninvestigated, emphasizing the importance of an evenly distributed sample of\nsources across a wide range of redshifts.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in\ntext-to-image tasks, leading to their widespread use. With the introduction of\nclassifier-free guidance (CFG), the quality of images generated by DMs is\nsignificantly improved. However, one can use DMs to generate more harmful\nimages by maliciously guiding the image generation process through CFG.\nExisting safe alignment methods aim to mitigate the risk of generating harmful\nimages but often reduce the quality of clean image generation. To address this\nissue, we propose SafeCFG to adaptively control harmful features with dynamic\nsafe guidance by modulating the CFG generation process. It dynamically guides\nthe CFG generation process based on the harmfulness of the prompts, inducing\nsignificant deviations only in harmful CFG generations, achieving high quality\nand safety generation. SafeCFG can simultaneously modulate different harmful\nCFG generation processes, so it could eliminate harmful elements while\npreserving high-quality generation. Additionally, SafeCFG provides the ability\nto detect image harmfulness, allowing unsupervised safe alignment on DMs\nwithout pre-defined clean or harmful labels. Experimental results show that\nimages generated by SafeCFG achieve both high quality and safety, and safe DMs\ntrained in our unsupervised manner also exhibit good safety performance.",

    "abstract": "Concerns associated with occupational health and safety (OHS) remain critical\nand often under-addressed aspects of workforce management. This is especially\ntrue for high-risk industries such as manufacturing, construction, and mining.\nSuch industries dominate the economy of India which is a developing country\nwith a vast informal sector. Regulatory frameworks have been strengthened over\nthe decades, particularly with regards to bringing the unorganized sector\nwithin the purview of law. Traditional approaches to OHS have largely been\nreactive and rely on post-incident analysis (which is curative) rather than\npreventive intervention. This paper portrays the immense potential of\npredictive analytics in rejuvenating OHS practices in India. Intelligent\npredictive analytics is driven by approaches like machine learning and\nstatistical modeling. Its data-driven nature serves to overcome the limitations\nof conventional OHS methods. Predictive analytics approaches to OHS in India\ndraw on global case studies and generative applications of predictive analytics\nin OHS which are customized to Indian industrial contexts. This paper attempts\nto explore in what ways it exhibits the potential to address challenges such as\nfragmented data ecosystems, resource constraints, and the variability of\nworkplace hazards. The paper presents actionable policy recommendations to\ncreate conditions conducive to the widespread implementation of predictive\nanalytics, which must be advocated as a cornerstone of OHS strategy.

Our spectropolarimetric analysis indicates that\nboth a blackbody (BB) plus double power-law (PL) and a double blackbody plus\npower-law spectral model fit the phase-averaged intensity data well, with a\nhard PL tail ($\\Gamma$=1.19 and 1.35, respectively) dominating above $\\approx\n5$ keV. For the former model, we find the soft PL (the dominant component at\nsoft energies) exhibits a polarization degree (PD) of $\\approx 30\\%$ while the\nhard PL displays a PD of $\\approx 40\\%$. Similarly, the cool BB of the 2BB+PL\nmodel possesses a PD of $\\approx 15\\%$ and a hard PL PD of $\\approx 57\\%$. For\nboth models, each component has a polarization angle (PA) compatible with\ncelestial north. Model-independent polarization analysis supports these\nresults, wherein the PD increases from$ \\approx 15\\%$ to $\\approx 70\\%$ in the\n2-3 keV and 6-8 keV ranges, respectively, while the PA remains nearly constant.\nWe find marginal evidence for phase-dependent variability of the polarization\nproperties, namely a higher PD at phases coinciding with the hard X-ray pulse\npeak. We compare the hard X-ray PL to the expectation from resonant inverse\nCompton scattering (RICS) and secondary pair cascade synchrotron radiation from\nprimary high-energy RICS photons; both present reasonable spectropolarimetric\nagreement with the data, albeit, the latter more naturally. We suggest that the\nsoft PL X-ray component may originate from a Comptonized corona in the inner\nmagnetosphere.",

We find that for a large prior\nuncertainty, the optimal probe states are close to coherent states, a result in\nline with findings from noisy parameter estimation.

    "abstract": "Morphogenesis, the process of growth and shape formation in biological\ntissues, is driven by complex interactions between mechanical, biochemical, and\ngenetic factors. Traditional models of biological growth often rely on the\nconcept of homeostatic Eshelby stress, which defines an ideal target state for\nthe growing body. Any local deviation from this state triggers growth and\nremodelling, aimed at restoring balance between mechanical forces and\nbiological adaptation. Despite its relevance in the biomechanical context, the\nnature of homeostatic stress remains elusive, with its value and spatial\ndistribution often chosen arbitrarily, lacking a clear biological\ninterpretation or understanding of its connection to the lower scales of the\ntissue. To bring clarity on the nature of homeostatic stress, we shift the\nfocus from Eshelby stress to growth incompatibility, a measure of geometric\nfrustration in the tissue that is the primary source of residual stresses in\nthe developing body. Incompatibility, measured by the Ricci tensor of the\ngrowth metric at the continuous level, can be potentially regulated at the cell\nlevel through connections with the surrounding cells, making it a more\nmeaningful concept than homeostatic stress. In this geometric perspective,\nachieving a homeostatic state corresponds to the establishment of a\nphysiological level of frustration in the body, a process leading to the\ngeneration and maintenance of the mechanical stresses that are crucial to\ntissue functionality. In this work we present a formulation of biological\ngrowth that penalises deviations from a desired state of incompatibility,\nsimilar to the way the Einstein-Hilbert action operates in General Relativity.\nThe proposed framework offers a clear and physically grounded approach that\nelucidates the regulation of size and shape, while providing a means to link\ncellular and tissue scales in biological systems.",

This design enables multiple devices to transmit thier\npilots concurrently while remaining orthogonal in frequency, achieving\nsimultaneous alignment of multiple devices. Furthermore, we present a\nsequential partitioning strategy into transmitters and receivers that results\nin logarithmic scaling of the overhead with the number of devices, as opposed\nto the conventional linear scaling. Finally, we show via accurate modeling of\nthe indoor propagation environment and ray tracing simulations that the\nresulting sub-THz channels after successful beamforming are approximately\nfrequency flat, therefore suitable for efficient single carrier transmission\nwithout equalization.

When\ndriving a system far from equilibrium, novel, otherwise inaccessible quantum\nstates of matter may arise.

The\nsolutions available today for spoofing detection either rely on additional\ncommunication systems, receivers, and antennas, or require mobile deployments.\nDetection systems working at the Physical (PHY) layer of the satellite\ncommunication link also require time-consuming and energy-hungry training\nprocesses on all satellites of the constellation, and rely on the availability\nof spoofed data, which are often challenging to collect. Moreover, none of such\ncontributions investigate the feasibility of aerial spoofing attacks launched\nvia drones operating at various altitudes. In this paper, we propose a new\nspoofing detection technique for LEO satellite constellation systems, applying\nanomaly detection on the received PHY signal via autoencoders. We validate our\nsolution through an extensive measurement campaign involving the deployment of\nan actual spoofer (Software-Defined Radio) installed on a drone and injecting\nrogue IRIDIUM messages while flying at different altitudes with various\nmovement patterns.

The cRKDG method was recently introduced in\n[Q. Chen, Z. Sun, and Y. Xing, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 46: A1327--A1351, 2024].\nIt enhances the compactness of the standard RKDG method, resulting in reduced\ndata communication, simplified boundary treatments, and improved suitability\nfor local time marching. This work improves the robustness of the cRKDG method\nby enforcing desirable physical bounds while preserving its compactness, local\nconservation, and high-order accuracy. Our method is extended from the seminal\nwork of [X. Zhang and C.-W. Shu, J. Comput. Phys., 229: 3091--3120, 2010]. We\nprove that the cell average of the cRKDG method at each RK stage preserves the\nphysical bounds by expressing it as a convex combination of three types of\nforward-Euler solutions. A scaling limiter is then applied after each RK stage\nto enforce pointwise bounds. Additionally, we explore RK methods with less\nrestrictive time step sizes. Because the cRKDG method does not rely on\nstrong-stability-preserving RK time discretization, it avoids its order\nbarriers, allowing us to construct a four-stage, fourth-order bound-preserving\ncRKDG method.

To fill this gap, we\ncrowdsource subjective annotations of emotion categories in a German argument\ncorpus and evaluate automatic LLM-based labeling methods. Specifically, we\ncompare three prompting strategies (zero-shot, one-shot, chain-of-thought) on\nthree large instruction-tuned language models (Falcon-7b-instruct,\nLlama-3.1-8B-instruct, GPT-4o-mini).

We find that emotion\ncategories enhance the prediction of emotionality in arguments, emphasizing the\nneed for discrete emotion annotations in arguments.

The goal is to motivate OW detectors to simultaneously preserve\nlearned classes, adapt to new classes, and maintain open-world capabilities\nunder few-shot adaptations. To mitigate forgetting in unseen categories, we\npropose MR-GDINO, a strong, efficient and scalable baseline via memory and\nretrieval mechanisms within a highly scalable memory pool. Experimental results\nshow that existing continual detectors suffer from severe forgetting for both\nseen and unseen categories. In contrast, MR-GDINO largely mitigates forgetting\nwith only 0.1% activated extra parameters, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance for old, new, and unseen categories.",

In this paper, we use a\nQLSA to solve the linear systems arising in each iteration of the DLBM.

Probes are placed\nonly around the surface of the cylinder, and a Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO) agent controls nine zero-net mass flux jets on the downstream side of the\ncylinder. The trained PPO agent effectively reduces drag by $29\\%$ and\ndecreases lift oscillations by $18\\%$ of amplitude, with the control effect\ndemonstrating good repeatability. Control tests of this agent within the\nReynolds number range of $Re=260000$ to $288000$ show the agent's control\nstrategy possesses a certain degree of robustness, with very similar drag\nreduction effects under different Reynolds numbers. Analysis using power\nspectral energy reveals that the agent learns specific flow frequencies in the\nflow field and effectively suppresses low-frequency, large-scale structures.\nGraphically visualizing the policy, combined with pressure, vorticity, and\nturbulent kinetic energy contours, reveals the mechanism by which jets achieve\ndrag reduction by influencing reattachment vortices.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a promising\ntechnology for future wireless communication systems due to their ability to\ncontrol the propagation environment in a hardware- and energy-efficient way.\nRecently, the concept of RISs has been extended to beyond diagonal RISs\n(BD-RISs), which unlock the full potential of RISs thanks to the presence of\ntunable interconnections between RIS elements. While various algorithms have\nbeen proposed for specific BD-RIS architectures, a universal optimization\nframework applicable to arbitrary architectures is still lacking. In this\npaper, we bridge this research gap by proposing an architecture-independent\nframework for BD-RIS optimization, with the main focus on sum-rate maximization\nand transmit power minimization in multiuser multi-input single-output\n(MU-MISO) systems. Specifically, we first incorporate BD-RIS architectures into\nthe models by connecting the scattering matrix with the admittance matrix and\nintroducing appropriate constraints to the admittance matrix. The formulated\nproblems are then solved by our custom-designed partially proximal alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (pp-ADMM) algorithms. The pp-ADMM algorithms\nare computationally efficient, with each subproblem either admitting a\nclosed-form solution or being easily solvable. We further explore the extension\nof the proposed framework to general utility functions and multiuser\nmulti-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Simulation results demonstrate that\nthe proposed approaches achieve a better trade-off between performance and\ncomputational efficiency compared to existing methods. We also compare the\nperformance of various BD-RIS architectures in MU-MISO systems using the\nproposed approach, which has not been explored before due to the lack of an\narchitecture-independent framework.",

Potentially, these results are of high\nrelevance for technology as they could lay the foundation for a many-body\ndescription of various nanostructures. For this to happen, we need expressions\nfor local (i.e., spatially resolved) correlations as a function of frequency.\nIn this study, we find such expressions and study their outcome. Based on our\nanalytic expressions we are able to identify two distinct cases of TLL which we\ncall Coulomb metal and Hund metal, respectively. We argue that these two cases\nspan all the situations possible in nanotubes made out of p-block elements.\nFrom an applications viewpoint, it is crucial to capture the fact that the end\nof the 1D system can be coupled with the external environment and emit\nelectrons into it. We discuss such coupling on two levels for both Coulomb and\nHund metals: i) in the zeroth order approximation, the coupling modifies the 1D\nsystem's boundary conditions; ii) stronger coupling, when the environment can\nself-consistently modify the 1D system, we introduce spatially dependent TLL\nparameters.

    "abstract": "Two similar-looking, two-part interplanetary type II burst events from 2003\nand 2012 are reported and analysed. The 2012 event was observed from three\ndifferent viewing angles, enabling comparisons between the spacecraft data. In\nthese two events, a diffuse wide-band type II radio burst was followed by a\ntype II burst that showed emission at the fundamental and harmonic (F-H) plasma\nfrequencies, and these emission bands were also slightly curved in their\nfrequency-time evolution. Both events were associated with high-speed,\nhalo-type coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In both events, the diffuse type II\nburst was most probably created by a bow shock at the leading front of the CME.\nHowever, for the later-appearing F-H type II burst there are at least two\npossible explanations. In the 2003 event there is evidence of CME interaction\nwith a streamer, with a possible shift from a bow shock to a CME flank shock.\nIn the 2012 event a separate white-light shock front was observed at lower\nheights, and it could have acted as the driver of the F-H type II burst. There\nis also some speculation on the existence of two separate CMEs, launched from\nthe same active region, close in time. The reason for the diffuse type II burst\nbeing visible only from one viewing direction (STEREO-A), and the ending of the\ndiffuse emission before the F-H type II burst appears, still need explanations.",

The effective metric is constrained by imposing\nthe black hole symmetries and asymptotic classical behavior. The deformed\nmetric is parametrized in terms of a physical quantity that we choose to be a\nphysical distance. The latter can be solved for in three main regions of\ninterest, the one around the horizon, origin, and spatial infinity. The\nfiniteness of physical quantities at the horizon, such as the Ricci and\nKretschmann scalars, leads to universal constraints on the physical parameters\nof the metric around the horizon. This allows us to further derive the general\nform of the corrected Hawking temperature in terms of the physical parameters\nof the effective metric. Assuming that the approach can be generalized to the\ninterior of the black hole, we further develop an effective metric description\nnear the origin.

We\nconducted a time-resolved analysis by dividing the data into several intervals\nfor each observation. This analysis reveals a continuous rotation of the\nphase-averaged polarization angle (PA) across the observations performed during\nthe super-critical and sub-critical regimes. To investigate the origin of the\nPA rotation, we performed a pulse phase-resolved polarimetric analysis over\nfour time intervals, each spanning approximately three days. Applying the\nrotating vector model (RVM), the geometric parameters of the system were\ndetermined for each interval. Despite the short time gap of just $\\sim$ 20\ndays, we observed significant variation in the RVM parameters between the first\ninterval and the subsequent three, indicating the presence of an additional\npolarized component alongside the RVM component. Using a two-polarized\ncomponent model with the assumption that this additional component remains\nconstant across pulse phases, we calculated the phase-averaged PA and polarized\nflux of both the variable and constant components. The phase-averaged PA of\neach component remained relatively stable over time, but the polarized flux of\nthe constant component decreased, while that of the variable component\nincreased. The observed rotation of the PA is attributed to the gradual shift\nin the polarized flux ratio between the two components and is not directly\nrelated to the different accretion regimes.",

The study focuses on the effect of\nthe annealing temperature (up to 600{\\deg}C) on the oxidation process, oxygen\nsaturation, structure evolution, and their subsequent impact on electrical,\noptical and mechanical properties. The findings reveal that controlled\noxidation transforms W-Zr TFMGs into amorphous ceramic W-Zr-O films with\nsubstoichiometric compositions. This is a consequence of an oxidation process\nthat does not proceed through the formation of a stoichiometric oxide layer on\nthe surface of W-Zr TFMGs, acting as a diffusion barrier against fast\noxidation, but leads to a gradual incorporation of oxygen across the film\nvolume due to thermodynamics factors. Higher Zr content accelerates the oxygen\nincorporation and its depth uniformity in the films. As a result, the\nmechanical properties are significantly enhanced achieving hardness values of\nup to 17.5 GPa at approximately 50% oxygen saturation. Simultaneously, the\nelectrical and optical properties are finely tuned with the resistivity and the\nextinction coefficient (measured at 550 nm) ranging from 1.7 to 95.7x10-4\nOhm.cm and 0.28 to 1.06, respectively.",

When the\ntest body pulsates periodically (such as a variable star), altering its\nquadrupole tensor, Melnikov's method shows that its orbital dynamics presents\nhomoclinic chaos near the corresponding unstable circular orbits however small\nthe oscillation amplitude is. Since for supermassive black holes the period of\nrevolution of a star near the innermost stable circular orbit roughly spans\ntime intervals from minutes to hours, the formalism can be applied in principle\nto the astrophysical scenario of a pulsating (variable) star inspiraling into a\nsupermassive black hole, including the black hole SgrA* at the center of our\nGalaxy. The chaotic nature of its orbit, due to pulsation, is imprinted in the\nredshift time series of the emitted light and can, in principle, be observed in\nthe corresponding light curves and even in gravitational-wave signals detected\nby future observatories such as the Laser Inteferometer Space Antenna. Also,\nalthough periodic with respect to the star's proper time, the chaotic orbital\nmotion will produce an erratic light curve (and gravitational-wave signal) in\nterms of observed, coordinate time. Although our results were obtained for a\nspecific exact solution, we argue that this phenomenon is generic for pulsating\nbodies immersed in black hole spacetimes surrounded by self-gravitating fluids.",

The program can be used to discover and\ncharacterize mixing in the neutron, antineutron and sterile neutron sectors.\nThe experiment addresses topical open questions such as the origins of\nbaryogenesis and the nature of dark matter, and is sensitive to scales of new\nphysics substantially in excess of those available at colliders.

    "abstract": "Greybox fuzzing is one of the most popular methods for detecting software\nvulnerabilities, which conducts a biased random search within the program input\nspace. To enhance its effectiveness in achieving deep coverage of program\nbehaviors, greybox fuzzing is often combined with concolic execution, which\nperforms a path-sensitive search over the domain of program inputs. In hybrid\nfuzzing, conventional greybox fuzzing is followed by concolic execution in an\niterative loop, where reachability roadblocks encountered by greybox fuzzing\nare tackled by concolic execution. However, such hybrid fuzzing still suffers\nfrom difficulties conventionally faced by symbolic execution, such as the need\nfor environment modeling and system call support. In this work, we show how to\nachieve the effect of concolic execution without having to compute and solve\nsymbolic path constraints. When coverage-based greybox fuzzing reaches a\nroadblock in terms of reaching certain branches, we conduct a slicing on the\nexecution trace and suggest modifications of the input to reach the relevant\nbranches. A Large Language Model (LLM) is used as a solver to generate the\nmodified input for reaching the desired branches. Compared with both the\nvanilla greybox fuzzer AFL and hybrid fuzzers Intriguer and Qsym, our LLM-based\nhybrid fuzzer HyLLfuzz (pronounced \"hill fuzz\") demonstrates superior coverage.\nFurthermore, the LLM-based concolic execution in HyLLfuzz takes a time that is\n4-19 times faster than the concolic execution running in existing hybrid\nfuzzing tools. This experience shows that LLMs can be effectively inserted into\nthe iterative loop of hybrid fuzzers, to efficiently expose more program\nbehaviors.",

    "abstract": "Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) discovery of the prevalence of switchbacks (SBs),\nlocalised magnetic deflections in the nascent solar wind, has sparked interest\nin uncovering their origins. A prominent theory suggests these SBs originate in\nthe lower corona through magnetic reconnection processes, closely linked to\nsolar jet phenomena. Jets are impulsive events, observed across scales and\nsolar atmosphere layers, associated with the release of magnetic twist and\nhelicity. This study examines whether self-consistent jets can form and\npropagate into the super-Alfv\\'enic wind, assesses the impact of distinct\nParker solar wind profiles on jet dynamics, and determines if jet-induced\nmagnetic untwisting waves display signatures typical of SBs. We employed\nparametric 3D numerical MHD simulations using the ARMS code to model the\nself-consistent generation of solar jets. Our study focuses on the propagation\nof solar jets in distinct atmospheric plasma $\\beta$ and Alfv\\'en velocity\nprofiles, including a Parker solar wind. Our findings show that self-consistent\ncoronal jets can form and propagate into the super-Alfv\\'enic wind. Notable\nstructures such as the leading Alfv\\'enic wave and trailing dense-jet region\nwere consistently observed across diverse plasma $\\beta$ atmospheres. The jet\npropagation dynamics are significantly influenced by atmospheric variations,\nwith changes in Alfv\\'en velocity profiles affecting the group velocity and\npropagation ratio of the leading and trailing structures. U-loops, prevalent at\njet onset, do not persist in the low-$\\beta$ corona, but magnetic untwisting\nwaves associated with jets show SB-like signatures. However, full-reversal SBs\nwere not observed. These findings may explain the absence of full reversal SBs\nin the sub-Alfv\\'enic wind and illustrate the propagation of magnetic\ndeflections through jet-like events, shedding light on possible SB formation\nprocesses.",

In contrast, fairness-aware Data Preparation practices are both\nfamiliar to practitioners and easier to implement, providing a more accessible\napproach to reducing bias. Objective. This registered report proposes an\nempirical evaluation of how optimally selected fairness-aware practices,\napplied in early ML lifecycle stages, can enhance both fairness and\nperformance, potentially outperforming standard pre-processing bias mitigation\nmethods. Method. To this end, we will introduce FATE, an optimization technique\nfor selecting 'Data Preparation' pipelines that optimize fairness and\nperformance. Using FATE, we will analyze the fairness-performance trade-off,\ncomparing pipelines selected by FATE with results by pre-processing bias\nmitigation techniques.",

Objective: To develop a comprehensive Japanese CT\nreport dataset through machine translation and establish a specialized language\nmodel for structured finding classification. Additionally, to create a\nrigorously validated evaluation dataset through expert radiologist review.\nMethods: We translated the CT-RATE dataset (24,283 CT reports from 21,304\npatients) into Japanese using GPT-4o mini. The training dataset consisted of\n22,778 machine-translated reports, while the validation dataset included 150\nradiologist-revised reports.

These insights provide a nuanced\nunderstanding of the core elements that drive effective step-level reward\nmodeling in mathematical reasoning. By shedding light on these mechanisms, this\nstudy offers valuable guidance for developing more efficient and streamlined\nSRMs, which can be achieved by focusing on the crucial parts of mathematical\nreasoning.",

This allows the prediction of outcome data at the\nconclusion of the trial. The PPoS is obtained by numerically averaging the\nprobability of success evaluated at fixed parameter values over the posterior\ndistribution of the parameters.

We deform here rotor-stator flow into an annular\nflow, thereby controlling curvature effects, and we investigate numerically the\ntransition scenarios as functions of the Reynolds number. Increasing curvature\nstarting from the planar limit reveals a clear path towards a subcritical\nscenario as a function of the Reynolds number. As the rotor-stator\nconfiguration is approached, supercritical branches shift to increasing\nReynolds number while a subcritical branch of chaotic states takes over. Modal\nselection in the supercritical scenario involves the competition between two\nmodal families. It rests on a specific radial localisation property of all\neigenmodes, linked to the space-dependent convective radial velocity which\nintensifies as curvature is increased. A new nonlinear mechanism for the\npairing of rolls is proposed based on multiple resonances.

    "abstract": "When numerically simulating the unitary time evolution of an\ninfinite-dimensional quantum system, one is usually led to treat the\nHamiltonian $H$ as an \"infinite-dimensional matrix\" by expressing it in some\northonormal basis of the Hilbert space, and then truncate it to some finite\ndimensions. However, the solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equations generated by\nthe truncated Hamiltonians need not converge, in general, to the solution of\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation corresponding to the actual Hamiltonian.\n  In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, they converge to\nthe solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation generated by a specific Hamiltonian\nwhich crucially depends on the particular choice of basis: the Friedrichs\nextension of the restriction of $H$ to the space of finite linear combinations\nof elements of the basis. Importantly, this is generally different from $H$\nitself; in all such cases, numerical simulations will unavoidably reproduce the\nwrong dynamics in the limit, and yet there is no numerical test that can reveal\nthis failure, unless one has the analytical solution to compare with.\n  As a practical demonstration of such results, we consider the quantum\nparticle in the box, and we show that, for a wide class of bases (which include\nassociated Legendre polynomials as a concrete example) the dynamics generated\nby the truncated Hamiltonians will always converge to the one corresponding to\nthe particle with Dirichlet boundary conditions, regardless the initial choice\nof boundary conditions. Other such examples are discussed.",

In order for the\necosystem, modeled as a content ranking game, to be effective and maximize user\nwelfare, it should guarantee stability, where stability is associated with the\nexistence of pure Nash equilibrium in the corresponding game. Moreover, if the\ncontents' ranking algorithm possesses a game in which any best-response\nlearning dynamics of the content creators converge to equilibrium of high\nwelfare, the system is considered highly attractive. However, as classical\ncontent ranking algorithms, employed by search and recommendation systems, rank\ndocuments by their distance to information needs, it has been shown that they\nfail to provide such stability properties. As a result, novel content ranking\nalgorithms have been devised. In this work, we offer an alternative approach:\ncorpus enrichment with a small set of fixed dummy documents. It turns out that,\nwith the right design, such enrichment can lead to pure Nash equilibrium and\neven to the convergence of any best-response dynamics to a high welfare result,\nwhere we still employ the classical/current content ranking approach.

Therefore, we\nconsider state abstraction, which reduces the number of states by treating\nmultiple different states as a single state. There is a substantial body of\nresearch on finding optimal policies for Markov decision processes using state\nabstraction. However, in the multi-player setting, the game with state\nabstraction may yield different equilibrium solutions from those of the ground\ngame. To evaluate the equilibrium solutions of the game with state abstraction,\nwe derived bounds on the duality gap, which represents the distance from the\nequilibrium solutions of the ground game.

Inspired by a U-Net-like autoencoder architecture, we utilize\nunsupervised PPG signal reconstruction, taking advantage of large amounts of\nunlabeled data during the pre-training phase combined with data augmentation,\nto improve state-of-the-art models' performance. Thanks to our approach and\nminimal modification to the state-of-the-art model, we improve the best HR\nestimation by 12.2%, lowering from 4.03 Beats-Per-Minute (BPM) to 3.54 BPM the\nerror on PPG-DaLiA. Importantly, our EnhancePPG approach focuses exclusively on\nthe training of the selected deep learning model, without significantly\nincreasing its inference latency",

Traditional BO assumes that the\nlearner has full control over all query variables without additional\nconstraints. However, in many real-world scenarios, controlling certain query\nvariables may incur costs. Therefore, the learner needs to balance the\nselection of informative subsets for targeted learning against leaving some\nvariables to be randomly sampled to minimize costs. This problem is known as\nBayesian Optimization with cost-varying variable subsets (BOCVS). While the\ngoal of BOCVS is to identify the optimal solution with minimal cost, previous\nworks have only guaranteed finding the optimal solution without considering the\ntotal costs incurred. Moreover, these works assume precise knowledge of the\ncost for each subset, which is often unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel algorithm for the extension of the BOCVS problem with random and unknown\ncosts that separates the process into exploration and exploitation phases. The\nexploration phase will filter out low-quality variable subsets, while the\nexploitation phase will leverage high-quality ones. Furthermore, we\ntheoretically demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a sub-linear rate in both\nquality regret and cost regret, addressing the objective of the BOCVS problem\nmore effectively than previous analyses.

We develop modeling techniques to characterize the ionized\ngas properties in the subset of 2052 star-forming galaxies from the\nvolume-limited, dwarf-dominated, z~0 ECO catalog. The MULTIGRIS statistical\nframework is used to evaluate the performance of various models using strong\nlines as constraints. The reference model involves physical parameters\ndistributed as power-laws with free parameter boundaries. Specifically, we use\ncombinations of 1D photoionization models (i.e., considering the propagation of\nradiation toward a single cloud) to match optical HII region lines, in order to\nprovide probability density functions of the inferred parameters. The inference\npredicts non-uniform physical conditions within galaxies. The integrated\nspectra of most galaxies are dominated by relatively low-excitation gas with a\nmetallicity around 0.3 solar. Using the average metallicity in galaxies, we\nprovide a new fit to the mass-metallicity relationship which is in line with\ndirect abundance method determinations from the calibrated range at low\nmetallicity to stacks at high metallicity. The average metallicity shows a\nweakly bimodal distribution which may be due related to external (e.g.,\nrefueling of non-cluster early-type galaxies above ~10^9.5 solar masses) or\ninternal processes (more efficient star-formation in metal-rich regions). The\nspecific line set used for inference affects the results and we identify\npotential issues with the use of the [SII] line doublet. Complex modelling\napproaches are limited by the inherent 1D model database as well as caveats\nregarding the gas geometry. Our results highlight, however, the possibility to\nextract useful and significant information from integrated spectra.",

For the\nGinibre ensemble this statement about the entropy was known for radial\nsymmetric sets $A$, and we prove it in generality for subsets $A$ of the bulk,\nthus establishing a holographic principle. Moreover, for generic random normal\nmatrix ensembles depending on some potential $V$, not necessarily exhibiting\nradial symmetry, we show that for large matrix size $n$ the number variance is\nproportional to the circumference of $A$, $\\sim\\sqrt{n}|\\partial A|$.

The Galactic ASKAP collaboration (GASKAP) is undertaking an HI\nemission survey of the 21cm line to map the Magellanic system and the Galactic\nplane with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). One of the\nfirst areas observed in the Pilot Phase I of the survey was the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC). Previous surveys of the SMC have uncovered new\nstructures in the periphery of the SMC, along relatively low column density\nlines of sight. Aims. In this work we aimed to uncover the phase distribution\nof three distinct structures in the periphery of the SMC. This work will add to\nthe constraints we have on the existence and survival of the cold neutral\nmedium (CNM) in the SMC. Methods. We used ROHSA, a Gaussian decomposition\nalgorithm, to model the emission across each cloud and classify the HI emission\ninto their respective phases based on the linewidths of the fitted Gaussians.\nWe created maps of velocity and column density of each phase of the HI across\nthese three clouds. We measured the HI mass and CNM number density for each\ncloud. We also compared the HI results across the different phases with other\ngas tracers. Results. We find that in two clouds, the ends of each cloud are\nalmost completely CNM dominated. Analysis of these two clouds indicates they\nare experiencing a compressive force from the direction of the SMC main body.\nIn the third cloud we find a uniform CNM distribution along one wall of what is\nlikely a supershell structure. Comparison with previous measurements of CO\nclumps in two of the clouds show the CO and HI are co-moving within a few km/s\nin regions of high HI column density, particularly when considering just the\nCNM.",

The large-scale CMB generated from the\nreionization epoch is important in probing the PGWs from all-sky experiments,\nsuch as LiteBIRD. The reionization model has been constrained by several\nastrophysical observations. However, its uncertainty could impact constraining\nmodels of the PGWs if we use large-scale CMB polarization. Here, by expanding\nthe analysis of Mortonson & Hu (2007), we estimate how reionization uncertainty\nimpacts constraints on a generic primordial tensor power spectrum. We assume\nthat CMB polarization is measured by a LiteBIRD-like experiment and the tanh\nmodel is adopted for a theoretical template when we fit data. We show that\nconstraints are almost unchanged even if the true reionization history is\ndescribed by an exponential model, where all parameters are within 68%\nConfidence Level (CL). We also show an example of the reionization history that\nthe constraints on the PGWs are biased more than 68% CL. Even in that case,\nusing E-mode power spectrum on large scales would exclude such a scenario and\nmake the PGW constraints robust against the reionization uncertainties.",

Local optima networks (LONs) have\nbeen especially dominant in the literature and capture an approximation of\nlocal optima and their connectivity in the landscape. However, thus far, LONs\nhave been constructed according to a strict definition of what a local optimum\nis: the result of local search. Many evolutionary approaches do not include\nthis, however. Popular algorithms such as CMA-ES have therefore never been\nsubject to LON analysis. Search trajectory networks (STNs) offer a possible\nalternative: nodes can be any search space location. However, STNs are not\ntypically modelled in such a way that models temporal stalls: that is, a region\nin the search space where an algorithm fails to find a better solution over a\ndefined period of time. In this work, we approach this by systematically\nanalysing a special case of STN which we name attractor networks. These offer a\ncoarse-grained view of algorithm behaviour with a singular focus on stall\nlocations. We construct attractor networks for CMA-ES, differential evolution,\nand random search for 24 noiseless black-box optimisation benchmark problems.\nThe properties of attractor networks are systematically explored. They are also\nvisualised and compared to traditional LONs and STN models.

    "abstract": "Current full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) methods often fuse\nfeatures from reference and distorted images, overlooking that color and\nluminance distortions occur mainly at low frequencies, whereas edge and texture\ndistortions occur at high frequencies. This work introduces a pioneering\ntraining-free FR-IQA method that accurately predicts image quality in alignment\nwith the human visual system (HVS) by leveraging a novel perceptual degradation\nmodelling approach to address this limitation. First, a collaborative feature\nrefinement module employs a carefully designed wavelet transform to extract\nperceptually relevant features, capturing multiscale perceptual information and\nmimicking how the HVS analyses visual information at various scales and\norientations in the spatial and frequency domains. Second, a Hausdorff\ndistance-based distribution similarity measurement module robustly assesses the\ndiscrepancy between the feature distributions of the reference and distorted\nimages, effectively handling outliers and variations while mimicking the\nability of HVS to perceive and tolerate certain levels of distortion. The\nproposed method accurately captures perceptual quality differences without\nrequiring training data or subjective quality scores. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with\nexisting state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its ability to correlate\nstrongly with the HVS.\\footnote{The code is available at\n\\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CVPR2025-F339}.}",

    "abstract": "Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a common paradigm for network\nquantization, in which the training phase incorporates the simulation of the\nlow-precision computation to optimize the quantization parameters in alignment\nwith the task goals. However, direct training of low-precision networks\ngenerally faces two obstacles: 1. The low-precision model exhibits limited\nrepresentation capabilities and cannot directly replicate full-precision\ncalculations, which constitutes a deficiency compared to full-precision\nalternatives; 2. Non-ideal deviations during gradient propagation are a common\nconsequence of employing pseudo-gradients as approximations in derived\nquantized functions. In this paper, we propose a general QAT framework for\nalleviating the aforementioned concerns by permitting the forward and backward\nprocesses of the low-precision network to be guided by the full-precision\npartner during training. In conjunction with the direct training of the\nquantization model, intermediate mixed-precision models are generated through\nthe block-by-block replacement on the full-precision model and working\nsimultaneously with the low-precision backbone, which enables the integration\nof quantized low-precision blocks into full-precision networks throughout the\ntraining phase. Consequently, each quantized block is capable of: 1. simulating\nfull-precision representation during forward passes; 2. obtaining gradients\nwith improved estimation during backward passes. We demonstrate that the\nproposed method achieves state-of-the-art results for 4-, 3-, and 2-bit\nquantization on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. The proposed framework provides a\ncompatible extension for most QAT methods and only requires a concise wrapper\nfor existing codes.",

    "abstract": "Recent efforts on image restoration have focused on developing \"all-in-one\"\nmodels that can handle different degradation types and levels within single\nmodel. However, most of mainstream Transformer-based ones confronted with\ndilemma between model capabilities and computation burdens, since\nself-attention mechanism quadratically increase in computational complexity\nwith respect to image size, and has inadequacies in capturing long-range\ndependencies. Most of Mamba-related ones solely scanned feature map in spatial\ndimension for global modeling, failing to fully utilize information in channel\ndimension. To address aforementioned problems, this paper has proposed to fully\nutilize complementary advantages from Mamba and Transformer without sacrificing\ncomputation efficiency. Specifically, the selective scanning mechanism of Mamba\nis employed to focus on spatial modeling, enabling capture long-range spatial\ndependencies under linear complexity. The self-attention mechanism of\nTransformer is applied to focus on channel modeling, avoiding high computation\nburdens that are in quadratic growth with image's spatial dimensions. Moreover,\nto enrich informative prompts for effective image restoration,\nmulti-dimensional prompt learning modules are proposed to learn prompt-flows\nfrom multi-scale encoder/decoder layers, benefiting for revealing underlying\ncharacteristic of various degradations from both spatial and channel\nperspectives, therefore, enhancing the capabilities of \"all-in-one\" model to\nsolve various restoration tasks. Extensive experiment results on several image\nrestoration benchmark tasks such as image denoising, dehazing, and deraining,\nhave demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve new state-of-the-art\nperformance, compared with many popular mainstream methods.

Specifically, we\ninvestigate a scenario where a base station (BS) equipped with multiple fluid\nantennas communicates with multiple users (CUs), each equipped with a single\nfluid antenna. Our objective is to maximize the minimum communication rate\namong all users by jointly optimizing the BS's transmit beamforming, the\npositions of its transmit fluid antennas, and the positions of the CUs' receive\nfluid antennas. To address this non-convex problem, we propose a block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) algorithm integrating semidefinite relaxation (SDR),\nrank-one constraint relaxation (SRCR), successive convex approximation (SCA),\nand majorization-minimization (MM). Simulation results demonstrate that FAS\nsignificantly enhances system performance and robustness, with notable gains\nwhen both the BS and CUs are equipped with fluid antennas. Even under low\ntransmit power conditions, deploying FAS at the BS alone yields substantial\nperformance gains. However, the effectiveness of FAS depends on the\navailability of sufficient movement space, as space constraints may limit its\nbenefits compared to fixed antenna strategies. Our findings highlight the\npotential of FAS to mitigate HIs and enhance multi-user system performance,\nwhile emphasizing the need for practical deployment considerations.",

As the number\nof modalities increases, aligning all-modality models with human intentions --\nsuch as instruction following -- becomes a pressing challenge. In this work, we\nmake the first attempt to fine-tune all-modality models (i.e. input and output\nwith any modality, also named any-to-any models) using human preference data\nacross all modalities (including text, image, audio, and video), ensuring its\nbehavior aligns with human intentions. This endeavor presents several\nchallenges. First, there is no large-scale all-modality human preference data\nin existing open-source resources, as most datasets are limited to specific\nmodalities, predominantly text and image. Secondly, the effectiveness of binary\npreferences in RLHF for post-training alignment in complex all-modality\nscenarios remains an unexplored area. Finally, there is a lack of a systematic\nframework to evaluate the capabilities of all-modality models, particularly\nregarding modality selection and synergy. To address these challenges, we\npropose the align-anything framework, which includes meticulously annotated\n200k all-modality human preference data. Then, we introduce an alignment method\nthat learns from unified language feedback, effectively capturing complex\nmodality-specific human preferences and enhancing the model's\ninstruction-following capabilities. Furthermore, to assess performance\nimprovements in all-modality models after post-training alignment, we construct\na challenging all-modality capability evaluation framework -- eval-anything.\nAll data, models, and code frameworks have been open-sourced for the community.\nFor more details, please refer to\nhttps://github.com/PKU-Alignment/align-anything.",

    "abstract": "The BL Lacertae object VER J0521+211 underwent a notable flaring episode in\nFebruary 2020. A short-term monitoring campaign, led by the MAGIC (Major\nAtmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) collaboration, covering a wide energy\nrange from radio to very-high-energy (VHE, 100 GeV < E < 100 TeV) gamma rays\nwas organised to study its evolution. These observations resulted in a\nconsistent detection of the source over six consecutive nights in the VHE\ngamma-ray domain. Combining these nightly observations with an extensive set of\nmultiwavelength data made modelling of the blazar's spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) possible during the flare. This modelling was performed with\na focus on two plausible emission mechanisms: i) a leptonic two-zone\nsynchrotron-self-Compton scenario, and ii) a lepto-hadronic one-zone scenario.\nBoth models effectively replicated the observed SED from radio to the VHE\ngamma-ray band. Furthermore, by introducing a set of evolving parameters, both\nmodels were successful in reproducing the evolution of the fluxes measured in\ndifferent bands throughout the observing campaign. Notably, the lepto-hadronic\nmodel predicts enhanced photon and neutrino fluxes at ultra-high energies (E >\n100 TeV). While the photon component, generated via decay of neutral pions, is\nnot directly observable as it is subject to intense pair production (and\ntherefore extinction) through interactions with the cosmic microwave background\nphotons, neutrino detectors (e.g. IceCube) can probe the predicted neutrino\ncomponent. Finally, the analysis of the gamma-ray spectra, as observed by MAGIC\nand the Fermi-LAT telescopes, yielded a conservative 95\\% confidence upper\nlimit of z \\leq 0.244 for the redshift of this blazar.",

Representative GFSS approaches typically employ a\ntwo-phase training scheme, involving base class pre-training followed by novel\nclass fine-tuning, to learn the classifiers for base and novel classes\nrespectively. Nevertheless, distribution gap exists between base and novel\nclasses in this process. To narrow this gap, we exploit effective knowledge\ntransfer from base to novel classes. First, a novel prototype modulation module\nis designed to modulate novel class prototypes by exploiting the correlations\nbetween base and novel classes. Second, a novel classifier calibration module\nis proposed to calibrate the weight distribution of the novel classifier\naccording to that of the base classifier. Furthermore, existing GFSS approaches\nsuffer from a lack of contextual information for novel classes due to their\nlimited samples, we thereby introduce a context consistency learning scheme to\ntransfer the contextual knowledge from base to novel classes. Extensive\nexperiments on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly enhances the state of the art in the GFSS setting.

Key findings reveal that the increasing NP density in the surface\nlayer leads to surface saturation, followed by transitions to a gel-like state\nthrough successive layer formation and collapse.

They provide users with more complete information\nthan single forecasts as they permit to estimate the probability of weather\nevents by representing the sources of uncertainties and accounting for the\nday-to-day variability of error growth in the atmosphere. This paper presents a\nnovel approach to obtain a weather forecast model for ensemble forecasting with\nmachine-learning. AIFS-CRPS is a variant of the Artificial Intelligence\nForecasting System (AIFS) developed at ECMWF. Its loss function is based on a\nproper score, the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). For the loss, the\nalmost fair CRPS is introduced because it approximately removes the bias in the\nscore due to finite ensemble size yet avoids a degeneracy of the fair CRPS. The\ntrained model is stochastic and can generate as many exchangeable members as\ndesired and computationally feasible in inference. For medium-range forecasts\nAIFS-CRPS outperforms the physics-based Integrated Forecasting System (IFS)\nensemble for the majority of variables and lead times. For subseasonal\nforecasts, AIFS-CRPS outperforms the IFS ensemble before calibration and is\ncompetitive with the IFS ensemble when forecasts are evaluated as anomalies to\nremove the influence of model biases.",

    "abstract": "Questions within surveys, called survey items, are used in the social\nsciences to study latent concepts, such as the factors influencing life\nsatisfaction. Instead of using explicit citations, researchers paraphrase the\ncontent of the survey items they use in-text. However, this makes it\nchallenging to find survey items of interest when comparing related work.\nAutomatically parsing and linking these implicit mentions to survey items in a\nknowledge base can provide more fine-grained references. We model this task,\ncalled Survey Item Linking (SIL), in two stages: mention detection and entity\ndisambiguation. Due to an imprecise definition of the task, existing datasets\nused for evaluating the performance for SIL are too small and of low-quality.\nWe argue that latent concepts and survey item mentions should be\ndifferentiated. To this end, we create a high-quality and richly annotated\ndataset consisting of 20,454 English and German sentences. By benchmarking deep\nlearning systems for each of the two stages independently and sequentially, we\ndemonstrate that the task is feasible, but observe that errors propagate from\nthe first stage, leading to a lower overall task performance. Moreover,\nmentions that require the context of multiple sentences are more challenging to\nidentify for models in the first stage. Modeling the entire context of a\ndocument and combining the two stages into an end-to-end system could mitigate\nthese problems in future work, and errors could additionally be reduced by\ncollecting more diverse data and by improving the quality of the knowledge\nbase.

However, the lack of explainability in AI systems (XAI) hinders\ntheir clinical adoption, especially in multimodal settings that use\nincreasingly complex model architectures. Most existing XAI methods focus on\nunimodal models, which fail to capture cross-modal interactions crucial for\nunderstanding the combined impact of multiple data sources. Existing methods\nfor quantifying cross-modal interactions are limited to two modalities, rely on\nlabelled data, and depend on model performance. This is problematic in\nhealthcare, where XAI must handle multiple data sources and provide\nindividualised explanations. This paper introduces InterSHAP, a cross-modal\ninteraction score that addresses the limitations of existing approaches.\nInterSHAP uses the Shapley interaction index to precisely separate and quantify\nthe contributions of the individual modalities and their interactions without\napproximations. By integrating an open-source implementation with the SHAP\npackage, we enhance reproducibility and ease of use. We show that InterSHAP\naccurately measures the presence of cross-modal interactions, can handle\nmultiple modalities, and provides detailed explanations at a local level for\nindividual samples.

This has motivated researchers to also apply the MPS ansatz to\nmachine learning (ML) problems where capturing complex correlations in datasets\nis also a key requirement. Here, we develop and apply an MPS-based algorithm,\nMPSTime, for learning a joint probability distribution underlying an observed\ntime-series dataset, and show how it can be used to tackle important\ntime-series ML problems, including classification and imputation. MPSTime can\nefficiently learn complicated time-series probability distributions directly\nfrom data, requires only moderate maximum MPS bond dimension $\\chi_{\\rm max}$,\nwith values for our applications ranging between $\\chi_{\\rm max} = 20-160$, and\ncan be trained for both classification and imputation tasks under a single\nlogarithmic loss function. Using synthetic and publicly available real-world\ndatasets, spanning applications in medicine, energy, and astronomy, we\ndemonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art ML approaches, but\nwith the key advantage of encoding the full joint probability distribution\nlearned from the data, which is useful for analyzing and interpreting its\nunderlying structure.

We account for\nasymmetries stemming both from plasma parameter gradients and an asymmetric\nplasmoid shielding caused by the drift of the ionized pellet cloud. For high\ntemperature, reactor relevant scenarios, we find a wide range of initial pellet\nsizes and speeds where the rocket effect severely limits the penetration depth\nof the pellet. In these cases, the plasma parameter profile variations dominate\nthe rocket effect.

The QOI-Check builds upon Simulation Based Calibration (SBC), and the\nHoldout Predictive Check (HPC). SBC verifies computational reliability of\nBayesian inference algorithms by consistency check of posterior with prior when\nthe posterior is estimated on prior-predicted data, while HPC ensures robust\ninference by assessing consistency of model predictions with holdout data.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel deep learning framework for estimating\nmultivariate joint extremes of metocean variables, based on the Semi-Parametric\nAngular-Radial (SPAR) model. When considered in polar coordinates, the problem\nof modelling multivariate extremes is transformed to one of modelling an\nangular density, and the tail of a univariate radial variable conditioned on\nangle. In the SPAR approach, the tail of the radial variable is modelled using\na generalised Pareto (GP) distribution, providing a natural extension of\nunivariate extreme value theory to the multivariate setting. In this work, we\nshow how the method can be applied in higher dimensions, using a case study for\nfive metocean variables: wind speed, wind direction, wave height, wave period,\nand wave direction. The angular variable is modelled using a kernel density\nmethod, while the parameters of the GP model are approximated using\nfully-connected deep neural networks. Our approach provides great flexibility\nin the dependence structures that can be represented, together with\ncomputationally efficient routines for training the model. Furthermore, the\napplication of the method requires fewer assumptions about the underlying\ndistribution(s) compared to existing approaches, and an asymptotically\njustified means for extrapolating outside the range of observations. Using\nvarious diagnostic plots, we show that the fitted models provide a good\ndescription of the joint extremes of the metocean variables considered.",

    "abstract": "Even though the Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) has shown its worth in a\nvariety of research areas, it has been rarely used for polymer dynamics,\nparticularly in dilute and semi-dilute conditions and under imposed flow\nfields. For such applications, the most popular technique has been Brownian\ndynamics (BD), even though the formulation of the same may be complicated for\nflow in complex geometries, which is straightforward for DPD. This is partly\ndue to the flexibility of BD simulations to mimic any dynamic regime for\npolymer solutions by independently tuning hydrodynamic interactions (HI) and\nexcluded volume (EV). In this study, we reveal that DPD also offers a similar\nflexibility and the regimes with respect to dominant EV and HI can be selected\nas conveniently as BD. This flexibility is achieved by tuning the repulsive\ninteraction parameter of polymer beads and the spring length (which determines\nthe chain resolution). Our results show that the former sets the chain size\n(and thus, EV) while the latter can be used to set the HI, nearly independently\nof each other. Thus, any rheological regime of certain level of EV and HI can\nbe attained by appropriately tuning only these two parameters, providing a\nflexibility of similar levels as BD simulations. We further indicate the\nsuitability of DPD by comparing rheological predictions with equivalent models\nin BD. For this, we imposed startup uniaxial extensional flows and steady shear\nflows on the system. Our results indicate the consistency of DPD with BD\nsimulations, which is known to agree well with experiments.",

Morphology metrics play a fundamental role in\nperformance-driven computational urban design (CUD) which integrates urban form\ngeneration, performance evaluation and optimization. However, a critical gap\nremains between performance evaluation and complex urban form generation,\ncaused by the disconnection between morphology metrics and urban form,\nparticularly in metric-to-form workflows. It prevents the application of\noptimized metrics to generate improved urban form with enhanced urban\nperformance. Formulating morphology metrics that not only effectively\ncharacterize complex urban forms but also enable the reconstruction of diverse\nforms is of significant importance. This paper highlights the importance of\nestablishing a bi-directional mapping between morphology metrics and complex\nurban form to enable the integration of urban form generation with performance\nevaluation. We present an approach that can 1) formulate morphology metrics to\nboth characterize urban forms and in reverse, retrieve diverse similar 3D urban\nforms, and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of morphology metrics in representing\n3D urban form characteristics of blocks by comparison. We demonstrate the\nmethodology with 3D urban models of New York City, covering 14,248 blocks. We\nuse neural networks and information retrieval for morphology metric encoding,\nurban form clustering and morphology metric evaluation. We identified an\neffective set of morphology metrics for characterizing block-scale urban forms\nthrough comparison.

    "abstract": "The availability of accurate and timely state predictions for objects in\nnear-Earth orbits is becoming increasingly important due to the growing\ncongestion in key orbital regimes. The Two-line Element Set (TLE) catalogue\nremains, to this day, one of the few publicly-available, comprehensive sources\nof near-Earth object ephemerides. At the same time, TLEs are affected by\nmeasurement noise and are limited by the low accuracy of the SGP4 theory,\nintroducing significant uncertainty into state predictions. Previous literature\nhas shown that filtering TLEs with batch least squares methods can yield\nsignificant improvements in long-term state prediction accuracy. However, this\nprocess can be highly sensitive to TLE quality which can vary throughout the\nyear. In this study, it is shown that either extended-duration fit windows of\nthe order of months, or the removal of systematic biases in along-track\nposition prior to state estimation can produce significant reductions in\npost-fit position errors. Simple models for estimating these systematic biases\nare shown to be effective without introducing the need for high-complexity\nMachine Learning (ML) models. Furthermore, by establishing a TLE-based error\nmetric, the need for high accuracy ephemerides is removed when creating these\nmodels. For selected satellites in the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) regime,\npost-fit position errors are reduced by up to 80 %, from approximately 5 km to\n1 km; meanwhile, for selected satellites in the Geostationary Earth Orbit\n(GEO)/Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GSO) regime, large oscillations in post-fit\nposition error can be suppressed.",

While a single\nclassical computer transforms one particular binary input into an output after\napplying one operator to the input, a quantum computer can apply the operator\nto a superposition of binary strings to provide a superposition of binary\noutputs, doing computation apparently in parallel. This feature allows quantum\ncomputers to speed up the computation compared to classical algorithms.\nUnsurprisingly, quantum algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization\nproblems in quantum computers. Furthermore, a family of quantum machines called\nquantum annealers are specially designed to solve optimization problems. In\nthis paper, we provide an introduction to quantum optimization from a practical\npoint of view. We introduce the reader to the use of quantum annealers and\nquantum gate-based machines to solve optimization problems.",

In\nrecent years, significant research and development have focused on large-scale\nX-ray sources such as synchrotrons and free-electron lasers, leading to the\ngeneration of high-brightness coherent X-rays. However, the large size and high\ncosts of such sources prevent their widespread use. The quest for a compact and\ncoherent Xray source has long been a critical objective in modern physics,\ngaining further importance in recent years for industrial applications and\nfundamental scientific research. Here, we review the physical mechanisms\ngoverning compact coherent X-ray generation. Of current interest are coherent\nperiodic interactions of free electrons in crystalline materials, creating hard\nX-rays via a mechanism known as parametric X-ray radiation (PXR). Over the past\ndecade, X-ray sources leveraging this mechanism have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art tunability, directionality, and broad spatial coherence,\nenabling X-ray phase-contrast imaging on a compact scale. The coming years are\nexpected to show substantial miniaturization of compact X-ray sources,\nfacilitated by progress in electron beam technologies. This review compares the\nmost promising mechanisms used for hard-X-ray generation, contrasting\nparametric X-ray radiation with inverse Compton scattering and characteristic\nradiation from a liquid-jet anode.

    "abstract": "A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation,\nwhich is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active\noriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question\nof how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. Here we\nstudy under which conditions active oriented deformation can be stabilized by\nthe concentration pattern of a signaling molecule, which is secreted by a\nlocalized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent\nwith earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is always\nunstable in the gradient-contractile case, i.e. when active stresses act to\ncontract the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient, and we now\nshow that this is true even in the limit of large diffusion. However, active\ndeformation can be stabilized in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active\nstresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the signaling\ngradient. Specifically, we show that gradient-extensile systems can be stable\nwhen the tissue is already elongated in the direction of the gradient. We\nmoreover point out the existence of a formerly unknown, additional instability\nof the tissue shape change. This instability results from the interplay of\nactive tissue shear and signal diffusion, and it indicates that some additional\nfeedback mechanism may be required to control the target tissue shape. Taken\ntogether, our theoretical results provide quantitative criteria for robust\nactive tissue deformation, and explain the lack of gradient-contractile systems\nin the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability\nacts as an evolutionary selection criterion.",

For a\nGW of sufficient amplitude and duration, and of suitable frequency, these\nshifts might be detected with a Gaia-like astrometric telescope. This paper\naims to analyse in detail the effects of GWs on an astrometric solution based\non Gaia-like observations, which are one-dimensional, strictly differential\nbetween two widely separated fields of view and following a prescribed scanning\nlaw. We present a simple geometric model for the astrometric effects of a plane\nGW in terms of the time-dependent positional shifts. Using this model, the\ngeneral interaction between the GW and a Gaia-like observation is discussed.\nNumerous Gaia-like astrometric solutions are made, taking as input simulated\nobservations that include the effects of a continuous plain GW with constant\nparameters and periods ranging from ~50 days to 100 years. The resulting\nsolutions are analysed in terms of the systematic errors on astrometric and\nattitude parameters, as well as the observational residuals. It is found that a\nsignificant part of the GW signal is absorbed by the astrometric parameters,\nleading to astrometric errors of a magnitude (in radians) comparable to the\nstrain parameters. These astrometric errors are in general not possible to\ndetect, because the true (unperturbed) astrometric parameters are not known to\ncorresponding accuracy. The astrometric errors are especially large for\nspecific GW frequencies that are linear combinations of two characteristic\nfrequencies of the scanning law. Nevertheless, for all GW periods smaller than\nthe time span covered by the observations, significant parts of the GW signal\nalso go into the astrometric residuals. This fosters the hope for a GW\ndetection algorithm based on the residuals of standard astrometric solutions.",

The library\nsupports finite and infinite streams and offers a rich set of combinators: from\nmap, filter, take(while) to flat-map (nesting), zip, map-accumulate and sliding\nwindowing. The combinators may be freely composed, and yet the resulting\nconvoluted imperative code contains no traces of combinator abstractions: no\nclosures, intermediate objects or tuples. The high-performance is portable and\nstatically guaranteed, without relying on compiler or black-box optimizations.\nWe greatly exceed in performance the available stream processing libraries in\nOCaml.\n  The library exists in two versions, OCaml and Scala 3, and supports pluggable\nbackends for code generation (currently: C, OCaml and Scala).\n  Strymonas has been developed in tandem with the equational theory of stateful\nstreams. Our theoretical model can represent all desired pipelines and also\nguarantees the existence of unique normal forms, which are mappable to (fused)\nstate machines.

    "abstract": "A complete sample of red supergiant stars (RSGs) is important for studying\ntheir properties. Identifying RSGs in extragalatic field first requires\nremoving the Galactic foreground dwarfs. The color-color diagram (CCD) method,\nspecifically using $r-z/z-H$ and $J-H/H-K$, has proven successful in several\nstudies. However, in metal-poor galaxies, faint RSGs will mix into the dwarf\nbranch in the CCD and would be removed, leading to an incomplete RSG sample.\nThis work attempts to improve the CCD method in combination with the Gaia\nastrometric measurement to remove foreground contamination in order to\nconstruct a complete RSG sample in metal-poor galaxies. The empirical regions\nof RSGs in both CCDs are defined and modified by fitting the locations of RSGs\nin galaxies with a range of metallicity. The metal-poor galaxy NGC 6822 is\ntaken as a case study for its low metallicity ([Fe/H] $\\approx$ -1.0) and\nmoderate distance (about 500 kpc). In the complete sample, we identify 1,184\nRSG, 1,559 oxygen-rich AGB (O-AGBs), 1,075 carbon-rich AGB (C-AGBs), and 140\nextreme AGB (x-AGBs) candidates, with a contamination rate of approximately\n20.5%, 9.7%, 6.8%, and 5.0%, respectively.

The storage and retrieval\nof time series can be challenging due to their unstoppable growth. In fact,\nthese applications often sacrifice precious historical data to make room for\nnew data.\n  General-purpose compressors can mitigate this problem with their good\ncompression ratios, but they lack efficient random access on compressed data,\nthus preventing real-time analyses. Ad-hoc streaming solutions, instead,\ntypically optimise only for compression and decompression speed, while giving\nup compression effectiveness and random access functionality. Furthermore, all\nthese methods lack awareness of certain special regularities of time series,\nwhose trends over time can often be described by some linear and nonlinear\nfunctions.\n  To address these issues, we introduce NeaTS, a randomly-accessible\ncompression scheme that approximates the time series with a sequence of\nnonlinear functions of different kinds and shapes, carefully selected and\nplaced by a partitioning algorithm to minimise the space. The approximation\nresiduals are bounded, which allows storing them in little space and thus\nrecovering the original data losslessly, or simply discarding them to obtain a\nlossy time series representation with maximum error guarantees.\n  Our experiments show that NeaTS improves the compression ratio of the\nstate-of-the-art lossy compressors that use linear or nonlinear functions (or\nboth) by up to 14%. Compared to lossless compressors, NeaTS emerges as the only\napproach to date providing, simultaneously, compression ratios close to or\nbetter than the best existing compressors, a much faster decompression speed,\nand orders of magnitude more efficient random access, thus enabling the storage\nand real-time analysis of massive and ever-growing amounts of (historical) time\nseries data.",

Such\nphoton pairs are commonly generated as the signal and idler in the frequency\nand polarization-degenerate spontaneous parametric down conversion~(SPDC). To\nscale this approach to a larger number of photons we demonstrate how two\nindependent signal photons radiated into different spatial modes can be\nrendered conditionally indistinguishable by a heralding measurement performed\non their respective idlers. We use the SPDC in a whispering gallery resonator,\nwhich is already proven to be versatile sources of quantum states. Its extreme\nconversion efficiency allowed us to perform our measurements with only\n\\qty{50}{nW} of in-coupled pump power in each propagation direction. The\nHong-Ou-Mandel interference of two counter-propagating signal photons\nmanifested itself in the four-fold coincidence rate, where the two idler\nphotons detection heralds a pair of signal photons with a desired temporal\noverlap. We achieved the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip contrast of \\(74\\pm 5\\%\\).\nImportantly, the optical bandwidth of all involved photons is of the order of a\nMHz and is continuously tunable.

This allows seamless integration to pretrained networks, where\nthis repulsive last-layer ensemble can be used for uncertainty aware\nfine-tuning at minimal additional cost.

These phenomena proof difficult to be modelled and\ncaptured accurately using physical analogies alone. This has motivated\nresearchers to shift from physics-based to data-driven models. Currently, these\nmethods are still limited in their ability to generalize effectively to typical\nindustrial robot deployement, characterized by high- and low-velocity\noperations and frequent direction reversals. Empirical observations motivate\nthe use of dynamic friction models but these remain particulary challenging to\nestablish. To address the current limitations, we propose to account for\nunidentified dynamics in the robot joints using latent dynamic states. The\nfriction model may then utilize both the dynamic robot state and additional\ninformation encoded in the latent state to evaluate the friction torque. We\ncast this stochastic and partially unsupervised identification problem as a\nstandard probabilistic representation learning problem. In this work both the\nfriction model and latent state dynamics are parametrized as neural networks\nand integrated in the conventional lumped parameter dynamic robot model. The\ncomplete dynamics model is directly learned from the noisy encoder measurements\nin the robot joints. We use the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm to find\na Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of the model parameters.

However, hardware\nthat does not follow a lattice structure, such as IBM's heavy-hexagon\nstructure, is also under development. In these non-lattice structures, many\nquantum error correction (QEC) codes designed for lattice-based system cannot\nbe directly applied. Adapting these codes often requires incorporating\nadditional qubits, such as flag qubits. This alters the properties of the QEC\ncode and introduces new variables into the magic state injection process. In\nthis study, we implemented and compared the magic state injection process on a\nheavy-hexagon structure with flag qubits and a lattice structure without flag\nqubits. Additionally, we considered biased errors in superconducting hardware\nand investigated the impact of flag qubits under these conditions. Our analysis\nreveals that the inclusion of flag qubits introduces distinct characteristics\ninto the magic state injection process, which are absent in systems without\nflag qubits. Based on these findings, we identify several critical\nconsiderations for performing magic state injection on heavy-hexagon systems\nincorporating flag qubits. Furthermore, we propose an optimized approach to\nmaximize the efficacy of this process in such systems.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide\nrange of tasks. However, the size of LLMs is steadily increasing, hindering\ntheir application on computationally constrained environments. On the other\nhand, despite their general capabilities, there are many situations where only\none specific task is performed, rendering all other capabilities unnecessary\nand wasteful. This leads us to the following question: Is it possible to\nextract the minimal subset from an LLM that is able to perform a specific task\nin a faster, standalone manner? Recent works on Mechanistic Interpretability\n(MI) have shown that specific tasks are performed by a localized subset of\ncomponents, or circuit. However, current techniques used to identify the\ncircuit cannot be used to extract it for its standalone usage. In this work, we\npropose a novel approach to automatically extract the subset of the LLM that\nproperly performs a targeted task requiring no additional training and a small\namount of data samples. We evaluate our approach on different tasks and show\nthat the resulting models are (i) considerably smaller, reducing the number of\nparameters up to 82.77% and (ii) more interpretable, as they focus on the\ncircuit that is used to carry out the specific task, and can therefore be\nunderstood using MI techniques.",

In particular, achieving\nXAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact\nacross the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, in this work, we adapt the\nexisting concept of reasoning behaviour and articulate its interpretation\nwithin the specific context of medical LLMs. We survey and categorise current\nstate-of-the-art approaches for modeling and evaluating reasoning reasoning in\nmedical LLMs. Additionally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower\nmedical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the\nlow-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models.

    "abstract": "Like many optimization algorithms, Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) is\nsensitive to the choice of the learning rate. If the learning rate is too\nsmall, the optimization process may be slow, and the algorithm might get stuck\nin local optima. On the other hand, if the learning rate is too large, the\nalgorithm may oscillate or diverge, failing to converge to a solution. Adaptive\nlearning rate methods such as Adam, AdaMax, Adagrad, or RMSprop automatically\nadjust the learning rate based on the history of gradients. Nevertheless, if\nthe base learning rate is too large, the variational parameters might still\noscillate around the optimal solution. With learning rate schedules, the\nlearning rate can be reduced gradually to mitigate this problem. However, the\namount at which the learning rate should be decreased in each iteration is not\nknown a priori, which can significantly impact the performance of the\noptimization. In this work, we propose a method to decay the learning rate\nbased on the history of the variational parameters. We use an empirical measure\nto quantify the amount of oscillations against the progress of the variational\nparameters to adapt the learning rate.

We\nprove canonicity and completeness in the relational semantics of the minimal\ndistribution-free normal modal logic, assuming just the K-axiom, as well as of\nits axiomatic extensions obtained by adding any of the D, T, B, S4 or S5\naxioms. Adding distribution can be easily accommodated and, as a side result,\nwe also obtain a new semantic treatment of Intuitionistic Modal Logic.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide important prospective insights in\napplications such as social behavior analysis and financial risk analysis based\non their powerful learning capabilities on graph data. Nevertheless, GNNs'\npredictive performance relies on the quality of task-specific node labels, so\nit is common practice to improve the model's generalization ability in the\ndownstream execution of decision-making tasks through pre-training. Graph\nprompting is a prudent choice but risky without taking measures to prevent data\nleakage. In other words, in high-risk decision scenarios, prompt learning can\ninfer private information by accessing model parameters trained on private data\n(publishing model parameters in pre-training, i.e., without directly leaking\nthe raw data, is a tacitly accepted trend). However, myriad graph inference\nattacks necessitate tailored module design and processing to enhance inference\ncapabilities due to variations in supervision signals. In this paper, we\npropose a novel Prompt-based unifying Inference Attack framework on GNNs, named\nProIA. Specifically, ProIA retains the crucial topological information of the\ngraph during pre-training, enhancing the background knowledge of the inference\nattack model. It then utilizes a unified prompt and introduces additional\ndisentanglement factors in downstream attacks to adapt to task-relevant\nknowledge. Finally, extensive experiments show that ProIA enhances attack\ncapabilities and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to various inference\nattacks.",

Addressing this\nchallenge is becoming increasingly crucial for safeguarding underwater\ninfrastructure, monitoring marine life, and providing defense during seabed\nwarfare. To that end, a solution is proposed based on a vector-autoregressive\nmodel for the ambient noise and a heavy-tailed statistical model for the\ndistribution of the raw hydrophone data. These models are integrated into a\nBernoulli track-before-detect (TkBD) filter that estimates the probability of\ntarget existence, target bearing, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed\nsolution is evaluated on both simulated and real-world data, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the proposed ambient noise modeling and the statistical model\nfor the raw hydrophone data samples to obtain early target detection and robust\ntarget tracking. The simulations show that the SNR at which the target can be\ndetected is reduced by 4 dB compared to when using the standard constant false\nalarm rate detector-based tracker. Further, the test with real-world data shows\nthat the proposed solution increases the target detection distance from 250 m\nto 390 m. The presented results illustrate that the TkBD technology, in\ncombination with data-driven ambient noise modeling and heavy-tailed\nstatistical signal models, can enable reliable broadband passive sonar target\ndetection and tracking in complex acoustic environments and lower the SNR\nrequired to detect and track targets.",

Algorithmic collusion has been debated among\ncompetition regulators, and it is a highly relevant phenomenon for buyers and\nsellers on online retail platforms. We analyze formally if mean-based\nalgorithms, a class of bandit algorithms relevant to algorithmic pricing,\nconverge to the Nash equilibrium in repeated Bertrand oligopolies. Bandit\nalgorithms only learn the profit of the agent for the price set in each step.\nIn addition, we provide results of extensive experiments with different types\nof multi-armed bandit algorithms used for algorithmic pricing. In a\nmathematical proof, we show that mean-based algorithms converge to correlated\nrational strategy profiles, which coincide with the Nash equilibrium in\nversions of the Bertrand competition. Learning algorithms do not converge to a\nNash equilibrium in general, and the fact that Bertrand pricing games are\nlearnable with bandit algorithms is remarkable. Our numerical results suggest\nthat wide-spread bandit algorithms that are not mean-based also converge to\nequilibrium and that algorithmic collusion only arises with symmetric\nimplementations of UCB or Q-learning, but not if different algorithms are used\nby sellers. In addition, the level of supra-competitive prices decreases with\nincreasing numbers of sellers. Supra-competitive prices decrease consumer\nwelfare. If algorithms lead to algorithmic collusion, this is important for\nconsumers, sellers, and regulators to understand. We show that for the\nimportant class of multi-armed bandit algorithms such fears are overrated\nunless all sellers agree on a symmetric implementation of certain collusive\nalgorithms.",

Moreover, none of the current peer studies have deployed dynamic\ntraffic systems for experiments, which is far from the actual situation.\n  In this context, we propose Multi-Scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning\nfor traffic signal control (MacLight), which offers faster training speeds and\nmore stable performance. Our approach consists of two main components. The\nfirst is the global representation, where we utilize variational autoencoders\nto compactly compress and extract the global representation. The second\ncomponent employs the proximal policy optimization algorithm as the backbone,\nallowing value evaluation to consider both local features and global embedding\nrepresentations. This backbone model significantly reduces time overhead and\nensures stability in policy updates. We validated our method across multiple\ntraffic scenarios under both static and dynamic traffic systems. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that, compared to general and domian SOTA methods, our\napproach achieves superior stability, optimized convergence levels and the\nhighest time efficiency.

In dynamic network environments, both threat landscapes and\nnormal operational behaviors are constantly changing, resulting in concept\ndrift. While continuous learning mitigates the adverse effects of concept\ndrift, insufficient attention to drift patterns and excessive preservation of\noutdated knowledge can still hinder the IDS's adaptability. In this paper, we\npropose SSF (Strategic Selection and Forgetting), a novel continual learning\nmethod for IDS, providing continuous model updates with a constantly refreshed\nmemory buffer. Our approach features a strategic sample selection algorithm to\nselect representative new samples and a strategic forgetting mechanism to drop\noutdated samples. The proposed strategic sample selection algorithm prioritizes\nnew samples that cause the `drifted' pattern, enabling the model to better\nunderstand the evolving landscape. Additionally, we introduce strategic\nforgetting upon detecting significant drift by discarding outdated samples to\nfree up memory, allowing the incorporation of more recent data. SSF captures\nevolving patterns effectively and ensures the model is aligned with the change\nof data patterns, significantly enhancing the IDS's adaptability to concept\ndrift.

While the addition of SOC contributes to rapid\noscillations in the amplitude of the rogue waves, Rabi coupling results in the\nappearance of stripes in the temporal direction. When the transient trap is\nswitched on, these stripes which remain stable within the confining region,\nbegin to overlap exponentially in the expulsive domain and eventually shrink\nleading to instability. We have shown that the instability arising in the rogue\nwaves in a transient trap can be completely overcome by manipulating the\nscattering length through Feshbach resonance. In the case of breathers, the\nRabi coupling introduces temporal stripes with single and double mode peaks\naround the origin while under the influence of the transient trap, the\nbreathers get compressed and tilted. On the other hand, the amplitude of\nbreathers which stays constant between a maxima and minima despite oscillating\nwith time undergoes rapid fluctuations in a given spatial domain under the\ninfluence of SOC. In the case of classical dark-bright solitons, we see the\nflipping of dark solitons to attain positive density much similar to bright\nsolitons under the impact of Rabi coupling. One also witnesses a 45 degree\nshift in the trajectory of dark and bright solitons when the transient trap is\nswitched on. The width of the solitons widen in the confining trap while they\nshrink in the expulsive domain.",

We introduce an adaptive gating network in MEC to\nadaptively identify and route newly arrived tasks of unknown data distributions\nto available experts, enabling each expert to specialize in a specific type of\ntasks upon convergence. We derived the minimum number of experts required to\nmatch each task with a specialized, available expert. Our MoE approach\nconsistently reduces the overall generalization error over time, unlike the\ntraditional MEC approach. Interestingly, when the number of experts is\nsufficient to ensure convergence, adding more experts delays the convergence\ntime and worsens the generalization error. Finally, we perform extensive\nexperiments on real datasets in deep neural networks (DNNs) to verify our\ntheoretical results.",

Reducing sampling steps often compromises\nvideo quality or generation diversity. In this work, we introduce a\ndistillation method that combines variational score distillation and\nconsistency distillation to achieve few-step video generation, maintaining both\nhigh quality and diversity. We also propose a latent reward model fine-tuning\napproach to further enhance video generation performance according to any\nspecified reward metric. This approach reduces memory usage and does not\nrequire the reward to be differentiable. Our method demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art performance in few-step generation for 10-second videos (128\nframes at 12 FPS). The distilled student model achieves a score of 82.57 on\nVBench, surpassing the teacher model as well as baseline models Gen-3,\nT2V-Turbo, and Kling. One-step distillation accelerates the teacher model's\ndiffusion sampling by up to 278.6 times, enabling near real-time generation.\nHuman evaluations further validate the superior performance of our 4-step\nstudent models compared to teacher model using 50-step DDIM sampling.",

Uncertainty quantification tools (notions of confidence\nand entropy, i.a.) can be used to that end (e.g., to reject a response when the\nmodel is `uncertain'). For example, Kuhn et al. (semantic entropy; 2022b)\nregard semantic variation amongst sampled responses as evidence that the model\n`struggles' with the prompt and that the LM is likely to err. We argue that\nsemantic variability need not imply error--this being especially intuitive in\nopen-ended settings, where prompts elicit multiple adequate but semantically\ndistinct responses.

The results cover the Nusselt number, the net and oscillatory\nfriction factors and the instantaneous velocity fields using PIV in an\nexperimental campaign with a 32 mm tube diameter.

In absence of oscillatory flow, opposed baffles advance the transition\nto turbulence from $Re_n = 100$ to $50$, increasing the net friction factor (40\n%) for $Re_n > 50$ and the Nusselt number (maximum of 27 %) for $Re_n < 150$.\nWhen an oscillatory flow is applied, augmentations caused by opposed baffles\nare only observed for $Re_n < 150$ and $Re_{osc} < 150$. Above $Re_n$,\n$Re_{osc}>150$, opposed baffles are not recommended for the promotion of heat\ntransfer, owing to friction penalties.

Although previous respectable TSG methods have achieved\nremarkable success, they train each video-query pair separately and ignore the\nrelationship between different pairs. We observe that the similar video/query\ncontent not only helps the TSG model better understand and generalize the\ncross-modal representation but also assists the model in locating some complex\nvideo-query pairs. Previous methods follow a single-thread framework that\ncannot co-train different pairs and usually spends much time re-obtaining\nredundant knowledge, limiting their real-world applications. To this end, in\nthis paper, we pose a brand-new setting: Multi-Pair TSG, which aims to co-train\nthese pairs. In particular, we propose a novel video-query co-training\napproach, Multi-Thread Knowledge Transfer Network, to locate a variety of\nvideo-query pairs effectively and efficiently. Firstly, we mine the spatial and\ntemporal semantics across different queries to cooperate with each other. To\nlearn intra- and inter-modal representations simultaneously, we design a\ncross-modal contrast module to explore the semantic consistency by a\nself-supervised strategy. To fully align visual and textual representations\nbetween different pairs, we design a prototype alignment strategy to 1) match\nobject prototypes and phrase prototypes for spatial alignment, and 2) align\nactivity prototypes and sentence prototypes for temporal alignment.

    "abstract": "Code review is a crucial process before deploying code to production, as it\nvalidates the code, provides suggestions for improvements, and identifies\nerrors such as missed edge cases. In projects with regular production releases,\nthe effort required for peer code-reviews remains high. Consequently, there has\nbeen significant interest from software engineering (SE) researchers in\nautomating the code review process. Previous research on code review automation\nhas typically approached the task as three independent sub-tasks: review\nnecessity prediction, review comment generation, and code refinement. Our study\nattempts to (i) leverage the relationships between the sub-tasks of code review\nautomation, by developing a multi-task model that addresses all tasks in an\nintegrated manner, and (ii) increase model robustness on unseen data via\ncollaborative large language model (LLM) modeling, while retaining the\nproprietary nature of code, by using federated learning (FL). The study\nexplores five simple techniques for multi-task training, including two\nsequential methods, one parallel method, and two cumulative methods. The\nresults indicate that sequentially training a federated LLM (FedLLM) for our\ncode review multi-task use case is less efficient in terms of time,\ncomputation, and performance metrics, compared to training separate models for\neach task. Because sequential training demonstrates catastrophic forgetting,\nalternatively cumulative fine-tuning for multi-task training performs better\nthan training models for individual tasks. This study highlights the need for\nresearch focused on effective fine-tuning of multi-task FedLLMs for SE tasks.",

Systems of ordinary differential equations have been crucial\nin simulating this progression. However, such models often operate on multiple\ntimescales, making them computationally expensive when simulating long-term\neffects. To overcome this, we propose a homogenized version of a two-timescale\nmodel that captures the short- and long-term effects of physical activity on\nblood glucose regulation. By invoking the homogenized contribution of a\nphysical activity session into the long-term effects, we reduce the full model\nfrom 12 to 7 state variables, while preserving its key dynamics. The\nhomogenized model offers a computational speedup of over 1000 times, since a\nnumerical solver can take time steps at the scale of the long-term effects. We\nprove that the error introduced by the homogenization is bounded over time and\nvalidate the theoretical findings through a simulation study. The significant\nreduction in computational time opens the door to apply the homogenized model\nin medical decision support systems. It supports the development of\npersonalized physical activity plans that can effectively reduce the risk of\ndeveloping type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have predominantly focused on\nmaximizing accuracy and reasoning capabilities, often overlooking crucial\ncomputational efficiency considerations. While this approach has yielded\nimpressive accuracy improvements, it has led to methods that may be impractical\nfor real-world deployment due to computational overhead and latency\nconstraints. This paper investigates the potential synergy between reasoning\nenhancement and computational efficiency by analyzing the integration of two\ncontrasting approaches: Quiet-STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner) and REBASE (REward\nBAlanced SEarch). Through comprehensive empirical analysis using the Mistral-7B\nmodel on the GSM8K dataset, we demonstrate that while each method excels in its\nprimary objective-Quiet-STaR achieving superior accuracy (32.03%) despite high\ncomputational cost (554.66s runtime, 12.73T FLOPs), and REBASE providing\nexceptional efficiency (8.47s runtime, 2.35T FLOPs) while maintaining\nbaseline-comparable accuracy (10.94%)-their integration reveals fundamental\nchallenges in reconciling reasoning depth with computational efficiency. The\ncombined approach unexpectedly results in degraded performance (9.38% accuracy,\n143.66s runtime), highlighting critical insights about the complex interplay\nbetween reasoning enhancement and efficiency optimization in LLMs. Our findings\nilluminate the need for novel architectures and algorithms specifically\ndesigned to bridge the gap between these competing objectives, while providing\nconcrete directions for future research in compute-efficient reasoning methods.",

Although previous works have made\ndecent success, they are ineffective for real-world challenging applications\nsince these methods simply regard all unlabeled data as OOD data and ignore the\ncase that different datasets have different label granularity. For example,\n\"cat\" on CIFAR-10 and \"tabby cat\" on Tiny-ImageNet share the same semantics but\nhave different labels due to various label granularity. To this end, in this\npaper, we propose a novel Adaptive Hierarchical Graph Cut network (AHGC) to\ndeeply explore the semantic relationship between different images.\nSpecifically, we construct a hierarchical KNN graph to evaluate the\nsimilarities between different images based on the cosine similarity. Based on\nthe linkage and density information of the graph, we cut the graph into\nmultiple subgraphs to integrate these semantics-similar samples. If the labeled\npercentage in a subgraph is larger than a threshold, we will assign the label\nwith the highest percentage to unlabeled images. To further improve the model\ngeneralization, we augment each image into two augmentation versions, and\nmaximize the similarity between the two versions.

To date, quantum hardware is still\nerror-prone and limited in size such that quantum heuristics cannot be scaled\nto relevant problem sizes and are often outperformed by their classical\ncounterparts. Moreover, if provably optimal solutions are desired, one has to\nresort to classical exact methods. As however quantum technologies may improve\nconsiderably in future, we demonstrate in this work how quantum heuristics with\nlimited resources can be integrated in large-scale exact optimization\nalgorithms for NP-hard problems. To this end, we consider vehicle routing as\nprototypical NP-hard problem. We model the pricing and separation subproblems\narising in a branch-price-and-cut algorithm as quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization problems. This allows to use established quantum heuristics like\nquantum annealing or the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for their\nsolution. A key feature of our algorithm is that it profits not only from the\nbest solution returned by the quantum heuristic but from all solutions below a\ncertain cost threshold, thereby exploiting the inherent randomness is quantum\nalgorithms. Moreover, we reduce the requirements on quantum hardware since the\nsubproblems, which are solved via quantum heuristics, are smaller than the\noriginal problem. We provide an experimental study comparing quantum annealing\nto simulated annealing and to established classical algorithms in our\nframework. While our hybrid quantum-classical approach is still outperformed by\npurely classical methods, our results reveal that both pricing and separation\nmay be well suited for quantum heuristics if quantum hardware improves.",

The key technical challenge lies in\nsimultaneously reasoning about complex scene geometry while maintaining text\ncontrol.

    "abstract": "Gender diversity enhances research by bringing diverse perspectives and\ninnovative approaches. It ensures equitable solutions that address the needs of\ndiverse populations. However, gender disparity persists in research where women\nremain underrepresented, which might limit diversity and innovation. Many even\nleave scientific careers as their contributions often go unnoticed and\nundervalued. Therefore, understanding gender-based contributions and\ncollaboration dynamics is crucial to addressing this gap and creating a more\ninclusive research environment. In this study, we analyzed 2,000 articles\npublished over the past decade in the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS).\nFrom these, we selected 384 articles that detailed authors' contributions and\ncontained both female and male authors to investigate gender-based\ncontributions. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we analyzed women's\nengagement in software systems research. Our analysis showed that only 32.74%\nof the total authors are women and female-led or supervised studies were fewer\nthan those of men. Second, we investigated female authors' contributions across\n14 major roles. Interestingly, we found that women contributed comparably to\nmen in most roles, with more contributions in conceptualization, writing, and\nreviewing articles. Third, we explored the areas of software systems research\nand found that female authors are more actively involved in human-centric\nresearch domains. Finally, we analyzed gender-based collaboration dynamics. Our\nfindings revealed that female supervisors tended to collaborate locally more\noften than national-level collaborations. Our study highlights that females'\ncontributions to software systems research are comparable to those of men.\nTherefore, the barriers need to be addressed to enhance female participation\nand ensure equity and inclusivity in research.",

One popular approach\nis augmenting the training dataset with synthetically generated data. While\nclassical augmentation techniques were limited to linear interpolation of\nexisting minority class examples, recently higher capacity deep generative\nmodels are providing greater promise.\n  However, handling of imbalance in class distribution when building a deep\ngenerative model is also a challenging problem, that has not been studied as\nextensively as imbalanced classifier model training. We show that\nstate-of-the-art deep generative models yield significantly lower-quality\nminority examples than majority examples. %In this paper, we start with the\nobservation that imbalanced data training of generative models trained\nimbalanced dataset which under-represent the minority class.

While training the classifier\nusing synthetic data, we remove the overlap class from the training data and\njustify the reasons behind the enhanced accuracy.

Here, we propose a systematic and\nversatile framework for FB constructions in tight-binding (TB) models based on\nsymmetric compact localized states (CLSs), integrating lattice and orbital\ndegrees of freedom. We first demonstrate that any CLS can be symmetrized into a\nrepresentation of the point group, which remains valid for high orbitals with\nfinite spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Second, we determine the candidate CLS sites\naccording to lattice symmetry, and simplify the hopping as a linear mapping\nbetween two Hilbert spaces: one of CLS sites and another of their adjacent\nsites. The existence of FBs depends on a non-empty kernel of the mapping.\nFinally, we distinguish eigenstates in the kernel to qualify as a CLS. To\nillustrate the versatility of our framework, we construct three representative\nFB models: one in two dimensions (2D) and the rest in three dimensions (3D).\nAll of them lack special lattice structures and incorporate high orbitals.\nNotably, the 3D FBs can exhibit not only band touchings at points but also\nalong lines, a feature of significant physical interest. For a comprehensive\nunderstanding, we derive a concise criterion for determining band touchings,\nwhich provides a natural explanation for the occurrence of both gapped and\ngapless FBs.

The construction combines two independent\ndevelopments: efficient algorithms for scaling covariance matrix adaptation to\nhigh dimensions, and evolution strategies for multi-objective optimization. In\norder to design a specific instance of the class we first develop a (1+1)\nversion of the limited memory matrix adaptation evolution strategy and then use\nan established standard construction to turn a population thereof into a\nstate-of-the-art multi-objective optimizer with indicator-based selection.

In this\nwork, we discuss the case of a continuous-time dynamics on a Markov network\nthat is observed stroboscopically, i.e., at discrete points in time in regular\nintervals. We compare the standard approach of deriving a lower bound on the\nentropy production rate in the steady state to the less common method of\nreconstructing the generator from the observed propagators by taking the matrix\nlogarithm. Provided that the timescale of the stroboscopic measurements is\nsmaller than a critical value that can be determined from the available data,\nthis latter method is able to recover all thermodynamic quantities like entropy\nproduction or cycle affinities and is therefore superior to the usual approach\nof deriving lower bounds. Beyond the critical value, we still obtain tight\nupper and lower bounds on these quantities that improve on extant methods.

First, agents struggle to autonomously assess the relevance of\ninput information for cooperative tasks, impairing their decision-making\nabilities. Second, in communication-limited scenarios with partial\nobservability, agents are unable to access global information, restricting\ntheir ability to collaborate effectively from a global perspective. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce a novel cooperative MARL framework based on\ninformation selection and tacit learning. In this framework, agents gradually\ndevelop implicit coordination during training, enabling them to infer the\ncooperative behavior of others in a discrete space without communication,\nrelying solely on local information. Moreover, we integrate gating and\nselection mechanisms, allowing agents to adaptively filter information based on\nenvironmental changes, thereby enhancing their decision-making capabilities.\nExperiments on popular MARL benchmarks show that our framework can be\nseamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms, leading to significant\nperformance improvements.",

Two cases of the electron scattering\nmechanism are considered: Electron-optical phonon scattering and\nelectron-acoustic phonon scattering. The general multi-photon absorption\ncoefficient is presented as a function of the temperature, the external\nmagnetic field, the photon energy and the amplitude of external EMW. These\nanalytical expressions for multi-photon non-linear absorption coefficient\n(MNAC) are numerically calculated and the results are discussed in both the\nabsence and presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene sheet.\nThe results show that there is no absorption peak in the absence of the\nmagnetic field, which contrasts with previous results in 2D systems such as\nquantum wells or superlattices. However, when there is a strong magnetic field\nalong the direction perpendicular to the 2D graphene, absorption spectral lines\nappear consistent with the magneto-phonon resonance conditions. Our\ncalculations show that the MPA's effect is stronger than mono-photon\nabsorption. Besides, the quantum multi-photon non-linear absorption phenomenon\nhas been studied from low to high temperatures. This transcends the limits of\nthe classical BKE which is studied in the high-temperature domain. The\ncomputational results show that the dependence of MNAC on the above quantities\nis consistent with the previous theoretical investigation. Another novel\nfeature of this work is that the general analytic expression for MNAC shows the\nHalf Width at Half Maximum dependence on the magnetic field which is in good\nagreement with the previous experimental observations. Thus, our estimation\nmight give a critical prediction for future experimental observations in 2D\ngraphene.",

Based on the stationary states due to the\nelectron confinement in Morse QWs and the Landau levels obtained by solving the\nSchrodinger equation in the effective mass approximation, we have developed\ncalculations for the optical absorption power with MPA using second-order\nperturbation theory. Our model accounts for electron-phonon interactions and\nconsiders both optical and acoustic phonon mechanisms in the MPA process. Our\nfindings show that the one-photon absorption (1PA) peaks are larger and appear\nto the right of the two-photon absorption (2PA) peaks, whereas 2PA peaks are\nlarger and occur to the right of three-photon absorption (3PA) peaks. The\nresonance peak positions follow the magneto-phonon resonance condition and are\ntemperature-independent. Increasing the magnetic field and aluminum\nconcentration induces a blue shift in the absorption spectra, whereas\nincreasing the QW width leads to a red shift. Variations in magnetic field,\naluminum concentration, and QW width also affect the peak intensities and\nfull-width at half maximum (FWHM), with increasing values of the former two\nenhancing the FWHM, while expanding the QW width reduces it. Thermal\nexcitations increase peak intensity without shifting their positions. Our study\nhighlights the significance of nonlinear absorption processes (2PA, 3PA) in\nunderstanding optical absorption, despite their smaller FWHM compared to linear\nabsorption (1PA). Overall, the Morse QW model demonstrates promising\nmagneto-optical properties, making it a strong candidate for future\noptoelectronic device applications.",

Analytical\nexpression for the longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) is derived from the\nquantum kinetic equation for electrons, using the Fr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian of the\nelectron-acoustic phonon system. Numerical calculation results show the complex\ndependence of LMR on the parameters of the external field (electric, magnetic\nfield and temperature) as well as the structure parameters of the confinement\npotential. In the absence of IMEW, Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations appear\nwith amplitudes that decrease with temperature in agreement with previous\ntheoretical and experimental results. In the presence of IEMW, the SdH\noscillations appear in beats with amplitudes that increase with the intensity\nof the IEMW. SdH oscillations under the influence of electromagnetic waves are\ncalled microwave-induced magnetoresistance oscillations. The maximum and\nminimum peaks appear at the positions where the IEMW frequencies are integer\nand half-integer values of the cyclotron frequency, respectively. In addition,\nthe structural parameters of the quantum well such as the confinement frequency\nand the geometrical parameters have a significant influence on the LMR as well\nas the SdH oscillations. When the confinement frequency is small, the\ntwo-dimensional electronic system in the quantum well behaves as a bulk\nsemiconductor, resulting in the absence of SdH oscillations. In addition, the\nLMR increases with the geometrical parameter $\\beta_z$ of the quantum well. The\nobtained results provide a solid theoretical foundation for the possibility of\ncontrolling SdH oscillations by IEMW as well as the structural properties of\nmaterials in future experimental observations.",

To do so, we construct an effective field theory with a single\norder-parameter -- a nonstationary analogue of active Model B -- that reflects\nthe fact that different properties of bQSAPs can only be interpreted in terms\nof passive thermodynamics in appropriately chosen inertial frames. This\ncodifies the movement of phase boundaries due to nonequilibrium fluxes between\ncoexisting bulk phases in terms of a difference in effective chemical\npotentials and therefore an {\\it unequal} tangent construction on a bulk free\nenergy density. The result is both an anomalous form of coarsening and, more\ngenerally, an exotic phase structure; binodals are permitted to cross spinodal\nlines so that criticality is no longer constrained to a single point. Instead,\ncriticality, with exponents that are seemingly unchanged from symmetric QSAPs,\nis shown to exist along a line that marks the entry to an otherwise forbidden\nregion of phase space. The interior of this region is not critical in the\nconventional sense, but retains certain features of criticality, which we term\npseudo-critical. Whilst an inability to satisfy a Ginzburg criterion implies\nthat fluctuations remain relevant at macroscopic scales, finite-wavenumber\nfluctuations grow at finite rates and exhibit non-trivial dispersion relations.\nThe interplay between the growth of fluctuations and the speed at which they\nmove relative to the bulk results in distinct regimes of micro- and meso-phase\nseparation.",

Despite the clear\nphysical interest in this system and the remarkable progress in the study of\nthe free boundary Euler equations in recent decades, the low regularity\nwell-posedness of the free boundary MHD equations has remained completely open.\nThis is due, in large part, to the highly nonlinear wave-type coupling between\nthe velocity, magnetic field and free boundary, which has forced previous works\nto impose restrictive geometric constraints on the data. To address this\nproblem, we introduce a novel Eulerian approach and an entirely new functional\nsetting, which better captures the wave equation structure of the MHD equations\nand permits a complete Hadamard well-posedness theory in low-regularity Sobolev\nspaces. In particular, we give the first proofs of existence, uniqueness and\ncontinuous dependence on the data at the sharp $s>\\frac{d}{2}+1$ Sobolev\nregularity, in addition to a blowup criterion for smooth solutions at the same\nlow regularity scale. Moreover, we provide a completely new method for\nconstructing smooth solutions which, to our knowledge, gives the first proof of\nexistence (at any regularity) in our new functional setting. All of our results\nhold in arbitrary dimensions and in general, not necessarily simply connected,\ndomains. By taking the magnetic field to be zero, they also recover the\ncorresponding sharp well-posedness theorems for the free boundary Euler\nequations.

This framework provides a multiscale\nrepresentation of cell migration, from single-cell dynamics to population-level\nbehaviours, as we start with a microscopic model that describes the dynamics of\nsingle cells in terms of stochastic processes. Next, we formally derive the\nmesoscopic counterpart of this model, which consists of a phenotype-structured\nkinetic equation that features a phenotype-dependent non-locality.

Previous work has proveided\nexplanations for the actions or states of agents, yet falls short in\nunderstanding the black-boxed agent's importance within a MAS and the overall\nteam strategy. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAI, a novel agent-level\nexplanation approach that evaluates the individual agent's importance. Inspired\nby counterfactual reasoning, a larger change in reward caused by the randomized\naction of agent indicates its higher importance. We model it as a MARL problem\nto capture interactions across agents. Utilizing counterfactual reasoning, EMAI\nlearns the masking agents to identify important agents. Specifically, we define\nthe optimization function to minimize the reward difference before and after\naction randomization and introduce sparsity constraints to encourage the\nexploration of more action randomization of agents during training. The\nexperimental results in seven multi-agent tasks demonstratee that EMAI achieves\nhigher fidelity in explanations than baselines and provides more effective\nguidance in practical applications concerning understanding policies, launching\nattacks, and patching policies.",

Traditional monolithic systems are bad at\nscaling and performing with high loads, causing backup resources to be\nunderutilized along with delays. To overcome the above-stated problems, we\nadopt a modularization approach in decoupling system components into\nindependent services that can grow or shrink according to demand. Our framework\nalso includes real-time predictive analytics, through machine learning models,\nthat optimize forecasting customer demand, dynamic pricing, as well as system\nperformance. With an experimental evaluation applying the approach, we could\nshow that the framework impacts metrics of performance such as response time,\nthroughput, transaction rate of success, and prediction accuracy compared to\ntheir conventional counterparts. Not only does the microservices approach\nimprove scalability and fault tolerance like a usual architecture, but it also\nbrings along timely and accurate predictions, which imply a greater customer\nsatisfaction and efficiency of operation. The integration of real-time\nanalytics would lead to more intelligent decision-making, thereby improving the\nresponse of the system along with the reliability it holds. A scalable,\nefficient framework is offered by such a system to address the modern\nchallenges imposed by any form of travel reservation system while considering\nother complex, data-driven industries as future applications.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful\napproach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge\nsources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency,\npotential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With\nthe advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended\ncontext windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented\ngeneration (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves\npreloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge\nfor retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended\ncontext and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model\nutilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional\nretrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval\nlatency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance.\nPerformance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where\nlong-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines.\nThese findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with\na constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient\nalternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced\ncomplexity.",

In this paper, we first point out\nthat the influence brought by the label deviation cannot be ignored, and\npropose a gaze label alignment algorithm (GLA) to eliminate the label\ndistribution deviation. Specifically, we first train the feature extractor on\nall domains to get domain invariant features, and then select an anchor domain\nto train the gaze regressor. We predict the gaze label on remaining domains and\nuse a mapping function to align the labels. Finally, these aligned labels can\nbe used to train gaze estimation models.

Recent efforts have focused on estimating human\nerror probability (HEP), but existing methods often rely heavily on expert\nknowledge,which can be subjective and time-consuming.

This innovative framework\nenables the semi-automated computation of base HEP values.

In this paper, we propose a semantic-level differential\nprivacy protection scheme that applies to the entire face dataset. Unlike\npixel-level differential privacy approaches, our scheme guarantees that\nsemantic privacy in faces is not compromised. The key idea is to convert\nunstructured data into structured data to enable the application of\ndifferential privacy. Specifically, we first extract semantic information from\nthe face dataset to build an attribute database, then apply differential\nperturbations to obscure this attribute data, and finally use an image\nsynthesis model to generate a protected face dataset.

The\ncellular structure is observed at a range of upstream density and envelope\ncomposition explored in the present work. C/O contamination by the WD core\nmaterial reduces the cell width rapidly, as accelerated by the {\\alpha}-capture\nreaction.

In this paper, we tackle the low social\nhomophily challenge from an innovative generative perspective, directly\ngenerating optimal user social representations that maximize consistency with\ncollaborative signals. Specifically, we propose the Score-based Generative\nModel for Social Recommendation (SGSR), which effectively adapts the Stochastic\nDifferential Equation (SDE)-based diffusion models for social recommendations.\nTo better fit the recommendation context, SGSR employs a joint curriculum\ntraining strategy to mitigate challenges related to missing supervision signals\nand leverages self-supervised learning techniques to align knowledge across\nsocial and collaborative domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in filtering redundant social\ninformation and improving recommendation performance.",

    "abstract": "Image to point cloud global localization is crucial for robot navigation in\nGNSS-denied environments and has become increasingly important for multi-robot\nmap fusion and urban asset management. The modality gap between images and\npoint clouds poses significant challenges for cross-modality fusion. Current\ncross-modality global localization solutions either require modality\nunification, which leads to information loss, or rely on engineered training\nschemes to encode multi-modality features, which often lack feature alignment\nand relation consistency. To address these limitations, we propose,\nSaliencyI2PLoc, a novel contrastive learning based architecture that fuses the\nsaliency map into feature aggregation and maintains the feature relation\nconsistency on multi-manifold spaces. To alleviate the pre-process of data\nmining, the contrastive learning framework is applied which efficiently\nachieves cross-modality feature mapping. The context saliency-guided local\nfeature aggregation module is designed, which fully leverages the contribution\nof the stationary information in the scene generating a more representative\nglobal feature. Furthermore, to enhance the cross-modality feature alignment\nduring contrastive learning, the consistency of relative relationships between\nsamples in different manifold spaces is also taken into account. Experiments\nconducted on urban and highway scenario datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\nand robustness of our method. Specifically, our method achieves a Recall@1 of\n78.92% and a Recall@20 of 97.59% on the urban scenario evaluation dataset,\nshowing an improvement of 37.35% and 18.07%, compared to the baseline method.\nThis demonstrates that our architecture efficiently fuses images and point\nclouds and represents a significant step forward in cross-modality global\nlocalization.

In this study, a specific class of near term quantum computing hardware\ndefined combinatorial optimization problems, Ising models on heavy-hex graphs\nboth with and without geometrically local cubic terms, are examined for their\nclassical computational hardness via empirical computation time scaling\nquantification. Specifically the Time-to-Solution metric using the classical\nheuristic simulated annealing is measured for finding optimal variable\nassignments (ground states), as well as the time required for the optimization\nsoftware Gurobi to find an optimal variable assignment. Because of the sparsity\nof these Ising models, the classical algorithms are able to find optimal\nsolutions efficiently even for large instances (i.e. $100,000$ variables). The\nIsing models both with and without geometrically local cubic terms exhibit\naverage-case linear-time or weakly quadratic scaling when solved exactly using\nGurobi, and the Ising models with no cubic terms show evidence of\nexponential-time Time-to-Solution scaling when sampled using simulated\nannealing.

    "abstract": "Existing continual learning (CL) methods mainly rely on fine-tuning or\nadapting large language models (LLMs). They still suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting (CF). Little work has been done to exploit in-context learning (ICL)\nto leverage the extensive knowledge within LLMs for CL without updating any\nparameters. However, incrementally learning each new task in ICL necessitates\nadding training examples from each class of the task to the prompt, which\nhampers scalability as the prompt length increases. This issue not only leads\nto excessively long prompts that exceed the input token limit of the underlying\nLLM but also degrades the model's performance due to the overextended context.\nTo address this, we introduce InCA, a novel approach that integrates an\nexternal continual learner (ECL) with ICL to enable scalable CL without CF. The\nECL is built incrementally to pre-select a small subset of likely classes for\neach test instance. By restricting the ICL prompt to only these selected\nclasses, InCA prevents prompt lengths from becoming excessively long, while\nmaintaining high performance. Experimental results demonstrate that InCA\nsignificantly outperforms existing CL baselines, achieving substantial\nperformance gains.",

We introduce Specialized Generative Primitives, a\ngenerative framework that allows non-expert users to author high-quality 3D\nscenes in a seamless, lightweight, and controllable manner. Each primitive is\nan efficient generative model that captures the distribution of a single\nexemplar from the real world. With our framework, users capture a video of an\nenvironment, which we turn into a high-quality and explicit appearance model\nthanks to 3D Gaussian Splatting. Users then select regions of interest guided\nby semantically-aware features. To create a generative primitive, we adapt\nGenerative Cellular Automata to single-exemplar training and controllable\ngeneration. We decouple the generative task from the appearance model by\noperating on sparse voxels and we recover a high-quality output with a\nsubsequent sparse patch consistency step. Each primitive can be trained within\n10 minutes and used to author new scenes interactively in a fully compositional\nmanner. We showcase interactive sessions where various primitives are extracted\nfrom real-world scenes and controlled to create 3D assets and scenes in a few\nminutes. We also demonstrate additional capabilities of our primitives:\nhandling various 3D representations to control generation, transferring\nappearances, and editing geometries.",

Specifically, we\nfocus on constructing a recognition model for music identification, where\nelectroencephalography (EEG) brain recordings collected during music listening\nserve as input.

    "abstract": "Citizen science biodiversity data present great opportunities for ecology and\nconservation across vast spatial and temporal scales. However, the\nopportunistic nature of these data lacks the sampling structure required by\nmodeling methodologies that address a pervasive challenge in ecological data\ncollection: imperfect detection, i.e., the likelihood of under-observing\nspecies on field surveys. Occupancy modeling is an example of an approach that\naccounts for imperfect detection by explicitly modeling the observation process\nseparately from the biological process of habitat selection. This produces\nspecies distribution models that speak to the pattern of the species on a\nlandscape after accounting for imperfect detection in the data, rather than the\npattern of species observations corrupted by errors. To achieve this benefit,\noccupancy models require multiple surveys of a site across which the site's\nstatus (i.e., occupied or not) is assumed constant. Since citizen science data\nare not collected under the required repeated-visit protocol, observations may\nbe grouped into sites post hoc. Existing approaches for constructing sites\ndiscard some observations and/or consider only geographic distance and not\nenvironmental similarity. In this study, we compare ten approaches for site\nconstruction in terms of their impact on downstream species distribution models\nfor 31 bird species in Oregon, using observations recorded in the eBird\ndatabase.

Recent research has\nsuccessfully introduced methods to identify unexpected behaviour in single-turn\ntesting scenarios. However, multi-turn interaction is the common real-world\nusage of dialogue systems, yet testing methods for such interactions remain\nunderexplored. This is largely due to the oracle problem in multi-turn testing,\nwhich continues to pose a significant challenge for dialogue system developers\nand researchers. In this paper, we propose MORTAR, a metamorphic multi-turn\ndialogue testing approach, which mitigates the test oracle problem in testing\nLLM-based dialogue systems. MORTAR formalises the multi-turn testing for\ndialogue systems, and automates the generation of question-answer dialogue test\ncases with multiple dialogue-level perturbations and metamorphic relations\n(MRs). The automated MR matching mechanism allows MORTAR more flexibility and\nefficiency in metamorphic testing. The proposed approach is fully automated\nwithout reliance on LLM judges. In testing six popular LLM-based dialogue\nsystems, MORTAR reaches significantly better effectiveness with over 150\\% more\nbugs revealed per test case when compared to the single-turn metamorphic\ntesting baseline. Regarding the quality of bugs, MORTAR reveals higher-quality\nbugs in terms of diversity, precision and uniqueness. MORTAR is expected to\ninspire more multi-turn testing approaches, and assist developers in evaluating\nthe dialogue system performance more comprehensively with constrained test\nresources and budget.",

Moreover, the product of neutral\nmatter operators can be found very explicitly and has a remarkably simple form.\nWhen primaries with nonzero matter R-charge are included, the trace can be\nwritten as a sum over matter vacuum expectation values associated to each\nallowed boundary R-charge $J_R$, with the terms in the sum weighted by\n$\\mathrm{cos}(\\pi J_R)$. In this way, the ground state algebras encode the\nratios of the number of BPS microstates within each R-charge sector. In\naddition to the results on super-JT gravity described above, we provide a\npurely Lorentzian derivation of the algebraic structure of canonically\nquantised (bosonic) JT gravity plus matter, without appeal to the Euclidean\ngravitational path integrals used in previous work.",

Nutrition Question\nAnswering (QA) has emerged as a popular method for addressing this problem.\nHowever, current research faces two critical limitations. On one hand, the\nabsence of datasets involving user-specific medical information severely limits\n\\textit{personalization}. This challenge is further compounded by the wide\nvariability in individual health needs. On the other hand, while large language\nmodels (LLMs), a popular solution for this task, demonstrate strong reasoning\nabilities, they struggle with the domain-specific complexities of personalized\nhealthy dietary reasoning, and existing benchmarks fail to capture these\nchallenges. To address these gaps, we introduce the Nutritional Graph Question\nAnswering (NGQA) benchmark, the first graph question answering dataset designed\nfor personalized nutritional health reasoning. NGQA leverages data from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Food and\nNutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to evaluate whether a food is\nhealthy for a specific user, supported by explanations of the key contributing\nnutrients. The benchmark incorporates three question complexity settings and\nevaluates reasoning across three downstream tasks.

To address\nthese limitations, we propose \\textbf{VLM-RL}, a unified framework that\nintegrates pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with RL to generate reward\nsignals using image observation and natural language goals. The core of VLM-RL\nis the contrasting language goal (CLG)-as-reward paradigm, which uses positive\nand negative language goals to generate semantic rewards.

Additionally, a batch-processing technique\nis employed to optimize computational efficiency during training. Extensive\nexperiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that VLM-RL outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 10.5\\% reduction in collision rate, a\n104.6\\% increase in route completion rate, and robust generalization to unseen\ndriving scenarios.

Existing generative methods for CD data synthesis show\ncompetitive potential in addressing this issue but still face the following\nlimitations: 1) difficulty in flexibly controlling change events, 2) dependence\non additional data to train the data generators, 3) focus on specific change\ndetection tasks. To this end, this paper focuses on the semantic CD (SCD) task\nand develops a multi-temporal SCD data generator ChangeDiff by exploring\npowerful diffusion models. ChangeDiff innovatively generates change data in two\nsteps: first, it uses text prompts and a text-to-layout (T2L) model to create\ncontinuous layouts, and then it employs layout-to-image (L2I) to convert these\nlayouts into images. Specifically, we propose multi-class distribution-guided\ntext prompts (MCDG-TP), allowing for layouts to be generated flexibly through\ncontrollable classes and their corresponding ratios. Subsequently, to\ngeneralize the T2L model to the proposed MCDG-TP, a class distribution\nrefinement loss is further designed as training supervision. %For the former, a\nmulti-classdistribution-guided text prompt (MCDG-TP) is proposed to complement\nvia controllable classes and ratios. To generalize the text-to-image diffusion\nmodel to the proposed MCDG-TP, a class distribution refinement loss is designed\nas training supervision.

Secondly, we\nutilize an embedded TSP solver to obtain sub-results, followed by graph fusion.\nFinally, we implement a decoding strategy customizable to the user's\nrequirements, resulting in high-quality solutions, complemented by a warming-up\nprocess for the heatmap. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we\nintegrate two representative TSP solvers into our framework and conduct a\ncomprehensive comparative analysis against existing algorithms using large TSP\nbenchmark datasets. The results unequivocally demonstrate that our framework\nefficiently scales existing TSP solvers to handle large instances and\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, since\nour proposed framework does not necessitate additional training or fine-tuning,\nwe believe that its generality can significantly advance research on end-to-end\nUAVRP solvers, enabling the application of a broader range of methods to\nreal-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Split Federated Learning (SFL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm\nthat combines federated learning and split learning. In SFL, a neural network\nis partitioned at a cut layer, with the initial layers deployed on clients and\nremaining layers on a training server. There are two main variants of SFL:\nSFL-V1 where the training server maintains separate server-side models for each\nclient, and SFL-V2 where the training server maintains a single shared model\nfor all clients. While existing studies have focused on algorithm development\nfor SFL, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of how the cut layer selection\naffects model performance remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by\nproviding numerical and theoretical analysis of SFL performance and convergence\nrelative to cut layer selection. We find that SFL-V1 is relatively invariant to\nthe choice of cut layer, which is consistent with our theoretical results.\nNumerical experiments on four datasets and two neural networks show that the\ncut layer selection significantly affects the performance of SFL-V2. Moreover,\nSFL-V2 with an appropriate cut layer selection outperforms FedAvg on\nheterogeneous data.",

SORREL selectively learns from suboptimal demonstrations based on value\nestimation. It utilizes suboptimal demonstrations through both offline\nreinforcement learning on the demonstrations generated by suboptimal heuristics\nand self-imitation learning on past good experiences sampled by itself.

In high-dimensional settings,\nSIR can be combined with sparsity penalties to achieve sufficient dimension\nreduction and variable selection simultaneously. Nevertheless, both classical\nand sparse estimators assume the covariates are exogenous. However, endogeneity\ncan arise in a variety of situations, such as when variables are omitted or are\nmeasured with error. In this article, we show such endogeneity invalidates SIR\nestimators, leading to inconsistent estimation of the true central subspace. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a two-stage Lasso SIR estimator, which first\nconstructs a sparse high-dimensional instrumental variables model to obtain\nfitted values of the covariates spanned by the instruments, and then applies\nSIR augmented with a Lasso penalty on these fitted values. We establish\ntheoretical bounds for the estimation and selection consistency of the true\ncentral subspace for the proposed estimators, allowing the number of covariates\nand instruments to grow exponentially with the sample size. Simulation studies\nand applications to two real-world datasets in nutrition and genetics\nillustrate the superior empirical performance of the two-stage Lasso SIR\nestimator compared with existing methods that disregard endogeneity and/or\nnonlinearity in the outcome model.",

We examine\nneutron star (NS)-BH binaries where the NS forms first (labeled NSBH), as the\nNS must be able to spin-up to MSP rotation periods before the BH forms in these\nsystems. We find that NSBHs are very rare and have a birth rate < 1 Myr$^{-1}$\nfor a Milky Way-like galaxy in our typical models. The NSBH birth rate is 2-3\norders of magnitude smaller than that for NS-BHs where the BH forms first\n(labeled BHNS). These rates are also sensitive to model assumptions about the\nsupernova (SN) remnant masses, natal kicks, and common-envelope efficiency. We\nfind that 100% of NSBHs undergo a mass ratio reversal before the first SN and\nup to 64% of NSBHs undergo a double common envelope phase after the mass ratio\nreversal occurs. Most importantly, no NSBH binaries in our populations undergo\na mass transfer phase, either stable or unstable, after the first SN.

The primary challenges in\nhandling graph streams include the impracticality of fully storing the\never-growing datasets and the complexity of supporting graph queries that\ninvolve both topological and temporal information. Recent advancements, such as\nPGSS and Horae, address these limitations by using domain-based, top-down\nmulti-layer structures in the form of compressed matrices. However, they either\nsuffer from poor query accuracy, incur substantial space overheads, or have low\nquery efficiency.\n  This study proposes a novel item-based, bottom-up hierarchical structure,\ncalled HIGGS.

HIGGS offers tighter theoretical bounds on query\naccuracy and space cost. Extensive empirical studies on real graph streams\ndemonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, HIGGS is capable of\nnotable performance enhancements: it can improve accuracy by over 3 orders of\nmagnitude, reduce space overhead by an average of 30%, increase throughput by\nmore than 5 times, and decrease query latency by nearly 2 orders of magnitude.",

Our previous works developed the Multimodal Intrinsic\nSpeckle-Tracking (MIST) algorithm, which is suitable for multimodal image\nretrieval from speckle-based X-ray imaging (SBXI) data. MIST is based on the\nX-ray Fokker-Planck equation, requiring the inversion of derivative operators\nthat are often numerically unstable.

The\nregularization output is highly sensitive to the choice of the Tikhonov\nregularization parameter, making it crucial to select this value carefully and\noptimally. Here, we present an automated iterative algorithm to optimize the\nregularization of the inverse Laplacian operator in our most recently published\nMIST variant, addressing the operator's instability near the Fourier-space\norigin. Our algorithm leverages the inherent stability of the phase solution\nobtained from the transport-of-intensity equation for SBXI, using it as a\nreliable ground truth for the more complex Fokker-Planck-based algorithms that\nincorporate the dark-field signal. We applied the algorithm to an SBXI dataset\ncollected using synchrotron light of a four-rod sample.

Although current model retrieval solutions attempt to\nconvert neural network models into vectors to avoid complex multiple inference\nprocesses required for model selection, it is still difficult to choose a\nsuitable model due to inaccurate vectorization and biased correlation alignment\nbetween the query dataset and models. From the perspective of knowledge\nconsistency, i.e., whether the knowledge possessed by the model can meet the\nneeds of query tasks, we propose a model retrieval scheme, named Know2Vec, that\nacts as a black-box retrieval proxy for model zoo.

    "abstract": "Efficient training of large-scale heterogeneous graphs is of paramount\nimportance in real-world applications. However, existing approaches typically\nexplore simplified models to mitigate resource and time overhead, neglecting\nthe crucial aspect of simplifying large-scale heterogeneous graphs from the\ndata-centric perspective. Addressing this gap, HGCond introduces graph\ncondensation (GC) in heterogeneous graphs and generates a small condensed graph\nfor efficient model training. Despite its efficacy in graph generation, HGCond\nencounters two significant limitations. The first is low effectiveness, HGCond\nexcessively relies on the simplest relay model for the condensation procedure,\nwhich restricts the ability to exert powerful Heterogeneous Graph Neural\nNetworks (HGNNs) with flexible condensation ratio and limits the generalization\nability. The second is low efficiency, HGCond follows the existing GC methods\ndesigned for homogeneous graphs and leverages the sophisticated optimization\nparadigm, resulting in a time-consuming condensing procedure. In light of these\nchallenges, we present the first Training \\underline{Free} Heterogeneous Graph\nCondensation method, termed FreeHGC, facilitating both efficient and\nhigh-quality generation of heterogeneous condensed graphs. Specifically, we\nreformulate the heterogeneous graph condensation problem as a data selection\nissue, offering a new perspective for assessing and condensing representative\nnodes and edges in the heterogeneous graphs. By leveraging rich meta-paths, we\nintroduce a new, high-quality heterogeneous data selection criterion to select\ntarget-type nodes. Furthermore, two training-free condensation strategies for\nheterogeneous graphs are designed to condense and synthesize other-types nodes\neffectively.",

Through a series of simulations across four\ndistinct intersections, the relationship between traffic flow characteristics\nwere analyzed. The RV penetration rates were varied from 0% to 100% in\nincrements of 25%. The study reveals that while the presence of RVs influences\ntraffic dynamics, the impact on flow and speed is not uniform across different\nlevels of RV penetration. The fundamental diagrams indicate that intersections\nmay experience an increase in capacity with varying levels of RVs, but this\ntrend does not consistently hold as RV penetration approaches 100%. The\nvariability observed across intersections suggests that local factors possibly\ninfluence the traffic flow characteristics. These findings highlight the\ncomplexity of integrating RVs into the existing traffic system and underscore\nthe need for intersection-specific traffic management strategies to accommodate\nthe transition towards increased RV presence.",

We formulate the\nrequirement of rotational symmetry by the use of a symmetrizer, and we use this\nsymmetrizer to guide the diffusion process towards symmetric wheel generations.\nOur experimental results find that the proposed approach makes generated\ninterpolations with higher realism than methods in related work, as evaluated\nby Fr\\'echet inception distance (FID).

First, considering sine function to describe the 18.8years-long\nlight curves from the CSS, ASAS-SN and ZTF, 550days periodicity can be\nconfirmed with confidence level higher than 5$\\sigma$. Second, the stable\n550days optical QPOs can be re-confirmed with confidence levels higher than\n5$\\sigma$ by the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the sine-like\nphase-folded light curves and the WWZ technique determined power maps. Third,\nbased on simulated light curves by CAR process, confidence level higher than\n$3.5\\sigma$ can be confirmed for the optical QPOs not related to intrinsic AGN\nvariability. Moreover, considering spatial separation of central two BH\naccreting systems smaller than expected sizes of broad emission line regions\n(BLRs), central total BH mass higher than $10^6{\\rm M_\\odot}$ could lead to few\neffects of supposed BBH systems on estimated virial BH masses. Meanwhile, disk\nprecession is not preferred due to the similar estimated sizes of optical and\nNUV emission regions, and jet precession can be ruled out due to PG 1411+442 as\na radio quiet quasar. The results strongly indicate it would be practicable by\napplying very different line profiles of broad Balmer emission lines to detect\ncandidates of BBH systems in normal broad line AGN in the near future.",

Considering its impact on social environments,\nthis paper introduces a previously ignored but significant threat to hateful\nmeme detection: backdoor attacks. By injecting specific triggers into meme\nsamples, backdoor attackers can manipulate the detector to output their desired\noutcomes. To explore this, we propose the Meme Trojan framework to initiate\nbackdoor attacks on hateful meme detection. Meme Trojan involves creating a\nnovel Cross-Modal Trigger (CMT) and a learnable trigger augmentor to enhance\nthe trigger pattern according to each input sample. Due to the cross-modal\nproperty, the proposed CMT can effectively initiate backdoor attacks on hateful\nmeme detectors under an automatic application scenario. Additionally, the\ninjection position and size of our triggers are adaptive to the texts contained\nin the meme, which ensures that the trigger is seamlessly integrated with the\nmeme content. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art backdoor attack\nmethods, showing significant improvements in effectiveness and stealthiness.

    "abstract": "A significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative\ngravitational entropy was recently achieved by a series of works showing that a\nproper accounting of gauge invariance and observer degrees of freedom converts\nthe Type III algebra of QFT observables in a gravitational subregion to a Type\nII crossed product, whose entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in\na semiclassical limit. The observers thus used are also known as quantum\nreference frames (QRFs); as noted in our companion work [arXiv:2405.00114],\nusing different QRFs result in different algebras, and hence different\nentropies -- so gravitational entropy is observer-dependent. Here, we provide\nan in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, with full derivations of many new\nresults. Using the perspective-neutral QRF formalism, we extend previous\nconstructions to allow for arbitrarily many observers, each carrying a clock\nwith possibly degenerate energy spectra. We consider a semiclassical regime\ncharacterized by clocks whose energy fluctuations dominate over the\nfluctuations of the energy of the QFT. Unlike previous works, we allow the\nclocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. At leading order the von Neumann\nentropy still reduces to the generalized entropy, but linear corrections are\ntypically non-vanishing and quantify the degree of entanglement between the\nclocks and fields. We also describe an `antisemiclassical' regime as the\nopposite of the semiclassical one, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock\nenergy; in this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced'\nout when evaluating the entropy. Four explicit examples of observer-dependent\nentropy are then given, involving a gravitational interferometer, degenerate\nclock superselection, a semiclassical approximation applying to some clocks but\nnot others, and differences between monotonic and periodic clocks.",

We propose a multilingual model\nleveraging transformer architectures like mBERT, XML-R, and mT5 to detect\nsuicidal text across posts in six languages - Spanish, English, German,\nCatalan, Portuguese and Italian. A Spanish suicide ideation tweet dataset was\ntranslated into five other languages using SeamlessM4T. Each model was\nfine-tuned on this multilingual data and evaluated across classification\nmetrics. Results showed mT5 achieving the best performance overall with F1\nscores above 85%, highlighting capabilities for cross-lingual transfer\nlearning. The English and Spanish translations also displayed high quality\nbased on perplexity. Our exploration underscores the importance of considering\nlinguistic diversity in developing automated multilingual tools to identify\nsuicidal risk. Limitations exist around semantic fidelity in translations and\nethical implications which provide guidance for future human-in-the-loop\nevaluations.",

The majority of new tasks,\ndatasets, language models and other resources focus on English and on suicide\nin the context of Western culture. However, suicide is global issue and\nreducing suicide rate by 2030 is one of the key goals of the UN's Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals. Previous work has used English dictionaries related to\nsuicide to translate into different target languages due to lack of other\navailable resources.

In this work, we introduce the\n'Lexicography Saves Lives Project' to address this issue and make three\ndistinct contributions. First, we outline ethical consideration and provide\noverview guidelines to mitigate harm in developing suicide-related resources.\nNext, we translate an existing dictionary related to suicidal ideation into 200\ndifferent languages and conduct human evaluations on a subset of translated\ndictionaries.

    "abstract": "Despite the growing popularity of graph attention mechanisms, their\ntheoretical understanding remains limited. This paper aims to explore the\nconditions under which these mechanisms are effective in node classification\ntasks through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Models (CSBMs). Our\ntheoretical analysis reveals that incorporating graph attention mechanisms is\n\\emph{not universally beneficial}. Specifically, by appropriately defining\n\\emph{structure noise} and \\emph{feature noise} in graphs, we show that graph\nattention mechanisms can enhance classification performance when structure\nnoise exceeds feature noise. Conversely, when feature noise predominates,\nsimpler graph convolution operations are more effective. Furthermore, we\nexamine the over-smoothing phenomenon and show that, in the high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, graph convolutional networks suffer from\nover-smoothing, whereas graph attention mechanisms can effectively resolve this\nissue. Building on these insights, we propose a novel multi-layer Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) architecture that significantly outperforms\nsingle-layer GATs in achieving \\emph{perfect node classification} in CSBMs,\nrelaxing the SNR requirement from $ \\omega(\\sqrt{\\log n}) $ to $\n\\omega(\\sqrt{\\log n} / \\sqrt[3]{n}) $. To our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to delineate the conditions for perfect node classification using\nmulti-layer GATs.

SSB is generally thought to\noccur only in the thermodynamic limit $N\\to \\infty$ (for $N$ degrees of\nfreedom). In this limit, the time to restore the symmetry once the field is\nturned off, either via thermal or quantum fluctuations, is expected to diverge.\nHere we show that SSB can also be observed in \\emph{finite-size} quantum spin\nsystems, provided that three conditions are met: 1) the ground state of the\nsystem has long-range correlations; 2) the Hamiltonian conserves the (spin)\nparity of the order parameter; and 3) $N$ is odd. Using a combination of\nanalytical arguments and numerical results (based on time-dependent variational\nMonte Carlo and rotor+spin-wave theory), we show that SSB on finite-size\nsystems can be achieved via a quasi-adiabatic preparation of the ground state\n-- which, in U(1)-symmetric systems, is shown to require a symmetry breaking\nfield vanishing over time scales $\\tau \\sim O(N)$.

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D generative domain adaptation has emerged to adapt the\npre-trained generator to other domains without collecting massive datasets and\ncamera pose distributions. Typically, they leverage large-scale pre-trained\ntext-to-image diffusion models to synthesize images for the target domain and\nthen fine-tune the 3D model. However, they suffer from the tedious pipeline of\ndata generation, which inevitably introduces pose bias between the source\ndomain and synthetic dataset. Furthermore, they are not generalized to support\none-shot image-guided domain adaptation, which is more challenging due to the\nmore severe pose bias and additional identity bias introduced by the single\nimage reference. To address these issues, we propose GCA-3D, a generalized and\nconsistent 3D domain adaptation method without the intricate pipeline of data\ngeneration. Different from previous pipeline methods, we introduce multi-modal\ndepth-aware score distillation sampling loss to efficiently adapt 3D generative\nmodels in a non-adversarial manner. This multi-modal loss enables GCA-3D in\nboth text prompt and one-shot image prompt adaptation. Besides, it leverages\nper-instance depth maps from the volume rendering module to mitigate the\noverfitting problem and retain the diversity of results. To enhance the pose\nand identity consistency, we further propose a hierarchical spatial consistency\nloss to align the spatial structure between the generated images in the source\nand target domain. Experiments demonstrate that GCA-3D outperforms previous\nmethods in terms of efficiency, generalization, pose accuracy, and identity\nconsistency.",

Specifically, we apply Q-learning to UG, where each player\nis assigned two Q-tables to guide decisions for the roles of proposer and\nresponder. In a two-player scenario, fairness emerges prominently when both\nexperiences and future rewards are appreciated. In particular, the probability\nof successful deals increases with higher offers, which aligns with\nobservations in behavioral experiments.

However, what if we are given not one but multiple graphs\nthat are unaligned and of different sizes? How can we find out if these graphs\nshare blocks with similar connectivity structures? In this paper, we propose\nthe shared stochastic block modeling (SSBM) problem, in which we model $n$\ngraphs using SBMs that share parameters of $s$ blocks. We show that fitting an\nSSBM is NP-hard, and consider two approaches to fit good models in practice. In\nthe first, we directly maximize the likelihood of the shared model using a\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In the second, we first fit an SBM for each\ngraph and then select which blocks to share. We propose an integer linear\nprogram to find the optimal shared blocks and to scale to large numbers of\nblocks, we propose a fast greedy algorithm.

    "abstract": "We analyze the computational complexity of several popular video games\nreleased for the Nintendo Game Boy video game console. We analyze the\ncomplexity of generalized versions of four popular Game Boy games: Donkey Kong,\nWario Land, Harvest Moon GB, and Mole Mania. We provide original proofs showing\nthat these games are \\textbf{NP}-hard. Our proofs rely on Karp reductions from\nfour of Karp's original 21 \\textbf{NP}-complete problems: \\textsc{Sat},\n\\textsc{3-Cnf-Sat}, \\textsc{Hamiltonian Cycle}, and \\textsc{Knapsack}. We also\ndiscuss proofs easily derived from known results demonstrating the\n\\textbf{NP}-hardness of Lock `n' Chase and The Lion King.",

    "abstract": "In today's data-driven world, algorithms operating with vertically\ndistributed datasets are crucial due to the increasing prevalence of\nlarge-scale, decentralized data storage. These algorithms enhance data privacy\nby processing data locally, reducing the need for data transfer and minimizing\nexposure to breaches. They also improve scalability, as they can handle vast\namounts of data spread across multiple locations without requiring centralized\naccess. Top-k queries have been studied extensively under this lens, and are\nparticularly suitable in applications involving healthcare, finance, and IoT,\nwhere data is often sensitive and distributed across various sources. Classical\ntop-k algorithms are based on the availability of two kinds of access to\nsources: sorted access, i.e., a sequential scan in the internal sort order, one\ntuple at a time, of the dataset; random access, which provides all the\ninformation available at a data source for a tuple whose id is known. However,\nin scenarios where data retrieval costs are high or data is streamed in\nreal-time or, simply, data are from external sources that only offer sorted\naccess, random access may become impractical or impossible, due to latency\nissues or data access constraints. Fortunately, a long tradition of algorithms\ndesigned for the \"no random access\" (NRA) scenario exists for classical top-k\nqueries. Yet, these do not cover the recent advances in ranking queries,\nproposing hybridizations of top-k queries (which are preference-aware and\ncontrol the output size) and skyline queries (which are preference-agnostic and\nhave uncontrolled output size). The non-dominated flexible skyline (ND) is one\nsuch proposal. We introduce an algorithm for computing ND in the NRA scenario,\nprove its correctness and optimality within its class, and provide an\nexperimental evaluation covering a wide range of cases, with both synthetic and\nreal datasets.",

    "abstract": "Combining multiple machine learning models has long been a technique for\nenhancing performance, particularly in distributed settings. Traditional\napproaches, such as model ensembles, work well, but are expensive in terms of\nmemory and compute. Recently, methods based on averaging model parameters have\nachieved good results in some settings and have gained popularity. However,\nmerging models initialized differently that do not share a part of their\ntraining trajectories can yield worse results than simply using the base\nmodels, even after aligning their neurons. In this paper, we introduce a novel\napproach, Non-uniform Parameter-wise Model Merging, or NP Merge, which merges\nmodels by learning the contribution of each parameter to the final model using\ngradient-based optimization. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method for merging models of various architectures in multiple settings,\noutperforming past methods. We also extend NP Merge to handle the merging of\nmultiple models, showcasing its scalability and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Sparse dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful approach to extract\nsemantically meaningful concepts from the internals of large language models\n(LLMs) trained mainly in the text domain. In this work, we explore whether DL\ncan extract meaningful concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data,\nsuch as vision foundation models trained on cell microscopy images, where\nlimited prior knowledge exists about which high-level concepts should arise. We\npropose a novel combination of a sparse DL algorithm, Iterative Codebook\nFeature Learning (ICFL), with a PCA whitening pre-processing step derived from\ncontrol data. Using this combined approach, we successfully retrieve\nbiologically meaningful concepts, such as cell types and genetic perturbations.\nMoreover, we demonstrate how our method reveals subtle morphological changes\narising from human-interpretable interventions, offering a promising new\ndirection for scientific discovery via mechanistic interpretability in\nbioimaging.",
