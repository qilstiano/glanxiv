To meet the critical Quality of\nService (QoS) requirements such as reduced latency, efficient bandwidth usage,\nswift reaction times, scalability, privacy, and security serverless edge\ncomputing has emerged as a transformative paradigm. This systematic literature\nreview explores the current landscape of serverless edge computing, analyzing\nrecent studies to uncover the present state of this technology. The review\nidentifies the essential features of serverless edge computing, focusing on\narchitectural designs, QoS metrics, implementation specifics, practical\napplications, and communication modalities central to this paradigm.\nFurthermore, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes existing\nresearch efforts, providing a comparative analysis based on these\nclassifications.

Here we investigate\nthe same problem in the time domain, with the ultimate purpose of improving the\nnumerical renormalization-group method. We focus our study on the time\ndependence of the photoemission current $\\mathcal{F}(t)$, a fidelity, in the\nterminology of quantum information. To establish benchmarks, we first calculate\n$\\mathcal{F}(t)$ analytically and numerically for a tight-binding model.\nAnalytically, we derive an approximate expression that becomes very precise at\nlarge times. Numerically, we diagonalize the tight-binding Hamiltonian and\ncompute $\\mathcal{F}(t)$ from its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, a\nstraightforward procedure that covers the segment of the $t$ axis in which the\nanalytical expression is less accurate. The time dependence shows features of\nphysical interest that have received little attention because they are\ninconspicuous in the frequency domain; the analytical expression provides a\nsimple interpretation and traces them to an unusual form of interference. We\nthen turn to eNRG, a recently proposed real-space variant that is more flexible\nthan Wilson's NRG method, and present two complementary time-dependent\nalgorithms. Comparison with the benchmarks shows that one of the eNRG\nalgorithms yields virtually exact photocurrents with a small fraction of the\ncomputational effort to diagonalize the tight-binding Hamiltonian. The second\nalgorithm is computationally less demanding and produces precise results at\nlong times.

We investigate the time\nevolution of x-ray photoemission in metals, which displays a strongly\nout-of-equilibrium character, continuum energy spectrum, and experiences the\nAnderson orthogonality catastrophe: a nightmarish scenario for this type of\ntest. Our results show that the metrics-based methods remains valid. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that the natural local density distance is able not\nonly to track adiabaticity, but also to provide information not captured by the\ncorresponding Bures' or trace distances about the system's dynamics. In the\nprocess, we establish an explicit upper limit for this local density distance\nin terms of the trace distance, and derive a simple analytical solution that\naccurately describes the time evolution of a Fermi gas with a localized\nscattering potential for a large range of parameters. We also demonstrate that,\nfor x-ray photoemission, the quantum adiabatic criterion, as commonly used,\nfails to predict and track adiabaticity.

The angle of attack is varied between $-5^\\circ \\le \\alpha \\le\n10^\\circ$, and $Re$ (based on the free-stream velocity and the airfoil chord)\nis increased up to $Re=6000$. The study relies on linear stability analyses and\nthree-dimensional (3D) nonlinear direct numerical simulations. For all $\\alpha$\nthe primary instability consists of a Hopf bifurcation towards a periodic\nregime. The linear stability analysis reveals that two distinct modes drive the\nflow bifurcation for positive and negative $\\alpha$, being characterised by a\ndifferent frequency and a distinct triggering mechanism. The critical $Re$\ndecreases as $|\\alpha|$ increases, and scales as a power law for large\npositive/negative $\\alpha$. At intermediate $Re$, different limit cycles arise\ndepending on $\\alpha$, each one characterised by a distinctive vortex\ninteraction, leading thus to secondary instabilities of different nature. For\nintermediate positive/negative $\\alpha$ vortices are shed from both the\ntop/bottom leading- and trailing-edge shear layers, and the two phenomena are\nfrequency locked. By means of Floquet stability analysis, we show that the\nsecondary instability consists of a 2D subharmonic bifurcation for large\nnegative $\\alpha$, of a 2D Neimark--Sacker bifurcation for small negative\n$\\alpha$, of a 3D pitchfork bifurcation for small positive $\\alpha$, and of a\n3D subharmonic bifurcation for large positive $\\alpha$.

Despite continual learning advances focusing on which examples to\nstore and how to incorporate them into the training loss, most approaches\nassume that sampling from this buffer is uniform by default.\n  We challenge the assumption that uniform sampling is necessarily optimal. We\nconduct an experiment in which the memory buffer updates the same way in every\ntrial, but the replay probability of each stored sample changes between trials\nbased on different random weight distributions. Specifically, we generate 50\ndifferent non-uniform sampling probability weights for each trial and compare\ntheir final accuracy to the uniform sampling baseline. We find that there is\nalways at least one distribution that significantly outperforms the baseline\nacross multiple buffer sizes, models, and datasets. These results suggest that\nmore principled adaptive replay policies could yield further gains. We discuss\nhow exploiting this insight could inspire new research on non-uniform memory\nsampling in continual learning to better mitigate catastrophic forgetting.\n  The code supporting this study is available at\n$\\href{https://github.com/DentonJC/memory-sampling}{https://github.com/DentonJC/memory-sampling}$.",

Key grassroots\nplatforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and\ngrassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were\ndefined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition\nsystems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However,\ngrassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions\ncarried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed\nby unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and\nproofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.\n  We enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic\ntransactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new\nfoundation; present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using\natomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social\nnetworks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming,\njoining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations; prove\na general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are\nso-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to\nspecify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms\nthus specified are indeed grassroots.

The former is characterized by entrained air packets and\nbubbles, while entrapped air corresponds to air transported along wave peaks\nand troughs. Entrapped air was first measured by Killen (1968) using a\nso-called dipping probe, while a physical interpretation of the dipping probe\nsignals was provided only later by Wilhelms and Gulliver (2005).\n  Since then, it has been commonly accepted that two different measurement\ninstruments, for example a dipping probe and a common phase-detection probe,\nare required to fully quantify entrained and entrapped air. Recently, an\narticle entitled \"Resurrecting a Neglected Measurement Technique for Air-Water\nFlows\" was published by Wilhelms and Gulliver (2024), who re-iterated the\nimportance of applying these concepts for cavitation prevention and air-water\ngas transfer, as well as the need for two separate measurement instruments. The\nauthors are congratulated for their seminal works on entrained and entrapped\nair (Wilhelms and Gulliver 2005; Wilhelms and Gulliver 2024), and it is\nstipulated that these concepts have been overlooked in the last two decades.\n  In this discussion, a simple discrimination technique for phase-detection\nprobe signals is proposed, which allows to differentiate entrained and\nentrapped air from existing datasets, recorded with a state-of-the-art dual-tip\nphase-detection probe. It is believed that this novel signal processing method\nwill make Killen's (1968) dipping probe redundant, and that it will be useful\nfor the validation of non-intrusive measurements of entrapped air, as well as\nfor the development of physics-based models for air-water mass transfer in\nself-aerated flows.",

This approach is defined for logics involving reasoning with\nmaximal consistent subsets and shows how any such logic can be translated to\nargumentation. Our work provides dialogue models as dialectic-proof procedures\nto compute and explain a query answer wrt inconsistency-tolerant semantics.\nThis allows us to construct dialectical proof trees as explanations, which are\nmore expressive and arguably more intuitive than existing explanation\nformalisms.",

However, these methods can introduce\na problem known as multi-modal position ambiguity, making it challenging to\nselect the exact mode in which the receiver is located. Accurately selecting\nthe correct mode is essential for improving positioning accuracy. A previous\nstudy proposed a method that uses satellite-pseudorange consistency (SPC),\ncalculated from pseudorange measurements, to select the mode containing the\nreceiver. This method achieved a mode selection accuracy of approximately 78%.\nTo further enhance accuracy, the study utilized pseudorange measurements\ncollected at multiple timesteps from a fixed location and a trained\nline-of-sight (LOS) classifier. However, in practice, collecting data at\nmultiple timesteps from the same location in dynamic environments is\nchallenging. Moreover, the performance of the trained LOS classifier heavily\ndepends on the surrounding environment, leading to low reliability. In this\nstudy, we propose a method that estimates and corrects multipath errors based\non the mode distribution obtained from the output of ZSM and extract an\nenhanced SPC using the corrected pseudorange measurements.

    "abstract": "Mental health care-seeking among marginalized young adults has received\nlimited attention in CSCW research. Through in-depth interviews and visual\nelicitation methods with 18 diverse U.S. participants, our study reveals how\nmarginalized identities shape mental health care-seeking journeys, often\ncharacterized by low aspirations and passive care-seeking influenced by lived\nexperiences of marginalization. However, we found the transformative function\nof \"care encounters\" - serendipitous interactions with mental health resources\nthat occur when individuals are not actively seeking support. These encounters\nserve as critical turning points, catalyzing shifts in aspiration and enabling\nmore proactive care-seeking behaviors. Our analysis identifies both the\ninfrastructural conditions that enable transformative care encounters and the\naspiration breakdowns that impede care-seeking processes. This work makes\nconceptual contributions by supplementing traditional motivation-based\ncare-seeking models with a reconceptualization of \"care encounters\" that\naccounts for the infrastructural and serendipitous nature of mental health\naccess. We advance understanding of how marginalized identity uniquely\ninfluences care-seeking behaviors while providing actionable design\nimplications for embedding technology-mediated \"care encounters\" into\nsocio-technical interventions that can better support mental health care access\nfor vulnerable populations.",

Under baseline scenarios with proportional wealth-based\nallocation, one-year interest rates rise to 10-16% compared to approximately 3%\nwithout strategic competition.

    "abstract": "Preparing high-quality datasets required by various data-driven AI and\nmachine learning models has become a cornerstone task in data-driven analysis.\nConventional data discovery methods typically integrate datasets towards a\nsingle pre-defined quality measure that may lead to bias for downstream tasks.\nThis paper introduces MODis, a framework that discovers datasets by optimizing\nmultiple user-defined, model-performance measures. Given a set of data sources\nand a model, MODis selects and integrates data sources into a skyline dataset,\nover which the model is expected to have the desired performance in all the\nperformance measures. We formulate MODis as a multi-goal finite state\ntransducer, and derive three feasible algorithms to generate skyline datasets.\nOur first algorithm adopts a \"reduce-from-universal\" strategy, that starts with\na universal schema and iteratively prunes unpromising data. Our second\nalgorithm further reduces the cost with a bi-directional strategy that\ninterleaves data augmentation and reduction. We also introduce a\ndiversification algorithm to mitigate the bias in skyline datasets. We\nexperimentally verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our skyline data\ndiscovery algorithms, and showcase their applications in optimizing data\nscience pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on learning policies solely from\na batch of previously collected data. offering the potential to leverage such\ndatasets effectively without the need for costly or risky active exploration.\nWhile recent advances in Offline Multi-Agent RL (MARL) have shown promise, most\nexisting methods either rely on large datasets jointly collected by all agents\nor agent-specific datasets collected independently. The former approach ensures\nstrong performance but raises scalability concerns, while the latter emphasizes\nscalability at the expense of performance guarantees. In this work, we propose\na novel scalable routine for both dataset collection and offline learning.\nAgents first collect diverse datasets coherently with a pre-specified\ninformation-sharing network and subsequently learn coherent localized policies\nwithout requiring either full observability or falling back to complete\ndecentralization. We theoretically demonstrate that this structured approach\nallows a multi-agent extension of the seminal Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI)\nalgorithm to globally converge, in high probability, to near-optimal policies.\nThe convergence is subject to error terms that depend on the informativeness of\nthe shared information. Furthermore, we show how this approach allows to bound\nthe inherent error of the supervised-learning phase of FQI with the mutual\ninformation between shared and unshared information. Our algorithm, SCAlable\nMulti-agent FQI (SCAM-FQI), is then evaluated on a distributed decision-making\nproblem.

We introduce the idea of\nstability information in the optimization process of conditional DIP, enabling\nthe identification of unstable regions within the network's optimization\ntrajectory. Our method incorporates a stability map, which is derived from\nmultiple intermediate outputs of moderate network at different optimization\nsteps.

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in recent years, the potential of information theory (IT) to\nenhance LLM development remains underexplored. This paper introduces the\ninformation theoretic principle of Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) to LLM\nfine-tuning for classification tasks, exploring its promise in two main ways:\nminimizing CMI to improve a model's standalone performance and maximizing CMI\nto enhance knowledge distillation (KD) for more capable student models. To\napply CMI in LLM fine-tuning, we adapt the recently proposed CMI-constrained\ndeep learning framework, which was initially developed for image\nclassification, with some modification. By minimizing CMI during LLM\nfine-tuning, we achieve superior performance gains on 6 of 8 GLUE\nclassification tasks compared to BERT. Additionally, maximizing CMI during the\nKD process results in significant performance improvements in 6 of 8 GLUE\nclassification tasks compared to DistilBERT. These findings demonstrate CMI's\nadaptability for optimizing both standalone LLMs and student models, showcasing\nits potential as a robust framework for advancing LLM fine-tuning.

Our approach directly\nmodels the edge dependency of count data by the pairwise dependence of latent\nerrors, which are assumed to be weakly exchangeable. This assumption not only\ncovers a variety of common network effects, but also leads to a concise\nrepresentation of the error covariance. In addition, the identification and\ninference of the mean structure, as well as the regression coefficients, depend\non the errors only through their covariance.

Surface codes are efficient for Clifford gates but require magic\nstate distillation protocols to process non-Clifford gates, such as T gates,\nessential for universal quantum computation. In large-scale quantum\narchitectures capable of correcting arbitrary circuits, specialized surface\ncodes for data qubits and distinct codes for magic state distillation are\nneeded. These architectures can be organized into data blocks and distillation\nblocks. The system works by having distillation blocks produce magic states and\ndata blocks consume them, causing stalls due to either a shortage or excess of\nmagic states. This bottleneck presents an opportunity to optimize quantum space\nby balancing data and distillation blocks. While prior research offers insights\ninto selecting distillation protocols and estimating qubit requirements, it\nlacks a tailored optimization approach. We present a framework for optimizing\nlarge-scale quantum architectures, focusing on data block layouts and magic\nstate distillation protocols. We evaluate three data block layouts and four\ndistillation protocols under three optimization strategies: minimizing tiles,\nminimizing steps, and achieving a balanced trade-off. Through a comparative\nanalysis of brute force, dynamic programming, greedy, and random algorithms, we\nfind that brute force delivers optimal results, while greedy deviates by 7% for\nminimizing steps and dynamic programming matches brute force in tile\nminimization. We observe that total steps increase with columns, while total\ntiles scale with qubits. Finally, we propose a heuristic to help users select\nalgorithms suited to their objectives, enabling scalable and efficient quantum\narchitectures.",

Standard systems relying\npredominantly on explicit textual cues often overlook harmful content\ncamouflaged by irony, symbolism, or cultural references.

By encoding crucial task information into a learnable cognitive shift\nvector, MemeSense effectively balances lexical, visual, and ethical\nconsiderations, enabling precise yet context-aware meme intervention.

These states combine the\nadvantages of bright intravalley excitons, where the valley index directly\ncouples to light polarization, and dark intervalley excitons, characterized by\nlow depolarization rates. We demonstrate that the hybridized state of dark KK'\nintervalley and defect-localized excitons exhibits a degree of circular\npolarization of emitted photons that is three times higher than that of the\nconstituent species. Moreover, a bright KK intravalley and a dark KQ exciton\nform a coherently coupled hybrid state under energetic resonance, with their\nvalley depolarization dynamics slowed down a hundredfold. Overall, these\nvalley-polarized hybrid excitons with strain-tunable valley character emerge as\nprime candidates for valleytronic applications in future quantum and\ninformation technology.",

    "abstract": "Spaceborne gravitational-wave observatories utilize a postprocessing\ntechnique known as time-delay interferometry (TDI) to reduce the otherwise\noverwhelming laser frequency noise by around 8 orders of magnitude. While, in\nits traditional form, TDI considers the spacecraft as point masses, recent\nstudies have enhanced this simplified scenario by incorporating more realistic\nmetrology chain models, which include onboard optical, electronic, and digital\ndelays. These studies have updated the TDI algorithm to include onboard delays\nobtained from prelaunch and in-flight calibrations. Conversely, the processing\nscheme presented in this article treats onboard delays as an integral part of\nthe TDI combinations: instead of having separate calibration stages, it\ndirectly expresses all delays appearing in the algorithm in terms of onboard\nmeasurements, especially pseudo-random-noise ranging (PRNR) measurements. The\nonly onboard delays that need to be corrected in our processing scheme are PRNR\ndelays in the digital domain, which are determined by commandable\ndigital-signal-processing parameters; hence, they can be easily managed in\npostprocessing. Furthermore, our processing scheme does not require a prior\ninterspacecraft clock synchronization, and it automatically corrects for\npotential relative drifts between the clocks driving local phase measurement\nsystems. The proposed observable-based formulation closely relates TDI to the\nactual metrology system, and it clearly outlines how to manage onboard\nmeasurements in postprocessing. Hence, it is expected to lead to fundamental\nadvancements in TDI, providing both conceptual completeness and unique\npractical benefits.",

While most\napproaches use analyzers that point students to problems in their code,\nincorporating these tools into classrooms is not straightforward. Combined with\nfurther research on code structure instruction in the classroom, we call for\nmore studies on effectiveness. Over 40% of instructional studies had no\nevaluation. Many studies show promise for their interventions by demonstrating\nimprovement in student performance (e.g., reduced violations in student code\nwhen using the intervention compared with code that was written without access\nto the intervention).

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)\nfor domain-specific question-answering (QA) tasks by leveraging external\nknowledge sources. However, traditional RAG systems primarily focus on\nrelevance-based retrieval and often struggle with redundancy, especially when\nreasoning requires connecting information from multiple sources. This paper\nintroduces Vendi-RAG, a framework based on an iterative process that jointly\noptimizes retrieval diversity and answer quality. This joint optimization leads\nto significantly higher accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. Vendi-RAG leverages\nthe Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to promote\nsemantic diversity in document retrieval. It then uses an LLM judge that\nevaluates candidate answers, generated after a reasoning step, and outputs a\nscore that the retriever uses to balance relevance and diversity among the\nretrieved documents during each iteration. Experiments on three challenging\ndatasets -- HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA -- demonstrate Vendi-RAG's\neffectiveness in multi-hop reasoning tasks. The framework achieves significant\naccuracy improvements over traditional single-step and multi-step RAG\napproaches, with accuracy increases reaching up to +4.2% on HotpotQA, +4.1% on\n2WikiMultiHopQA, and +1.3% on MuSiQue compared to Adaptive-RAG, the current\nbest baseline.

Existing work in LLM-based MMT typically mitigates this issue\nvia scaling up training and computation budget, which raises a critical\nquestion: Is scaling up the training and computation budget truly necessary for\nhigh-quality MMT, or can a deeper understanding of CoM provide a more efficient\nsolution? To explore this problem, we analyze the linguistic conflicts and\nsynergy, the underlying mechanism of CoM during post-training phase. We\nidentify an asymmetric phenomenon in linguistic conflicts and synergy: the\ndominance of conflicts and synergy varies in different translation directions,\nleading to sub-optimal adaptation in existing post-training methods. We further\nfind that a significant bottleneck in MMT appears to lie in post-training\nrather than multilingual pre-training, suggesting the need for more effective\nadaptation strategies.

Traditional approaches rely on continuous representations of\npopulation size, but in many cases, the precise number of individuals is\nunknowable. Here, we present a coarse-grained population model that simplifies\npopulation dynamics to binary states - high or low - determined by the balance\nof bottom-up resource availability and top-down predation pressure. This\nBoolean framework provides a minimal yet analytically tractable alternative to\ntraditional Lotka-Volterra-based models, enabling direct insights into the role\nof food web structure in shaping community stability. Using this approach, we\ninvestigate how trophic interactions influence population persistence, cyclic\ndynamics, and extinction risk across model food webs. We find that top-down\neffects are a primary driver of cycling, aligning with theoretical expectations\nfrom traditional population models, and that trophic position strongly\ninfluences extinction risk, with higher-trophic species more prone to\npersistent low-population states. Additionally, we explore the role of trophic\nshort-circuits -- direct interactions between apex predators and low-trophic\nprey -- and find that they can buffer cascades and alter extinction patterns in\nways that are often overlooked in classical models. By simplifying population\ndynamics to a two-state system, this framework provides a powerful tool for\ndisentangling the structural drivers of community stability.

In this\nwork, we introduce text-guided binaural audio generation. As an early effort,\nwe focus on the scenario where a monaural reference audio is given\nadditionally. The core problem is to associate specific sound events with their\ndirections, thereby creating binaural spatial audio. The challenge lies in the\ncomplexity of textual descriptions and the limited availability of\nsingle-source sound event datasets. To address this, we propose AudioSpa, an\nend-to-end model that applies large language models to process both acoustic\nand textual information. We employ fusion multi-head attention (FMHA) to\nintegrate text tokens, which enhances the generation capability of the\nmultimodal learning. Additionally, we propose a binaural source localization\nmodel to assess the quality of the generated audio. Finally, we design a data\naugmentation strategy to generate diverse datasets, which enables the model to\nspatialize sound events across various spatial positions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our model is able to put sounds at the specified locations\naccurately. It achieves competitive performance in both localization accuracy\nand signal distortion. Our demonstrations are available at\nhttps://linfeng-feng.github.io/AudioSpa-demo.",

Of the 81 localized bursts, we use the\nProbabilistic Association of Transients to their Hosts (PATH) algorithm to\nsecurely identify 21 new FRB host galaxies, and compile spectroscopic redshifts\nfor 19 systems, 15 of which are newly obtained via spectroscopic observations.\nThe most nearby source is FRB 20231229A, at a distance of 90 Mpc. One burst in\nour sample is from a previously reported repeating source in a galaxy merger\n(FRB 20190303A). Three new FRB host galaxies (FRBs 20230203A, 20230703A, and\n20231206A) are found towards X-ray and optically selected galaxy clusters,\npotentially doubling the sample of known galaxy cluster FRBs. A search for\nradio counterparts reveals that FRB 20231128A is associated with a luminous\npersistent radio source (PRS) candidate with high significance ($P_{cc} \\sim\n10^{-2}$). If its compactness is confirmed, it would be the nearest known\ncompact PRS at $z = 0.1079$. Our catalog significantly increases the statistics\nof the Macquart relation at low redshifts ($z < 0.2$). In the near future, the\ncompleted CHIME/FRB Outriggers array will produce hundreds of FRBs localized\nwith very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). This will significantly expand\nthe known sample and pave the way for future telescopes relying on VLBI for FRB\nlocalization.",

Using Bayesian optimization, the Generalized $k$-$\\omega$ (GEKO)\nmodel was calibrated by tuning $C_\\text{SEP}$ and $C_\\text{NW}$ with sparse\ndirect numerical simulation (DNS) data at $Re = 12,600$. The calibration\nfollowed the Generalized Error Distribution-based Calibration Procedure\n(GEDCP), optimizing coefficients based on pressure recovery ($C_p$) and skin\nfriction ($C_f$). The optimized model was evaluated beyond training data.\nStreamwise velocity ($U$) predictions at $Re = 12,600$ were compared to DNS to\nassess improvements in $C_p$ and $C_f$. To test robustness, comparisons were\nmade against large-eddy simulation (LES) data at $Re = 20,580$ for velocity and\nskin friction. Results show that optimized GEKO (turbo-RANS) improves wall\nquantity predictions, particularly reattachment. Improved velocity profiles at\nboth Reynolds numbers suggest Bayesian-optimized coefficients enhance adverse\npressure gradient modeling. The model retains accuracy across different $Re$,\nshowing turbo-RANS' potential in turbulence model corrections that generalize\nacross flows. While skin friction predictions showed limited improvement due to\nconstraints of two-equation models, this study highlights the role of machine\nlearning-assisted RANS calibration in improving predictive accuracy for complex\nflows. The results suggest optimized coefficients from a single dataset can be\napplied across moderate $Re$ variations, improving turbo-RANS' applicability\nfor turbulence model tuning.",

To combat these\nchallenges, organizations employ Material Requirements Planning (MRP) software\nsolutions to set inventory stock buffers - for raw materials, work-in-process\ngoods, and finished products - to help them meet customer service levels.\nHowever, holding excess inventory further complicates operations and can lock\nup millions of dollars of capital that could be otherwise deployed.\nFurthermore, most commercially available MRP solutions fall short in\nconsidering uncertainties and do not result in optimal solutions for modern\nenterprises.\n  At C3 AI, we fundamentally reformulate the inventory management problem as a\nconstrained stochastic optimization.

Unlike normal modes, which are resonances of\nenergy-conserving systems, QNMs are damped oscillations arising when a system\nloses energy due to open boundaries or via dissipation. The detection of the\nfull QNM spectrum of black holes is challenging due to rapidly decaying\namplitudes of these resonances, limiting observations only to the longest-lived\nmode. Theoretical and numerical studies suggest that environmental confinement\ndue to surrounding plasma or dark matter modify the QNM spectrum.

In the available\nparameter space, we observe regimes in which multiple QNMs emerge from the\ninterface noise spectrum. In agreement with theoretical predictions, their real\nand imaginary frequencies are shifted with respect to those expected in the\nunbounded system.

    "abstract": "Thin cylindrical membranes arise in a wide variety of biological systems\nranging from tubular structures on and within cell membranes to in-vitro\nexperiments on artificial vesicles. Motor proteins embedded in such fluidic\nmembranes often induce vortex-like flows. In this work, we construct a class of\n2D vortex flow in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to 3D external embedding\nfluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in\nthe flow field, consistent with Poincar\\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the\nincompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of\na multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian, This Hamiltonian also\nincorporates the specific couplings of the 2D membrane flow with the 3D\nexternal fluids. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry\nof the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex\ndynamics, such as orbit pinching, For a two-vortex system of same circulation,\nwe observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time,\nunlike flat and spherical fluid membranes, where the separation remains\nconstant. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along\nhelical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the\nRoyal Society A, Vol 455 (1999), now extended to tubular geometries. We also\nexplore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and\ndemonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be\ninteresting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as\nexperimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610\n(2011).",

    "abstract": "Housing and household characteristics are key determinants of social and\neconomic well-being, yet our understanding of their interrelationships remains\nlimited. This study addresses this knowledge gap by developing a deep\ncontrastive learning (DCL) model to infer housing-household relationships using\nthe American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). More\nbroadly, the proposed model is suitable for a class of problems where the goal\nis to learn joint relationships between two distinct entities without\nexplicitly labeled ground truth data. Our proposed dual-encoder DCL approach\nleverages co-occurrence patterns in PUMS and introduces a bisect K-means\nclustering method to overcome the absence of ground truth labels. The\ndual-encoder DCL architecture is designed to handle the semantic differences\nbetween housing (building) and household (people) features while mitigating\nnoise introduced by clustering. To validate the model, we generate a synthetic\nground truth dataset and conduct comprehensive evaluations. The model further\ndemonstrates its superior performance in capturing housing-household\nrelationships in Delaware compared to state-of-the-art methods. A\ntransferability test in North Carolina confirms its generalizability across\ndiverse sociodemographic and geographic contexts. Finally, the post-hoc\nexplainable AI analysis using SHAP values reveals that tenure status and\nmortgage information play a more significant role in housing-household matching\nthan traditionally emphasized factors such as the number of persons and rooms.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements have established self-intercalation as a powerful\ntechnique for manipulating quantum material properties, with precisely\ncontrollable intercalation concentrations. Given the inherently rich phase\ndiagrams of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), studying the\nself-intercalated TMDCs can offer promising candidates for investigating the\ninterplay between various orderings. This work focuses on fully intercalated\nbilayer TaSe$_2$ (Ta$_3$Se$_4$), which has recently been fabricated\nexperimentally. By performing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the\nsuppression of an intrinsic $3\\times3$ charge density wave (CDW) in parent\nTaSe$_2$ layers, and the emergence of $2\\times 2$, $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$,\nor the absence of a CDW in the intercalated layers, depending on the interlayer\nstacking orders and intercalation sites being occupied. Particularly, the\n$2\\times 2$ CDW shows an increase in electronic states at the Fermi level\ncompared to its non-CDW phase. This unusual behavior contrasts with that of\ntypical CDW materials in TMDCs. Furthermore, superconductivity is preserved in\nthese Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures, with superconducting transition temperatures\ncomparable to or substantially smaller than those of TaSe$_2$. Spin-orbit\ncoupling is found to enhance the density of states at Fermi levels while\nsimultaneously reducing the electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. These two\ncompeting effects result in varying impacts on superconductivity across\ndifferent Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures. Moreover, our calculations indicate that\nmagnetic order is absent. Our study deepens the understanding of underlying\nphysics in Ta$_3$Se$_4$, and provides experimentally feasible candidates for\nstudying CDW, superconductivity, and their interplay.",

    "abstract": "Plasma systems exhibit complex multiscale dynamics, resolving which poses\nsignificant challenges for conventional numerical simulations. Machine learning\n(ML) offers an alternative by learning data-driven representations of these\ndynamics. Yet existing ML time-stepping models suffer from error accumulation,\ninstability, and limited long-term forecasting horizons. This paper\ndemonstrates the application of a hierarchical multiscale neural network\narchitecture for autonomous plasma forecasting. The framework integrates\nmultiple neural networks trained across different temporal scales to capture\nboth fine-scale and large-scale behaviors while mitigating compounding error in\nrecursive evaluation. Fine-scale networks accurately resolve fast-evolving\nfeatures, while coarse-scale networks provide broader temporal context,\nreducing the frequency of recursive updates and limiting the accumulation of\nsmall prediction errors over time. We first evaluate the method using canonical\nnonlinear dynamical systems and compare its performance against classical\nsingle-scale neural networks. The results demonstrate that single-scale neural\nnetworks experience rapid divergence due to recursive error accumulation,\nwhereas the multiscale approach improves stability and extends prediction\nhorizons. Next, our ML model is applied to two plasma configurations of high\nscientific and applied significance, demonstrating its ability to preserve\nspatial structures and capture multiscale plasma dynamics. By leveraging\nmultiple time-stepping resolutions, the applied framework is shown to\noutperform conventional single-scale networks for the studied plasma test\ncases. The results of this work position the hierarchical multiscale neural\nnetwork as a promising tool for efficient plasma forecasting and digital twin\napplications.",

The approach employs correlation maps to detect cyclic behavior\nwithin specific frequency bands in the time-frequency domain (spectrogram),\nenabling the identification of IFBs. Robust correlation measures and median\nfiltering are applied to enhance the correlation maps and improve the final IFB\nselection. Signal segmentation and the use of averaged results for IFB\nselection are also highlighted. The proposed trimmed and quadrant correlations\nare compablack with the Pearson and Kendall correlations using simulated\nsignal, real vibration signal from crusher in mining industry and acoustic\nsignal measublack on the test rig. Furthermore, the results of real vibration\nanalyses are compablack with established IFB selectors, including the spectral\nkurtosis, the alpha selector and the conditional variance-based selector.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, ensuring their alignment\nwith human goals and values remains a pressing challenge. A key concern is\n\\textit{instrumental convergence}, where an AI system, in optimizing for a\ngiven objective, develops unintended intermediate goals that override the\nultimate objective and deviate from human-intended goals. This issue is\nparticularly relevant in reinforcement learning (RL)-trained models, which can\ngenerate creative but unintended strategies to maximize rewards. In this paper,\nwe explore instrumental convergence in LLMs by comparing models trained with\ndirect RL optimization (e.g., the o1 model) to those trained with reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF). We hypothesize that RL-driven models\nexhibit a stronger tendency for instrumental convergence due to their\noptimization of goal-directed behavior in ways that may misalign with human\nintentions. To assess this, we introduce InstrumentalEval, a benchmark for\nevaluating instrumental convergence in RL-trained LLMs. Initial experiments\nreveal cases where a model tasked with making money unexpectedly pursues\ninstrumental objectives, such as self-replication, implying signs of\ninstrumental convergence. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of\nalignment challenges in AI systems and the risks posed by unintended model\nbehaviors.",

    "abstract": "Many e-commerce search pipelines have four stages, namely: retrieval,\nfiltering, ranking, and personalized-reranking. The retrieval stage must be\nefficient and yield high recall because relevant products missed in the first\nstage cannot be considered in later stages. This is challenging for\ntask-oriented queries (queries with actionable intent) where user requirements\nare contextually intensive and difficult to understand. To foster research in\nthe domain of e-commerce, we created a novel benchmark for Task-oriented\nQueries (TQE) by using LLM, which operates over the existing ESCI product\nsearch dataset. Furthermore, we propose a novel method 'Graph-based Recall\nImprovement for Task-oriented queries' (GRIT) to address the most crucial\nfirst-stage recall improvement needs. GRIT leads to robust and statistically\nsignificant improvements over state-of-the-art lexical, dense, and\nlearned-sparse baselines. Our system supports both traditional and\ntask-oriented e-commerce queries, yielding up to 6.3% recall improvement. In\nthe indexing stage, GRIT first builds a product-product similarity graph using\nuser clicks or manual annotation data. During retrieval, it locates neighbors\nwith higher contextual and action relevance and prioritizes them over the less\nrelevant candidates from the initial retrieval. This leads to a more\ncomprehensive and relevant first-stage result set that improves overall system\nrecall. Overall, GRIT leverages the locality relationships and contextual\ninsights provided by the graph using neighboring nodes to enrich the\nfirst-stage retrieval results. We show that the method is not only robust\nacross all introduced parameters, but also works effectively on top of a\nvariety of first-stage retrieval methods.",

To optimize the SIM phase shifts, we propose a layer-by-layer iterative\nalgorithm for optimizing the phase shifts in each layer alternately. Then, the\nminimum mean square error (MMSE) transmit precoding method is employed for the\ndigital beamformer to support multi-user access. Furthermore, the mitigation of\nthe SIM phase tuning error is also taken into account in the digital beamformer\nby exploiting its statistics. The power sharing ratio of each user is designed\nbased on the iterative waterfilling power allocation algorithm. Additionally,\nour analytical results indicate that the spectral efficiency attained saturates\nin the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region due to the phase tuning error\nresulting from the imperfect SIM hardware quality.

After confirming the presence of chemical species in our atmospheric\nmodel, we combined the pre- and post-eclipse datasets for a joint analysis. By\nemploying a Bayesian retrieval framework, this joint retrieval enabled us to\nconstrain the spatially varying temperature-pressure (T-P) profile and\natmospheric carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. We detected strong emission\nsignatures of CO and H$_2$O in the post-eclipse and combined datasets. While a\nwell-mixed retrieval model results in a super-solar C/O, allowing for\nvertically varying chemistry yields C/O values consistent with solar. The\nretrieved parameters are not only consistent across the datasets but also\nacross different chemical regimes. We did not identify any significant velocity\nshifts between the detected species or across the datasets, which could\notherwise serve as proxies for possible atmospheric dynamics. We also explored\nphase dependence through the model scaling factor and found no substantial\nchanges in atmospheric properties throughout the observed phases. Due to strong\ndegeneracies between the temperature gradient and chemical abundances, our\nretrieved temperatures are broadly consistent with either a full redistribution\nof heat or strong day-night contrasts. While this complicates direct\ncomparisons with recent Spitzer phase curve analyses suggesting inefficient\nrecirculation, we find no clear evidence of spatial variation in the chemical\nor temperature structure of MASCARA-1b from pre- to post-eclipse, nor temporal\nvariation over $\\approx$2 years.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese acupuncture methods often face controversy in clinical\npractice due to their high subjectivity. Additionally, current\nintelligent-assisted acupuncture systems have two major limitations: slow\nacupoint localization speed and low accuracy. To address these limitations, a\nnew method leverages the excellent inference efficiency of the state-space\nmodel Mamba, while retaining the advantages of the attention mechanism in the\ntraditional DETR architecture, to achieve efficient global information\nintegration and provide high-quality feature information for acupoint\nlocalization tasks. Furthermore, by employing the concept of residual\nlikelihood estimation, it eliminates the need for complex upsampling processes,\nthereby accelerating the acupoint localization task. Our method achieved\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on a private dataset of acupoints on the human\nback, with an average Euclidean distance pixel error (EPE) of 7.792 and an\naverage time consumption of 10.05 milliseconds per localization task. Compared\nto the second-best algorithm, our method improved both accuracy and speed by\napproximately 14\\%. This significant advancement not only enhances the efficacy\nof acupuncture treatment but also demonstrates the commercial potential of\nautomated acupuncture robot systems.

    "abstract": "Recent 2D CNN-based domain adaptation approaches struggle with long-range\ndependencies due to limited receptive fields, making it difficult to adapt to\ntarget domains with significant spatial distribution changes. While\ntransformer-based domain adaptation methods better capture distant\nrelationships through self-attention mechanisms that facilitate more effective\ncross-domain feature alignment, their quadratic computational complexity makes\npractical deployment challenging for object detection tasks across diverse\ndomains. Inspired by the global modeling and linear computation complexity of\nthe Mamba architecture, we present the first domain-adaptive Mamba-based\none-stage object detection model, termed DA-Mamba. Specifically, we combine\nMamba's efficient state-space modeling with attention mechanisms to address\ndomain-specific spatial and channel-wise variations. Our design leverages\ndomain-adaptive spatial and channel-wise scanning within the Mamba block to\nextract highly transferable representations for efficient sequential\nprocessing, while cross-attention modules generate long-range, mixed-domain\nspatial features to enable robust soft alignment across domains. Besides,\nmotivated by the observation that hybrid architectures introduce feature noise\nin domain adaptation tasks, we propose an entropy-based knowledge distillation\nframework with margin ReLU, which adaptively refines multi-level\nrepresentations by suppressing irrelevant activations and aligning uncertainty\nacross source and target domains. Finally, to prevent overfitting caused by the\nmixed-up features generated through cross-attention mechanisms, we propose\nentropy-driven gating attention with random perturbations that simultaneously\nrefine target features and enhance model generalization.",

Existing Transformer-based STVG\napproaches often leverage a set of object queries, which are initialized simply\nusing zeros and then gradually learn target position information via iterative\ninteractions with multimodal features, for spatial and temporal localization.\nDespite simplicity, these zero object queries, due to lacking target-specific\ncues, are hard to learn discriminative target information from interactions\nwith multimodal features in complicated scenarios (\\e.g., with distractors or\nocclusion), resulting in degradation. Addressing this, we introduce a novel\nTarget-Aware Transformer for STVG (TA-STVG), which seeks to adaptively generate\nobject queries via exploring target-specific cues from the given video-text\npair, for improving STVG. The key lies in two simple yet effective modules,\ncomprising text-guided temporal sampling (TTS) and attribute-aware spatial\nactivation (ASA), working in a cascade. The former focuses on selecting\ntarget-relevant temporal cues from a video utilizing holistic text information,\nwhile the latter aims at further exploiting the fine-grained visual attribute\ninformation of the object from previous target-aware temporal cues, which is\napplied for object query initialization. Compared to existing methods\nleveraging zero-initialized queries, object queries in our TA-STVG, directly\ngenerated from a given video-text pair, naturally carry target-specific cues,\nmaking them adaptive and better interact with multimodal features for learning\nmore discriminative information to improve STVG.

This\ngeneralises the well-known notion of a sharply $k$-transitive action on a set.\nWe show that, for $k \\leq 3$, a wide range of countable ultrahomogeneous\nstructures admit structurally sharply $k$-transitive actions by finitely\ngenerated virtually free groups, giving a substantial answer to a question of\nCameron from the book Oligomorphic Permutation Groups. We also show that the\nrandom $k$-hypertournament admits a structurally sharply $k$-transitive action\nfor $k=4,5$, and that $\\mathbb{Q}$ and several of its reducts admit\nstructurally sharply $k$-transitive actions for all $k$. (This contrasts with\nthe case of sets, where for $k \\geq 4$ there are no sharply $k$-transitive\nactions on infinite sets by results of Tits and Hall.) We also show the\nexistence of sharply $2$-transitive actions of finitely generated virtually\nfree groups on an infinite set, solving the open question of whether such\nactions exist for hyperbolic groups.\n  [Note: this is an early working draft.]",

This is perhaps the first and the most\nimportant surprising property ever discovered about primes. There is little in\nnumber theory that is not dependent on it or intertwined with it, and its\nsignificance is amply demonstrated by the fact that today, almost four\ncenturies later, Fermat's theorem provides the mathematical foundation for the\nRSA cryptosystem, which is still central to society's communications security\neven after several decades serving as its heart.\n  Fermat's theorem is totally unexpected and truly astonishing. So why and how\ndid he discover it? We know that Fermat was studying perfect numbers from\nclassical Greek mathematics. But exactly how did that lead to his discovery?\nThe secret lies in patterns in prime factorizations of Mersenne numbers, and\nFermat's letters reveal hints of his path. We can reconstruct details of how\nMersenne numbers led to Fermat's discoveries.",

Existing approaches (e.g., ACT) tend to treat\nmulti-view features equally and directly concatenate them for policy learning.\nHowever, it will introduce redundant visual information and bring higher\ncomputational costs, leading to ineffective manipulation. For a fine-grained\nmanipulation task, it tends to involve multiple stages while the most\ncontributed view for different stages is varied over time. In this paper, we\npropose a plug-and-play best-feature-aware (BFA) fusion strategy for multi-view\nmanipulation tasks, which is adaptable to various policies. Built upon the\nvisual backbone of the policy network, we design a lightweight network to\npredict the importance score of each view. Based on the predicted importance\nscores, the reweighted multi-view features are subsequently fused and input\ninto the end-to-end policy network, enabling seamless integration.

    "abstract": "Utilizing complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) in wireless communication\ntasks has received growing attention for their ability to provide natural and\neffective representation of complex-valued signals and data. However, existing\nstudies typically employ complex-valued versions of simple neural network\narchitectures. Not only they merely scratch the surface of the extensive range\nof modern deep learning techniques, theoretical understanding of the superior\nperformance of CVNNs is missing. To this end, this paper aims to fill both the\ntheoretical and practice gap of employing CVNNs in wireless communications. In\nparticular, we provide a comprehensive description on the various operations in\nCVNNs and theoretically prove that the CVNN requires fewer layers than the\nreal-valued counterpart to achieve a given approximation error of a continuous\nfunction. Furthermore, to advance CVNNs in the field of wireless\ncommunications, this paper focuses on the transformer model, which represents a\nmore sophisticated deep learning architecture and has been shown to have\nexcellent performance in wireless communications but only in its real-valued\nform. In this aspect, we propose a fundamental paradigm of complex-valued\ntransformers for wireless communications. Leveraging this structure, we develop\ncustomized complex-valued transformers for three representative applications in\nwireless communications: channel estimation, user activity detection, and\nprecoding design. These applications utilize transformers with varying levels\nof sophistication and span a variety of tasks, ranging from regression to\nclassification, supervised to unsupervised learning, and specific module design\nto end-to-end design. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance\nof the complex-valued transformers for the above three applications compared to\nother traditional real-valued neural network-based methods.",

However, building\nconversational explanation systems is hindered by the scarcity of training\ndata. Training with synthetic data faces two main challenges: lack of data\ndiversity and hallucination in the generated data. To alleviate these issues,\nwe introduce a repetition penalty to promote data diversity and exploit a\nhallucination detector to filter out untruthful synthetic conversation turns.\nWe conducted both automatic and human evaluations on the proposed system,\nfEw-shot Multi-round ConvErsational Explanation (EMCEE). For automatic\nevaluation, EMCEE achieves relative improvements of 81.6% in BLEU and 80.5% in\nROUGE compared to the baselines. EMCEE also mitigates the degeneration of data\nquality caused by training on synthetic data. In human evaluations (N=60),\nEMCEE outperforms baseline models and the control group in improving users'\ncomprehension, acceptance, trust, and collaboration with static explanations by\nlarge margins. Through a fine-grained analysis of model responses, we further\ndemonstrate that training on self-generated synthetic data improves the model's\nability to generate more truthful and understandable answers, leading to better\nuser interactions.

Obvious\nstrategy-proofness, introduced by Li [American Economic Review, 2017],\nstrengthens the well-known concept of dominant-strategy incentive compatibility\n(DSIC). Loosely speaking, it ensures that even agents who struggle with\ncontingent reasoning can identify that their dominant strategy is optimal.\n  Thus, one would hope to design OSP mechanisms with good approximation\nguarantees. Unfortunately, Ron [SODA,2024] has shown that deterministic OSP\nmechanisms fail to achieve an approximation better than $\\min\\{m,n\\}$ where $m$\nis the number of items and $n$ is the number of bidders, even for the simple\nsettings of additive and unit-demand bidders. We circumvent these\nimpossibilities by showing that randomized mechanisms that are obviously\nstrategy-proof in the universal sense obtain a constant factor approximation\nfor these classes. We show that this phenomenon occurs also for the setting of\na multi-unit auction with single-minded bidders. Thus, our results provide a\nmore positive outlook on the design of OSP mechanisms and exhibit a stark\nseparation between the power of randomized and deterministic OSP mechanisms.\n  To complement the picture, we provide impossibilities for randomized OSP\nmechanisms in each setting. While the deterministic VCG mechanism is well known\nto output an optimal allocation in dominant strategies, we show that even\nrandomized OSP mechanisms cannot obtain more than $87.5\\%$ of the optimal\nwelfare. This further demonstrates that OSP mechanisms are significantly weaker\nthan dominant-strategy mechanisms.",

For Gaussian predictors it is shown that these\nconditions are also necessary for consistency of GWASH (with truncation) and\nsimulations suggest that necessity holds too when the predictors are\nnon-Gaussian. We also show that, with properly truncated weights, weighting\ndoes not change the consistency results, but standardization of the predictors\nand outcome, as done in practice, introduces bias in both LDSC and GWASH if the\ntwo essential conditions are violated.

Composed of multiple parts\nconnected by joints, articulated objects are endowed with diverse functional\nmechanisms through complex relative motions. For example, a safe consists of a\ndoor, a handle, and a lock, where the door can only be opened when the latch is\nunlocked. The internal structure, such as the state of a lock or joint angle\nconstraints, cannot be directly observed from visual observation. Consequently,\nsuccessful manipulation of these objects requires adaptive adjustment based on\ntrial and error rather than a one-time visual inference. However, previous\ndatasets and simulation environments for articulated objects have primarily\nfocused on simple manipulation mechanisms where the complete manipulation\nprocess can be inferred from the object's appearance. To enhance the diversity\nand complexity of adaptive manipulation mechanisms, we build a novel\narticulated object manipulation environment and equip it with 9 categories of\nobjects. Based on the environment and objects, we further propose an adaptive\ndemonstration collection and 3D visual diffusion-based imitation learning\npipeline that learns the adaptive manipulation policy.

    "abstract": "The prediction of the Remaining Useful Life of aircraft engines is a critical\narea in high-reliability sectors such as aerospace and defense. Early failure\npredictions help ensure operational continuity, reduce maintenance costs, and\nprevent unexpected failures. Traditional regression models struggle with\ncensored data, which can lead to biased predictions. Survival models, on the\nother hand, effectively handle censored data, improving predictive accuracy in\nmaintenance processes. This paper introduces a novel approach based on the\nRashomon perspective, which considers multiple models that achieve similar\nperformance rather than relying on a single best model. This enables\nuncertainty quantification in survival probability predictions and enhances\ndecision-making in predictive maintenance. The Rashomon survival curve was\nintroduced to represent the range of survival probability estimates, providing\ninsights into model agreement and uncertainty over time. The results on the\nCMAPSS dataset demonstrate that relying solely on a single model for RUL\nestimation may increase risk in some scenarios. The censoring levels\nsignificantly impact prediction uncertainty, with longer censoring times\nleading to greater variability in survival probabilities.

However, existing RDH-EI schemes often suffer from high\ncomputational complexity, low embedding rates, and excessive data expansion.\nThis paper addresses these challenges by first analyzing the block-based secret\nsharing in existing schemes, revealing significant data redundancy within image\nblocks. Based on this observation, we propose two space-preserving methods: the\ndirect space-vacating method and the image-shrinking-based space-vacating\nmethod. Using these techniques, we design two novel RDH-EI schemes: a\nhigh-capacity RDH-EI scheme and a size-reduced RDH-EI scheme. The high-capacity\nRDH-EI scheme directly creates embedding space in encrypted images, eliminating\nthe need for complex space-vacating operations and achieving higher and more\nstable embedding rates. In contrast, the size-reduced RDH-EI scheme minimizes\ndata expansion by discarding unnecessary shares, resulting in smaller encrypted\nimages. Experimental results show that the high-capacity RDH-EI scheme\noutperforms existing methods in terms of embedding capacity, while the\nsize-reduced RDH-EI scheme excels in minimizing data expansion. Both schemes\nprovide effective solutions to the challenges in RDH-EI, offering promising\napplications in fields such as medical imaging and cloud storage.",

The rule is considered to\nbe related to the solar dynamo, which drives the evolution of the Sun's\nlarge-scale magnetic field. However, observational studies of the G-O rule have\nrevealed inconsistencies, particularly regarding long-term variations and the\nunderlying physical mechanisms. In this study, we use an iterative map derived\nwithin the framework of the Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo to analyze the G-O\nrule. We investigate comprehensive and definitive forms of the G-O rule using\nboth a sufficiently large number of solar cycles and a limited number of solar\ncycles. Our findings indicate a higher probability for an arbitrary cycle to be\nfollowed by a stronger cycle instead of weaker, regardless of even or odd. Over\ntime spans comparable to historical observations, cycles exhibit periods that\nfollow both the G-O rule and the reversed G-O rule, without a statistically\nsignificant preference, consistent with the observed variability of the G-O\nrule. The occurrence of the reversed G-O rule is random, rather than periodic.\nThe G-O rule emerges as a result of the nonlinearity and stochasticity inherent\nin the BL mechanism.

Whether solar\ncycle variability is dominated by deterministic chaos or stochastic\nperturbations remains an open question. Distinguishing between the two\nmechanisms is crucial for predicting solar cycles. Here we reduce the solar\ndynamo process responsible for the solar cycle to a one-dimensional iterative\nmap, incorporating recent advance in the observed nonlinearity and\nstochasticity of the cycle. We demonstrate that deterministic chaos is absent\nin the nonlinear system, regardless of model parameters, if the generation of\nthe poloidal field follows an increase-then-saturate pattern as the cycle\nstrength increases. The synthesized solar cycles generated by the iterative map\nexhibit a probability density function (PDF) similar to that of observed normal\ncycles, supporting the dominant role of stochasticity in solar cycle\nvariability. The parameters governing nonlinearity and stochasticity profoundly\ninfluence the PDF. The iterative map provides a quick and effective tool for\npredicting the range, including uncertainty of the subsequent cycle strength\nwhen an ongoing cycle amplitude is known. Due to stochasticity, a solar cycle\nloses almost all its original information within 1 or 2 cycles.

Despite the advances in large language models (LLMs),\ntheir application to TRE remains limited. Most existing approaches rely on\npairwise classification, where event pairs are classified in isolation, leading\nto computational inefficiency and a lack of global consistency in the resulting\ntemporal graph. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot method for TRE that\ngenerates a document's complete temporal graph in a single step, followed by\ntemporal constraint optimization to refine predictions and enforce temporal\nconsistency across relations. Additionally, we introduce OmniTemp, a new\ndataset with complete annotations for all pairs of targeted events within a\ndocument.

We present\nexperiments using the Qwen2.5 model and HalluQA dataset, employing ReAct\nprompting (which involves reasoning, confidence assessment, and answer\nverification) to control and optimize hallucinations.

To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded approach that\nreplaces forward KL divergence-whose mass-covering behavior risks overfitting\nto imperfect weak signals-with reverse KL divergence.

The enrichment of the point-group symmetries is then fully encoded\nat the boundary of the sector and the apex of the section, which forms a\njunction between the two boundaries. The mirror-symmetry enrichment encoded on\nthe boundaries is analyzed by the classification theory of symmetric gapped\nboundaries, and the point-group-symmetry enrichment encoded on the junction is\nanalyzed by a framework for classifying symmetric gapped junctions between\nboundaries which we develop in this work.

Assuming the plasma moves toward the observers with a bulk Lorentz\nfactor of $\\Gamma=100$ and the electron distribution in an individual blob is\nmonoenergetic ($\\gamma_{\\rm e}\\sim300$), our analysis shows that bright and\nnarrow-banded radio bursts with peak flux density $\\sim$ 1 ${\\rm Jy}$ at peak\nfrequency ($\\nu_{\\rm pk}$) $\\sim 3.85$ GHz can be produced by the synchrotron\nmaser emission if the plasma blob has a magnetization factor of\n$\\sigma\\sim10^{-5}$ and a frequency of $\\nu_{\\rm P}\\sim 4.5$ MHz.

    "abstract": "Mechanism design has long been a cornerstone of economic theory, with\ntraditional approaches relying on mathematical derivations. Recently, automated\napproaches, including differentiable economics with neural networks, have\nemerged for designing payments and allocations. While both analytical and\nautomated methods have advanced the field, they each face significant\nweaknesses: mathematical derivations are not automated and often struggle to\nscale to complex problems, while automated and especially neural-network-based\napproaches suffer from limited interpretability. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce a novel framework that reformulates mechanism design as a code\ngeneration task. Using large language models (LLMs), we generate heuristic\nmechanisms described in code and evolve them to optimize over some evaluation\nmetrics while ensuring key design criteria (e.g., strategy-proofness) through a\nproblem-specific fixing process. This fixing process ensures any mechanism\nviolating the design criteria is adjusted to satisfy them, albeit with some\ntrade-offs in performance metrics. These trade-offs are factored in during the\nLLM-based evolution process. The code generation capabilities of LLMs enable\nthe discovery of novel and interpretable solutions, bridging the symbolic logic\nof mechanism design and the generative power of modern AI. Through rigorous\nexperimentation, we demonstrate that LLM-generated mechanisms achieve\ncompetitive performance while offering greater interpretability compared to\nprevious approaches. Notably, our framework can rediscover existing manually\ndesigned mechanisms and provide insights into neural-network based solutions\nthrough Programming-by-Example. These results highlight the potential of LLMs\nto not only automate but also enhance the transparency and scalability of\nmechanism design, ensuring safe deployment of the mechanisms in society.",

This paper focuses on the viewing angle effect for a structured jet by\nconsidering the emission from the shear-accelerated electrons.

Without\nadditional training, MoTE enables meaningful and focused behavior changes in\nLLMs on-the-fly during inference time. By analyzing the digital LLM brain of\nDeepSeek-R1 using a technique we dub 'functional Token Resonance Imaging'\n(fTRI) -- inspired by fMRI and using prompts designed to elicit specific\nbehavior (e.g., 'What happened {time}{place}?') -- we empirically identify\ndistinctive experts associated with behaviors like refusal responses. Using\nMoTE we are able to intervene and control such specific behavior. We switched\noff the top 10 most refusal-relevant experts (0.07% of R1's 14,848 routed\nexperts), achieving a 52% refusal reduction on sensitive reference prompts\nwithout performance degradation on MT-Bench. Random expert deactivation\nresulted in smaller behavioral shifts with increased noise, whereas forced\nexpert activation led to significantly higher refusal rates. Our approach\nshares similarities with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in terms of explainability\nand steerability. Unlike SAEs, MoTE does not require large training efforts, as\nwithin MoEs with a vast number of experts, specialization already emerged\nnaturally during pretraining. Our findings suggest that significant functional\nmechanisms in Mixture-of-Experts architectures can at least partially be\nlocalized in a small number of specific experts, rather than being distributed\nthroughout the model's weights.

SyncSpeech has the following advantages: Low\nlatency, as it begins generating streaming speech upon receiving the second\ntext token; High efficiency, as it decodes all speech tokens corresponding to\nthe each arrived text token in one step. To achieve this, we propose a temporal\nmasked transformer as the backbone of SyncSpeech, combined with token-level\nduration prediction to predict speech tokens and the duration for the next\nstep.

The rapid development and deployment of increasingly\nlarger algorithmic models capable of analysing vast amounts of data are\ncontributing to rising carbon emissions, water withdrawal, and waste\ngeneration.

It is empirically demonstrated to be widespread across\nmainstream LRMs, posing both a significant risk and potential utility,\ndepending on how it is exploited. In this paper, we systematically investigate\nthis vulnerability from both malicious and beneficial perspectives. On the\nmalicious side, we introduce Breaking of Thought (BoT), a novel attack that\nenables adversaries to bypass the thinking process of LRMs, thereby\ncompromising their reliability and availability. We present two variants of\nBoT: a training-based version that injects backdoor during the fine-tuning\nstage, and a training-free version based on adversarial attack during the\ninference stage. As a potential defense, we propose thinking recovery alignment\nto partially mitigate the vulnerability.

    "abstract": "Hateful meme detection presents a significant challenge as a multimodal task\ndue to the complexity of interpreting implicit hate messages and contextual\ncues within memes. Previous approaches have fine-tuned pre-trained\nvision-language models (PT-VLMs), leveraging the knowledge they gained during\npre-training and their attention mechanisms to understand meme content.\nHowever, the reliance of these models on implicit knowledge and complex\nattention mechanisms renders their decisions difficult to explain, which is\ncrucial for building trust in meme classification. In this paper, we introduce\nIntMeme, a novel framework that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for\nhateful meme classification with explainable decisions. IntMeme addresses the\ndual challenges of improving both accuracy and explainability in meme\nmoderation. The framework uses LMMs to generate human-like, interpretive\nanalyses of memes, providing deeper insights into multimodal content and\ncontext. Additionally, it uses independent encoding modules for both memes and\ntheir interpretations, which are then combined to enhance classification\nperformance. Our approach addresses the opacity and misclassification issues\nassociated with PT-VLMs, optimizing the use of LMMs for hateful meme detection.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of IntMeme through comprehensive experiments\nacross three datasets, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art models.",

So far, the ongoing research has undertaken considerable efforts to\nmodel usability in such new challenging context.

However, to\nthe best of our knowledge, little or no effort has been made to empirically\nevaluate these factors against perceived influence. With this in mind, the\nobjective of this study is to explore this issue by evaluating the selected\nfactors. To achieve this goal in a reliable and reproducible manner, we took\nadvantage of previous attempts to conceptualize the mobile usability factors,\nbut we contribute by operationalizing these theoretical constructs into\nobservable and measurable phenomena. In this sense, the survey was designed and\ncarried out on the sample of 838 users in order to evaluate the significance of\nthe PACMAD+3 factors on the perceived usability of mobile applications. Our\nfindings show that, on average, users rated efficiency as highly important,\nwhile the remaining seven, namely: cognitive load, errors, learnability,\noperability, effectiveness, memorability, and understandability, were rated as\nmoderately important. The discussed results provide insight into the importance\nof usability attributes and quality criteria from both perspectives, ultimately\nfacilitating and securing the design and development of mobile applications.\nTherefore, our research contributes to the field of human-computer interaction,\nwith both theoretical and practical implications for mobile usability\nresearchers, UX designers, and quality assurance engineers.",

CARMA employs mutual information regularisation and\nlayer-wise stability constraints to mitigate feature fragmentation, ensuring\nstructured representations persist across and within layers.

Leveraging this methodology, we introduce DreamDDP, a training\nframework to accelerate low-bandwidth distributed training with three key\ninnovations: (1) partial local SGD with theoretical assurances of convergence\nrates comparable to S-SGD; (2) overlapping parameter synchronization with\ncomputation without extra GPU memory occupation; (3) identifying and exploiting\nthree properties to schedule the communication and computation to reduce the\ntraining time based on fine-grained profiling of layer-wise communication and\ncomputation time. Empirical evaluations conducted on 32 GPUs using prominent\ndeep learning models, including ResNet-18, ResNet-50, GPT-2, and Llama-2,\ndemonstrate that DreamDDP enhances the convergence properties of Local SGD (and\nAdam) and achieves speedups ranging from $1.49\\times$ to $3.91\\times$ over\nleading baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "As autonomous systems become more ubiquitous in daily life, ensuring high\nperformance with guaranteed safety is crucial. However, safety and performance\ncould be competing objectives, which makes their co-optimization difficult.\nLearning-based methods, such as Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL),\nachieve strong performance but lack formal safety guarantees due to safety\nbeing enforced as soft constraints, limiting their use in safety-critical\nsettings. Conversely, formal methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability\nAnalysis and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety\nassurances but often neglect performance, resulting in overly conservative\ncontrollers. To bridge this gap, we formulate the co-optimization of safety and\nperformance as a state-constrained optimal control problem, where performance\nobjectives are encoded via a cost function and safety requirements are imposed\nas state constraints. We demonstrate that the resultant value function\nsatisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which we approximate\nefficiently using a novel physics-informed machine learning framework. In\naddition, we introduce a conformal prediction-based verification strategy to\nquantify the learning errors, recovering a high-confidence safety value\nfunction, along with a probabilistic error bound on performance degradation.\nThrough several case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed\nframework in enabling scalable learning of safe and performant controllers for\ncomplex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.",

However, designing a pair of PnCs\nwith specified band gaps (BGs) and TIS frequency remains a challenging problem.\nIn this work, deep learning (DL) approaches are used for the engineering of\none-dimensional (1D) PnCs with high design freedoms. The considered 1D PnCs are\ncomposed of periodic solid scatterers embedded in the air background, whose\nunit cell is divided into a matrix with 32 * 32 pixels. First, the variational\nautoencoder is applied to reduce the dimensionality of unit cell images,\nallowing accurate reconstruction of PnC images with different numbers of\nscatterers. Subsequently, the multilayer perceptron and the tandem neural\nnetwork are used to realize the property prediction and customized design of 1D\nPnCs, respectively. The correlation coefficients for the property prediction\nand inverse design are more than 97%. The unit cell images of 1D PnCs with\nspecific BG properties could be successfully and instantaneously designed.\nImportantly, the implementation of a \"one-to-many\" design of PnC pairs with\nspecific TIS frequencies is realized. Furthermore, the reliability and\nrobustness of the constructed networks are confirmed by randomly specifying the\ndesign targets as well as the experimental verification. This study\ndemonstrates the broad application prospects of DL approaches in the field of\nPnC design and provides new ideas and methods for the intelligent design of\nartificially functional materials.",

The problem is reduced to solving a flow of\nforward-backward stochastic differential equations for open-loop equilibria,\nand to solving extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations for closed-loop\nequilibria. In particular, we derive semi-closed-form solutions for these two\ntypes of equilibria under a deterministic parameter setting.

However,\ndirectly adopting standard CXL primitives leads to performance degradation due\nto the high cost of maintaining cross-node cache coherence. To address the CXL\nchallenges, this paper introduces CtXnL, a software-hardware co-designed system\nthat implements a novel hybrid coherence primitive tailored to the loosely\ncoherent nature of transactional data. The core innovation of CtXnL is\nempowering transaction system developers with the ability to selectively\nachieve data coherence. Our evaluations on OLTP workloads demonstrate that\nCtXnL enhances performance, outperforming current network-based systems and\nachieves with up to 2.08x greater throughput than vanilla CXL memory sharing\narchitectures across universal transaction processing policies.",

The\nnumber of events in the burst is called a burst size. Some empirical analyses\nhave shown that consecutive burst sizes are correlated with each other.

Their formation\nand evolution remain debated, with interactions with satellite galaxies and\naccretion streams proposed as key contributors. Malin 1 has multiple\nsatellites, including Malin 1A, Malin 1B, and the newly reported Malin 1C,\nalong with eM1 at 350 kpc. Additionally, it exhibits two giant stellar streams,\nthe largest extending 200 kpc, likely linked to past interactions.\n  Aims. We investigate the orbital dynamics of Malin 1's satellites and their\nrelationship with the observed stellar streams, testing their consistency with\ndifferent formation scenarios.\n  Methods. We constructed gravitational potentials using optical and H I\nrotation curve data, using stellar, gaseous, and dark matter components. We\nexplored a wide parameter space to see if the candidate progenitors of the\nstellar streams could have originated from past interactions, testing both NFW\nand isothermal halo profiles.\n  Results. Among ten explored scenarios, seven produced bound orbital\nsolutions. The isothermal halo model, with a virial mass of 3.8 x 10^12 solar\nmasses and a virial radius of approximately 323 kpc, favors bound satellite\norbits more than the NFW model (1.7 x 10^12 solar masses). We find that eM1\nprobably had a pericenter passage 1.3 Gyr ago, Malin 1A around 1.4 Gyr ago, and\nMalin 1B's leading arm may be experiencing one now. Malin 1C displays both\nleading and trailing arms. Furthermore, we identify three unbound orbital\nsolutions that could link eM1, Malin 1A, or Malin 1B to the streams.\n  Conclusions. The alignment of satellites and streams supports the idea that\npast interactions contributed to Malin 1's morphology, enriched its gas\nreservoir, and influenced the development of its extended disk, providing\ninsights into the evolution of gLSBGs.",

Despite extensive research, understanding the Onsager\nreciprocity of orbital transport, fundamentally rooted in the second law of\nthermodynamics and time-reversal symmetry, remains elusive. In this study, we\nexperimentally demonstrate the Onsager reciprocity of orbital transport in an\norbital Edelstein system by utilizing nonlocal measurements.

Remarkably, we observe that the direct and inverse orbital-charge\nconversion processes produce identical electric voltages, confirming Onsager\nreciprocity in orbital transport. Additionally, we find that the orbital decay\nlength, approximately 100 nm at room temperature, is independent of Cu\nthickness and decreases with lowering temperature, revealing a distinct\ncontrast to spin transport behavior.

    "abstract": "Model-assisted estimation combines sample survey data with auxiliary\ninformation to increase precision when estimating finite population quantities.\nAccurately estimating the variance of model-assisted estimators is challenging:\nthe classical approach ignores uncertainty from estimating the working model\nfor the functional relationship between survey and auxiliary variables. This\napproach may be asymptotically valid, but can underestimate variance in\npractical settings with limited sample sizes. In this work, we develop a\nconnection between model-assisted estimation and the theory of U- and\nV-statistics. We demonstrate that when predictions from the working model for\nthe variable of interest can be represented as a U- or V-statistic, the\nresulting model-assisted estimator also admits a U- or V-statistic\nrepresentation. We exploit this connection to derive an improved estimator of\nthe exact variance of such model-assisted estimators. The class of working\nmodels for which this strategy can be used is broad, ranging from linear models\nto modern ensemble methods. We apply our approach to the model-assisted\nestimator constructed with a linear regression working model, commonly referred\nto as the generalized regression estimator, show that it can be re-written as a\nU-statistic, and propose an estimator of its exact variance. We illustrate our\nproposal and compare it against the classical asymptotic variance estimator\nusing household survey data from the American Community Survey.",

However,\nupon the investigation of \\pc papers in the relevant literature, we find that\nthere exists a persistent, extensive but under-explored confusion regarding\nthese two types of biases.

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a significant challenge in machine\nlearning, where a model forgets previously learned information upon learning\nnew tasks. Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs),\nthey continue to face challenges with CF during continual learning. The\nmajority of existing research focuses on analyzing forgetting patterns through\na singular training sequence, thereby overlooking the intricate effects that\ndiverse tasks have on model behavior. Our study explores CF across various\nsettings, discovering that model forgetting is influenced by both the specific\ntraining tasks and the models themselves. To this end, we interpret forgetting\nby examining the function vector (FV), a compact representation of functions in\nLLMs, offering a model-dependent indicator for the occurrence of CF. Through\ntheoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrated that CF in LLMs primarily\nstems from biases in function activation rather than the overwriting of task\nprocessing functions. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel function\nvector guided training methodology, incorporating a regularization technique to\nstabilize the FV and mitigate forgetting. Empirical tests on four benchmarks\nconfirm the effectiveness of our proposed training method, substantiating our\ntheoretical framework concerning CF and model function dynamics. We plan to\nmake our code publicly accessible in the near future.",

The\nprimary objective was to determine the most effective classifier-feature\ncombination for SMS spam detection. Our research offers two main contributions:\nfirst, by systematically examining various classifier and feature extraction\npairings, and second, by empirically evaluating their ability to distinguish\nspam messages. Our results demonstrate that the TF-IDF method consistently\noutperforms the bag-of-words approach across all six classifiers. Specifically,\nNaive Bayes with TF-IDF achieved the highest accuracy of 96.2%, with a\nprecision of 0.976 for non-spam and 0.754 for spam messages. Similarly, Support\nVector Machines with TF-IDF exhibited an accuracy of 94.5%, with a precision of\n0.926 for non-spam and 0.891 for spam. Deep Neural Networks using TF-IDF\nyielded an accuracy of 91.0%, with a recall of 0.991 for non-spam and 0.415 for\nspam messages. In contrast, classifiers such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear\nDiscriminant Analysis, and Decision Trees showed weaker performance, regardless\nof the feature extraction method employed. Furthermore, we observed substantial\nvariability in classifier effectiveness depending on the chosen feature\nextraction technique. Our findings emphasize the significance of feature\nselection in SMS spam detection and suggest that TF-IDF, when paired with Naive\nBayes, Support Vector Machines, or Deep Neural Networks, provides the most\nreliable performance.

We show that the {\\sl explodability} of these stars,\ni.e., which of a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) is formed, is sensitive\nto the strength of convective shell burning of C and O, and thus the mass\nfractions of C ($X$(C)) and O in the shell. For the small $^{12}$C($\\alpha,\n\\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate that yields larger $X$(C), $X$(C) is further\nenhanced by mixing of C from the overlying layer and then C shell burning is\nstrengthened. The extra heating by C shell burning tends to prevent the\ncontraction of outer layers and decrease the {\\sl compactness parameter} at\n$M_r$ = 2.5 M$_\\odot$. This effect leads to the formation of smaller mass cores\nof Si and Fe and steeper density and pressure gradients at the O burning shell\nin the presupernova models. If the pressure gradient there is steeper, the\nmodel is more likely to explode to form a NS rather than a BH. We describe the\npressure gradient against $M_r$ with $V/U$ and the density drop with $1/U$,\nwhere $U$ and $V$ are non-dimensional variables to describe the stellar\nstructure. We estimate the critical values of $V/U$ and $1/U$ at the O-burning\nshell above which the model is more likely to explode.

This investigative\nchallenge is further complicated by the semantics and subjectivity of the input\nprompts involved in the LLM conversation with its user and the context of the\nenvironment to which the conversation is being carried out. Hence, the\nchallenge for AI security investigators would be two-fold. The first is to\nidentify adversarial prompt injects and then to assess whether the input prompt\nis contextually benign or adversarial. For the first step, this could be done\nusing existing AI security solutions like guardrails to detect and protect the\nLLMs. Guardrails have been developed using a variety of approaches. A popular\napproach is to use signature based. Another popular approach to develop AI\nmodels to classify such prompts include the use of NLP based models like a\nlanguage model. However, in the context of conducting an AI security\ninvestigation of prompt injects, these guardrails lack the ability to aid\ninvestigators in triaging or assessing the identified input prompts. In this\napplied research exploration, we explore the use of a text generation\ncapabilities of LLM to detect prompt injects and generate explanation for its\ndetections to aid AI security investigators in assessing and triaging of such\nprompt inject detections. The practical benefit of such a tool is to ease the\ntask of conducting investigation into prompt injects.",

    "abstract": "It is usually supposed that only low-symmetry two-dimensional (2D) materials\nexhibit anisotropy, here we show that high-symmetry 2D semiconductors can show\nsignificant anisotropy in momentum space due to the band structure anisotropy\nin k-space. The basic reason is that different k-points in the Brillouin zone\nhave different symmetry. Using 2D semiconductor WSe$_2$ as the example, we\nconstruct lateral heterostructures with zigzag and armchair connections to 2D\nmetal NbSe$_2$, and the electronic structure and contact characteristics of\nthese two connections are analyzed. It is found that both connections exhibit\np-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) but the sizes of SBH are very different\n(of 0.03 eV and 0.50 eV), mainly because the band-edge energies of WSe$_2$ are\ndifferent along the two mutually perpendicular directions in momentum space.\nThere are two factors contributing to the SBH anisotropy: one is the different\ninterface structure and the other is the band edge anisotropy of the 2D\nsemiconductor WSe$_2$. Since the two interface structures give only a\ndifference in interface potential change by less than 0.1 eV, the SBH variation\nof ~0.47 eV is mainly from the band structure anisotropy in momentum-space. So,\nhigh-symmetry 2D materials may exhibit highly anisotropic electronic states in\nmomentum space and this affects the transport properties. Our current work\nextends the research field of 2D material anisotropy to 2D materials with high\nreal-space symmetry, thus greatly expands the candidate materials for\nanisotropic studies and provides new guidance for optimizing the performance of\n2D material devices via controlling transport directions.",

Doing so leads to very different philosophical interpretations of a\ntheory. For instance, our world would be 'hyperdeterministic' with analytic\nfunctions, in the sense that every field configuration is uniquely determined\nby its restriction to an arbitrarily small region. Relatedly, the hole argument\nof general relativity does not get off the ground.

To tackle this challenge, we introduce FeaKM, a novel method that\nemploys Feature-level Keypoints Matching to effectively correct pose\ndiscrepancies among collaborating agents. Our approach begins by utilizing a\nconfidence map to identify and extract salient points from intermediate feature\nrepresentations, allowing for the computation of their descriptors.

    "abstract": "Defocus blur is a common problem in photography. It arises when an image is\ncaptured with a wide aperture, resulting in a shallow depth of field. Sometimes\nit is desired, e.g., in portrait effect. Otherwise, it is a problem from both\nan aesthetic point of view and downstream computer vision tasks, such as\nsegmentation and depth estimation. Defocusing an out-of-focus image to obtain\nan all-in-focus image is a highly challenging and often ill-posed problem. A\nrecent work exploited dual-pixel (DP) image information, widely available in\nconsumer DSLRs and high-end smartphones, to solve the problem of defocus\ndeblurring. DP sensors result in two sub-aperture views containing defocus\ndisparity cues. A given pixel's disparity is directly proportional to the\ndistance from the focal plane. However, the existing methods adopt a na\\\"ive\napproach of a channel-wise concatenation of the two DP views without explicitly\nutilizing the disparity cues within the network. In this work, we propose to\nperform an explicit cross-correlation between the two DP views to guide the\nnetwork for appropriate deblurring in different image regions. We adopt\nmulti-scale cross-correlation to handle blur and disparities at different\nscales. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our multi-scale\ncross-correlation network (MCCNet) reveals that it achieves better defocus\ndeblurring than existing state-of-the-art methods despite having lesser\ncomputational complexity.",

However, existing PT\napproaches face two significant issues: (i) They overlook intrinsic semantic\nassociations between soft prompt tokens, leading to high discreteness and\nlimited interactions, thus reducing the model's comprehension and effectiveness\nin complex tasks. (ii) Due to the complexity of downstream tasks, long soft\nprompt is necessitated to improve performance, but prompt length correlates\npositively with memory usage and computational costs.

It\nthen utilizes a compressed outer product module to facilitate multiple\ninteractions among prompt tokens, exploring their intrinsic associations to\nenhance knowledge representation.

    "abstract": "In this study, we calculate for the first time the impacts of neutron\nstar(NS) structure on the type I X-ray burst ashes using the \\texttt{MESA}\ncode. We find an increased mass fraction of the heavier elements with\nincreasing surface gravity (increase mass or decrease radius), resulting in a\nhigher average mass number ($A_{\\rm ash}$) of burst ashes (except for higher\nmass NS due to the competition between the envelope temperature and the\nrecurrence time). The burst strength ($\\alpha$) increases as surface gravity\nincreases, which indicates the positive correlation between $A_{\\rm ash}$ and\n$\\alpha$ with changes in surface gravity. If the $\\alpha$ value is higher,\nheavier $p$-nuclei should be produced by the type I X-ray burst\nnucleosynthesis. Besides, the effects of various burst input parameters, e.g.\nbase heating ($Q_{\\rm b}$), metallicity ($Z$) and some new reaction rates are\ncalculated for comparison. We find that the heavier nuclei synthesis is\ninversely correlated to the base heating/metallicity, the smaller the base\nheating/metallicity, the greater the mass fraction of the heavier elements. The\n$\\alpha$ value decreases as $Q_{\\rm b}$ or $Z$ decreases, which also indicates\nthe positive correlation between $A_{\\rm ash}$ and $\\alpha$ with variation in\n$Q_{\\rm b}$ or $Z$. The new reaction rates from the $(p,\\gamma)$ reactions on\n$^{17}\\rm{F}$, $^{19}\\rm{F}$, $^{26}\\rm{P}$, $^{56}\\rm{Cu}$, $^{65}\\rm{As}$,\nand $(\\alpha,p)$ reaction on $^{22}\\rm{Mg}$ have only minimal effects on burst\nashes.

The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has\nboosted it to the next level by showing real-time rendering potentials. An\nintuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take\ninto account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross\nsection, as suggested by optics. Therefore, we develop a novel approach that\nadds this dependency to the modeling itself.

The gradients for material properties are\ntherefore not only from color but also from opacity, facilitating a constraint\nfor their optimization. Therefore, the proposed method incorporates more\naccurate physical properties compared to previous works.

(2) Despite these deviations, Elo frequently outperforms\nmore complex rating systems, such as mElo and pairwise models, which are\nspecifically designed to account for non-BT components in the data,\nparticularly in terms of win rate prediction.

(b) Through extensive\nsynthetic experiments on data generated from transitive but non-BT models, such\nas strongly or weakly stochastic transitive models, we show that the\n''sparsity'' of practical matching data is a critical factor behind Elo's\nsuperior performance in prediction compared to more complex rating systems.

Although this\nmethod presents improvements over traditional strategies, its dependence on\nstatic thresholds limits its theoretical optimality.\n  In this paper, we propose a new conceptual model for optimizing hash table\nprobing, inspired by human behavior in selecting restroom stalls - dubbed the\n\"Bathroom Model.\" Unlike fixed or purely random approaches, our technique\ndynamically updates probing decisions using previously observed occupancy\npatterns, resulting in a more intelligent and adaptive search process. We\nrigorously formalize this model, analyze its theoretical properties, and\nbenchmark its performance against leading hash table algorithms. Our findings\nindicate that adaptive probing mechanisms can significantly enhance search\nefficiency while keeping computational demands minimal. This work not only\nsheds new light on an extensively studied problem but also points to broader\nalgorithmic opportunities in rethinking classical data structures.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has drawn significant\nattention in the area of 3D map reconstruction and visual SLAM. While extensive\nresearch has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor\nalone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial\nMeasurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor\nnavigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed\nGS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented\nby 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene\nrepresentation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation\nperformance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the\nfirst GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the\nanalytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To\nmaintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce\na motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative\npose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For\nvalidation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky,\nsub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for\nevaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing\nnavigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.",

Such a setting is restricted in real-world\napplications, since the target network might contain additional classes that\nare not present in the source. In this work, we study a more realistic open-set\ncross-network node classification (O-CNNC) problem, where the target network\ncontains all the known classes in the source and further contains several\ntarget-private classes unseen in the source. Borrowing the concept from\nopen-set domain adaptation, all target-private classes are defined as an\nadditional unknown class. To address the challenging O-CNNC problem, we propose\nan unknown-excluded adversarial graph domain alignment (UAGA) model with a\nseparate-adapt training strategy. Firstly, UAGA roughly separates known classes\nfrom unknown class, by training a graph neural network encoder and a\nneighborhood-aggregation node classifier in an adversarial framework. Then,\nunknown-excluded adversarial domain alignment is customized to align only\ntarget nodes from known classes with the source, while pushing target nodes\nfrom unknown class far away from the source, by assigning positive and negative\ndomain adaptation coefficient to known class nodes and unknown class nodes.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant\noutperformance of the proposed UAGA over state-of-the-art methods on O-CNNC.",

Here, we utilized temperature-dependent in-situ Ni K-edge X-ray\nAbsorption Near-edge Spectroscopy (XANES) to probe the Ni-3d/4p electronic\nstates of La3Ni2O7-delta and La2PrNi2O7-delta samples down to 4.8 K, enabling\nus to witness the evolution of both in-plane d_(x^2-y^2)/p_x (p_y) and\nout-of-plane d_(3z^2-r^2)/p_z orbitals of NiO6 octahedron across the DW\ntransition. Main edge energy associated with Ni 4p orbital shows an anomalous\ndecline near DW transition, signifying the occurrence of lattice distortions as\na hallmark of charge density wave. Below DW transition, the enlarged crystal\nfield splitting (CFS) indicates an enhanced NiO6 octahedral distortion.\nIntriguingly, magnetic Pr substituents could activate the mutual interplay of\nd_(x^2-y^2) and d_(3z^2-r^2) orbitals.

    "abstract": "Auto-evaluating language models (LMs), i.e., using a grader LM to evaluate\nthe candidate LM, is an appealing way to accelerate the evaluation process and\nthe cost associated with it. But this presents a paradox: how can we trust the\ngrader LM, which is presumably weaker than the candidate LM, to assess problems\nthat are beyond the frontier of the capabilities of either model or both? For\ninstance, today's LMs struggle on graduate-level physics and Olympiad-level\nmath, making them unreliable graders in these domains.\n  We show that providing privileged information -- such as ground-truth\nsolutions or problem-specific guidelines -- improves automated evaluations on\nsuch frontier problems. This approach offers two key advantages. First, it\nexpands the range of problems where LMs graders apply. Specifically, weaker\nmodels can now rate the predictions of stronger models. Second, privileged\ninformation can be used to devise easier variations of challenging problems\nwhich improves the separability of different LMs on tasks where their\nperformance is generally low. With this approach, general-purpose LM graders\nmatch the state of the art performance on RewardBench, surpassing almost all\nthe specially-tuned models. LM graders also outperform individual human raters\non Vibe-Eval, and approach human expert graders on Olympiad-level math\nproblems.",

However, there has been no systematic study to explore the trade-offs\namong these dimensions. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of\nindividual techniques and identify the performance factors affecting these\nstorage methods by proposing a common abstraction for DGS design and\nimplementing a generic test framework based on this abstraction. Our findings\nhighlight several key insights: 1) Existing DGS methods exhibit substantial\nspace overhead. For example, Aspen consumes 3.3-10.8x more memory than CSR,\nwhile the optimal fine-grained methods consume 4.1-8.9x more memory than CSR,\nindicating a significant memory overhead. 2) Existing methods often overlook\nmemory access impact of modern architectures, leading to performance\ndegradation compared to continuous storage methods. 3) Fine-grained concurrency\ncontrol methods, in particular, suffer from severe efficiency and space issues\ndue to maintaining versions and performing checks for each neighbor.

We also\nconsider applications to free boundary problems and stochastic currents. These\nresults provide insight into the behavior of geometric objects under non-smooth\nperturbations, which have relevance in geometric measure theory, dynamical\nsystems, and optimal transport. We highlight various open problems regarding\nweaker regularity and more involved geometric settings.",

    "abstract": "Unlike digital computers, the brain exhibits spontaneous activity even during\ncomplete rest, despite the evolutionary pressure for energy efficiency.\nInspired by the critical brain hypothesis, which proposes that the brain\noperates optimally near a critical point of phase transition in the dynamics of\nneural networks to improve computational efficiency, we postulate that\nspontaneous activity plays a homeostatic role in the development and\nmaintenance of criticality. Criticality in the brain is associated with the\nbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (EI balance), which\nis essential for maintaining neural computation performance. Here, we\nhypothesize that both criticality and EI balance are stabilized by appropriate\nnoise levels and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) windows. Using\nspiking neural network (SNN) simulations and in vitro experiments with\ndissociated neuronal cultures, we demonstrated that while repetitive stimuli\ntransiently disrupt both criticality and EI balance, spontaneous activity can\ndevelop and maintain these properties and prolong the fading memory of past\nstimuli. Our findings suggest that the brain may achieve self-optimization and\nmemory consolidation as emergent functions of noise-driven spontaneous\nactivity. This noise-harnessing mechanism provides insights for designing\nenergy-efficient neural networks, and may explain the critical function of\nsleep in maintaining homeostasis and consolidating memory.",
