    "abstract": "Modern cutting-edge AI applications are being developed over fast-evolving,\nheterogeneous, nascent hardware devices. This requires frequent reworking of\nthe AI software stack to adopt bottom-up changes from new hardware, which takes\ntime for general-purpose software libraries. Consequently, real applications\noften develop custom software stacks optimized for their specific workloads and\nhardware. Custom stacks help in quick development and optimization, but incur a\nlot of redundant efforts across applications in writing non-portable code. This\npaper discusses an alternative communication library interface for AI\napplications that offers both portability and performance by reducing redundant\nefforts while maintaining flexibility for customization. We present MSCCL++, a\nnovel abstraction of GPU communication based on separation of concerns: (1) a\nprimitive interface provides a minimal hardware abstraction as a common ground\nfor software and hardware developers to write custom communication, and (2)\nhigher-level portable interfaces and specialized implementations enable\noptimization for different workloads and hardware environments. This approach\nmakes the primitive interface reusable across applications while enabling\nhighly flexible optimization. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines (NCCL,\nRCCL, and MSCCL), MSCCL++ achieves speedups of up to 5.4$\\times$ for collective\ncommunication and up to 15% for real-world AI inference workloads. MSCCL++ is\nin production of multiple AI services provided by Microsoft Azure, and is also\nadopted by RCCL, the GPU collective communication library maintained by AMD.\nMSCCL++ is open-source and available at https://github.com/microsoft/mscclpp.",

    "abstract": "Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) is a class of promising post-CMOS\ntechnologies that transmit information through electric or magnetic fields\ninstead of current flow. They utilize basic building blocks called cells, which\ncan form gates that implement Boolean functions. However, the design\nconstraints for FCN circuits differ significantly from those for CMOS. One\nmajor challenge is that wires in FCN have to be realized as gates, i.e., they\nare constructed from cells and incur the same costs as gates. Additionally, all\nFCN technologies are fabricated on a single layer, e.g., a silicon surface,\nrequiring all elements -- gates and wires -- to be placed within that same\nlayer. Consequently, FCN employs special gates, called wire crossings, to\nenable signals to cross. While existing wire-crossing implementations are\ncomplex and were previously considered costly, initial efforts have aimed at\nminimizing their use. However, recent physical simulations and experiments on a\nquantum annealing platform have shown that currently used wire crossings in FCN\nsignificantly compromise signal stability, to the extent that circuits cannot\nfunction reliably. This work addresses that issue by introducing the first\nplacement and routing algorithm that produces fully planar FCN circuits,\neliminating the need for all wire crossings. For a comparative evaluation, a\nstate-of-the-art placement and routing algorithm was also modified to enforce\nplanarity. However, our proposed algorithm is more scalable and can handle\ninputs with up to 149k gates, enabling it to process circuits that are 182x\nmore complex than those handled by the modified state-of-the-art algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In clinical trials, inferences on clinical outcomes are often made\nconditional on specific selective processes. For instance, only when a\ntreatment demonstrates a significant effect on the primary outcome, further\nanalysis is conducted to investigate its efficacy on selected secondary\noutcomes. Similarly, inferences may also depend on whether a trial is\nterminated early at interim stage. While conventional approaches primarily aim\nto control the family-wise error rate through multiplicity adjustments, they do\nnot necessarily ensure the desired statistical property of the inference\nresult, when the analysis is conducted according to a selective process. For\nexample, the conditional coverage level of a regular confidence interval under\na selective processes can be very different from its nominal level even after\nadjustment for multiple testing. In this paper, we argue that the validity of\nthe inference procedure conditional on selective process is important in many\napplications. In addition, we propose to construct confidence intervals with\ncorrect conditional coverage probability by accounting for related selective\nprocess. Specifically, our approach involves a pivotal quantity constructed by\ninversing the cumulative distribution function of a truncated normal\ndistribution induced by the selective process. Theoretical justification and\ncomprehensive simulations illustrate the effectiveness of this method in\nrealistic settings. We also apply our method to analyze data from the SPRINT,\nresulting in more conservative but conditionally valid confidence intervals for\nthe average treatment effect than those originally published.",

These processes are\ndifficult to probe and quantify experimentally, often limiting measurements to\nmacroscopic properties. Here, fundamental mechanisms in such interactions are\nelucidated through detailed numerical simulation of Mach 2 and 3 shock waves\ninteracting with 100 $\\mu$m water droplets. Using a thermodynamically\nconsistent two-phase formulation with adaptive mesh refinement, the simulations\ncapture droplet surface instabilities and atomization into secondary droplets\nin great detail. The results show that droplet breakup occurs through a coupled\nmulti-stage process, including droplet flattening, formation of surface\ninstabilities and piercing, and the shedding of secondary droplets from the\nligaments of the deformed primary droplet. When considering the dimensionless\ntimescale of Ranger and Nicholls ($\\tau$), these processes occur at similar\nrates for the different shock strengths. The PDFs for the Sauter mean diameters\nof secondary droplets are bimodal log-normal distributions at $\\tau=2$. Modest\ndifferences in the degree and rate of liquid mass transfer into droplets less\nthan 5 $\\mu$m in diameter are hypothesized to partially derive from differences\nin droplet surface piercing modes.

However,\nfluid models are only valid if the SOL is highly collisional, an assumption\nthat is valid in many present day experiments but is questionable in the\nhigh-power scenarios envisioned for burning plasmas and fusion pilot plants.\nThis paper reports on comparisons between fluid and kinetic simulations of the\nscrape off layer (SOL) for parameters and geometry representative of the\nSpherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) fusion pilot plant. The\nSOLPS-ITER (fluid) and Gkeyll (gyrokinetic) codes are operated in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric mode, which replaces turbulence with ad-hoc\ndiffusivities. In kinetic simulations, we observe that the ions in the upstream\nSOL experience significant mirror trapping. This substantially increases the\nupstream temperature and has important implications for impurity dynamics. We\nshow that the mirror force, which is excluded in SOLPS's form of fluid\nequations, enhances the electrostatic potential drop along the field line in\nthe SOL. We also show that the assumption of equal main ion and impurity\ntemperatures, which is made in commonly used fluid codes, is invalid. The\ncombination of these effects results in superior confinement of impurities to\nthe divertor region in kinetic simulations, consistent with our earlier\npredictions. This effect can be dramatic, reducing the midplane impurity\ndensity by orders of magnitude. These results indicate that in reactor-like\nregimes the tolerable downstream impurity densities may be higher than would be\npredicted by fluid simulations, allowing for higher radiated power while\navoiding unacceptable core contamination.

    "abstract": "Interactions between short laser pulses and electron bunches determine a wide\nrange of accelerator applications. Finding spatiotemporal overlap between\nfew-micron-sized optical and electron beams is critical, yet there are few\nroutine diagnostics for this purpose. We present a method for achieving\nspatiotemporal overlap between a picosecond laser pulse and a relativistic\nsub-ps electron bunch. The method uses the transient change in optical\ntransmission of a Ce:YAG screen upon irradiation with a short electron bunch to\nco-time the electron and laser beams. We demonstrate and quantify the\nperformance of this method using an inverse Compton source comprised of a 30\nMeV electron beam from an X-band linac focused to a 10 $\\mu$m spot, overlapped\nwith a joule-class picosecond Yb:YAG laser system. This method is applicable to\nelectron beams with few-microjoule bunch energies, and uses standard\nscintillator screens common in electron accelerators.",

    "abstract": "Visual Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) requires a robot to locate a target\nobject in an unseen environment using egocentric observations. However,\ndecision-making policies often struggle to transfer to unseen environments and\nnovel target objects, which is the core generalization problem. Traditional\nend-to-end learning methods exacerbate this issue, as they rely on memorizing\nspatial patterns rather than employing structured reasoning, limiting their\nability to generalize effectively. In this letter, we introduce Closed-Loop\nHierarchical Chain-of-Thought Navigation (CL-CoTNav), a vision-language model\n(VLM)-driven ObjectNav framework that integrates structured reasoning and\nclosed-loop feedback into navigation decision-making. To enhance\ngeneralization, we fine-tune a VLM using multi-turn question-answering (QA)\ndata derived from human demonstration trajectories. This structured dataset\nenables hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (H-CoT) prompting, systematically\nextracting compositional knowledge to refine perception and decision-making,\ninspired by the human cognitive process of locating a target object through\niterative reasoning steps. Additionally, we propose a Closed-Loop H-CoT\nmechanism that incorporates detection and reasoning confidence scores into\ntraining. This adaptive weighting strategy guides the model to prioritize\nhigh-confidence data pairs, mitigating the impact of noisy inputs and enhancing\nrobustness against hallucinated or incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments\nin the AI Habitat environment demonstrate CL-CoTNav's superior generalization\nto unseen scenes and novel object categories. Our method consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches in navigation success rate (SR) and\nsuccess weighted by path length (SPL) by 22.4\\%.

The integration of BaTiO3 as a base material\nfor the coating allowed the successful use of otherwise\ndischarge-ignition-inhibiting materials such as MnO2-CuO applied as a full\ncoating. Application of pure BaTiO3 led to highly porous coatings that do not\nhinder the discharge ignition and show a negligible influence on n-butane\nconversion while reducing byproduct formation. Thus, BaTiO3 was identified as a\nsuitable structure-directing agent in two-component coatings, using 1:1 and 1:2\nratios of BaTiO3:catalyst coatings.

The study involved analysing system performance across\nvarious demographic groups, particularly focusing on gender and age-based\ncohorts. Performance evaluation was based on multiple metrics, including\nnormalised costs and cross-entropy. We employed calibration techniques trained\nseparately on predefined demographic groups to address group-dependent\nmiscalibration. Analysis revealed significant performance disparities across\ngroups despite strong global metrics. The system showed systematic biases,\nmisclassifying healthy speakers over 55 as having a voice disorder and speakers\nwith disorders aged 14-30 as healthy. Group-specific calibration improved\nposterior probability quality, reducing overconfidence. For young disordered\nspeakers, low severity scores were identified as contributing to poor system\nperformance. For older speakers, age-related voice characteristics and\npotential limitations in the pretrained Hubert model used as feature extractor\nlikely affected results. The study demonstrates that global performance metrics\nare insufficient for evaluating AVDD system performance. Group-specific\nanalysis may unmask problems in system performance which are hidden within\nglobal metrics. Further, group-dependent calibration strategies help mitigate\nbiases, resulting in a more reliable indication of system confidence.

Light curves showing the\nevolution of the flare's irradiance as a function of time taken by MAVEN are\nwell correlated with the brightness evolution of fan structures observed in the\nPROBA2 SWAP 174 {\\AA} passband, suggesting that the radiance of structures near\nthe flare site was influenced by emission from the flare. Because SWAP did not\ndirectly observe the flare itself, this event represents a rare opportunity to\nstudy the evolution of emission near a flare without the risk of instrumental\nscattered light contaminating the observations. We analyze this evolution and\nimplement a simple model to explore the possibility that resonant excitation\n(or resonant scattering) plays an important role in driving coronal EUV\nemission during flaring events. Our modeling shows that for a large flare,\nresonant excitation could increase emission from nearby structures by about\n45%, consistent with our findings that the involved structures observed by SWAP\nincreased in brightness by about 60% during the flare. We conclude that\nresonant excitation may play an important role in driving coronal EUV emission\nunder certain circumstances and should be accounted for in models and\nemission-based analysis tools.",

We highlight an\nimbalanced metabolic axis of growth and proliferation (anabolic) versus\nmaintenance and dormancy (catabolic), focusing on major mechanisms including\nIGF-1, mTOR, AMPK, and Klotho. We also relate this axis to the hyperfunction\ntheory of aging, which similarly implicates anabolic mechanisms like mTOR in\naging and disease. Next, we highlight the Brain-Body Energy Conservation model,\nwhich connects the hyperfunction theory with energetic trade-offs that induce\nhypofunction and catabolic health risks like impaired immunity. Finally, we\ndiscuss how modern environmental mismatches exacerbate this process. Following\nour review, we discuss future research directions to better understand health\nrisk. This includes studying IGF-1, mTOR, AMPK, and Klotho and how they relate\nto health and aging in human subsistence populations, including with lifestyle\nshifts. It also includes understanding their role in the developmental origins\nof health and disease as well as the social determinants of health disparities.\nFurther, we discuss the need for future studies on exceptionally long-lived\nspecies to understand potentially underappreciated trade-offs and costs that\ncome with their longevity. We close with considering possible implications for\ntherapeutics, including (1) compensatory pathways counteracting treatments, (2)\na Goldilocks zone, in which suppressing anabolic metabolism too far introduces\ncatabolic health risks, and (3) species constraints, in which therapeutics\ntested in shorter lived species with greater anabolic imbalance will be less\neffective in humans.",

    "abstract": "Sinking marine snow particles, composed primarily of organic matter, control\nthe global export of photosynthetically fixed carbon from the ocean surface to\ndepth. The fate of sedimenting marine snow particles is in part regulated by\ntheir encounters with suspended, micron-sized objects, which leads to mass\naccretion by the particles and potentially alters their buoyancy, and with\nbacteria that can colonize the particles and degrade them. Their collision\nrates are typically calculated using two types of models focusing either on\ndirect (ballistic) interception with a finite interaction range, or\nadvective-diffusive capture with a zero interaction range. Since the range of\napplicability of the two models is unknown, and many relevant marine encounter\nscenarios span across both regimes, quantifying such encounters remains\nchallenging, because the two models yield asymptotically different predictions\nat high P\\'{e}clet numbers. Here, we reconcile the two limiting approaches by\nquantifying the encounters in the general case using a combination of\ntheoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Solving the advection-diffusion\nequation in Stokes flow around a sphere to model mass transfer to a large\nsinking particle by small yet finite-sized objects, we determine a new formula\nfor the Sherwood number as a function of two dimensionless parameters: the\nP\\'{e}clet number and the ratio of small to large particle sizes. We find that\ndiffusion can play a significant role in generating encounters even at high Pe.\nAt Pe as high as $10^6$, the direct interception model underestimates the\nencounter rate by up to two orders of magnitude. This overlooked contribution\nof diffusion to encounters suggests that important processes affecting the fate\nof marine snow, such as colonization by bacteria and plankton or accretion of\nneutrally buoyant gels, may proceed at a rate much faster than previously\nthought.",

GX 9+1, located in the Galactic bulge, is a persistently\nbright Atoll source known for its spectral variability along the color-color\ndiagram. Our spectral analysis during the soft state confirms emission\ndominated by a soft blackbody and thermal Comptonization components, with no\nevidence of a hard X-ray tail. These observations suggest a relatively\nlow-inclination system (23 deg < i < 46 deg) with a weak reflection component,\nconsistent with emission from the accretion disk and neutron star boundary\nlayer. Spectro-polarimetric analysis reveals no significant polarization in the\n2-8 keV range, with a 3-sigma upper limit for the polarization degree of 1.9%.\nHowever, marginal evidence of polarization was detected in the 2-3 keV band at\nthe 95.5% confidence level (2-sigma), suggesting potential contributions from\nscattering effects in the individual spectral components (disk, reflection, and\nComptonization) that could cancel each other out due to the different\norientations of their polarization angles. This behavior aligns with other\nAtoll sources observed by IXPE, which typically exhibit lower and less variable\npolarization degrees compared to Z-class sources.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental task in Intelligent Tutoring Systems\n(ITS), which aims to model the dynamic knowledge states of students based on\ntheir interaction histories. However, existing KT models often rely on a global\nforgetting decay mechanism for capturing learning patterns, assuming that\nstudents' performance is predominantly influenced by their most recent\ninteractions. Such approaches fail to account for the diverse and complex\nlearning patterns arising from individual differences and varying learning\nstages. To address this limitation, we propose RouterKT, a novel\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to capture heterogeneous\nlearning patterns by enabling experts to specialize in different patterns\nwithout any handcrafted learning pattern bias such as forgetting decay.\nSpecifically, RouterKT introduces a \\textbf{person-wise routing mechanism} to\neffectively model individual-specific learning behaviors and employs\n\\textbf{multi-heads as experts} to enhance the modeling of complex and diverse\npatterns. Comprehensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nRouterKT exhibits significant flexibility and improves the performance of\nvarious KT backbone models, with a maximum average AUC improvement of 3.29\\%\nacross different backbones and datasets, outperforming other state-of-the-art\nmodels.

The quality of acquired images directly influences\nthe ability of autonomous driving systems to correctly recognize and respond to\nother vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles in real-time. However, real\nenvironments present extreme variations in lighting, causing saturation\nproblems and resulting in the loss of crucial details for detection.\nTraditionally, High Dynamic Range (HDR) images have been preferred for their\nability to capture a broad spectrum of light intensities, but the need for\nmultiple captures to construct HDR images is inefficient for real-time\napplications in autonomous vehicles. To address these issues, this work\nintroduces the use of modulo sensors for robust object detection.

Second\nharmonic generation microscopy (SHM) is a powerful tool for optimizing domain\nengineering (E-field poling), and it enabled the fabrication of near-ideal QPM\ngratings.

    "abstract": "Recent steganographic schemes, starting with Meteor (CCS'21), rely on\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) to resolve a historically-challenging\ntask of disguising covert communication as ``innocent-looking''\nnatural-language communication. However, existing methods are vulnerable to\n``re-randomization attacks,'' where slight changes to the communicated text,\nthat might go unnoticed, completely destroy any hidden message. This is also a\nvulnerability in more traditional encryption-based stegosystems, where\nadversaries can modify the randomness of an encryption scheme to destroy the\nhidden message while preserving an acceptable covertext to ordinary users. In\nthis work, we study the problem of robust steganography. We introduce formal\ndefinitions of weak and strong robust LLM-based steganography, corresponding to\ntwo threat models in which natural language serves as a covertext channel\nresistant to realistic re-randomization attacks. We then propose two\nconstructions satisfying these notions. We design and implement our\nsteganographic schemes that embed arbitrary secret messages into natural\nlanguage text generated by LLMs, ensuring recoverability even under adversarial\nparaphrasing and rewording attacks. To support further research and real-world\ndeployment, we release our implementation and datasets for public use.",

We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped\nsource (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H II region, excited by a\nsingle O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble\nis still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$.

Using the SimLine non-LTE\nradiative transfer code, the [C II] emission can be modeled to originate from\nthree regions. First, a central H II region with little C$^+$ in the fully\nionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around\n$2500\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer\nis a slowly expanding [C II] shell with an expansion velocity of\n$\\sim\\,$$2.6\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. The outermost layer exhibits a temperature\nand velocity gradient that produces the observed self-absorption features in\nthe optically thick [C II] line ($\\tau \\sim 4$) leading to an apparent deficit\nin [C II] emission and a low ratio of [C II] to total far-infrared (FIR)\nemission. We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C II] flux and\nfind a linear correlation between [C II] and FIR without a [C II]-deficit.

To uncover the extent and nature\nof these biases, we build upon existing benchmarks to create five datasets\ncontaining mismatched image-text pairs, covering topics in mathematics,\nscience, and visual descriptions.

In addition, we explore\nthree mitigation strategies: simple prompt modifications, modifications that\nexplicitly instruct models on how to handle conflicting information (akin to\nchain-of-thought prompting), and a task decomposition strategy that analyzes\neach modality separately before combining their results.

These metrics often compress accuracy\nassessment into a single value, obscuring models' specific strengths and\nweaknesses. The prevailing evaluation protocol, link prediction, operates under\nthe unrealistic assumption that an entity's properties, for which values are to\nbe predicted, are known in advance.

    "abstract": "Incivility refers to behaviors that violate collective norms and disrupt\ncooperation within the political process. Although large-scale online data and\nautomated techniques have enabled the quantitative analysis of uncivil\ndiscourse, prior research has predominantly focused on impoliteness or\ntoxicity, often overlooking other behaviors that undermine democratic values.\nTo address this gap, we propose a multidimensional conceptual framework\nencompassing Impoliteness, Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric, Hate\nSpeech and Stereotyping, and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values.\nUsing this framework, we measure the spread of online political incivility in\nBrazil using approximately 5 million tweets posted by 2,307 political\ninfluencers during the 2022 Brazilian general election. Through statistical\nmodeling and network analysis, we examine the dynamics of uncivil posts at\ndifferent election stages, identify key disseminators and audiences, and\nexplore the mechanisms driving the spread of uncivil information online. Our\nfindings indicate that impoliteness is more likely to surge during election\ncampaigns. In contrast, the other dimensions of incivility are often triggered\nby specific violent events. Moreover, we find that left-aligned individual\ninfluencers are the primary disseminators of online incivility in the Brazilian\nTwitter/X sphere and that they disseminate not only direct incivility but also\nindirect incivility when discussing or opposing incivility expressed by others.\nThey relay those content from politicians, media agents, and individuals to\nreach broader audiences, revealing a diffusion pattern mixing the direct and\ntwo-step flows of communication theory. This study offers new insights into the\nmultidimensional nature of incivility in Brazilian politics and provides a\nconceptual framework that can be extended to other political contexts.",

    "abstract": "Generative masked transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across\nvarious content generation tasks, primarily due to their ability to effectively\nmodel large-scale dataset distributions with high consistency. However, in the\nanimation domain, large datasets are not always available. Applying generative\nmasked modeling to generate diverse instances from a single MoCap reference may\nlead to overfitting, a challenge that remains unexplored. In this work, we\npresent MotionDreamer, a localized masked modeling paradigm designed to learn\ninternal motion patterns from a given motion with arbitrary topology and\nduration. By embedding the given motion into quantized tokens with a novel\ndistribution regularization method, MotionDreamer constructs a robust and\ninformative codebook for local motion patterns. Moreover, a sliding window\nlocal attention is introduced in our masked transformer, enabling the\ngeneration of natural yet diverse animations that closely resemble the\nreference motion patterns. As demonstrated through comprehensive experiments,\nMotionDreamer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods that are typically GAN\nor Diffusion-based in both faithfulness and diversity. Thanks to the\nconsistency and robustness of the quantization-based approach, MotionDreamer\ncan also effectively perform downstream tasks such as temporal motion editing,\n\\textcolor{update}{crowd animation}, and beat-aligned dance generation, all\nusing a single reference motion.

To this\nend, we propose an approach that detects which high-level goals and patterns\n(i.e. programming plans) exist in a student program with LLMs. We show that\nboth the full GPT-4o model and a small variant (GPT-4o-mini) can detect these\nplans with remarkable accuracy, outperforming baselines inspired by\nconventional approaches to code analysis.

These smaller models can be\nincorporated into autograders for open-ended code-writing exercises to provide\nfeedback for students' implicit planning skills, even when their program is\nsyntactically incorrect.

Our findings reveal that Li and Na intercalation primarily\nmodifies the electronic properties of Nb2C without inducing significant\nstructural distortions, as indicated by Raman intensity variations. Adsorption\nenergy calculations show that the T4 and H3 sites are the most favorable for\nmetal intercalation, with Nb2CO2 exhibiting stronger adsorption due to oxygen\nfunctionalization. We find that Nb2C offers lower diffusion barriers,\nespecially for Na ions, making it a promising candidate for fast-charging SIBs.\nIn contrast, Nb2CO2 enhances charge retention through stronger electrostatic\ninteractions but introduces higher migration resistance. Electronic structure\nanalysis confirms the metallic nature of both MXenes, ensuring efficient\nelectron transport. Open-circuit voltage (OCV) calculations indicate that\nNb2CO2 exhibits higher OCV values than Nb2C, highlighting the role of surface\nfunctionalization in tuning electrochemical performance. Our study suggests\nthat, while Li-based systems achieve slightly higher theoretical capacities,\nNa-based systems exhibit comparable performance, reinforcing the viability of\nsodium-ion batteries as a cost-effective alternative.

To make these measurements with high precision,\nDUNE will require external $\\nu$-Ar scattering cross section data as a crucial\ninput to the oscillation fit.

This dissertation focused on the\nmodel of the NuMI beamline and its impact on the neutrino fluxes, but also\ndelved into the detector response model and its impact on reconstructed\nobservables in the detector. In particular, the NuMI flux was determined to be\ncomposed of 57% $\\nu_\\mu$, 38% $\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$, 3% $\\nu_e$, and 2%\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ while the horns are operating in the positive-particle focusing\nconfiguration.

These approaches\npredominantly employ supervised fine-tuning on single-domain user interactions\nto adapt LLMs for specific recommendation tasks. However, they typically\nencounter dual challenges: the mismatch between general language\nrepresentations and domain-specific preference patterns, as well as the limited\nadaptability to multi-domain recommendation scenarios. To bridge these gaps, we\nintroduce CPRec -- an All-domain Continual Pre-Training framework for\nRecommendation -- designed to holistically align LLMs with universal user\nbehaviors through the continual pre-training paradigm. Specifically, we first\ndesign a unified prompt template and organize users' multi-domain behaviors\ninto domain-specific behavioral sequences and all-domain mixed behavioral\nsequences that emulate real-world user decision logic. To optimize behavioral\nknowledge infusion, we devise a Warmup-Stable-Annealing learning rate schedule\ntailored for the continual pre-training paradigm in recommendation to\nprogressively enhance the LLM's capability in knowledge adaptation from\nopen-world knowledge to universal recommendation tasks. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of our CPRec, we implement it on a large-scale dataset covering\nseven domains and conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets\nfrom two distinct platforms. Experimental results confirm that our continual\npre-training paradigm significantly mitigates the semantic-behavioral\ndiscrepancy and achieves state-of-the-art performance in all recommendation\nscenarios.

Initial\nexperiments applying DRL to an implementation of the A Link to the Past example\ndo not produce the treacherous turn effect naturally, despite various\nmodifications to the environment intended to produce it. However, in this work,\nwe find the treacherous behavior to be reproducible in a DRL agent when using\nother trojan injection strategies.

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important\nproblem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed\nthe tasks.

We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the\nprocess would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations\nwith LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually\nannotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation.\nHowever, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this\nend, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the\neffectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench\ncontains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in\nAgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to\nthe success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our\nbenchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across\nall benchmarks.

Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on\nlarge-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw\nimages, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In\ncontrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural\nnetworks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel\nfusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction\nalgorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs\ninvolved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained\nGranular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to\nslide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and\nperform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights\nare then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level,\npixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are\ncategorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be\naccurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball\nperforms modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive\nregion, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to\ncomplement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying\ntheory.

Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed\nquantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves,\nelectric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the\nlaboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and\ninertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size,\nweight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here,\nwe describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to\ncreate the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations,\nsuch as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative\ncooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant\nadvantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced\ncurrent inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage.\nHowever, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that\ninclude bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design\nimplements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which\nuse a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity\nthat is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal.

The\nparameters - related to the energy density difference between quark matter and\nthe QCD vacuum, the strength of strong interactions, and the gap parameter for\ncolor superconductivity - are sampled via quasi-random Latin hypercube sampling\nto ensure uniform coverage. To constrain them, we incorporate observational\ndata on the maximum mass of NSs (from binary and merger systems), the radii of\n$1.4$ M$_{\\odot}$ NSs (from gravitational wave and electromagnetic\nobservations), and tidal deformabilities (from GW170817). Our results show that\nquark strong interactions play a key role, requiring at least a $20\\%$\ndeviation from the free-quark limit. We also find that color superconductivity\nis relevant, with the gap parameter reaching up to $\\sim 230$ MeV for a strange\nquark mass of $100$ MeV.

We detect two distinct\ncomponents of ionized absorbers in this source. The ionization parameter of the\nlow-ionization warm absorber component tracks changes in the ionizing flux with\nno measurable time lag.

We detect H$_2$O (3.09 $\\sigma$) both across NIRISS/SOSS wavelengths\nrange and at the bluest end of NIRSpc/G395H as well as a gray cloud deck (1.90\n$\\sigma$). We constrain the atmospheric metallicity of HAT-P-14 b to be roughly\nSolar, with [Fe/H] $= -0.08^{+0.89}_{-0.98}$, consistent with the planet\nmass-metallicity relationship. The differences compared to previous works are\nlikely due to the improved STScI jwst pipeline, which highlights the need to\nreanalyze the early NIRISS/SOSS transiting exoplanet targets with the latest\nmethods. As HAT-P-14 b is placed as the 805th best target for transmission\nspectroscopy according to Transmission Spectroscopy Metrics (TSM), our results\nshowcase JWST's unparalleled photometric precision which can easily\ncharacterize a thousand exoplanets' atmospheres through transmission\nspectroscopy.",

Their true form only reveals\nitself when seen from a specific viewpoint, which can be through some\ncatadioptric device like a mirror or a lens. While the construction of these\nmathematical devices can be traced back to as early as the 17th century, they\nare only interpretable when viewed from a specific vantage point and tend to\nlose meaning when seen normally. In this paper, we revisit these famous optical\nillusions with a generative twist. With the help of latent rectified flow\nmodels, we propose a method to create anamorphic images that still retain a\nvalid interpretation when viewed directly. To this end, we introduce Laplacian\nPyramid Warping, a frequency-aware image warping technique key to generating\nhigh-quality visuals.

Specifically, camera\nrelocalization methods, such as Absolute Pose Regression (APR), can localize\ncameras with a median translation error of more than $0.5m$ in outdoor scenes.\nThis paper presents HAL-NeRF, a high-accuracy localization method that combines\na CNN pose regressor with a refinement module based on a Monte Carlo particle\nfilter.

To address this problem, we examine adversarial robustness in SNNs\nthrough the framework of four types of training algorithms.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce a hybrid adversarial attack paradigm that leverages\nthe transferability of adversarial instances.

At a large scale, real-world data often\nexhibit inherently non-Euclidean structures, such as multi-way relationships,\nhierarchies, symmetries, and non-isotropic scaling, in a variety of domains,\nsuch as languages, vision, and the natural sciences. It is challenging to\neffectively capture these structures within the constraints of Euclidean\nspaces. This position paper argues that moving beyond Euclidean geometry is not\nmerely an optional enhancement but a necessity to maintain the scaling law for\nthe next-generation of foundation models. By adopting these geometries,\nfoundation models could more efficiently leverage the aforementioned\nstructures. Task-aware adaptability that dynamically reconfigures embeddings to\nmatch the geometry of downstream applications could further enhance efficiency\nand expressivity. Our position is supported by a series of theoretical and\nempirical investigations of prevalent foundation models.Finally, we outline a\nroadmap for integrating non-Euclidean geometries into foundation models,\nincluding strategies for building geometric foundation models via fine-tuning,\ntraining from scratch, and hybrid approaches.",

Two competing tendencies can be\nanticipated: (i) following the quantum order-by-disorder paradigm, quantum\nfluctuations could induce symmetry-breaking (charge) order, or (ii) the\nclassical liquid builds up long-range entanglement and turns into a quantum\nliquid.

Unlike\nmost magnetars, the source has only moderate foreground extinction with minimal\ncrowding. Our observations began only 2 hours after the first activation of SGR\n0501+4516 in August 2008, and continued for 4 years, including two epochs of\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. The proper motion constraint is improved\nby a third HST epoch 10 years later. The near-infrared and X-rays faded slowly\nduring the first week, thereafter following a steeper power-law decay. The\nbehaviour is satisfactorily fit by a broken power-law. Three epochs of HST\nimaging with a 10-year baseline allow us to determine a quiescent level, and to\nmeasure a proper motion of 5.4+/-0.6 mas/yr. This corresponds to a low\ntransverse peculiar velocity of 51+/-14 km/s (at 2 kpc). The magnitude and\ndirection of the proper motion rules out supernova remnant HB9 as the\nbirth-site. We can find no other supernova remnants or groups of massive stars\nwithin the region traversed by SGR 0501+4516 during its characteristic lifetime\n(20 kyr). Our observations of SGR 0501+4516 suggest that some magnetars may be\neither significantly older than expected, that their progenitors produce low\nsupernova ejecta masses, or alternatively that they can be formed through\naccretion-induced collapse (AIC) or low-mass neutron star mergers.

    "abstract": "Physical constraints and engineering challenges, including wafer dimensions,\nclassical control cabling, and refrigeration volumes, impose significant\nlimitations on the scalability of quantum computing units. As a result, a\nmodular quantum computing architecture, comprising small processors\ninterconnected by quantum links, is emerging as a promising approach to\nfault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the requirements that the network\nmust fulfill to enable distributed quantum computation remain largely\nunexplored. We consider an architecture tailored for qubits with\nnearest-neighbor physical connectivity, leveraging the surface code for error\ncorrection and enabling fault-tolerant operations through lattice surgery and\nmagic state distillation. We propose measurement teleportation as a tool to\nextend lattice surgery techniques to qubits located on different computing\nunits interconnected via Bell pairs. Through memory simulations, we build an\nerror model for logical operations and deduce an end-to-end resource estimation\nof Shor's algorithm over a minimalist distributed architecture. Concretely, for\na characteristic physical gate error rate of 1e-3, a processor cycle time of 1\nmicrosecond, factoring a 2048-bit RSA integer is shown to be possible with 379\ncomputing processors, each made with 89781 qubits, with negligible space and\ntime overhead with respect to a monolithic approach without parallelization, if\n70 Bell pairs are available per cycle time between each processor with a\nfidelity exceeding 98.4 percent.",

Low-mass galaxies tend to follow a steep slope, close\nto one, while the slope flattens for high-mass early type galaxies. In our\nstudy, we investigate the $\\Sigma_1 - M_{\\star}$ scaling relation and its\nevolution using the NIHAO suite of cosmological simulations and compare our\nfindings with recent results from the MaNGA survey. Our analysis shows that\nNIHAO galaxies successfully reproduce the observed scaling relation based on\nMANGA survey. Our analysis suggests that AGN feedback plays a critical role in\nflattening the $\\Sigma_1$ slope by expelling gas from galactic centers, leading\nto a decrease in both stellar and dark matter density as the gravitational\npotential becomes shallower. To further support our findings, we conducted\nhigh-resolution N-body simulations, which confirmed that\n  ({\\it sudden}) gas removal does substantially alter the stellar density in\nthe central region, consistent with results from NIHAO. Furthermore, our\nnumerical experiments show that even if the same amount of gas is re-accreted\non a typical ({\\it longer}) free-fall time, it is not able to restore the\noriginal stellar density. Our study concludes that AGN feedback assisted gas\nremoval presents a plausible explanation for the decline in central stellar\nsurface density as observed in massive elliptical galaxies.",

    "abstract": "With a small sample of fast X-ray transients (FXTs) with multi-wavelength\ncounterparts discovered to date, the progenitors of FXTs and their connections\nto gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and supernovae (SNe) remain ambiguous. Here, we\npresent photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2025kg, the supernova\ncounterpart to the FXT EP 250108a. At $z=0.17641$, this is the closest known SN\ndiscovered following an Einstein Probe (EP) FXT. We show that SN 2025kg's\noptical spectra reveal the hallmark features of a broad-lined Type Ic SN. Its\nlight curve evolution and expansion velocities are also comparable to those of\nGRB-SNe, including SN 1998bw, and several past FXT SNe. We present JWST/NIRSpec\nspectroscopy taken around SN 2025kg's maximum light, and find weak absorption\ndue to He I $\\lambda 1.0830, \\lambda 2.0581$ $\\mu$m and a broad, unidentified\nfeature at $\\sim$ 4-4.5 $\\mu$m. Further, we observe clear evidence for\nbroadened H$\\alpha$ in optical data at 42.5 days that is not detected at other\nepochs, indicating interaction with hydrogen-rich material. From its light\ncurve, we derive a $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.2 - 0.6 $M_{\\odot}$. Together with our\ncompanion paper (Eyles-Ferris et al. 2025), our broadband data of EP 250108a/SN\n2025kg are consistent with a trapped or low energy ($\\lesssim 10^{51}$ ergs)\njet-driven explosion from a collapsar with a zero-age main sequence mass of\n15-30 $M_{\\odot}$. Finally, we show that the sample of EP FXT SNe support past\nrate estimates that low-luminosity jets seen through FXTs are more common than\nsuccessful (GRB) jets, and that similar FXT-like signatures are likely present\nin at least a few percent of the brightest Ic-BL SNe.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there is interest in coincident 'sharpening' and 'learnability'\ntransitions in monitored quantum systems. In the latter, an outside observer's\nability to infer properties of a quantum system from measurements undergoes a\nphase transition. Such transitions appear to be related to the decodability\ntransition in quantum error correction, but the precise connection is not\nclear. Here, we study these problems under one framework we call the general\nquantum inference problem. In cases as above where the system has a Markov\nstructure, we say that the inference is on a quantum hidden Markov model. We\nshow a formal connection to classical hidden Markov models and that they\ncoincide for certain setups. For example, we prove this for those involving\nHaar-random unitaries and measurements. We introduce the notion of Bayes\nnon-optimality, where parameters used for inference differs from true ones.\nThis allows us to expand the phase diagrams of above models. At Bayes\noptimality, we obtain an explicit relation between 'sharpening' and\n'learnability' order parameters, explicitly showing that the two transitions\ncoincide. Next, we study concrete examples. We review quantum error correction\non the toric and repetition code and their mapping to 2D random-bond Ising\nmodel (RBIM) through our framework. We study the Haar-random U(1)-symmetric\nmonitored quantum circuit and tree, mapping each to inference models that we\ncall the planted SSEP and planted XOR, respectively, and expanding the phase\ndiagram to Bayes non-optimality. For the circuit, we deduce the phase boundary\nnumerically and analytically argue that it is of a single universality class.\nFor the tree, we present an exact solution of the entire phase boundary, which\ndisplays re-entrance as does the 2D RBIM. We discuss these phase diagrams, with\ntheir interpretations for quantum inference problems and rigorous arguments on\ntheir shapes.",

In this work,\nwe introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully\nplanar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present\nplanar code families with logical dimensions $6 \\leq k\\leq13$, e.g., $[[78, 6,\n6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$,\n$[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically\nlocal weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a\n$[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of\nmagnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary\nanyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding\nhigh-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware\narchitectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose\ndistance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC\ncodes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold\nfault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic\ntwo-dimensional hardware.",

The ultra-high sensitivity of NV\nmagnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron\nspins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics,\nspintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond\nsensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that\ncan be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this\nstudy, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted\nsignal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation\ntechnique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2)\nlayer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin\ndensity aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the\ndiamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of\n$2,000$~$\\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our\nNV sensors ($200$~$\\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo\ncoherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a\ncomprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV\ncoherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the\nobserved spin dynamics.

In this work, we utilise TRIM simulations to improve the\nmodelling of track length distributions. Our findings suggest that previous\nstudies have overestimated the number of tracks caused by weakly interacting\nparticles, and that the lowest observable dark matter mass should be higher\nthan previously predicted. These differences are mainly attributed to the fact\nthat (a) the recoil energy-track length relation is not one-to-one, (b) at low\nrecoil energies, a substantial fraction of recoils do not yield any tracks, and\n(c) at high energies, electronic stopping becomes dominant, resulting in a\ntrack length barrier at $\\sim200$ nm.

We present an improved cluster mass reconstruction and\na tighter constraint on Earendel's magnification using a joint strong- and\nweak-lensing analysis with JWST data. Our strong-lensing mass model,\nincorporating newly identified multiple-image systems from JWST imaging data\nand modifying the existing multiple-image assignment scheme, produces a\nroot-mean-square (RMS) lens-plane scatter of less than $0.''3$. Additionally,\nour weak-lensing catalog achieves a source density of $\\sim 100$ galaxies\narcmin$^{-2}$, providing constraints on the mass profile beyond the\nstrong-lensing regime.

Their evolution is mainly driven by\nstrong wind mass loss, yet current evolution models make simplistic assumptions\non their atmospheric physics which are incompatible with the nature of VMS. In\nthis work, we aim to understand VMS atmospheres throughout their evolution by\nsupplementing structure models (computed with GENEC) with detailed atmosphere\nmodels (computed with PoWR) capable of capturing the physics of a\nradially-expanding medium in non-LTE. An important aspect is the computation of\natmosphere models reaching into deeper layers of the star, notably including\nthe iron-opacity peak as an important source of radiative driving. In this\nstudy, we compute atmosphere models at 16 snapshots along the main sequence of\na 150 $M_\\odot$ star. For each snapshot, we compute two atmosphere models\nconnected to the underlying structure model at different depths (below and\nabove the hot iron bump). We perform a detailed spectroscopic and structural\ncomparison of the two sequences of model atmospheres, and present a generalized\nmethod for the correction of the effective temperature in evolution models with\nstrong winds. The choice of connection point between structure and atmosphere\nmodels has a severe influence on the predicted spectral appearance, which\nconstitutes a previously unexplored source of uncertainty in quantitative\nspectroscopy. The simplified atmosphere treatment of current stellar structure\ncodes likely leads to an overestimation of the spatial extension of very\nmassive stars, caused by opacity-induced sub-surface inflation. This inflation\ndoes not occur in our deep atmosphere models, resulting in a discrepancy in\npredicted effective temperatures of up to 20 kK. Future improvements with\nturbulence and dynamically-consistent models may resolve these discrepancies.",

While\nscaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often\ndegrades downstream generation quality -- a challenge not adequately addressed\nin existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first\napproach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and\nrepresentation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing\ncomplexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs.\ngeneration dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which\naligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a\npre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space\ncomplexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both\nreconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic\nregularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using\n1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when\nexpanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize\ntraining for billion-scale tokenizers. By scaling to $\\bf{3 \\space billion}$\nparameters, GigaTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction,\ndownstream AR generation, and downstream AR representation quality.",

This\ncoupling can generate a substantial field, leading to pronounced observable\nphenomena, including the topological Hall effect. Motivated by this, we\nconsider a bilayer model in which the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee model on\none layer interact with topological spin textures on the second layer via a\nspin-spin interaction. Unlike the Kitaev model, the Yao-Lee model remains\nexactly solvable, allowing us to perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine\nits ground state. Our analysis indicates that skyrmion crystals can give rise\nto a variety of vison crystals that are periodic arrangements of the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes with unusual patterns such as a kagome pattern. In\naddition, Majorana fermions acquire a substantial Berry phase from skyrmion\ncrystals, resulting in phases with finite Chern numbers up to $\\nu =5$. In the\ncase of a single skyrmion defect in the magnetic layer, a corresponding defect\nin the vison configuration can be realized. These defects support localized\nstates when the spin liquid is gapped. Similar to skyrmion crystals, spiral\nspin textures also give rise to a diverse range of flux crystals. However, in\nthis case, most of these phases are gapless, with only a few being\ntrivially-gapped.

In these settings, the neural network\napproximations can be used as surrogate models to accelerate the solution of\nthe outer-loop tasks. However, since outer-loop tasks in infinite dimensions\noften require knowledge of the underlying geometry, the approximation accuracy\nof the operator's derivatives can also significantly impact the performance of\nthe surrogate model.

Starting from 3d abelian Chern-Simons\ntheory, we construct an ensemble of boundary CFTs defined by gauging all\npossible maximal subgroups of the bulk one-form symmetry. Each maximal\nnon-anomalous subgroup is isomorphic to a classical even self-dual\nerror-correcting code over $\\mathbb Z_p\\times \\mathbb Z_p$, providing a way to\ndefine a boundary \"code CFT.\" The average over the ensemble of such theories is\nholographically dual to Chern-Simons gravity, a bulk theory summed over 3d\ntopologies sharing the same boundary. In the case of prime $p$, the sum reduces\nto that over handlebodies, i.e. becomes the Poincar\\'e series akin to that in\nsemiclassical gravity. As the main result of the paper, we show that the\nmathematical identity underlying this holographic duality can be understood and\nrigorously proven using the framework of Howe duality over finite fields. This\nframework is concerned with the representation theory of two commuting groups\nforming a dual pair: the symplectic group of modular transformations of the\nboundary, and an orthogonal group mapping codes to each other.

The former challenge is addressed by\nSurrogate-Based Optimization (SBO) algorithms, in particular Bayesian\nOptimization (BO) using Gaussian Process (GP) models. An overview is provided\nof how BO can deal with challenges specific to architecture optimization, such\nas design variable hierarchy and multiple objectives: specific measures include\nensemble infills and a hierarchical sampling algorithm. Evaluations might fail\ndue to non-convergence of underlying solvers or infeasible geometry in certain\nareas of the design space. Such failed evaluations, also known as hidden\nconstraints, pose a particular challenge to SBO/BO, as the surrogate model\ncannot be trained on empty results. This work investigates various strategies\nfor satisfying hidden constraints in BO algorithms. Three high-level strategies\nare identified: rejection of failed points from the training set, replacing\nfailed points based on viable (non-failed) points, and predicting the failure\nregion. Through investigations on a set of test problems including a jet engine\narchitecture optimization problem, it is shown that best performance is\nachieved with a mixed-discrete GP to predict the Probability of Viability\n(PoV), and by ensuring selected infill points satisfy some minimum PoV\nthreshold. This strategy is demonstrated by solving a jet engine architecture\nproblem that features at 50% failure rate and could not previously be solved by\na BO algorithm.

The anomaly is reconciled by degenerate quantum states where\nelectron spins and orbital currents give rise to time-odd and space-odd\nmagnetic vortices known as toroidal moments, that carry a vanishing magnetic\ndipole. Resilient to stray magnetic fields and susceptible to electric\nmanipulation, toroidal moments have attracted interest for spintronic,\nmagnonic, and photonic applications. While macroscopic toroidal moments feature\nin some extended systems, molecular toroidal states have yet to be observed, as\nit remains unclear how existing experimental set-ups could split degenerate\nstates carrying counter-rotating vortices.

The eikonal regime is applicable here.\nMethods. We study the voltage (rather than the intensity) in a simple\nsimulation consisting of (a) microlensing stars, and (b) plasma scattering by a\nturbulent interstellar medium. Results: The auto-correlation of the voltage\nshows peaks (at order-microsecond separations) corresponding to wave-optical\ninterference between lensed micro-images. The peaks are frequency dependent if\nplasma-scattering is significant. While qualitative and still in need of more\nrealistic simulations, the results suggest that a strongly-lensed FRB could be\nidentified from a single image. Conclusions: Microlensing could sniff out\nmacro-lensed FRBs",

Based on the evolution of the optical polarization in\nthird-order nonlinear media, the high-dimensional machine reaches the Ising\nground state by the mechanism of dimensional collapse: the dynamics on the\nPoincar\\'e sphere undergoes a self-induced collapse into polarization fixed\npoints mapping Ising spins. The photonic setup consists of\npolarization-modulated pulses in a $\\chi^{(3)}$ crystal subject to iterative\nfeedback. We numerically demonstrate that its high-dimensional operation leads\nto an enhanced success probability on benchmark graphs and an exponential\nimprovement in performance scaling with respect to coherent Ising machines.

While existing benchmarks focus on basic plan validity, they\nneglect critical aspects such as route efficiency, POI appeal, and real-time\nadaptability. This paper introduces TP-RAG, the first benchmark tailored for\nretrieval-augmented, spatiotemporal-aware travel planning. Our dataset includes\n2,348 real-world travel queries, 85,575 fine-grain annotated POIs, and 18,784\nhigh-quality travel trajectory references sourced from online tourist\ndocuments, enabling dynamic and context-aware planning. Through extensive\nexperiments, we reveal that integrating reference trajectories significantly\nimproves spatial efficiency and POI rationality of the travel plan, while\nchallenges persist in universality and robustness due to conflicting references\nand noisy data. To address these issues, we propose EvoRAG, an evolutionary\nframework that potently synergizes diverse retrieved trajectories with LLMs'\nintrinsic reasoning. EvoRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving\nspatiotemporal compliance and reducing commonsense violation compared to\nground-up and retrieval-augmented baselines.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been gradually employed to solve\ncomplex tasks. To face the challenge, task decomposition has become an\neffective way, which proposes to divide a complex task into multiple simpler\nsubtasks and then solve them separately so that the difficulty of the original\ntask can be reduced. However, the performance of existing task decomposition\nmethods can be suboptimal when the task contains overly complex logic and\nconstraints. In this situation, the solution generated by LLMs may deviate from\nthe original purpose of the task, or contain redundant or even erroneous\ncontent. Therefore, inspired by the fact that humans possess two thinking\nsystems including fast thinking and slow thinking, this paper introduces a new\ntask decomposition method termed ``Fast-Slow-Thinking'' (FST), which stimulates\nLLMs to solve tasks through the cooperation of Fast Thinking (FT) and Slow\nThinking (ST) steps. Here FT focuses more on the general and concise aspect of\nthe task, and ST focuses more on the details of the task. In FT, LLMs are\nprompted to remove the constraints of the original task, therefore simplifying\nit to a general and concise one. In ST, we recall the constraints removed in\nFT, so that LLMs can improve the answer generated in FT to meet the\nrequirements of the original task. Therefore, our FST method enables LLMs to\nconsider a complex problem via a human-like cognition process from coarse to\nfine, the effectiveness of which has been well demonstrated by the experiments\non three types of tasks.",

Recent advancements in multi-modal large language\nmodels (LLMs) now offer new possibilities for supporting interactive and\nexpressive voice-based reflection in writing. In particular, we propose that\nLLM-generated static feedback can be repurposed as conversation starters,\nallowing writers to seek clarification, request examples, and ask follow-up\nquestions, thereby fostering deeper reflection on their writing. We argue that\nvoice-based interaction can naturally facilitate this conversational exchange,\nencouraging writers' engagement with higher-order concerns, facilitating\niterative refinement of their reflections, and reduce cognitive load compared\nto text-based interactions. To investigate these effects, we propose a\nformative study exploring how text vs. voice input influence writers'\nreflection and subsequent revisions.

    "abstract": "The products of stellar mergers between two massive main-sequence (MS) stars\nappear as seemingly normal MS stars after a phase of thermal relaxation, if not\nfor certain peculiarities. Since these peculiarities are not limited to the\nmerger product's surface, we use asteroseismology to predict how the\ndifferences in the internal structure of a merger product and a genuine single\nstar manifest via properties of non-radial stellar pulsations. We mapped the\nresult of a 3D MHD stellar merger simulation between a 9 and an 8 solar-mass MS\nstar to 1D and evolved it through the MS. We compare the predicted pressure (p)\nand gravity (g) modes for the merger product model with those predicted for a\ncorresponding genuine single-star model. The p-mode frequencies are\nconsistently lower for the merger product than for the genuine single star, and\nthe differences between them are more than a thousand times larger than the\ncurrent best observational uncertainties for measured mode frequencies of this\nkind. Even though g-mode period spacing differences vary in value and sign\nthroughout the MS, they, too, are larger than the current best observational\nuncertainties for such long-period modes. This, combined with additional\nvariability in the merger product's period spacing patterns, shows the\npotential of identifying merger products in future-forward modelling. We also\nattempt to replicate the merger product's structure using three widely applied\n1D merger prescriptions and repeat the asteroseismic analysis. Although none of\nthe 1D prescriptions reproduces the entire merger product's structure, we\nconclude that the prescription with shock heating shows the highest potential,\nprovided that it can be calibrated on binary-evolution-driven 3D merger\nsimulations. Our work should be expanded to encompass the various possible\nmerger product structures predicted to exist in the Universe. (abridged)",

    "abstract": "Multidisciplinary design optimization methods aim at adapting numerical\noptimization techniques to the design of engineering systems involving multiple\ndisciplines. In this context, a large number of mixed continuous, integer and\ncategorical variables might arise during the optimization process and practical\napplications involve a large number of design variables. Recently, there has\nbeen a growing interest in mixed variables constrained Bayesian optimization\nbut most existing approaches severely increase the number of the\nhyperparameters related to the surrogate model. In this paper, we address this\nissue by constructing surrogate models using less hyperparameters. The\nreduction process is based on the partial least squares method. An adaptive\nprocedure for choosing the number of hyperparameters is proposed. The\nperformance of the proposed approach is confirmed on analytical tests as well\nas two real applications related to aircraft design. A significant improvement\nis obtained compared to genetic algorithms.",

Our analysis uses\ngauge ensembles generated by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC)\nwith $N_{f} = 2 + 1 + 1$ flavors of Wilson-clover twisted mass fermions. For\nthe first time, we go beyond the electroquenched approximation by including\nquark-disconnected contributions. Several key improvements have been\nimplemented: (i) the simulations are now performed directly at physical light-\nand strange-quark masses, (ii) finite-size effects are carefully investigated\nusing lattices with spatial extents ranging from $L \\simeq 3.8\\,\\mathrm{fm}$ to\n$L \\simeq 7.7\\,\\mathrm{fm}$, and (iii) the continuum extrapolation is based on\nthree lattice spacings in the range $a \\in [0.08, 0.058]\\,\\mathrm{fm}$. As a\nresult of the high-precision determination of the relevant correlation\nfunctions, we reduce the uncertainties on both the axial and vector form\nfactors by nearly a factor of two compared to our previous analysis. When\ncompared to experimental measurements in the electron channel ($K^- \\to e^-\n\\bar{\\nu}_e \\gamma$), our results show a tension -- at the level of $2.6$\nstandard deviations -- with respect to KLOE data. On the other hand, they are\ncompatible with measurements from the E36 Collaboration at J-PARC. In the\nmuonic decay channel ($K^- \\to \\mu^- \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\gamma$), we confirm the\ntensions, already observed in our previous study, between lattice QCD\npredictions and ISTRA+ and OKA data, which are both primarily sensitive to the\nvalue of the negative-helicity form factor $F^{-}$.",

This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant\nsetting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens --\nto a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures\nthat something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses\nStrategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage\npermissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal\ninterference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically\ncontrol interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance\nformal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to\ntrigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized\npolicy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to\nchanging specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for\ncyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to\ndemonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally\nupdated) $\\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic\npolicies.",

To further refine anatomical accuracy, X2BR\nintegrates a patient-specific template mesh, constructed using YOLOv9-based\ndetection and the SKEL biomechanical skeleton model. The coarse reconstruction\nis aligned to the template using geodesic-based coherent point drift, enabling\nanatomically consistent 3D bone volumes. Experimental results on a clinical\ndataset show that X2B achieves the highest numerical accuracy, with an IoU of\n0.952 and Chamfer-L1 distance of 0.005, outperforming recent baselines\nincluding X2V and D2IM-Net. Building on this, X2BR incorporates anatomical\npriors via YOLOv9-based bone detection and biomechanical template alignment,\nleading to reconstructions that, while slightly lower in IoU (0.875), offer\nsuperior anatomical realism, especially in rib curvature and vertebral\nalignment.

    "abstract": "This paper gives a fixed-parameter linear algorithm for the single-source\nshortest path problem (SSSP) on directed graphs. The parameter in question is\nthe nesting width, a measure of the extent to which a graph can be represented\nas a nested collection of graphs. We present a novel directed graph\ndecomposition called the acyclic-connected tree (A-C tree), which breaks the\ngraph into a recursively nested sequence of strongly connected components in\ntopological order. We prove that the A-C tree is optimal in the sense that its\nwidth, the size of the largest nested graph, is equal to the nesting width of\nthe graph. We then provide a linear-time algorithm for constructing the A-C\ntree of any graph. Finally, we show how the A-C tree allows us to construct a\nsimple variant of Dijkstra's algorithm which achieves a time complexity of\n$O(e+n\\log w)$, where $n$ ($e$) is the number of nodes (arcs) in the graph and\n$w$ is the nesting width. The idea is to apply the shortest path algorithm\nseparately to each component in the order dictated by the A-C tree. We obtain\nan asymptotic improvement over Dijkstra's algorithm: when $w=n$, our algorithm\nreduces to Dijkstra's algorithm, but it is faster when $w \\in o(n)$, and\nlinear-time for classes of graphs with bounded width, such as directed acyclic\ngraphs.",

This\npaper presents a low-complexity formalism for incorporating inequality\nconstraints into the cost function of QAOA using an oracle-based subroutine\nthat evaluates constraint satisfaction in an additional register, subsequently\ncalled Indicator Function QAOA (IF-QAOA). The IF-QAOA cost function consists of\na step-function but does not require a penalty term with additional parameters.\nApplied to the Knapsack problem, we demonstrate the superior performance of\nIF-QAOA over conventional penalty-based approaches in simulated experiments.\nUsing advanced QAOA simulation techniques with instances consisting of up to 22\nitems, we find that IF-QAOA achieves significantly higher solution quality and\na faster time-to-solution in 82% of our benchmark cases. Analysis of the\nscaling behavior shows favorable scaling of IF-QAOA compared to penalty-based\nmethods. Also, benchmarked against the recently developed Quantum Tree\nGenerator QAOA for Knapsack Problems, we demonstrate higher solution quality\nfor circuits of similar complexity.

In widely used equation of state (EoS)\nmeta-models, such as the Polytrope (PP) and Speed-of-Sound (CS) models, this\nfirst-order phase transition behavior can be naturally mimicked by tuning some\nmodel parameters. Here, we systematically explore the under-explored parameter\nspace within one of a widely adopted CS model that leads to twin stars via a\nstrong first-order phase transition. Within this twin-star subspace, we perform\na comprehensive Bayesian analysis that integrates mass--radius (MR) constraints\nfrom X-ray observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. The resultant\ntwin star branch, situated within the 1--1.2 $M_{\\odot}$ mass range and\napproximately 7 km in radius, surprisingly coincides with the MR ranges\nproposed for the recent anomaly in the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars XTE\nJ1814--338 (J1814), suggesting a hybrid twin star configuration. Moreover,\nincorporating the J1814 observation as an additional constraint yields an\nextreme phase transition pressure $P_{\\text{trans}} = 108.9_{-4.85}^{+6.46}$\nMeV/fm$^3$, a transition density of $\\varepsilon_{\\text{trans}}/\\varepsilon_0 =\n4.847_{-0.134}^{+0.271}$(where $\\varepsilon_0$ is the nuclear saturation energy\ndensity) and an energy density jump $\\Delta \\varepsilon =\n558.7_{-278.7}^{+303.6}$ MeV/fm$^3$, corresponding to $\\Delta\n\\varepsilon/\\varepsilon_0 = 3.716_{-1.854}^{+2.020}$. Notably, to satisfy all\nastrophysical constraints, the speed of sound inside of the hybrid twin star\ncore is driven toward the speed of light ($c_s^2/c^2 > 0.9$), indicating the\npotential presence of strongly interacting, exotic matter in this core region.",

However, existing methods focus solely on\npredicting positions without considering articulation, and only when the hands\nare visible in the field of view. This limitation overlooks the fact that\napproximate hand positions can still be inferred even when they are outside the\ncamera's view. In this paper, we propose a method to forecast the 3D\ntrajectories and poses of both hands from an egocentric video, both in and out\nof the field of view. We propose a diffusion-based transformer architecture for\nEgocentric Hand Forecasting, EgoH4, which takes as input the observation\nsequence and camera poses, then predicts future 3D motion and poses for both\nhands of the camera wearer. We leverage full-body pose information, allowing\nother joints to provide constraints on hand motion. We denoise the hand and\nbody joints along with a visibility predictor for hand joints and a 3D-to-2D\nreprojection loss that minimizes the error when hands are in-view. We evaluate\nEgoH4 on the Ego-Exo4D dataset, combining subsets with body and hand\nannotations. We train on 156K sequences and evaluate on 34K sequences,\nrespectively. EgoH4 improves the performance by 3.4cm and 5.1cm over the\nbaseline in terms of ADE for hand trajectory forecasting and MPJPE for hand\npose forecasting.

By analyzing signal time\ntraces with transformer-based models, significant improvements in angular\nresolution are achieved compared to previous designs with larger PMTs. These\ndetectors enable the reconstruction of neutrino directions with resolutions of\napproximately $10^\\circ$ in azimuth and $7^\\circ$ in zenith for high-signal\nevents, corresponding to an overall opening angle of approximately $10^\\circ$.\nThis design reduces saturation effects and enhances directional sensitivity,\nparticularly for high-energy neutrinos. The results highlight the potential of\nWCD arrays as complementary tools for neutrino astronomy, particularly in the\ncontext of multimessenger observations of transient astrophysical sources.

However, information extraction (IE)\nfrom building drawings is often time-consuming and costly, especially when\ndealing with historical buildings. Drawing search can be simplified by\nleveraging the information stored in the title block portion of the drawing,\nwhich can be seen as drawing metadata. However, title block IE can be complex\nespecially when dealing with historical drawings which do not follow existing\nstandards for uniformity. This work performs a comparison of existing methods\nfor this kind of IE task, and then proposes a novel title block detection and\nIE pipeline which outperforms existing methods, in particular when dealing with\ncomplex, noisy historical drawings. The pipeline is obtained by combining a\nlightweight Convolutional Neural Network and GPT-4o, the proposed inference\npipeline detects building engineering title blocks with high accuracy, and then\nextract structured drawing metadata from the title blocks, which can be used\nfor drawing search, filtering and grouping. The work demonstrates high accuracy\nand efficiency in IE for both vector (CAD) and hand-drawn (historical)\ndrawings.

By embedding Large Language Model (LLM) agents within an evolutionary\ngame-theoretic framework, this paper investigates the complex interplay between\nAI developers, regulators and users, modelling their strategic choices under\ndifferent regulatory scenarios. Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is used to\nquantitatively model the dilemmas faced by each actor, and LLMs provide\nadditional degrees of complexity and nuances and enable repeated games and\nincorporation of personality traits. Our research identifies emerging\nbehaviours of strategic AI agents, which tend to adopt more \"pessimistic\" (not\ntrusting and defective) stances than pure game-theoretic agents. We observe\nthat, in case of full trust by users, incentives are effective to promote\neffective regulation; however, conditional trust may deteriorate the \"social\npact\". Establishing a virtuous feedback between users' trust and regulators'\nreputation thus appears to be key to nudge developers towards creating safe AI.\nHowever, the level at which this trust emerges may depend on the specific LLM\nused for testing. Our results thus provide guidance for AI regulation systems,\nand help predict the outcome of strategic LLM agents, should they be used to\naid regulation itself.",

This study investigates\nthe role of parenthood in shaping gender disparities in academic careers,\nfocusing on the complex interplay between gender, childcare responsibilities,\ngender role beliefs, institutional support, and scientists' career\nachievements. Using a large-scale survey of 5,670 U.S. and Canadian academics,\nsupplemented with bibliometric data from Web of Science, it reveals that\nchildcare responsibilities significantly mediate gender disparities in both\nsubjective and objective academic achievements, with women assuming a\ndisproportionate share of childcare duties. In particular, women shoulder a\ngreater caregiving load when their partners are employed full-time outside\nacademia. However, egalitarian gender role beliefs have been playing an\nimportant role in shifting this structure by transforming women academics'\nbehaviors. As women's egalitarian gender role beliefs strengthen, their\nchildcare responsibilities tend to diminish-an effect not mirrored in men.\nInstitutional parental support policies show mixed effects. While flexible work\nschedules and childcare support can mitigate the negative association between\nchildcare responsibilities and career outcomes of women academics, policies\nsuch as tenure clock extensions and paternity leave may inadvertently intensify\nit. Addressing these disparities necessitates a comprehensive approach that\nintegrates shifts in individual attitudes, broader sociocultural changes, and\npolicy improvements.",

Unlike conventional\ndiffusion autoencoders operating in image space, LDAE applies the diffusion\nprocess in a compressed latent representation, improving computational\nefficiency and making 3D medical imaging representation learning tractable. To\nvalidate the proposed approach, we explore two key hypotheses: (i) LDAE\neffectively captures meaningful semantic representations on 3D brain MR\nassociated with AD and ageing, and (ii) LDAE achieves high-quality image\ngeneration and reconstruction while being computationally efficient.\nExperimental results support both hypotheses: (i) linear-probe evaluations\ndemonstrate promising diagnostic performance for AD (ROC-AUC: 90%, ACC: 84%)\nand age prediction (MAE: 4.1 years, RMSE: 5.2 years); (ii) the learned semantic\nrepresentations enable attribute manipulation, yielding anatomically plausible\nmodifications; (iii) semantic interpolation experiments show strong\nreconstruction of missing scans, with SSIM of 0.969 (MSE: 0.0019) for a 6-month\ngap. Even for longer gaps (24 months), the model maintains robust performance\n(SSIM > 0.93, MSE < 0.004), indicating an ability to capture temporal\nprogression trends; (iv) compared to conventional diffusion autoencoders, LDAE\nsignificantly increases inference throughput (20x faster) while also enhancing\nreconstruction quality.

    "abstract": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering and scientific\ncomputing, but its pre-processing, solver configuration, and post-processing\nstages are often time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. This paper\nproposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics\nsimulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language\nmodels (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand\nuser-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task\ndecomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to\nautomatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model\nhallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing\nannotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted\nexperimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer,\nmechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that\nMooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent,\nespecially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively\nsimple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the\nproposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its\npotential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the\nuser barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite\nelement simulation software.

CryptoChaos\nharnesses the intrinsic unpredictability of four discrete chaotic maps\n(Logistic, Chebyshev, Tent, and Henon) to generate a high-entropy,\nmultidimensional key from a unified entropy pool. This key is derived through a\nlayered process that combines SHA3-256 hashing with an ephemeral X25519\nDiffie-Hellman key exchange and is refined using an HMAC-based key derivation\nfunction (HKDF). The resulting encryption key powers AES-GCM, providing both\nconfidentiality and integrity. Comprehensive benchmarking against established\nsymmetric ciphers confirms that CryptoChaos attains near-maximal Shannon\nentropy (approximately 8 bits per byte) and exhibits negligible adjacent-byte\ncorrelations, while robust performance on the NIST SP 800-22 test suite\nunderscores its statistical rigor. Moreover, quantum simulations demonstrate\nthat the additional complexity inherent in chaotic key generation dramatically\nelevates the resource requirements for Grover-based quantum attacks, with an\nestimated T gate count of approximately 2.1 x 10^9. The modular and\ninteroperable design of CryptoChaos positions it as a promising candidate for\nhigh-assurance applications, ranging from secure communications and financial\ntransactions to IoT systems, paving the way for next-generation post-quantum\nencryption standards.",

However, most studies on these systems focus on planar motion\nplanning without addressing rapid vertical motion. Despite their success on\nmild rugged terrains, recent field tests reveal a critical need for 3D\nbehaviors (e.g., climbing or traversing tall obstacles). The challenges of 3D\nmotion planning partially lie in designing sensing and control for a complex\nhigh-degree-of-freedom system, typically with over 25 degrees of freedom. To\naddress the first challenge regarding sensing, we propose a tactile antenna\nsystem that enables the robot to probe obstacles to gather information about\ntheir structure. Building on this sensory input, we develop a control framework\nthat integrates data from the antenna and foot contact sensors to dynamically\nadjust the robot's vertical body undulation for effective climbing. With the\naddition of simple, low-bandwidth tactile sensors, a robot with high static\nstability and redundancy exhibits predictable climbing performance in complex\nenvironments using a simple feedback controller. Laboratory and outdoor\nexperiments demonstrate the robot's ability to climb obstacles up to five times\nits height. Moreover, the robot exhibits robust climbing capabilities on\nobstacles covered with shifting, robot-sized random items and those\ncharacterized by rapidly changing curvatures.

    "abstract": "The dissemination of online hate speech can have serious negative\nconsequences for individuals, online communities, and entire societies. This\nand the large volume of hateful online content prompted both practitioners',\ni.e., in content moderation or law enforcement, and researchers' interest in\nmachine learning models to automatically classify instances of hate speech.\nWhereas most scientific works address hate speech classification as a binary\ntask, practice often requires a differentiation into sub-types, e.g., according\nto target, severity, or legality, which may overlap for individual content.\nHence, researchers created datasets and machine learning models that approach\nhate speech classification in textual data as a multi-label problem. This work\npresents the first systematic and comprehensive survey of scientific literature\non this emerging research landscape in English (N=46). We contribute with a\nconcise overview of 28 datasets suited for training multi-label classification\nmodels that reveals significant heterogeneity regarding label-set, size,\nmeta-concept, annotation process, and inter-annotator agreement. Our analysis\nof 24 publications proposing suitable classification models further establishes\ninconsistency in evaluation and a preference for architectures based on\nBidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) and Recurrent\nNeural Networks (RNNs). We identify imbalanced training data, reliance on\ncrowdsourcing platforms, small and sparse datasets, and missing methodological\nalignment as critical open issues and formulate ten recommendations for\nresearch.",

Here, we introduce frequency-bin\ninterferometry for reconstructing electric fields with low intensity (FIREFLY),\na technique that directly provides spectral amplitude, phase, and coherence\nprofiles of single-photon pulses without requiring intensive reconstruction\nalgorithms. Our approach measures the two-point spectral correlation function\nof the pulse by interfering its different frequency components using a quantum\npulse gate (QPG) driven by a reference pump pulse. We demonstrate its\ncompatibility with quantum light by characterizing partially coherent pulses\ngenerated by a type-0 parametric down-conversion process. We also overcome this\nrequirement of a known pump pulse by introducing spectral shear into our\ninterferometric scheme using a multi-output QPG (mQPG). This enables\nsimultaneous characterization of a single-photon-level input pulse alongside an\nunknown pump pulse.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning can seamlessly transfer agile locomotion and\nnavigation skills from the simulator to real world. However, bridging the\nsim-to-real gap with domain randomization or adversarial methods often demands\nexpert physics knowledge to ensure policy robustness. Even so, cutting-edge\nsimulators may fall short of capturing every real-world detail, and the\nreconstructed environment may introduce errors due to various perception\nuncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose Neural Fidelity\nCalibration (NFC), a novel framework that employs conditional score-based\ndiffusion models to calibrate simulator physical coefficients and residual\nfidelity domains online during robot execution. Specifically, the residual\nfidelity reflects the simulation model shift relative to the real-world\ndynamics and captures the uncertainty of the perceived environment, enabling us\nto sample realistic environments under the inferred distribution for policy\nfine-tuning. Our framework is informative and adaptive in three key ways: (a)\nwe fine-tune the pretrained policy only under anomalous scenarios, (b) we build\nsequential NFC online with the pretrained NFC's proposal prior, reducing the\ndiffusion model's training burden, and (c) when NFC uncertainty is high and may\ndegrade policy improvement, we leverage optimistic exploration to enable\nhallucinated policy optimization. Our framework achieves superior simulator\ncalibration precision compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse\nrobots with high-dimensional parametric spaces. We study the critical\ncontribution of residual fidelity to policy improvement in simulation and\nreal-world experiments.

We represent the environment\nas a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate\nmap representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM\nsystem corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation\nbetween submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from\nefficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into\nobject-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary\nqueries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The\nopen-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art\nsemantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset.

This proved useful\nto uncover biases between different target (foreground or concept) classes.\nHowever, given that the background is mostly uncontrolled during training, an\nimportant question has been left unattended so far: Are/to what extent are\nstate-of-the-art, data-driven post-hoc C-XAI approaches themselves prone to\nbiases with respect to their backgrounds?

A\ndangerous performance degradation of the concept-corner cases of animals on the\nroad could thus remain undiscovered.

    "abstract": "An oscillating scalar field can behave like cold dark matter in the expanding\nUniverse. In relativistic cosmology, this perspective is primarily reasoned by\nan evolution of a background scalar field and its subhorizon perturbations in a\nmatter-dominated era. A corresponding relativistic description is usually based\non the ansatz that the perturbations oscillate in the same way as the\nbackground field and on time averaging to find the oscillation amplitudes. In\ncontrast, the presented approach makes no initial assumptions about the\nperturbation behavior and does not use time averages. It is shown that although\nthe previous treatments are valid only well inside the Hubble scale, the scalar\nfield reproduces the CDM scenarios on the superhorizon scale and also\nthroughout the evolution of the Universe from the beginning of the\noscillations. The misunderstanding about the Jeans length scale in the\nmatter-dominated epoch is also clarified. An analog of the Jeans effect is\nfound in a radiation-dominated era. It can prevent an overproduction of small\nhalos for the scalars with $m\\sim 10^{-13}$~eV.",

To address this, we introduce ZipIR, a novel framework\nthat enhances efficiency, scalability, and long-range modeling for high-res\nimage restoration. ZipIR employs a highly compressed latent representation that\ncompresses image 32x, effectively reducing the number of spatial tokens, and\nenabling the use of high-capacity models like the Diffusion Transformer (DiT).\nToward this goal, we propose a Latent Pyramid VAE (LP-VAE) design that\nstructures the latent space into sub-bands to ease diffusion training. Trained\non full images up to 2K resolution, ZipIR surpasses existing diffusion-based\nmethods, offering unmatched speed and quality in restoring high-resolution\nimages from severely degraded inputs.",

We propose a decentralised deployment strategy that\ncombines auction-based task allocation with online learning. Each UAV\nindependently decides whether to bid for orders based on its energy storage\ncharge level, the parcel mass, and delivery distance.

Simulations using\nrealistic UAV energy models reveal that, counter-intuitively, assigning orders\nto the least confident bidders reduces delivery times and increases the number\nof successfully fulfilled orders. This strategy is shown to outperform\nthreshold-based methods which require UAVs to exceed specific charge levels at\ndeployment. We propose a variant of the strategy which uses learned policies\nfor forecasting. This enables UAVs with insufficient charge levels to commit to\nfulfilling orders at specific future times, helping to prioritise early orders.\nOur work provides new insights into long-term deployment of UAV swarms,\nhighlighting the advantages of decentralised energy-aware decision-making\ncoupled with online learning in real-world dynamic environments.",

However, multi-granularity interaction remains\na challenging task due to the ambiguity of language and degraded quality when\nit comes to queries upon object components. In this work, we present FMLGS, an\napproach that supports part-level open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS). We propose an efficient pipeline for building and querying\nconsistent object- and part-level semantics based on Segment Anything Model 2\n(SAM2). We designed a semantic deviation strategy to solve the problem of\nlanguage ambiguity among object parts, which interpolates the semantic features\nof fine-grained targets for enriched information. Once trained, we can query\nboth objects and their describable parts using natural language. Comparisons\nwith other state-of-the-art methods prove that our method can not only better\nlocate specified part-level targets, but also achieve first-place performance\nconcerning both speed and accuracy, where FMLGS is 98 x faster than LERF, 4 x\nfaster than LangSplat and 2.5 x faster than LEGaussians. Meanwhile, we further\nintegrate FMLGS as a virtual agent that can interactively navigate through 3D\nscenes, locate targets, and respond to user demands through a chat interface,\nwhich demonstrates the potential of our work to be further expanded and applied\nin the future.",

Recent efforts in multimodal egocentric action recognition often\nassume the availability of all modalities, leading to failures or performance\ndrops when any modality is missing. To address this, we introduce an efficient\nmultimodal knowledge distillation approach for egocentric action recognition\nthat is robust to missing modalities (KARMMA) while still benefiting when\nmultiple modalities are available. Our method focuses on resource-efficient\ndevelopment by leveraging pre-trained models as unimodal feature extractors in\nour teacher model, which distills knowledge into a much smaller and faster\nstudent model.

The theoretical analysis of the dynamics for a single\nagent demonstrates that the two oscillating dynamics in the presence of a field\nmap onto the bounded and unbounded phase dynamics of a weighing pendulum.

The natural integration of massive MIMO with OTFS in\nmillimeter-wave systems can improve communication data rate and enhance the\nspectral efficiency. However, when transmitting wideband signals with\nlarge-scale arrays, the beam squint effect may occur, causing discrepancies in\nbeam directions across subcarriers in multi-carrier systems. Moreover, the\nhigh-mobility wideband millimeter wave communications\n  can induce the Doppler squint effect, leading to different Doppler shifts\namong the subcarriers. Both beam squint effect and Doppler squint effect\n(denoted as doubly squint effect) can degrade communication performance\nsignificantly. In this paper, we present an efficient channel estimation and\nhybrid precoding scheme to address the doubly squint effect in massive\nMIMO-OTFS systems. We first characterize the wideband channel model and the\ninput-output relationship for massive MIMO-OTFS transmission considering doubly\nsquint effect. We then mathematically derive the impact of channel parameters\non chirp pilots under the doubly squint effect. Additionally, we develop a\npeak-index-based channel estimation scheme. By leveraging the results from\nchannel estimation, we propose a hybrid precoding method to mitigate the doubly\nsquint effect in downlink transmission scenarios.

    "abstract": "The level of ripeness is essential in determining the quality of bananas. To\ncorrectly estimate banana maturity, the metrics of international marketing\nstandards need to be considered. However, the process of assessing the maturity\nof bananas at an industrial level is still carried out using manual methods.\nThe use of CNN models is an attractive tool to solve the problem, but there is\na limitation regarding the availability of sufficient data to train these\nmodels reliably. On the other hand, in the state-of-the-art, existing CNN\nmodels and the available data have reported that the accuracy results are\nacceptable in identifying banana maturity. For this reason, this work presents\nthe generation of a robust dataset that combines real and synthetic data for\ndifferent levels of banana ripeness. In addition, it proposes a simple CNN\narchitecture, which is trained with synthetic data and using the transfer\nlearning technique, the model is improved to classify real data, managing to\ndetermine the level of maturity of the banana. The proposed CNN model is\nevaluated with several architectures, then hyper-parameter configurations are\nvaried, and optimizers are used. The results show that the proposed CNN model\nreaches a high accuracy of 0.917 and a fast execution time.",

We prove that the operator with two frozen arguments, in general\ncase, can not be recovered by the two spectra.

We further demonstrate a\nlocking effect between the chirality of the (anti)merons and the parity of the\nirreps.

Focusing on translation-invariant non-interacting fermionic\nmodels with U(1) symmetry, we present a theoretical framework to understand the\nstructure of the steady-state of these models and their entanglement content\nbased on two ingredients: the nature of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian and the constraints imposed on the steady-state single-particle\noccupation by the conserved quantities. These emerge from an interplay between\nHamiltonian symmetries and initial state, due to the non-linearity of\nmeasurement back-action. For models with complex energy spectrum, we show that\nthe steady state is obtained by filling single-particle right eigenstates with\nthe largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue. As a result, one can have\npartially filled or fully filled bands in the steady-state, leading to an\nentanglement entropy undergoing a filling-driven transition between critical\nsub volume scaling and area-law, similar to ground-state problems. Conversely,\nwhen the spectrum is fully real, we provide evidence that local observables can\nbe captured using a diagonal ensemble, and the entanglement entropy exhibits a\nvolume-law scaling independently on the initial state, akin to unitary\ndynamics. We illustrate these principles in the Hatano-Nelson model with\nperiodic boundary conditions and the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model,\nuncovering a rich interplay between the single-particle spectrum and\nconservation laws in determining the steady-state structure and the\nentanglement transitions.

    "abstract": "The integration of advanced sensor technologies with deep learning algorithms\nhas revolutionized fault diagnosis in railway systems, particularly at the\nwheel-track interface. Although numerous models have been proposed to detect\nirregularities such as wheel out-of-roundness, they often fall short in\nreal-world applications due to the dynamic and nonstationary nature of railway\noperations. This paper introduces BOLT-RM (Boosting-inspired Online Learning\nwith Transfer for Railway Maintenance), a model designed to address these\nchallenges using continual learning for predictive maintenance. By allowing the\nmodel to continuously learn and adapt as new data become available, BOLT-RM\novercomes the issue of catastrophic forgetting that often plagues traditional\nmodels. It retains past knowledge while improving predictive accuracy with each\nnew learning episode, using a boosting-like knowledge sharing mechanism to\nadapt to evolving operational conditions such as changes in speed, load, and\ntrack irregularities. The methodology is validated through comprehensive\nmulti-domain simulations of train-track dynamic interactions, which capture\nrealistic railway operating conditions. The proposed BOLT-RM model demonstrates\nsignificant improvements in identifying wheel anomalies, establishing a\nreliable sequence for maintenance interventions.",

Thermodynamic analysis reveals the critical\ntemperature $ T_c $ and coupling $ \\alpha_c $ for this transition, with the\nvectorized phase exhibiting lower free energy. A central discovery is the\nemergence of a ``screened volume law'' in the holographic entanglement entropy\n(HEE), a novel phenomenon where the entanglement entropy scales with the\nsubregion size via a screened entropy density distinct from thermal entropy.\nThis arises from a geometric constraint tied to the vanishing of the\nChristoffel symbol $ \\Gamma^z{}_{xx} $, which defines an effective boundary\noutside the horizons. Unlike conventional ``entanglement shadows'' in black\nhole systems, this surface acts as a boundary for minimal surfaces in a\ntranslationally invariant geometry. This screening effect suggests the\ninability of entanglement measure to fully probe the Hilbert space of this\nthermal system. Additionally, the HEE in the vectorized phase displays\nnon-monotonic temperature dependence.

    "abstract": "Automated scoring (AS) systems are increasingly used for evaluating L2\nwriting, but require ongoing refinement for construct validity. While prior\nwork suggested lexical bundles (LBs) - recurrent multi-word sequences\nsatisfying certain frequency criteria - could inform assessment, their\nempirical integration into AS models needs further investigation. This study\ntested the impact of incorporating LB frequency features into an AS model for\nTOEFL independent writing tasks. Analyzing a sampled subcorpus (N=1,225 essays,\n9 L1s) from the TOEFL11 corpus, scored by ETS-trained raters (Low, Medium,\nHigh), 3- to 9-word LBs were extracted, distinguishing prompt-specific from\nnon-prompt types. A baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) scoring model using\nestablished linguistic features (e.g., mechanics, cohesion, sophistication) was\ncompared against an extended model including three aggregate LB frequency\nfeatures (total prompt, total non-prompt, overall total). Results revealed\nsignificant, though generally small-effect, relationships between LB frequency\n(especially non-prompt bundles) and proficiency (p < .05). Mean frequencies\nsuggested lower proficiency essays used more LBs overall. Critically, the\nLB-enhanced model improved agreement with human raters (Quadratic Cohen's Kappa\n+2.05%, overall Cohen's Kappa +5.63%), with notable gains for low (+10.1% exact\nagreement) and medium (+14.3% Cohen's Kappa) proficiency essays. These findings\ndemonstrate that integrating aggregate LB frequency offers potential for\ndeveloping more linguistically informed and accurate AS systems, particularly\nfor differentiating developing L2 writers.",

One key difficulty is that existing encoders struggle to\nefficiently fuse low-level features. Additionally, the query selection\nstrategies are not effectively tailored for small objects. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes an efficient model, Small Object Detection\nTransformer (SO-DETR). The model comprises three key components: a dual-domain\nhybrid encoder, an enhanced query selection mechanism, and a knowledge\ndistillation strategy. The dual-domain hybrid encoder integrates spatial and\nfrequency domains to fuse multi-scale features effectively. This approach\nenhances the representation of high-resolution features while maintaining\nrelatively low computational overhead. The enhanced query selection mechanism\noptimizes query initialization by dynamically selecting high-scoring anchor\nboxes using expanded IoU, thereby improving the allocation of query resources.\nFurthermore, by incorporating a lightweight backbone network and implementing a\nknowledge distillation strategy, we develop an efficient detector for small\nobjects.

While Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for\ndistributed model training, critical challenges persist. First, existing\napproaches often overlook the trade-off between predictive accuracy and\ninterpretability. Second, they struggle to integrate inherently explainable\nmodels such as decision trees because their non-differentiable structure makes\nthem not amenable to backpropagation-based training algorithms. Lastly, they\nlack meaningful mechanisms for continual Machine Learning (ML) model adaptation\nthrough Continual Learning (CL) in resource-limited environments. In this\npaper, we pave the way for a set of novel optimization problems that emerge in\ndistributed learning at the network edge with wirelessly interconnected edge\ndevices, and we identify key challenges and future directions.

We introduce a CFR method to obtain\ntimbre-free content representations by expressing each content frame as a\nweighted linear combination of dictionary entries using corresponding phoneme\nposteriors as weights. Extensive experiments across various VC frameworks\ndemonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates timbre leakage and\nsignificantly improves similarity to the target speaker.",

    "abstract": "When performing the Fourier transform of the scattering amplitudes in\nYang-Mills theory from momentum space to real twistor space, we encounter sign\nfactors that break global conformal invariance. Previous studies conjectured\nthat the sign factors are intrinsic in the real twistor space corresponding to\nthe split signature space-time; hence, they will not appear in the complex\ntwistor space corresponding to the Lorentzian signature space-time. In this\nstudy, we present a new geometrical interpretation of the sign factors by\ninvestigating the domain of the delta functions on the real twistor space. In\naddition, we propose a new definition of delta functions on the complex twistor\nspace in terms of the Cech cohomology group without any sign factors and show\nthat these delta functions have conformal invariance. Moreover, we show that\nthe inverse Fourier transforms of these delta functions are the scattering\namplitudes in Yang-Mills theory. Thus, the sign factors do not appear in the\ncomplex twistor space.",

It is known that the\nrecurrence coefficients $\\beta_n$ satisfy a fourth-order nonlinear discrete\nequation, which is a special case of the second member of the discrete\nPainlev\\'{e} I hierarchy, often known as the ''string equation''. The\nrecurrence coefficients have been studied in the context of Hermitian\none-matrix models and random symmetric matrix ensembles with researchers in the\n1990s observing ''chaotic, pseudo-oscillatory'' behaviour. More recently, this\n''chaotic phase'' was described as a dispersive shockwave in a hydrodynamic\nchain. Our emphasis is a comprehensive study of the behaviour of the recurrence\ncoefficients as the parameters $\\tau$ and $t$ vary. Extensive computational\nanalysis is carried out, using Maple, for critical parameter ranges, and\ngraphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence\ncoefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice\nhierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to\nsatisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The\nmoments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral\nrepresentations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form\nexpressions for moments are obtained in several special cases in terms of\ngeneralised hypergeometric functions and modified Bessel functions. The results\nhighlight the rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the Freud\nweight and its connections to integrable systems.",

Defects in\nuniaxial, biaxial nematics and cholesterics are represented by elements\nbelonging to different Clifford algebras, suggesting that there are fundamental\ndistinctions between topological defects in each of these phases. Our theory\nallows nematic defects to be interpreted as Majorana-like spinors, as defects\nand antidefects are topologically equivalent, whilst some cholesteric defects,\nsuch as screw dislocations, are better viewed as Weyl-like spinors of\nwell-defined chirality. Defects can be described by a ``defect bivector'', an\nalgebraic element which quantifies the rototranslation associated with them. In\ncholesterics, fermionic defects of different types can combine to yield\ncomposite quasiparticles with either fermionic or bosonic nature. Under\ncylindrical confinement, these quasiparticles provide the way to understand the\nstructure of screw dislocations.

    "abstract": "Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology,\nlithography, and communication. One of the main methods of two-photon\ngeneration is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low\nefficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an\nalternative approach: two-photon generation from an atom in a doubly resonant\ncavity. The system, consisting of an atom interacting with two modes of the\ncavity, is modelled by the Lindblad Master Equation. An approximate analytical\nsolution is derived, using a novel approximation method, to determine the\npractically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. The model also\npredicts the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits. For\nexperimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency turns out to be\napproximately $0.1\\%$, which is about three orders of magnitude greater than\nthat of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and\nefficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of\nthe cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon\natom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode\nat the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized.\nThe cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order\ncorrelation function at zero time delay and the Fano Factor. The quantum-jump\nframework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the\nmechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity.\nTwo-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum\njumps, and the spectrum exhibits distinct peaks that correspond to transitions\nbetween the manifolds of the system.",

The former, aided by the high-multiplicity triggers,\nallows probing for potential jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity events\n(with up to 400 charged particles), for which collective phenomena consistent\nwith quark-gluon plasma (QGP) droplet formation were previously observed. The\nratios of $x_j$ distributions for high- to low-multiplicity events are used to\nquantify the possible medium effects.

However, current deep\nlearning-based AMR (DL-AMR) methods are challenged to extract discriminative\nand robust features at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), where the\nrepresentation of modulation symbols is highly interfered by noise.\nFurthermore, current research on GNN methods for AMR tasks generally suffers\nfrom issues related to graph structure construction and computational\ncomplexity.

On this basis, an adaptive correlation-based adjacency matrix\nconstruction method is proposed, which significantly enhances the graph\nstructure's capacity to aggregate local information into individual nodes.

Different mathematical and computational approaches\nhave been developed for this task. The most common mathematical approach,\ndating back to the late 1970's, is the linear-quadratic (LQ) model for the\nsurvival probability given the radiation dose. Most simulation models consider\ntissue as a continuum rather than consisting of discrete cells. While\nreasonable for large scale models, e.g., for human organs, any cellular scale\neffects become, by necessity, neglected. They do, however, influence growth,\nmorphology, and metastasis of tumors. Here, we propose a method for modeling\nthe effect of radiation on cells based on the mechanobiological\n\\textsc{CellSim3D} simulation model for growth, division, and proliferation of\ncells. To model the effect of a radiation beam, we incorporate a Monte Carlo\nprocedure into \\textsc{CellSim3D} with the LQ model by introducing a survival\nprobability at each beam delivery. Effective removal of dead cells by\nphagocytosis was also implemented. Systems with two types of cells were\nsimulated: stiff slowly proliferating healthy cells and soft rapidly\nproliferating cancer cells. For model verification, the results were compared\nto prostate cancer (PC-3 cell line) data for different doses and we found good\nagreement.

Using a\nrecently reported method to calibrate the translation and pitch rotations -\nyielding a spatial resolution of about 2 nm and angular resolution of 0.1\ndegrees - we report novel roto-translational coupled dynamics. We also suggest\na new technique where we explore the correlation between the translation and\npitch rotation to study extent of activity. Given that a spherical birefringent\nparticle phagosome is almost a sphere, the fact that it turns due to the\nactivity of the motors is not obvious, even implying high rigidity of shell.\nApplying a minimal model for the roto-translational coupling, we further show\nthat this coupling manifests itself as sustained fluxes in phase space, a\nsignature of broken detailed balance.",

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that\nchemical information present in foundation training data can give them utility\nfor processing chemical data. Furthermore, they can be augmented with and help\nsynthesize potentially multiple modalities of source chemical data germane to\nthe optimization task. In this work, we examine how chemical information from\nLLMs can be elicited and used for transfer learning to accelerate the BO of\nreaction conditions to maximize yield. Specifically, we show that a survey-like\nprompting scheme and preference learning can be used to infer a utility\nfunction which models prior chemical information embedded in LLMs over a\nchemical parameter space; we find that the utility function shows modest\ncorrelation to true experimental measurements (yield) over the parameter space\ndespite operating in a zero-shot setting.

Despite the reduced maintenance costs on an individual\nservice level, increased integration complexity arises. Consequently, automated\nservice composition approaches have arisen to mitigate this issue.\nNevertheless, these approaches have not achieved high acceptance in practice\ndue to their reliance on complex formal modeling.

Although the transferability concept has been widely\nstudied, its practical feasibility remains limited due to assumptions of high\nsimilarity between source and target models. This paper analyzes the core\nfactors that contribute to transferability, including feature alignment, model\narchitectural similarity, and overlap in the data distributions that each IDS\nexamines.

One\nwell-known model is the $T$-Interval Connectivity model, where the graph\nremains connected in every round, and the parameter $T$ reflects the duration\nof structural stability. Another model is Connectivity Time, where the union of\nedges across any $T$ consecutive rounds forms a connected graph. This is a\nweaker model, as the graph may be disconnected in individual rounds.\n  In this work, we introduce a new connectivity model called $T$-Path\nConnectivity. Unlike $T$-Interval Connectivity, the graph may not be connected\nin each round, but for every pair of nodes $u,v$, there must exist a path\nconnecting them in at least one round within any $T$ consecutive rounds. This\nmodel is strictly weaker than $T$-Interval Connectivity but stronger than the\nConnectivity Time model.\n  We study the dispersion problem in the $T$-Path Connectivity model. While\ndispersion has been explored in the 1-Interval Connectivity model, we show that\nthe existing algorithm with termination does not work in our model. We then\nidentify the minimal necessary assumptions required to solve dispersion in the\n$T$-Path Connectivity model and provide an algorithm that solves it optimally\nunder those conditions. Moreover, we prove that dispersion is unsolvable in the\nConnectivity Time model, even under several strong assumptions.\n  We further initiate the study of the exploration problem under all three\nconnectivity models.

CNN-CBAM\nachieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(0.88), sensitivity (0.81), and specificity (0.86) when compared to the other\napproaches. The attention maps from CNN-CBAM localized artifacts within the\nepoch with a sensitivity of 0.71 and specificity of 0.67.

    "abstract": "Uranium dioxide which is used as a fuel in light water nuclear reactors, is\ncontinually exposed to radiation damage originated from the collision of\nhigh-energy particles. Accumulation of the resulting defects gives rise to the\nevolution in the micro-structure of the fuel which in turn brings about local\ntensions and strains in the fuel. One of the after effects due to evolution of\nmicro-structure is the swelling of fuel which can damage the fuel cladding and\ncause environmental contamination by leakage of radioactive particles. Hence,\nit is vital to continually monitor the evolution of micro-structure and to\nanalyze the changes in mechanical properties of the fuel. The study of elastic\nconstants and analysis of their behavior is very helpful in understanding the\nmechanical properties of the fuel. In this research, using the\nHubbard-corrected first-principles density-functional theory method, we have\ncalculated the elastic constants of the uranium dioxide single crystal and\ncompared the results with existing experimental data. In addition, using the\nVoigt, Reuss, and Hill models, we have estimated the mechanical properties for\nthe poly-crystalline fresh fuel. The results show a very good agreement between\nthe theory and experiment. Accordingly, we can reliably extend our method of\ncalculations to the complicated system of irradiated fuel pellet, which is in\nthe form of a poly-crystal and hosts various defects.",

One of the measurable\neffects of a stellar cycle is the significant (more than one order of\nmagnitude) variation in XUV irradiance. As a first step in modelling stellar\nirradiances, we present EUV irradiances in a sample of strong spectral lines\nformed in different layers and regions of the solar atmosphere, obtained from\nSolar Dynamics Observatory Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (SDO\nEVE). These irradiances span half a solar cycle. We present correlations with\nseveral proxies of solar activity, such as the Mg II index, sunspot numbers,\nand cm radio fluxes. Among these, the sunspot number proves to be the poorest\nproxy, whereas the Mg II index is a very good proxy for coronal lines (hotter\ntemperature lines). We find a relatively strong linear relationship, which\nenables us to build a model essential for various applications. Additionally,\nwe compare our results with the previous EUV standard solar irradiances\nreported by Del Zanna and Andretta 2014, derived from Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (SOHO CDS) data, as well as\nhistorical records from the literature.

Under our framework,\nCCE-based tests are asymptotically normal and robust to overspecification of\nthe number of factors, which is in stark contrast to existing methodologies in\nthe CCE context. Our tests are highly applicable in practice as they\naccommodate for different predictor types (e.g., stationary and highly\npersistent factors), and remain invariant to the location of structural breaks\nin loadings. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations indicate that our tests exhibit\nexcellent local power properties. Finally, we apply our tests to a novel\nEA-MD-QD dataset by Barigozzi et al.

We propose a Correlation-based Iterative and Decompose-Restore\n(CIDR) interpolation method to address the dual limitations of conventional\nSingular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) methods: instability caused by flawed\niterative strategy and accuracy degradation due to inadequate denoising. CIDR\nsolves the above issues with two key ways: (i) a correlation-driven iteration\nstopping rule ensuring the method's overall consistency, and (ii)\ncomponent-specific interpolation with optimized denoising through a\ndecompose-restore framework. The 0.5{\\deg} downscaled GRACE(-FO) TWSA dataset\nwas employed with artificial gaps replicating intra-mission and inter-mission\nscenarios to evaluate the method's performance. At the grid scale, the global\naverage relative Root Mean Square (rRMS) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)\nimproved by 17.5% and 42.6% compared to the SSA method for intra-mission gaps,\nand by 18.6% and 27.6% for inter-mission gap interpolation, respectively. In\naddition, the CIDR method shows a significant improvement over the SSA method\nwithin the global basins, with the global basin area-weighted average rRMS\nimproved by 20.3% and 20% for both gaps, respectively.

    "abstract": "Discovery gene-disease links is important in biology and medicine areas,\nenabling disease identification and drug repurposing. Machine learning\napproaches accelerate this process by leveraging biological knowledge\nrepresented in ontologies and the structure of knowledge graphs. Still, many\nexisting works overlook ontologies explicitly representing diseases, missing\ncausal and semantic relationships between them. The gene-disease association\nproblem naturally frames itself as a link prediction task, where embedding\nalgorithms directly predict associations by exploring the structure and\nproperties of the knowledge graph. Some works frame it as a node-pair\nclassification task, combining embedding algorithms with traditional machine\nlearning algorithms. This strategy aligns with the logic of a machine learning\npipeline. However, the use of negative examples and the lack of validated\ngene-disease associations to train embedding models may constrain its\neffectiveness. This work introduces a novel framework for comparing the\nperformance of link prediction versus node-pair classification tasks, analyses\nthe performance of state of the art gene-disease association approaches, and\ncompares the different order-based formalizations of gene-disease association\nprediction. It also evaluates the impact of the semantic richness through a\ndisease-specific ontology and additional links between ontologies. The\nframework involves five steps: data splitting, knowledge graph integration,\nembedding, modeling and prediction, and method evaluation. Results show that\nenriching the semantic representation of diseases slightly improves\nperformance, while additional links generate a greater impact. Link prediction\nmethods better explore the semantic richness encoded in knowledge graphs.\nAlthough node-pair classification methods identify all true positives, link\nprediction methods outperform overall.",

    "abstract": "UN migration data and Hofstede's six cultural dimensions make it possible to\nfind a connection between migration patterns and culture from a longterm\nperspective. Migrant patterns have been studied from the perspective of both\nimmigrants and OECD host countries. This study tests two hypotheses: first,\nthat the number of migrants leaving for OECD countries is influenced by\ncultural similarities to the host country; and second, that OECD host countries\nare more likely to accept culturally close migrants. Both hypotheses were\ntested using the Mann/Whitney U test for 93 countries between 1995 and 2015.\nThe relationship between cultural and geodesic distance also analysed. The\nresults indicate that cultural proximity significantly influences migration\npatterns, although the impact varies across countries. About two/thirds of OECD\ncountries show a positive correlation between cultural similarity and\ngeographic proximity, with notable exceptions, such as New Zealand and\nAustralia, which exhibit a negative correlation. Countries such as Colombia,\nDenmark, and Japan maintain cultural distance, even from their neighbouring\ncountries. Migrants from wealthier countries tend to select culturally similar\ndestinations, whereas those from poorer countries often migrate to culturally\ndistant destinations. Approximately half of OECD countries demonstrate a\nstatistically significant bias towards accepting culturally close migrants. The\nresults of this study highlight the importance of a critical debate that\nrecognises and accepts the influence of culture on migration patterns.",

In this study, we\ndemonstrate that misaligned protoplanetary disks combined with stellar\noblateness drive complex dynamical evolution in planetary systems during their\ndisk dispersal stages. Specifically, we identify bifurcated evolutionary\npathways in multi-planet systems: systems with low star-disk misalignment\nangles ($\\psi_{\\star0}$) undergo smooth, adiabatic evolution, producing nearly\ncoplanar, low-obliquity configurations; in contrast, systems with high\nmisalignment angles typically experience an abrupt, non-adiabatic transition,\nleading to large-amplitude libration of mutual planetary inclinations and then\ntriggering chaotic eccentricity excitation. This libration and eccentricity\nexcitation process can propagate inward-outward in compact multi-planet\nsystems, forming an excitation chain that can destabilize the entire system.\nThe non-adiabatic transition arises from the dynamical bifurcation-induced\neffect, which occurs during disk dissipation when\n$\\psi_{\\star0}\\gtrsim44.6^\\circ$ (for one-planet systems).

Here, we consider\na class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular\n(circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a\ntime-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow\ncell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly\nswitches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental\nconditions. It is known that environmental variability can lead to population\nbottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced\nextinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and\nfluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle,\nand square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large,\nbottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus\ncaptured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean\ntime of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in\ncontrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the\nrate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation\ntime can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the\ncarrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and\nthe metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and\nstrain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we\nidentify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the\nmetapopulation to extinction.

    "abstract": "Despite their impressive performance, deep visual models are susceptible to\ntransferable black-box adversarial attacks. Principally, these attacks craft\nperturbations in a target model-agnostic manner. However, surprisingly, we find\nthat existing methods in this domain inadvertently take help from various\npriors that violate the black-box assumption such as the availability of the\ndataset used to train the target model, and the knowledge of the number of\nclasses in the target model. Consequently, the literature fails to articulate\nthe true potency of transferable black-box attacks. We provide an empirical\nstudy of these biases and propose a framework that aids in a prior-free\ntransparent study of this paradigm. Using our framework, we analyze the role of\nprior knowledge of the target model data and number of classes in attack\nperformance. We also provide several interesting insights based on our\nanalysis, and demonstrate that priors cause overestimation in transferability\nscores. Finally, we extend our framework to query-based attacks. This extension\ninspires a novel image-blending technique to prepare data for effective\nsurrogate model training.",

The\nexperiment reveals distinct shifts in the position of the capacitance peaks.\nWhile temperature-induced shifts have been explained by previous models, the\nobservation of frequency-dependent shifts has not been explained so far.

We highlight the critical role of\nenergy-dependent tunneling in two distinct regimes: at low temperatures,\nensemble effects arising from energy-level dispersion in differently sized QDs\ndominate the spectral response; at high temperatures and frequencies, we\nobserve a peak shift of a different nature, which is best described by\noptimizing the conjoint probability of successive in- and out-tunneling events.\nOur findings contribute to a deeper understanding of tunnel processes and the\nphysical properties of QD ensembles coupled to a common reservoir, with\nimplications for their development in applications such as single-photon\nsources and spin qubits.",

    "abstract": "As the popularity and reach of social networks continue to surge, a vast\nreservoir of opinions and sentiments across various subjects inundates these\nplatforms. Among these, X social network (formerly Twitter) stands as a\njuggernaut, boasting approximately 420 million active users. Extracting users'\nemotional and mental states from their expressed opinions on social media has\nbecome a common pursuit. While past methodologies predominantly focused on the\ntextual content of messages to analyze user sentiment, the interactive nature\nof these platforms suggests a deeper complexity. This study employs hybrid\nmethodologies, integrating textual analysis, profile examination, follower\nanalysis, and emotion dissemination patterns. Initially, user interactions are\nleveraged to refine emotion classification within messages, encompassing\nexchanges where users respond to each other. Introducing the concept of a\ncommunication tree, a model is extracted to map these interactions.\nSubsequently, users' bios and interests from this tree are juxtaposed with\nmessage text to enrich analysis. Finally, influential figures are identified\namong users' followers in the communication tree, categorized into different\ntopics to gauge interests. The study highlights that traditional sentiment\nanalysis methodologies, focusing solely on textual content, are inadequate in\ndiscerning sentiment towards significant events, notably the presidential\nelection. Comparative analysis with conventional methods reveals a substantial\nimprovement in accuracy with the incorporation of emotion distribution patterns\nand user profiles. The proposed approach yields a 12% increase in accuracy with\nemotion distribution patterns and a 15% increase when considering user\nprofiles, underscoring its efficacy in capturing nuanced sentiment dynamics.",

Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are two well established\ncorrelation coefficients, characterized by a symmetric form that ensures zero\nexpected value between two pairs of rankings randomly chosen with uniform\nprobability. However, in recent years, several weighted versions of the\noriginal Spearman and Kendall coefficients have emerged that take into account\nthe greater importance of top ranks compared to low ranks, which is common in\nmany contexts. The weighting schemes break the symmetry, causing a non-zero\nexpected value between two random rankings. This issue is very relevant, as it\nundermines the concept of uncorrelation between rankings. In this paper, we\naddress this problem by proposing a standardization function $g(x)$ that maps a\ncorrelation ranking coefficient $\\Gamma$ in a standard form $g(\\Gamma)$ that\nhas zero expected value, while maintaining the relevant statistical properties\nof $\\Gamma$.",

The idea is to consider the motion of\nsuch solitons through DSW as motion along some smooth effective profile.

We model the radio spectra of 6 sources with\nsufficiently bright radio emission and find the sources show radio spectra\nconsistent with optically thin synchrotron emission and radio outflow minimum\nradii of $10^{16}$--$10^{17}$ cm, velocities 0.01--0.05 c, and energies\n$10^{48}$--$10^{51}$ erg. On comparison with the radio properties of an\noptically-selected TDE sample at similar late times, we find no significant\ndifference in the radio luminosity range or radio detection rate. We find a\ntentative positive trend with peak radio and X-ray luminosity, but require\nfurther observations to determine if this is real or due to observational bias\ndue to the large range in distances of the events. Interestingly, none of the\nX-ray selected events show late rising radio emission, compared to 45% of\nradio-detected sources of an optically-selected sample that showed late rising\nradio emission. We propose that this may indicate that many TDEs launch radio\noutflows at or near peak X-ray luminosity, which can be significantly delayed\nfrom peak optical luminosity. This study presents the first systematic analysis\nof the radio properties of an X-ray selected sample of TDEs, and gives insight\ninto the possible link between the physical processes that power X-ray and\nradio emission in TDEs.",

We compiled a TDE sample from the catalog of eROSITA's\nextragalactic transients and variables eRO-ExTra, which includes X-ray sources\nwith a variability significance and fractional amplitude over four between\neRASS1 and eRASS2, not associated with known AGNs. Each X-ray source is\nassociated with an optical counterpart from the Legacy Survey DR10. Canonical\nTDEs were selected based on their X-ray light-curve properties (single flare or\ndecline), soft X-ray spectra ($\\Gamma>3$), and the absence of archival X-ray\nvariability and AGN signatures in their host photometry and spectroscopy. The\nsample includes 31 X-ray-selected TDE candidates with redshifts of $0.02<\nz<0.34$ and luminosities of $5.7 \\times 10^{41}<L_X<5.3 \\times 10^{44}$ erg/s\nin the 0.2-6.0 keV rest frame, of which 30 are canonical TDEs and one is an\noff-nuclear TDE candidate.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments is typically\nchallenging, as it requires agents to learn an estimate of the underlying\nsystem state. These challenges are exacerbated in multi-agent settings, where\nagents learn simultaneously and influence the underlying state as well as each\nothers' observations. We propose the use of learned beliefs on the underlying\nstate of the system to overcome these challenges and enable reinforcement\nlearning with fully decentralized training and execution. Our approach\nleverages state information to pre-train a probabilistic belief model in a\nself-supervised fashion. The resulting belief states, which capture both\ninferred state information as well as uncertainty over this information, are\nthen used in a state-based reinforcement learning algorithm to create an\nend-to-end model for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning under\npartial observability. By separating the belief and reinforcement learning\ntasks, we are able to significantly simplify the policy and value function\nlearning tasks and improve both the convergence speed and the final\nperformance.

However, these methods cannot be\nmigrated to the 3D domains due to the limited pre-training datasets and\ninsufficient focus on fine-grained geometric details.

Based on this, we propose a framework embedded with 3D geometry\nknowledge for incremental learning in point clouds, compatible with\nexemplar-free (-based) settings. In the incremental stage, the geometry\nknowledge is extended to represent objects in point clouds.

Frontier research has shown\nthat integrating knowledge in deep learning can produce reliable and\ngeneralizable solutions. Inspired by these, we propose a knowledge-guided\nadversarial defense (KGAD) to actively force malicious manipulation models to\noutput semantically confusing samples. Specifically, in the process of\ngenerating adversarial noise, we focus on constructing significant semantic\nconfusions at the domain-specific knowledge level, and exploit a metric closely\nrelated to visual perception to replace the general pixel-wise metrics. The\ngenerated adversarial noise can actively interfere with the malicious\nmanipulation model by triggering knowledge-guided and perception-related\ndisruptions in the fake samples. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, we conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on human perception\nand visual quality assessment.

While these advancements have yielded\nsignificant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable\nsocietal implications raises a critical question about fairness: What impact\ndoes the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs? To\naddress this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs,\nretrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the\nscale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes\nwithin the RAG framework. When the model scale is smaller than 8B, the\nintegration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness in small-scale\nLLMs (e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA3-8B). To mitigate the fairness\nissues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches,\nFairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the\nLLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate\nfairer model outputs.

Recently, Tang et al. proposed CaseLink, a novel graph-based method\nfor legal case retrieval, which models both cases and legal charges as nodes in\na network, with edges representing relationships such as references and shared\nsemantics. This approach offers a new perspective on the task by capturing\nhigher-order relationships of cases going beyond the stand-alone level of\ndocuments. However, while this shift in approaching legal case retrieval is a\npromising direction in an understudied area of graph-based legal IR, challenges\nin reproducing novel results have recently been highlighted, with multiple\nstudies reporting difficulties in reproducing previous findings. Thus, in this\nwork we reproduce CaseLink, a graph-based legal case retrieval method, to\nsupport future research in this area of IR. In particular, we aim to assess its\nreliability and generalizability by (i) first reproducing the original study\nsetup and (ii) applying the approach to an additional dataset. We then build\nupon the original implementations by (iii) evaluating the approach's\nperformance when using a more sophisticated graph data representation and (iv)\nusing an open large language model (LLM) in the pipeline to address limitations\nthat are known to result from using closed models accessed via an API.

To address the challenge, prior work has explored\nquantization, but achieving low-precision quantization for DiT inferencing with\nboth high accuracy and substantial speedup remains an open problem. To this\nend, this paper proposes MixDiT, an algorithm-hardware co-designed acceleration\nsolution that exploits mixed Microscaling (MX) formats to quantize DiT\nactivation values.

As\nsuch, auditing is essential for ensuring compliance with the principles of\nfairness, equity, and transparency mandated by the European Union's AI Act.\nMoreover, biases present during the training phase of a learning system can\npersist in the modeling process and result in discrimination against certain\nsubgroups of individuals when the model is deployed in production.

This paper proposes a robust methodology for auditing image\ndatasets based on so-called \"sensitive\" features, such as gender, age, and\nethnicity. The proposed methodology consists of both a feature extraction phase\nand a statistical analysis phase. The first phase introduces a novel\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture specifically designed for\nextracting sensitive features with a limited number of manual annotations. The\nsecond phase compares the distributions of sensitive features across subgroups\nusing a novel statistical test that accounts for the imprecision of the feature\nextraction model.

To address\nthese limitations, this paper introduces Light-YOLOv8-Flame, a lightweight\nflame detection algorithm specifically designed for fast and efficient\nreal-time deployment. The proposed model enhances the YOLOv8 architecture\nthrough the substitution of the original C2f module with the FasterNet Block\nmodule. This new block combines Partial Convolution (PConv) and Convolution\n(Conv) layers, reducing both computational complexity and model size. A dataset\ncomprising 7,431 images, representing both flame and non-flame scenarios, was\ncollected and augmented for training purposes. Experimental findings indicate\nthat the modified YOLOv8 model achieves a 0.78% gain in mean average precision\n(mAP) and a 2.05% boost in recall, while reducing the parameter count by\n25.34%, with only a marginal decrease in precision by 0.82%. These findings\nhighlight that Light-YOLOv8-Flame offers enhanced detection performance and\nspeed, making it well-suited for real-time fire detection on\nresource-constrained devices.",

In this\nwork, we propose MineWorld, a real-time interactive world model on Minecraft,\nan open-ended sandbox game which has been utilized as a common testbed for\nworld modeling. MineWorld is driven by a visual-action autoregressive\nTransformer, which takes paired game scenes and corresponding actions as input,\nand generates consequent new scenes following the actions. Specifically, by\ntransforming visual game scenes and actions into discrete token ids with an\nimage tokenizer and an action tokenizer correspondingly, we consist the model\ninput with the concatenation of the two kinds of ids interleaved. The model is\nthen trained with next token prediction to learn rich representations of game\nstates as well as the conditions between states and actions simultaneously. In\ninference, we develop a novel parallel decoding algorithm that predicts the\nspatial redundant tokens in each frame at the same time, letting models in\ndifferent scales generate $4$ to $7$ frames per second and enabling real-time\ninteractions with game players. In evaluation, we propose new metrics to assess\nnot only visual quality but also the action following capacity when generating\nnew scenes, which is crucial for a world model.

TS based on silver (Ag) conductive filaments has been\nobserved in many materials, including layered two-dimensional (2D) transition\nmetal dichalcogenides (TMDs). 2D TMDs are particularly promising for metal ion\nmovement due to their van der Waals (vdW) gaps between their sheets,\nfacilitating ion migration and filament formation without disturbing covalent\nchemical bonds. In this work, we demonstrate the heterostructure growth of\nvertically aligned molybdenum disulfide (VAMoS${_2}$) with an amorphous silicon\noxide (SiO${_x}$) layer on top after sulfurization. We show that Ag ions\nmigrate through this material stack, enabling TS. Our\nAg/SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$/gold (Au) devices exhibit TS at low voltages of ~0.63\nV, with high on-state currents over 200 ${\\mu}$A and stable switching exceeding\n10${^4}$ cycles. Moreover, we identify two rate-limiting steps for filament\nformation through a physics-based dynamical model and simulate the switching\nkinetics.

However, high-dimensional language model\nembeddings, often in the range of hundreds to thousands of dimensions, can\npresent scalability challenges in terms of storage and latency, especially when\nprocessing massive financial text corpora. This paper investigates the use of\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce embedding dimensionality, thereby\nmitigating computational bottlenecks without incurring large accuracy losses.\nWe experiment with a real-world dataset and compare different similarity and\ndistance metrics under both full-dimensional and PCA-compressed embeddings.

Traditionally, EEG signals have\nbeen the primary standard for seizure prediction due to their precision in\ncapturing brain activity.

In order to overcome these limitations, this study focuses\non leveraging ECG signals as an alternative for seizure prediction.

Such a set $S'$ serves as a proof that $x$ indeed has\nlabel $y$ under the assumption that (1) the target function $h^\\star$ belongs\nto $H$, and (2) the set $S$ contains at most $b$ corrupted points. For example,\nif $b=0$ and $H$ is the family of linear classifiers in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and if\n$x$ lies inside the convex hull of the positive data points in $S$ (and hence\nevery consistent linear classifier labels $x$ as positive), then\nCarath\\'eodory's theorem states that $x$ lies inside the convex hull of $d+1$\nof those points. So, a set $S'$ of size $d+1$ could be released as an\nexplanation for a positive prediction, and would serve as a short proof of\ncorrectness of the prediction under the assumption of realizability.\n  In this work, we consider this problem more generally, for general hypothesis\nclasses $H$ and general values $b\\geq 0$. We define the notion of the robust\nhollow star number of $H$ (which generalizes the standard hollow star number),\nand show that it precisely characterizes the worst-case size of the smallest\ncertificate achievable, and analyze its size for natural classes. We also\nconsider worst-case distributional bounds on certificate size, as well as\ndistribution-dependent bounds that we show tightly control the sample size\nneeded to get a certificate for any given test example. In particular, we\ndefine a notion of the certificate coefficient $\\varepsilon_x$ of an example\n$x$ with respect to a data distribution $D$ and target function $h^\\star$, and\nprove matching upper and lower bounds on sample size as a function of\n$\\varepsilon_x$, $b$, and the VC dimension $d$ of $H$.",

The total order of the events in a sequential trace is typically based\non their temporal occurrence. However, real-life processes are partially\nordered by nature. Different activities can occur in different parts of the\nprocess and, thus, independently of each other. Therefore, the temporal total\norder of events does not necessarily reflect their causal order, as also\ncausally unrelated events may be ordered in time. Only partial orders allow to\nexpress concurrency, duration, overlap, and uncertainty of events.\nConsequently, there is a growing need for process mining algorithms that can\ndirectly handle partially ordered input. In this paper, we combine two\nwell-established and efficient algorithms, the eST Miner from the process\nmining community and the Firing LPO algorithm from the Petri net community, to\nintroduce the eST$^2$ Miner.

To gain a more\ncomprehensive view, in this work, we conduct the first large-scale evaluation\nof LLM culture assessing 20 countries' cultures and languages across ten LLMs.\nWith a renowned cultural values questionnaire and by carefully analyzing LLM\noutput with human ground truth scores, we thoroughly study LLMs' cultural\nalignment across countries and among individual models. Our findings show that\nthe output over all models represents a moderate cultural middle ground.

Deeper investigation sheds light on the influence of model\norigin, prompt language, and value dimensions on cultural output. Specifically,\nmodels, regardless of where they originate, align better with the US than they\ndo with China.

This is especially true in the\npresence of aliasing and spurious signals caused by environmental influences\naffecting the instrument. Our goal is to test a clustering algorithm to find\nsignals with the same periodicity, (i.e. with the stellar rotation period) in\nthe periodograms of a large number of activity indicators. On this basis, we\nhave looked to evaluate the correlations between activity indicators and\nfundamental stellar parameters. We used generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms\nto find periodic signals in 24 activity indicators, spanning the VIS and NIR\nchannels of the CARMENES spectrograph. Common periods were subsequently\ndetermined by a machine learning algorithm for density-based spatial clustering\nof applications with noise (DBSCAN). The clustering analysis of the signals\napparent in the spectral activity indicators is a powerful tool for the\ndetection of stellar rotation periods. It is straightforward to implement and\ncan be easily automated, so that large data sets can be analysed. For a sample\nof 136 stars, we were able to recover the stellar rotation period in a total of\n59 cases, including 3 with a previously unknown rotation period. In addition,\nwe analysed spurious signals frequently occurring at the period of one year and\nits integer fractions, concluding that they are likely aliases of one\nunderlying signal. Furthermore, we reproduced the results of several previous\nstudies on the relationships between activity indicators and the stellar\ncharacteristics.",

In this study, we use MUSE integral-field spectroscopy to investigate\nthe stellar rotation of ~2300 stars in the 1.5 Gyr old cluster NGC 1783 in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud. The effective temperature, surface gravity, radial\nvelocity, and projected rotational velocity ($v\\mathrm{sin}i$) of the entire\nsample were obtained within a Bayesian framework to derive robust estimates of\nthese parameters along with their associated errors. The analysis shows that\nstars along the extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) cover a wide range of\nrotational velocities, from values consistent with no/slow rotation up to\n$v\\mathrm{sin}i$ ~ 250 km/s. The distribution of stellar rotation velocities\nappears to play a crucial role in explaining the broadening of the eMSTO in\nthis cluster, and a correlation is observed between $v\\mathrm{sin}i$ and the\ncolor of the eMSTO stars, with $v\\mathrm{sin}i$ increasing as the color becomes\nredder. Among the eMSTO stars, we investigate the peculiar population of stars\nstrongly dimmed in the UV (so-called UV-dim stars), recently discovered in NGC\n1783. UV-dim stars show clear photometric evidence of self-extinction and mild\nspectroscopic signatures typically observed in shell stars, thus suggesting\nthat they have likely a decretion disc observed nearly equator-on.\nInterestingly, the study also shows that a significant fraction of UV-dim stars\nare slow rotators. We discuss potential implications these results may have on\nour understanding of the formation and evolution of UV-dim stars and we propose\nthat the rotational properties of the UV-dim stars should vary with cluster\nage.",

Our approach combines Implicit\nSewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn rich garment\nshape priors in a 2D UV space. A key innovation is our mapping model that\nestablishes correspondences between 2D image pixels, UV pattern coordinates,\nand 3D geometry, enabling joint optimization of both 3D garment meshes and the\ncorresponding 2D patterns by aligning learned priors with image observations.\nDespite training exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method\ngeneralizes effectively to real-world images, outperforming existing approaches\non both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments maintain\nphysical plausibility while capturing fine geometric details, enabling\ndownstream applications including garment retargeting and texture manipulation.",

    "abstract": "LC technology is a promising hardware solution for realizing extremely large\nRISs due to its advantages in cost-effectiveness, scalability, energy\nefficiency, and continuous phase shift tunability. However, the slow response\ntime of the LC cells, especially in comparison to the silicon-based\nalternatives like radio frequency switches and PIN diodes, limits the\nperformance. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in TDMA applications\nwhere RIS must sequentially serve users in different locations, as the\nphase-shifting response time of LC cells can constrain system performance. This\npaper addresses the slow phase-shifting limitation of LC by developing a\nphysics-based model for the time response of an LC unit cell and proposing a\nnovel phase-shift design framework to reduce the transition time. Specifically,\nexploiting the fact that LC-RIS at milimeter wave bands have a large electric\naperture, we optimize the LC phase shifts based on user locations, eliminating\nthe need for full channel state information and minimizing reconfiguration\noverhead. Moreover, instead of focusing on a single point, the RIS phase\nshifters are designed to optimize coverage over an area. This enhances\ncommunication reliability for mobile users and mitigates performance\ndegradation due to user location estimation errors. The proposed design\nminimizes the transition time between configurations, a critical requirement\nfor TDMA schemes. Our analysis reveals that the impact of RIS reconfiguration\ntime on system throughput becomes particularly significant when TDMA intervals\nare comparable to the reconfiguration time. In such scenarios, optimizing the\nphase-shift design helps mitigate performance degradation while ensuring\nspecific QoS requirements. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has been tested\nthrough experimental evaluations, which demonstrate that it also performs\neffectively in practice.",

Here we use a combination of\nexperiments, theory and simulations to show that small magnetic particles of\ndifferent densities, exploring flow regions of distinct vorticity statistics,\ncan act as effective probes for measuring and forcing turbulence at its\nsmallest scale. The interplay between the magnetic torque, from an externally\ncontrollable magnetic field, and hydrodynamic stresses, from small-scale\nturbulent vorticity, reveals an extremely rich phenomenology. Notably, we\npresent the first observation of stochastic resonance for particles in\nturbulence: turbulent fluctuations, effectively acting as noise,\ncounterintuitively enhance the particle rotational response to external\nforcing. We identify a pronounced resonant peak in particle rotational\nphase-lag when the applied magnetic field matches the characteristic intensity\nof small-scale vortices. Furthermore, we uncover a novel symmetry-breaking\nmechanism: an oscillating magnetic field with zero-mean angular velocity\nremarkably induces net particle rotation in turbulence with zero-mean\nvorticity, as turbulent fluctuations aid the particle in \"surfing\" the magnetic\nfield. Our findings offer insights into flexible particle manipulation in\ncomplex flows and open up a novel magnetic resonance-based approach for\nmeasuring vorticity: magnetic particles as probes emit detectable magnetic\nfields, enabling turbulence quantification even under optically-inaccessible\nconditions.",

Stochastic computing (SC) offers a promising alternative by\napproximating complex arithmetic operations, such as addition and\nmultiplication, using simple bitwise operations, like majority or AND, on\nrandom bit-streams. While SC operations are inherently fault-tolerant, their\naccuracy largely depends on the length and quality of the stochastic\nbit-streams (SBS).

    "abstract": "The NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm has received\nconsiderable recognition in the field of neuroevolution. Its effectiveness is\nderived from initiating with simple networks and incrementally evolving both\ntheir topologies and weights. Although its capability across various challenges\nis evident, the algorithm's computational efficiency remains an impediment,\nlimiting its scalability potential. To address these limitations, this paper\nintroduces TensorNEAT, a GPU-accelerated library that applies tensorization to\nthe NEAT algorithm. Tensorization reformulates NEAT's diverse network\ntopologies and operations into uniformly shaped tensors, enabling efficient\nparallel execution across entire populations. TensorNEAT is built upon JAX,\nleveraging automatic function vectorization and hardware acceleration to\nsignificantly enhance computational efficiency. In addition to NEAT, the\nlibrary supports variants such as CPPN and HyperNEAT, and integrates with\nbenchmark environments like Gym, Brax, and gymnax. Experimental evaluations\nacross various robotic control environments in Brax demonstrate that TensorNEAT\ndelivers up to 500x speedups compared to existing implementations, such as\nNEAT-Python.

    "abstract": "Vector processors frequently suffer from inefficient memory accesses,\nparticularly for strided and segment patterns. While coalescing strided\naccesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at\nfixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead\ncrossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical\ndesign issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically\nhandled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading\nperformance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area\noverhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access\narchitecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based\noptimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift\nnetworks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple\naccesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and\nregisters through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment\noperations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise\naccess, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance,\nin-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an\nopen-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory\naccesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided\noperations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9%\nand power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and\nefficiency of vector processors.",

We propose two sets of methods, cross-block feature\naggregation PCA (CFA-PCA) and moving average PCA (MA-PCA), designed for sparse\nand dense block signals, respectively. Both methods adaptively utilize block\nsignal structures, applicable to non-Gaussian data with heterogeneous variances\nand non-diagonal covariance matrices. Specifically, the CFA method utilizes a\nblock-wise U-statistic to aggregate and select block signals non-parametrically\nfrom data with unknown cluster labels. We show that the proposed methods are\nconsistent for both clustering and signal recovery under mild conditions and\nweaker signal strengths than the existing methods without considering block\nstructures of signals. Furthermore, we derive both statistical and\ncomputational minimax lower bounds (SMLB and CMLB) for high-dimensional\nclustering and signal recovery under block signals, where the CMLBs are\nrestricted to algorithms with polynomial computation complexity. The minimax\nboundaries partition signals into regions of impossibility and possibility. No\nalgorithm (or no polynomial time algorithm) can achieve consistent clustering\nor signal recovery if the signals fall into the statistical (or computational)\nregion of impossibility. We show that the proposed CFA-PCA and MA-PCA methods\ncan achieve the CMLBs for the sparse and dense block signal regimes,\nrespectively, indicating the proposed methods are computationally minimax\noptimal.

A Latent\nFactorization of Tensors (LFT) model is one of the most effective models for\nlearning the representation of a target network. However, an academic network\nis often High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) because the relationships among\nnumerous network entities are impossible to be fully explored, making it\ndifficult for an LFT model to learn accurate representation of the academic\nnetwork. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Prediction-sampling-based\nLatent Factorization of Tensors (PLFT) model with two ideas: 1) constructing a\ncascade LFT architecture to enhance model representation learning ability via\nlearning academic network hierarchical features, and 2) introducing a nonlinear\nactivation-incorporated predicting-sampling strategy to more accurately learn\nthe network representation via generating new academic network data layer by\nlayer. Experimental results from the three real-world academic network datasets\nshow that the PLFT model outperforms existing models when predicting the\nunexplored relationships among network entities.",

Traditional set reconciliation\nschemes are either statistical, offering success probability as a function of\ncommunication overhead and symmetric difference size, or require\nparametrization and estimation of that size, which can be error-prone. We\npresent CertainSync, a novel reconciliation framework that, to the best of our\nknowledge, is the first to guarantee successful set reconciliation without any\nparametrization or estimators. The framework is rateless and adapts to the\nunknown symmetric difference size. Reconciliation is guaranteed whenever the\ncommunication overhead reaches a lower bound derived from the symmetric\ndifference size and universe size. Our framework builds on recent constructions\nof Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs), ensuring successful element listing\nas long as the number of elements is bounded.

Our\napproach is validated by simulations, showing the ability to synchronize sets\nwith efficient communication costs while maintaining guarantees compared to\nbaseline schemes.

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the growing research and application of multimodal\nlarge language models (VLMs) in robotics, there has been an increasing trend of\nutilizing VLMs for robotic scene understanding tasks. Existing approaches that\nuse VLMs for 3D Visual Grounding tasks often focus on obtaining scene\ninformation through geometric and visual information, overlooking the\nextraction of diverse semantic information from the scene and the understanding\nof rich implicit semantic attributes, such as appearance, physics, and\naffordance. The 3D scene graph, which combines geometry and language, is an\nideal representation method for environmental perception and is an effective\ncarrier for language models in 3D Visual Grounding tasks. To address these\nissues, we propose a diverse semantic map construction method specifically\ndesigned for robotic agents performing 3D Visual Grounding tasks. This method\nleverages VLMs to capture the latent semantic attributes and relations of\nobjects within the scene and creates a Diverse Semantic Map (DSM) through a\ngeometry sliding-window map construction strategy. We enhance the understanding\nof grounding information based on DSM and introduce a novel approach named\nDSM-Grounding. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current\napproaches in tasks like semantic segmentation and 3D Visual Grounding,\nparticularly excelling in overall metrics compared to the state-of-the-art. In\naddition, we have deployed this method on robots to validate its effectiveness\nin navigation and grasping tasks.",

In this work, we propose PolyConf, a pioneering tailored polymer\nconformation generation method that leverages hierarchical generative models to\nunlock new possibilities. Specifically, we decompose the polymer conformation\ninto a series of local conformations (i.e., the conformations of its repeating\nunits), generating these local conformations through an autoregressive model,\nand then generating their orientation transformations via a diffusion model to\nassemble them into the complete polymer conformation. Moreover, we develop the\nfirst benchmark with a high-quality polymer conformation dataset derived from\nmolecular dynamics simulations to boost related research in this area.

    "abstract": "As the knowledge of the eigenmode symmetries at high symmetry points (HSPs)\nin the Brillouin zone is essential in studying the topological properties of\nelectronic and electromagnetic systems, how one can acquire it precisely has\nbecome a subject of interest. Here, we employ temporal coupled mode theory\n(CMT) to determine the irreducible representations of the energy bands at the\nHSPs in 2D square lattice photonic systems. Our CMT on plasmonic nanohole\narrays formulates how Bloch-like surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) interact not\nonly with each other and but also with the continuum, revealing the importance\nof mode coupling in defining the field symmetries as well as their radiative\nand nonradiative characteristics. Such formulation facilitates the assignments\nof the band representations. From the representations, we find, unlike the\nconventional 2D tight-binding model, several band inversions occur at the\n{\\Gamma}and X points as hole size increases, leading to changes in band\ntopology in a subtle manner. In addition, the radiations arising from the\ncoupled SPPs that carry different field symmetries are strongly polarization-\nand phase-dependent. We then conduct angle- and polarization-resolved\ndiffraction spectroscopy on plasmonic arrays to verify the theory. Our study\npaves a simple way toward the probing of the band topology of non-Hermitian\nsystems via far-field.",

Unlike existing\nmethods that directly insert objects into the background, adaptive and\ninteractive fusion remains a challenging yet appealing task. It requires the\nforeground to adjust or interact with the background context, enabling more\ncoherent integration. To address this, we propose an iterative\nhuman-in-the-loop data generation pipeline, which leverages limited initial\ndata with diverse textual prompts to generate fusion datasets across various\nscenarios and interactions, including placement, holding, wearing, and style\ntransfer. Building on this, we introduce DreamFuse, a novel approach based on\nthe Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model, to generate consistent and harmonious\nfused images with both foreground and background information. DreamFuse employs\na Positional Affine mechanism to inject the size and position of the foreground\ninto the background, enabling effective foreground-background interaction\nthrough shared attention. Furthermore, we apply Localized Direct Preference\nOptimization guided by human feedback to refine DreamFuse, enhancing background\nconsistency and foreground harmony. DreamFuse achieves harmonious fusion while\ngeneralizing to text-driven attribute editing of the fused results.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches across multiple metrics.",

Specifically, we explore the\ntheoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of\nthe second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii)\nsingle-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of\nstatic and dynamical phases. However, matter-wave superradiance, captured\nwithin the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show\nthat they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the\nsingle-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher\nenergy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner\napproximation (TWA), we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We\ndemonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the\nphoton-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave (DW)\nphase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of\ninteratomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be\nobserved in larger system sizes.

In contrast,\nsmaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual\ncapabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable\ndata. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose\na multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized\nroles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically\nachieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small\nLLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a\npeer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial\ndata samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the\nAdjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the\nsynthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can\nachieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation.

These agents start\nthe execution of a common algorithm from (possibly different) nodes in an\n$n$-node network, potentially starting at different times. Once started, the\nagents operate in synchronous rounds. We focus on \\emph{weakly} Byzantine\nenvironments, where Byzantine agents can behave arbitrarily but cannot falsify\ntheir IDs. The goal is for all \\emph{non-Byzantine} agents to eventually\nterminate at a single node simultaneously.\n  In this paper, we first prove two impossibility results: (1) for any number\nof non-Byzantine agents, no algorithm can solve this problem without global\nknowledge of the network size or the number of agents, and (2) no\nself-stabilizing algorithm exists if $k\\leq 2f$ even with $n$, $k$, $f$, and\nthe length $\\Lambda_g$ of the largest ID among IDs of non-Byzantine agents,\nwhere the self-stabilizing algorithm enables agents to gather starting from\narbitrary (inconsistent) initial states. Next, based on these results, we\nintroduce a \\emph{perpetual gathering} problem and propose a self-stabilizing\nalgorithm for this problem. This problem requires that all non-Byzantine agents\nalways be co-located from a certain time onwards. If the agents know\n$\\Lambda_g$ and upper bounds $N$, $K$, $F$ on $n$, $k$, $f$, the proposed\nalgorithm works in $O(K\\cdot F\\cdot \\Lambda_g\\cdot X(N))$ rounds, where $X(n)$\nis the time required to visit all nodes in a $n$-nodes network. Our results\nindicate that while no algorithm can solve the original self-stabilizing\ngathering problem for any $k$ and $f$ even with \\emph{exact} global knowledge\nof the network size and the number of agents, the self-stabilizing perpetual\ngathering problem can always be solved with just upper bounds on this\nknowledge.",

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of multimodal data across text, tables, and\nimages presents new challenges for developing models capable of complex\ncross-modal reasoning. Existing methods for Multimodal Multi-hop Question\nAnswering (MMQA) often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities, reliance on\nmodality conversion, and inadequate alignment between visual and textual\nrepresentations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces\nVision-Language Multimodal Transformer (VLMT), a unified architecture that\nintegrates a transformer-based vision encoder with a sequence-to-sequence\nlanguage model. VLMT employs a direct token-level injection mechanism to fuse\nvisual and textual inputs within a shared embedding space, eliminating the need\nfor intermediate projection layers. To enhance cross-modal alignment and\nreasoning, a three-stage pretraining strategy is proposed to progressively\nalign vision-language representations and improve the model's capacity for\nmultimodal understanding. Based on the pretrained backbone, two task-specific\nmodules are instantiated to form a two-stage MMQA framework: a multimodal\nreranker that predicts document relevance scores and utilizes a relative\nthreshold with top-k strategy for context retrieval, and a multimodal question\nanswering model that generates contextually grounded answers based on the\nretrieved evidence. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. On MultimodalQA\nvalidation set, VLMT-Large achieves 76.5% Exact Match and 80.1% F1,\noutperforming the previous state-of-the-art by +9.1% in Exact Match and +8.8%\nin F1. On WebQA, it attains a QA score of 47.6, surpassing prior models such as\nPERQA by +3.2. These results highlight VLMT's strong capabilities in multimodal\nreasoning and its potential to advance real-world information retrieval and\nquestion answering systems.",

When the shock broadness p is\nless than about 0.3 and the shock severity q is close to 1, the structural\nrobustness curves S(p,q) decrease linearly with respect to the shock broadness\np, suggesting that the most critical economies have relatively even influence\non network integrity.

    "abstract": "Observational studies examining causal effects rely on unverifiable causal\nassumptions, the violation of which can induce multiple biases. Quantitative\nbias analysis (QBA) methods examine the sensitivity of findings to such\nviolations, generally by producing bias-adjusted estimates under alternative\nassumptions. Common strategies for QBA address either a single source of bias\nor multiple sources one at a time, thus not informing the overall impact of the\npotential biases. We propose a systematic approach (roadmap) for identifying\nand analysing multiple biases together. Briefly, this consists of (i)\narticulating the assumptions underlying the primary analysis through\nspecification and emulation of the \"ideal trial\" that defines the causal\nestimand of interest and depicting these assumptions using casual diagrams;\n(ii) depicting alternative assumptions under which biases arise using causal\ndiagrams; (iii) obtaining a single estimate simultaneously adjusted for all\nbiases under the alternative assumptions. We illustrate the roadmap in an\ninvestigation of the effect of breastfeeding on risk of childhood asthma. We\nfurther use simulations to evaluate a recent simultaneous adjustment approach\nand illustrate the need for simultaneous rather than one-at-a-time adjustment\nto examine the overall impact of biases. The proposed roadmap should facilitate\nthe conduct of high-quality multiple bias analyses.",

In applications\nsuch as industrial manufacturing and defense systems, a higher output power is\nalways desired. Nevertheless, the power scaling in fiber lasers is limited by\nnonlinear effects and transverse mode instability in conventional high-power\nfiber laser systems, where the laser is amplified within the fundamental fiber\nmode. A promising strategy to overcome these limitations is to utilize\nmultimode fibers, which exhibit higher thresholds for both nonlinear effects\nand transverse mode instability, combined with wavefront shaping techniques to\nconvert the output speckle pattern into a single concentrated spot. In this\nstudy, a high-power multimode fiber laser amplifier based on wavefront shaping\nis constructed and investigated, achieving a focused beam profile with a 168 W\noutput power. The effects of objective function and the linewidth of seed laser\non the system performance are also studied.

This work opens\nup new avenues for leveraging multimode fibers to achieve higher brightness in\nfiber lasers and may inspire other research based on wavefront shaping.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the problem of characteristic mode analysis using\neigendecomposition of the method of moments impedance matrix has been\nsimplified using the eigen-subspace approach. The idea behind the\neigen-subspace arises from the physical properties of antenna or scatterers,\nwhere only a few eigenmodes are enough to characterize the antenna or\nscatterer. Therefore, entire space eigenanalysis is a waste of computational\nresources, and eigen-subspace analysis with few modes is good enough to\ncharacterize antennas and scatterers. It has been assumed that there is an\neigen-subspace (or hyperplane) of coupled characteristic mode, which coincides\nwith the eigen-hyperplane of uncoupled characteristic mode. We can say the\ncoupled characteristic modes are linear combinations of isolated modes based on\nthis assumption. The linear combination is mapped via modal coupling matrix.\nUsing the modal coupling matrix, we can explain the behavior of arbitrarily\nshaped antennas and scatterers. A computationally efficient method is developed\nto compute coupled characteristic modes of two mutually coupled scatterers or\nantennas using the eigen-subspace. The method is summarized as a theorem of\ntwo-body coupled characteristic mode. The theorem of two-body coupled\ncharacteristic mode has been extended to the N-body coupled characteristic\nmode. Two algorithms have been developed for the two-body multimode coupled\ncharacteristic mode and N-body multimode coupled characteristic mode.

    "abstract": "Reliable trajectory-based nonadiabatic quantum dynamics methods at the atomic\nlevel are critical for understanding many important processes in real systems.\nThe paper reports latest progress of nonadiabatic field (NaF), a conceptually\nnovel approach for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics with independent trajectories.\nSubstantially different from the mainstreams of Ehrenfest-like dynamics and\nsurface hopping methods, the nuclear force in NaF involves the nonadiabatic\nforce arising from the nonadiabatic coupling between different electronic\nstates, in addition to the adiabatic force contributed by a single adiabatic\nelectronic state. NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between\nelectronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the\nrelevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and\nwhere the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is\nderived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with\ncoordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed\nfor discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient\nintegrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic\nrepresentations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF\ncan in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the\ntime correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are\napplied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark\nmodels where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is\nshown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of\nthe electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable\nsimulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear\ndynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.",

While CBF-based controllers\noffer safety guarantees, they can compromise the performance of the system,\nleading to undesirable behaviors such as unbounded trajectories and emergence\nof locally stable spurious equilibria. Computing reachable sets for systems\nwith CBF-based controllers is an effective approach for runtime performance and\nstability verification, and can potentially serve as a tool for trajectory\nre-planning. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient interval\nreachability method for performance verification of systems with\noptimization-based controllers by: (i) approximating the optimization-based\ncontroller by a pre-trained neural network to avoid solving optimization\nproblems repeatedly, and (ii) using mixed monotone theory to construct an\nembedding system that leverages state-of-the-art neural network verification\nalgorithms for bounding the output of the neural network. Results in terms of\ncloseness of solutions of trajectories of the system with the\noptimization-based controller and the neural network are derived.

However, policies trained in\nsimulation often fail to transfer to real-world robots due to unrealistic\nassumptions such as infinite actuator bandwidth and the absence of torque\nlimits. These conditions allow policies to rely on abrupt, high-frequency\ntorque changes, which are infeasible for real actuators with finite bandwidth.\n  Traditional methods address this issue by penalizing aggressive motions\nthrough regularization rewards, such as joint velocities, accelerations, and\nenergy consumption, but they require extensive hyperparameter tuning.\nAlternatively, Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP) enforce finite bandwidth\naction control by penalizing policy gradients, but their reliance on gradient\ncalculations introduces significant GPU memory overhead. To overcome this\nlimitation, this work proposes Spectral Normalization (SN) as an efficient\nreplacement for enforcing Lipschitz continuity. By constraining the spectral\nnorm of network weights, SN effectively limits high-frequency policy\nfluctuations while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Experimental\nevaluations in both simulation and real-world humanoid robot show that SN\nachieves performance comparable to gradient penalty methods while enabling more\nefficient parallel training.",

The molecular axis distribution is influenced by the interacting\npulses and is intrinsically linked to the electronic coherences of the excited\nmolecules. However, in typical theoretical calculations of such interactions,\nthe signal is either calculated for a single molecule in the molecular frame or\naveraged over all possible molecular orientations to compare with the\nexperiment. This averaging leads to the loss of information about anisotropy in\nthe molecular-axis distribution, which could significantly affect the measured\nexperimental signal.

The\napproach is based on monitoring the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB)\noperator of each scanned part estimated using finite element methods (FEM). The\nspectrum of the LB operator is an intrinsic summary of the geometry of a part,\nindependent of the ambient space. Hence, registration of scanned parts is\nunnecessary when comparing them. The primary goal of this case study paper is\nto demonstrate the practical implementation of the spectral SPC methodology\nthrough multiple examples using real scanned parts acquired with an\nindustrial-grade laser scanner, including 3D printed parts and commercial\nparts.

However, the synergistic\neffects in multimodal data increase the sensitivity of ICL performance to the\nconfigurations of ICDs, stimulating the need for a more stable and general\nmapping function. Mathematically, in Transformer-based models, ICDs act as\n\"shift vectors\" added to the hidden states of query tokens. Inspired by this,\nwe introduce Mimic In-Context Learning (MimIC) to learn stable and\ngeneralizable shift effects from ICDs. Specifically, compared with some\nprevious shift vector-based methods, MimIC more strictly approximates the shift\neffects by integrating lightweight learnable modules into LMMs with four key\nenhancements: 1) inserting shift vectors after attention layers, 2) assigning a\nshift vector to each attention head, 3) making shift magnitude query-dependent,\nand 4) employing a layer-wise alignment loss. Extensive experiments on two LMMs\n(Idefics-9b and Idefics2-8b-base) across three multimodal tasks (VQAv2, OK-VQA,\nCaptioning) demonstrate that MimIC outperforms existing shift vector-based\nmethods.

With the increasing containerization and modernization of big\ndata applications, we argue that a unified control/management plane now makes\nsense for running these applications in hybrid cloud environments. To this end,\nwe study the problem of building a generic hybrid-cloud management plane to\nradically simplify managing big data applications.

Titchener\ncomprises of independent and loosely coupled local control planes interacting\nwith a highly available public cloud hosted global management plane. We\ndescribe a possible instantiation of Titchener based on Kubernetes and address\nissues related to global service discovery, network connectivity and access\ncontrol enforcement.

The challenge is that the sample size is\nlimited, so empirical covariance provides a poor estimate. In related\napplications, Bayesian factor models have been popular; these approaches\nexpress the covariance as low rank plus diagonal and can infer the number of\nfactors adaptively. However, they have the disadvantage of shrinking towards a\ndiagonal covariance, often under estimating important covariation patterns in\nthe data. Alternatively, the dimensionality problem is addressed by collapsing\nthe detailed exposure data within chemical classes, potentially obscuring\nimportant information. We apply a covariance meta regression extension of\nBayesian factor analysis, which improves performance by including information\nfrom features summarizing properties of the different exposures. This approach\nenables shrinkage to more flexible covariance structures, reducing the\nover-shrinkage problem, as we illustrate in the TESIE data using various\nchemical features as meta covariates.",

To address this limitation, we propose the influential bandit\nproblem, which models inter-arm interactions through an unknown, symmetric,\npositive semi-definite interaction matrix that governs the dynamics of arm\nlosses. We formally define this problem and establish two regret lower bounds,\nincluding a superlinear $\\Omega(T^2 / \\log^2 T)$ bound for the standard LCB\nalgorithm (loss minimization version of UCB) and an algorithm-independent\n$\\Omega(T)$ bound, which highlight the inherent difficulty of the setting. We\nthen introduce a new algorithm based on a lower confidence bound (LCB)\nestimator tailored to the structure of the loss dynamics. Under mild\nassumptions, our algorithm achieves a regret of $O(KT \\log T)$, which is nearly\noptimal in terms of its dependence on the time horizon.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become integral to numerous\napplications in critical domains where reliability is paramount. Despite\nsignificant advances in safety frameworks and guardrails, current protective\nmeasures exhibit crucial vulnerabilities, particularly in multilingual\ncontexts. Existing safety systems remain susceptible to adversarial attacks in\nlow-resource languages and through code-switching techniques, primarily due to\ntheir English-centric design. Furthermore, the development of effective\nmultilingual guardrails is constrained by the scarcity of diverse cross-lingual\ntraining data. Even recent solutions like Llama Guard-3, while offering\nmultilingual support, lack transparency in their decision-making processes. We\naddress these challenges by introducing X-Guard agent, a transparent\nmultilingual safety agent designed to provide content moderation across diverse\nlinguistic contexts. X-Guard effectively defends against both conventional\nlow-resource language attacks and sophisticated code-switching attacks. Our\napproach includes: curating and enhancing multiple open-source safety datasets\nwith explicit evaluation rationales; employing a jury of judges methodology to\nmitigate individual judge LLM provider biases; creating a comprehensive\nmultilingual safety dataset spanning 132 languages with 5 million data points;\nand developing a two-stage architecture combining a custom-finetuned mBART-50\ntranslation module with an evaluation X-Guard 3B model trained through\nsupervised finetuning and GRPO training. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate\nX-Guard's effectiveness in detecting unsafe content across multiple languages\nwhile maintaining transparency throughout the safety evaluation process. Our\nwork represents a significant advancement in creating robust, transparent, and\nlinguistically inclusive safety systems for LLMs and its integrated systems.",

    "abstract": "Gradient acoustic metasurfaces have shown strong potential for manipulation\nof acoustic waves across the audible and ultrasonic frequency ranges. The key\nchallenge in designing acoustic metasurfaces is to create a series of\nsub-wavelength unit cells that match the desired phase response. The most\ncommonly used geometry is a series of Helmholtz resonators, side-coupled to a\nnarrow channel. Despite the existence of a closed-form solution for 3\nside-coupled resonators, most reported designs instead make use of 4 or more\nresonators, which require opaque, optimization-based design approaches. We show\nthat the limiting factor in designs based on side-coupled resonators is the\nrequirement to use elements with a positive imaginary part of impedance, which\nimplies a Helmholtz resonator operating above its fundamental resonance -\ncontradicting the requirement for sub-wavelength volume. We show that by\nreplacing some of the Helmholtz resonators with meander-line elements, the\nrequired impedance values can readily be realized within a sub-wavelength\nvolume. The metasurface design approach is demonstrated for a lens operating at\n3 kHz and verified numerically. Furthermore, incorporating meander-line\nelements leads to improved broadband focusing performance, even when no\nexplicit dispersion engineering is included in the design. As this design\nincludes narrow channels, we include the effects of thermo-viscous losses in\nour modeling, and confirm that our design still gives superior performance to\nthe reference design using only Helmholtz resonators. Our design is expected to\nlead to more optimal performance of acoustic metasurface designs, and the\nability to make use of a closed-form design formula is expected to facilitate\nthe analysis of fundamental performance bounds and enable more explicit\nachromatic design processes.",

This study provides an\nefficient way to manipulate spin orientation in 2D materials and establishes a\ngeneral platform to explore physics and applications associated with spin\nslanting.",

    "abstract": "AI Agents powered by Large Language Models are transforming the world through\nenormous applications. A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user\nneeds, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding\nuser intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks. However, to\nmake such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale,\nsignificant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost.\nThis position paper presents a design of the Super Agent System powered by the\nhybrid AI routers. Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the\nintent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the\nnecessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most\napplications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and\nrobots. As different language models vary in capability and cloud-based models\noften entail high computational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then\nexplore the hybrid mode where the router dynamically selects between local and\ncloud models based on task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of\nan on-device super agent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality\nmodels and edge hardware, we envision that most computations can be handled\nlocally, with cloud collaboration only as needed. Such architecture paves the\nway for super agents to be seamlessly integrated into everyday life in the near\nfuture.",

    "abstract": "Liquid argon time projection chambers are often used in neutrino physics and\ndark-matter searches because of their high spatial resolution. The images\ngenerated by these detectors are extremely sparse, as the energy values\ndetected by most of the detector are equal to 0, meaning that despite their\nhigh resolution, most of the detector is unused in a particular interaction.\nInstead of representing all of the empty detections, the interaction is usually\nstored as a sparse matrix, a list of detection locations paired with their\nenergy values. Traditional machine learning methods that have been applied to\nparticle reconstruction such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), however,\ncannot operate over data stored in this way and therefore must have the matrix\nfully instantiated as a dense matrix. Operating on dense matrices requires a\nlot of memory and computation time, in contrast to directly operating on the\nsparse matrix. We propose a machine learning model using a point set neural\nnetwork that operates over a sparse matrix, greatly improving both processing\nspeed and accuracy over methods that instantiate the dense matrix, as well as\nover other methods that operate over sparse matrices. Compared to competing\nstate-of-the-art methods, our method improves classification performance by\n14%, segmentation performance by more than 22%, while taking 80% less time and\nusing 66% less memory.

Thus, this work proposes an innovative large-scale multi-perspective\nCode Intent Summary Dataset named BADS , aiming to increase the understanding\nof a given code snippet and reduce the risk in the code developing process. The\nprocedure of establishing a dataset can be divided into four steps: First, we\ncollect samples of codes with known vulnerabilities as well as code generated\nby AI from multiple sources. Second, we do the data clean and format\nunification, then do the data combination. Third, we utilize the LLM to\nautomatically Annotate the code snippet.

Our data are from Z open-source projects and CVE entries, and\ncompared to existing work, our dataset not only contains original code but also\ncode function summary and security intent summary, providing context\ninformation for research in code security analysis.
