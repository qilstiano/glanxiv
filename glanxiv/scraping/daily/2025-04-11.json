    "abstract": "Modern cutting-edge AI applications are being developed over fast-evolving,\nheterogeneous, nascent hardware devices. This requires frequent reworking of\nthe AI software stack to adopt bottom-up changes from new hardware, which takes\ntime for general-purpose software libraries. Consequently, real applications\noften develop custom software stacks optimized for their specific workloads and\nhardware. Custom stacks help in quick development and optimization, but incur a\nlot of redundant efforts across applications in writing non-portable code. This\npaper discusses an alternative communication library interface for AI\napplications that offers both portability and performance by reducing redundant\nefforts while maintaining flexibility for customization. We present MSCCL++, a\nnovel abstraction of GPU communication based on separation of concerns: (1) a\nprimitive interface provides a minimal hardware abstraction as a common ground\nfor software and hardware developers to write custom communication, and (2)\nhigher-level portable interfaces and specialized implementations enable\noptimization for different workloads and hardware environments. This approach\nmakes the primitive interface reusable across applications while enabling\nhighly flexible optimization. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines (NCCL,\nRCCL, and MSCCL), MSCCL++ achieves speedups of up to 5.4$\\times$ for collective\ncommunication and up to 15% for real-world AI inference workloads. MSCCL++ is\nin production of multiple AI services provided by Microsoft Azure, and is also\nadopted by RCCL, the GPU collective communication library maintained by AMD.\nMSCCL++ is open-source and available at https://github.com/microsoft/mscclpp.",

    "abstract": "Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN) is a class of promising post-CMOS\ntechnologies that transmit information through electric or magnetic fields\ninstead of current flow. They utilize basic building blocks called cells, which\ncan form gates that implement Boolean functions. However, the design\nconstraints for FCN circuits differ significantly from those for CMOS. One\nmajor challenge is that wires in FCN have to be realized as gates, i.e., they\nare constructed from cells and incur the same costs as gates. Additionally, all\nFCN technologies are fabricated on a single layer, e.g., a silicon surface,\nrequiring all elements -- gates and wires -- to be placed within that same\nlayer. Consequently, FCN employs special gates, called wire crossings, to\nenable signals to cross. While existing wire-crossing implementations are\ncomplex and were previously considered costly, initial efforts have aimed at\nminimizing their use. However, recent physical simulations and experiments on a\nquantum annealing platform have shown that currently used wire crossings in FCN\nsignificantly compromise signal stability, to the extent that circuits cannot\nfunction reliably. This work addresses that issue by introducing the first\nplacement and routing algorithm that produces fully planar FCN circuits,\neliminating the need for all wire crossings. For a comparative evaluation, a\nstate-of-the-art placement and routing algorithm was also modified to enforce\nplanarity. However, our proposed algorithm is more scalable and can handle\ninputs with up to 149k gates, enabling it to process circuits that are 182x\nmore complex than those handled by the modified state-of-the-art algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In clinical trials, inferences on clinical outcomes are often made\nconditional on specific selective processes. For instance, only when a\ntreatment demonstrates a significant effect on the primary outcome, further\nanalysis is conducted to investigate its efficacy on selected secondary\noutcomes. Similarly, inferences may also depend on whether a trial is\nterminated early at interim stage. While conventional approaches primarily aim\nto control the family-wise error rate through multiplicity adjustments, they do\nnot necessarily ensure the desired statistical property of the inference\nresult, when the analysis is conducted according to a selective process. For\nexample, the conditional coverage level of a regular confidence interval under\na selective processes can be very different from its nominal level even after\nadjustment for multiple testing. In this paper, we argue that the validity of\nthe inference procedure conditional on selective process is important in many\napplications. In addition, we propose to construct confidence intervals with\ncorrect conditional coverage probability by accounting for related selective\nprocess. Specifically, our approach involves a pivotal quantity constructed by\ninversing the cumulative distribution function of a truncated normal\ndistribution induced by the selective process. Theoretical justification and\ncomprehensive simulations illustrate the effectiveness of this method in\nrealistic settings. We also apply our method to analyze data from the SPRINT,\nresulting in more conservative but conditionally valid confidence intervals for\nthe average treatment effect than those originally published.",

This necessitates a\ncomprehensive understanding of the physical processes and timescales that\ndictate the shock-induced breakup of liquid droplets. These processes are\ndifficult to probe and quantify experimentally, often limiting measurements to\nmacroscopic properties. Here, fundamental mechanisms in such interactions are\nelucidated through detailed numerical simulation of Mach 2 and 3 shock waves\ninteracting with 100 $\\mu$m water droplets. Using a thermodynamically\nconsistent two-phase formulation with adaptive mesh refinement, the simulations\ncapture droplet surface instabilities and atomization into secondary droplets\nin great detail. The results show that droplet breakup occurs through a coupled\nmulti-stage process, including droplet flattening, formation of surface\ninstabilities and piercing, and the shedding of secondary droplets from the\nligaments of the deformed primary droplet. When considering the dimensionless\ntimescale of Ranger and Nicholls ($\\tau$), these processes occur at similar\nrates for the different shock strengths. The PDFs for the Sauter mean diameters\nof secondary droplets are bimodal log-normal distributions at $\\tau=2$. Modest\ndifferences in the degree and rate of liquid mass transfer into droplets less\nthan 5 $\\mu$m in diameter are hypothesized to partially derive from differences\nin droplet surface piercing modes.

However,\nfluid models are only valid if the SOL is highly collisional, an assumption\nthat is valid in many present day experiments but is questionable in the\nhigh-power scenarios envisioned for burning plasmas and fusion pilot plants.\nThis paper reports on comparisons between fluid and kinetic simulations of the\nscrape off layer (SOL) for parameters and geometry representative of the\nSpherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) fusion pilot plant. The\nSOLPS-ITER (fluid) and Gkeyll (gyrokinetic) codes are operated in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric mode, which replaces turbulence with ad-hoc\ndiffusivities. In kinetic simulations, we observe that the ions in the upstream\nSOL experience significant mirror trapping. This substantially increases the\nupstream temperature and has important implications for impurity dynamics. We\nshow that the mirror force, which is excluded in SOLPS's form of fluid\nequations, enhances the electrostatic potential drop along the field line in\nthe SOL. We also show that the assumption of equal main ion and impurity\ntemperatures, which is made in commonly used fluid codes, is invalid. The\ncombination of these effects results in superior confinement of impurities to\nthe divertor region in kinetic simulations, consistent with our earlier\npredictions. This effect can be dramatic, reducing the midplane impurity\ndensity by orders of magnitude. These results indicate that in reactor-like\nregimes the tolerable downstream impurity densities may be higher than would be\npredicted by fluid simulations, allowing for higher radiated power while\navoiding unacceptable core contamination.

    "abstract": "Interactions between short laser pulses and electron bunches determine a wide\nrange of accelerator applications. Finding spatiotemporal overlap between\nfew-micron-sized optical and electron beams is critical, yet there are few\nroutine diagnostics for this purpose. We present a method for achieving\nspatiotemporal overlap between a picosecond laser pulse and a relativistic\nsub-ps electron bunch. The method uses the transient change in optical\ntransmission of a Ce:YAG screen upon irradiation with a short electron bunch to\nco-time the electron and laser beams. We demonstrate and quantify the\nperformance of this method using an inverse Compton source comprised of a 30\nMeV electron beam from an X-band linac focused to a 10 $\\mu$m spot, overlapped\nwith a joule-class picosecond Yb:YAG laser system. This method is applicable to\nelectron beams with few-microjoule bunch energies, and uses standard\nscintillator screens common in electron accelerators.",

    "abstract": "Visual Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) requires a robot to locate a target\nobject in an unseen environment using egocentric observations. However,\ndecision-making policies often struggle to transfer to unseen environments and\nnovel target objects, which is the core generalization problem. Traditional\nend-to-end learning methods exacerbate this issue, as they rely on memorizing\nspatial patterns rather than employing structured reasoning, limiting their\nability to generalize effectively. In this letter, we introduce Closed-Loop\nHierarchical Chain-of-Thought Navigation (CL-CoTNav), a vision-language model\n(VLM)-driven ObjectNav framework that integrates structured reasoning and\nclosed-loop feedback into navigation decision-making. To enhance\ngeneralization, we fine-tune a VLM using multi-turn question-answering (QA)\ndata derived from human demonstration trajectories. This structured dataset\nenables hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (H-CoT) prompting, systematically\nextracting compositional knowledge to refine perception and decision-making,\ninspired by the human cognitive process of locating a target object through\niterative reasoning steps. Additionally, we propose a Closed-Loop H-CoT\nmechanism that incorporates detection and reasoning confidence scores into\ntraining. This adaptive weighting strategy guides the model to prioritize\nhigh-confidence data pairs, mitigating the impact of noisy inputs and enhancing\nrobustness against hallucinated or incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments\nin the AI Habitat environment demonstrate CL-CoTNav's superior generalization\nto unseen scenes and novel object categories. Our method consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches in navigation success rate (SR) and\nsuccess weighted by path length (SPL) by 22.4\\%.

The integration of BaTiO3 as a base material\nfor the coating allowed the successful use of otherwise\ndischarge-ignition-inhibiting materials such as MnO2-CuO applied as a full\ncoating. Application of pure BaTiO3 led to highly porous coatings that do not\nhinder the discharge ignition and show a negligible influence on n-butane\nconversion while reducing byproduct formation. Thus, BaTiO3 was identified as a\nsuitable structure-directing agent in two-component coatings, using 1:1 and 1:2\nratios of BaTiO3:catalyst coatings.

The study involved analysing system performance across\nvarious demographic groups, particularly focusing on gender and age-based\ncohorts. Performance evaluation was based on multiple metrics, including\nnormalised costs and cross-entropy. We employed calibration techniques trained\nseparately on predefined demographic groups to address group-dependent\nmiscalibration. Analysis revealed significant performance disparities across\ngroups despite strong global metrics. The system showed systematic biases,\nmisclassifying healthy speakers over 55 as having a voice disorder and speakers\nwith disorders aged 14-30 as healthy. Group-specific calibration improved\nposterior probability quality, reducing overconfidence. For young disordered\nspeakers, low severity scores were identified as contributing to poor system\nperformance. For older speakers, age-related voice characteristics and\npotential limitations in the pretrained Hubert model used as feature extractor\nlikely affected results. The study demonstrates that global performance metrics\nare insufficient for evaluating AVDD system performance. Group-specific\nanalysis may unmask problems in system performance which are hidden within\nglobal metrics. Further, group-dependent calibration strategies help mitigate\nbiases, resulting in a more reliable indication of system confidence.

Light curves showing the\nevolution of the flare's irradiance as a function of time taken by MAVEN are\nwell correlated with the brightness evolution of fan structures observed in the\nPROBA2 SWAP 174 {\\AA} passband, suggesting that the radiance of structures near\nthe flare site was influenced by emission from the flare. Because SWAP did not\ndirectly observe the flare itself, this event represents a rare opportunity to\nstudy the evolution of emission near a flare without the risk of instrumental\nscattered light contaminating the observations. We analyze this evolution and\nimplement a simple model to explore the possibility that resonant excitation\n(or resonant scattering) plays an important role in driving coronal EUV\nemission during flaring events. Our modeling shows that for a large flare,\nresonant excitation could increase emission from nearby structures by about\n45%, consistent with our findings that the involved structures observed by SWAP\nincreased in brightness by about 60% during the flare. We conclude that\nresonant excitation may play an important role in driving coronal EUV emission\nunder certain circumstances and should be accounted for in models and\nemission-based analysis tools.",

We highlight an\nimbalanced metabolic axis of growth and proliferation (anabolic) versus\nmaintenance and dormancy (catabolic), focusing on major mechanisms including\nIGF-1, mTOR, AMPK, and Klotho. We also relate this axis to the hyperfunction\ntheory of aging, which similarly implicates anabolic mechanisms like mTOR in\naging and disease. Next, we highlight the Brain-Body Energy Conservation model,\nwhich connects the hyperfunction theory with energetic trade-offs that induce\nhypofunction and catabolic health risks like impaired immunity. Finally, we\ndiscuss how modern environmental mismatches exacerbate this process. Following\nour review, we discuss future research directions to better understand health\nrisk. This includes studying IGF-1, mTOR, AMPK, and Klotho and how they relate\nto health and aging in human subsistence populations, including with lifestyle\nshifts. It also includes understanding their role in the developmental origins\nof health and disease as well as the social determinants of health disparities.\nFurther, we discuss the need for future studies on exceptionally long-lived\nspecies to understand potentially underappreciated trade-offs and costs that\ncome with their longevity. We close with considering possible implications for\ntherapeutics, including (1) compensatory pathways counteracting treatments, (2)\na Goldilocks zone, in which suppressing anabolic metabolism too far introduces\ncatabolic health risks, and (3) species constraints, in which therapeutics\ntested in shorter lived species with greater anabolic imbalance will be less\neffective in humans.",

    "abstract": "Sinking marine snow particles, composed primarily of organic matter, control\nthe global export of photosynthetically fixed carbon from the ocean surface to\ndepth. The fate of sedimenting marine snow particles is in part regulated by\ntheir encounters with suspended, micron-sized objects, which leads to mass\naccretion by the particles and potentially alters their buoyancy, and with\nbacteria that can colonize the particles and degrade them. Their collision\nrates are typically calculated using two types of models focusing either on\ndirect (ballistic) interception with a finite interaction range, or\nadvective-diffusive capture with a zero interaction range. Since the range of\napplicability of the two models is unknown, and many relevant marine encounter\nscenarios span across both regimes, quantifying such encounters remains\nchallenging, because the two models yield asymptotically different predictions\nat high P\\'{e}clet numbers. Here, we reconcile the two limiting approaches by\nquantifying the encounters in the general case using a combination of\ntheoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Solving the advection-diffusion\nequation in Stokes flow around a sphere to model mass transfer to a large\nsinking particle by small yet finite-sized objects, we determine a new formula\nfor the Sherwood number as a function of two dimensionless parameters: the\nP\\'{e}clet number and the ratio of small to large particle sizes. We find that\ndiffusion can play a significant role in generating encounters even at high Pe.\nAt Pe as high as $10^6$, the direct interception model underestimates the\nencounter rate by up to two orders of magnitude. This overlooked contribution\nof diffusion to encounters suggests that important processes affecting the fate\nof marine snow, such as colonization by bacteria and plankton or accretion of\nneutrally buoyant gels, may proceed at a rate much faster than previously\nthought.",

GX 9+1, located in the Galactic bulge, is a persistently\nbright Atoll source known for its spectral variability along the color-color\ndiagram. Our spectral analysis during the soft state confirms emission\ndominated by a soft blackbody and thermal Comptonization components, with no\nevidence of a hard X-ray tail. These observations suggest a relatively\nlow-inclination system (23 deg < i < 46 deg) with a weak reflection component,\nconsistent with emission from the accretion disk and neutron star boundary\nlayer. Spectro-polarimetric analysis reveals no significant polarization in the\n2-8 keV range, with a 3-sigma upper limit for the polarization degree of 1.9%.\nHowever, marginal evidence of polarization was detected in the 2-3 keV band at\nthe 95.5% confidence level (2-sigma), suggesting potential contributions from\nscattering effects in the individual spectral components (disk, reflection, and\nComptonization) that could cancel each other out due to the different\norientations of their polarization angles. This behavior aligns with other\nAtoll sources observed by IXPE, which typically exhibit lower and less variable\npolarization degrees compared to Z-class sources.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental task in Intelligent Tutoring Systems\n(ITS), which aims to model the dynamic knowledge states of students based on\ntheir interaction histories. However, existing KT models often rely on a global\nforgetting decay mechanism for capturing learning patterns, assuming that\nstudents' performance is predominantly influenced by their most recent\ninteractions. Such approaches fail to account for the diverse and complex\nlearning patterns arising from individual differences and varying learning\nstages. To address this limitation, we propose RouterKT, a novel\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to capture heterogeneous\nlearning patterns by enabling experts to specialize in different patterns\nwithout any handcrafted learning pattern bias such as forgetting decay.\nSpecifically, RouterKT introduces a \\textbf{person-wise routing mechanism} to\neffectively model individual-specific learning behaviors and employs\n\\textbf{multi-heads as experts} to enhance the modeling of complex and diverse\npatterns. Comprehensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nRouterKT exhibits significant flexibility and improves the performance of\nvarious KT backbone models, with a maximum average AUC improvement of 3.29\\%\nacross different backbones and datasets, outperforming other state-of-the-art\nmodels.

The quality of acquired images directly influences\nthe ability of autonomous driving systems to correctly recognize and respond to\nother vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles in real-time. However, real\nenvironments present extreme variations in lighting, causing saturation\nproblems and resulting in the loss of crucial details for detection.\nTraditionally, High Dynamic Range (HDR) images have been preferred for their\nability to capture a broad spectrum of light intensities, but the need for\nmultiple captures to construct HDR images is inefficient for real-time\napplications in autonomous vehicles. To address these issues, this work\nintroduces the use of modulo sensors for robust object detection.

    "abstract": "Recent steganographic schemes, starting with Meteor (CCS'21), rely on\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) to resolve a historically-challenging\ntask of disguising covert communication as ``innocent-looking''\nnatural-language communication. However, existing methods are vulnerable to\n``re-randomization attacks,'' where slight changes to the communicated text,\nthat might go unnoticed, completely destroy any hidden message. This is also a\nvulnerability in more traditional encryption-based stegosystems, where\nadversaries can modify the randomness of an encryption scheme to destroy the\nhidden message while preserving an acceptable covertext to ordinary users. In\nthis work, we study the problem of robust steganography. We introduce formal\ndefinitions of weak and strong robust LLM-based steganography, corresponding to\ntwo threat models in which natural language serves as a covertext channel\nresistant to realistic re-randomization attacks. We then propose two\nconstructions satisfying these notions. We design and implement our\nsteganographic schemes that embed arbitrary secret messages into natural\nlanguage text generated by LLMs, ensuring recoverability even under adversarial\nparaphrasing and rewording attacks. To support further research and real-world\ndeployment, we release our implementation and datasets for public use.",

We report the discovery of a bubble-shaped\nsource (S144 in RCW79), associated with a compact H II region, excited by a\nsingle O7.5--9.5V/III star, which is consistent with a scenario that the bubble\nis still mostly ``filled'' with C$^+$.

Using the SimLine non-LTE\nradiative transfer code, the [C II] emission can be modeled to originate from\nthree regions. First, a central H II region with little C$^+$ in the fully\nionized phase, followed by two layers with gas density around\n$2500\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ of partially photo-dissociated gas. The second layer\nis a slowly expanding [C II] shell with an expansion velocity of\n$\\sim\\,$$2.6\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$.

We developed a procedure to approximate the missing [C II] flux and\nfind a linear correlation between [C II] and FIR without a [C II]-deficit.

To uncover the extent and nature\nof these biases, we build upon existing benchmarks to create five datasets\ncontaining mismatched image-text pairs, covering topics in mathematics,\nscience, and visual descriptions.

These metrics often compress accuracy\nassessment into a single value, obscuring models' specific strengths and\nweaknesses. The prevailing evaluation protocol, link prediction, operates under\nthe unrealistic assumption that an entity's properties, for which values are to\nbe predicted, are known in advance.

    "abstract": "Incivility refers to behaviors that violate collective norms and disrupt\ncooperation within the political process. Although large-scale online data and\nautomated techniques have enabled the quantitative analysis of uncivil\ndiscourse, prior research has predominantly focused on impoliteness or\ntoxicity, often overlooking other behaviors that undermine democratic values.\nTo address this gap, we propose a multidimensional conceptual framework\nencompassing Impoliteness, Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric, Hate\nSpeech and Stereotyping, and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values.\nUsing this framework, we measure the spread of online political incivility in\nBrazil using approximately 5 million tweets posted by 2,307 political\ninfluencers during the 2022 Brazilian general election. Through statistical\nmodeling and network analysis, we examine the dynamics of uncivil posts at\ndifferent election stages, identify key disseminators and audiences, and\nexplore the mechanisms driving the spread of uncivil information online. Our\nfindings indicate that impoliteness is more likely to surge during election\ncampaigns. In contrast, the other dimensions of incivility are often triggered\nby specific violent events. Moreover, we find that left-aligned individual\ninfluencers are the primary disseminators of online incivility in the Brazilian\nTwitter/X sphere and that they disseminate not only direct incivility but also\nindirect incivility when discussing or opposing incivility expressed by others.\nThey relay those content from politicians, media agents, and individuals to\nreach broader audiences, revealing a diffusion pattern mixing the direct and\ntwo-step flows of communication theory. This study offers new insights into the\nmultidimensional nature of incivility in Brazilian politics and provides a\nconceptual framework that can be extended to other political contexts.",

    "abstract": "Generative masked transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across\nvarious content generation tasks, primarily due to their ability to effectively\nmodel large-scale dataset distributions with high consistency. However, in the\nanimation domain, large datasets are not always available. Applying generative\nmasked modeling to generate diverse instances from a single MoCap reference may\nlead to overfitting, a challenge that remains unexplored. In this work, we\npresent MotionDreamer, a localized masked modeling paradigm designed to learn\ninternal motion patterns from a given motion with arbitrary topology and\nduration. By embedding the given motion into quantized tokens with a novel\ndistribution regularization method, MotionDreamer constructs a robust and\ninformative codebook for local motion patterns. Moreover, a sliding window\nlocal attention is introduced in our masked transformer, enabling the\ngeneration of natural yet diverse animations that closely resemble the\nreference motion patterns. As demonstrated through comprehensive experiments,\nMotionDreamer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods that are typically GAN\nor Diffusion-based in both faithfulness and diversity. Thanks to the\nconsistency and robustness of the quantization-based approach, MotionDreamer\ncan also effectively perform downstream tasks such as temporal motion editing,\n\\textcolor{update}{crowd animation}, and beat-aligned dance generation, all\nusing a single reference motion.

To this\nend, we propose an approach that detects which high-level goals and patterns\n(i.e. programming plans) exist in a student program with LLMs. We show that\nboth the full GPT-4o model and a small variant (GPT-4o-mini) can detect these\nplans with remarkable accuracy, outperforming baselines inspired by\nconventional approaches to code analysis. We further show that the smaller,\ncost-effective variant (GPT-4o-mini) achieves results on par with\nstate-of-the-art (GPT-4o) after fine-tuning, creating promising implications\nfor smaller models for real-time grading. These smaller models can be\nincorporated into autograders for open-ended code-writing exercises to provide\nfeedback for students' implicit planning skills, even when their program is\nsyntactically incorrect. Furthermore, LLMs may be useful in providing feedback\nfor problems in other domains where students start with a set of high-level\nsolution steps and iteratively compute the output, such as math and physics\nproblems.",

Our findings reveal that Li and Na intercalation primarily\nmodifies the electronic properties of Nb2C without inducing significant\nstructural distortions, as indicated by Raman intensity variations. Adsorption\nenergy calculations show that the T4 and H3 sites are the most favorable for\nmetal intercalation, with Nb2CO2 exhibiting stronger adsorption due to oxygen\nfunctionalization. We find that Nb2C offers lower diffusion barriers,\nespecially for Na ions, making it a promising candidate for fast-charging SIBs.\nIn contrast, Nb2CO2 enhances charge retention through stronger electrostatic\ninteractions but introduces higher migration resistance. Electronic structure\nanalysis confirms the metallic nature of both MXenes, ensuring efficient\nelectron transport. Open-circuit voltage (OCV) calculations indicate that\nNb2CO2 exhibits higher OCV values than Nb2C, highlighting the role of surface\nfunctionalization in tuning electrochemical performance. Our study suggests\nthat, while Li-based systems achieve slightly higher theoretical capacities,\nNa-based systems exhibit comparable performance, reinforcing the viability of\nsodium-ion batteries as a cost-effective alternative.

To make these measurements with high precision,\nDUNE will require external $\\nu$-Ar scattering cross section data as a crucial\ninput to the oscillation fit.

From this position, ICARUS is exposed to a\nlarge flux of NuMI (anti-)electron and (anti-)muon neutrinos, and poses a\nunique opportunity to provide high-statistics measurements of quasi-elastic and\nsingle pion-production cross sections for four neutrino flavors ($\\nu_\\mu$,\n$\\nu_e$, $\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$, $\\bar{\\nu}_e$). This dissertation focused on the\nmodel of the NuMI beamline and its impact on the neutrino fluxes, but also\ndelved into the detector response model and its impact on reconstructed\nobservables in the detector. In particular, the NuMI flux was determined to be\ncomposed of 57% $\\nu_\\mu$, 38% $\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$, 3% $\\nu_e$, and 2%\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ while the horns are operating in the positive-particle focusing\nconfiguration.

These approaches\npredominantly employ supervised fine-tuning on single-domain user interactions\nto adapt LLMs for specific recommendation tasks. However, they typically\nencounter dual challenges: the mismatch between general language\nrepresentations and domain-specific preference patterns, as well as the limited\nadaptability to multi-domain recommendation scenarios. To bridge these gaps, we\nintroduce CPRec -- an All-domain Continual Pre-Training framework for\nRecommendation -- designed to holistically align LLMs with universal user\nbehaviors through the continual pre-training paradigm. Specifically, we first\ndesign a unified prompt template and organize users' multi-domain behaviors\ninto domain-specific behavioral sequences and all-domain mixed behavioral\nsequences that emulate real-world user decision logic. To optimize behavioral\nknowledge infusion, we devise a Warmup-Stable-Annealing learning rate schedule\ntailored for the continual pre-training paradigm in recommendation to\nprogressively enhance the LLM's capability in knowledge adaptation from\nopen-world knowledge to universal recommendation tasks. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of our CPRec, we implement it on a large-scale dataset covering\nseven domains and conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets\nfrom two distinct platforms.

Initial\nexperiments applying DRL to an implementation of the A Link to the Past example\ndo not produce the treacherous turn effect naturally, despite various\nmodifications to the environment intended to produce it.

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important\nproblem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed\nthe tasks.

We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the\nprocess would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations\nwith LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually\nannotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation.\nHowever, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents.

Most deep learning-based fusion methods rely on\nlarge-scale paired datasets to extract global weighting features from raw\nimages, thereby generating fused outputs that approximate real fused images. In\ncontrast to previous studies, this paper explores few-shot training of neural\nnetworks under the condition of having prior knowledge. We propose a novel\nfusion framework named GBFF, and a Granular Ball Significant Extraction\nalgorithm specifically designed for the few-shot prior setting. All pixel pairs\ninvolved in the fusion process are initially modeled as a Coarse-Grained\nGranular Ball. At the local level, Fine-Grained Granular Balls are used to\nslide through the brightness space to extract Non-Salient Pixel Pairs, and\nperform splitting operations to obtain Salient Pixel Pairs. Pixel-wise weights\nare then computed to generate a pseudo-supervised image. At the global level,\npixel pairs with significant contributions to the fusion process are\ncategorized into the Positive Region, while those whose contributions cannot be\naccurately determined are assigned to the Boundary Region. The Granular Ball\nperforms modality-aware adaptation based on the proportion of the positive\nregion, thereby adjusting the neural network's loss function and enabling it to\ncomplement the information of the boundary region. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed algorithm and the underlying\ntheory.

    "abstract": "Quantum inertial sensors test general relativity, measure fundamental\nconstants, and probe dark matter and dark energy in the laboratory with\noutstanding accuracy. Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed\nquantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves,\nelectric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the\nlaboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and\ninertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size,\nweight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here,\nwe describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to\ncreate the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations,\nsuch as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative\ncooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant\nadvantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced\ncurrent inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage.\nHowever, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that\ninclude bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design\nimplements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which\nuse a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity\nthat is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal.

The\nparameters - related to the energy density difference between quark matter and\nthe QCD vacuum, the strength of strong interactions, and the gap parameter for\ncolor superconductivity - are sampled via quasi-random Latin hypercube sampling\nto ensure uniform coverage. To constrain them, we incorporate observational\ndata on the maximum mass of NSs (from binary and merger systems), the radii of\n$1.4$ M$_{\\odot}$ NSs (from gravitational wave and electromagnetic\nobservations), and tidal deformabilities (from GW170817). Our results show that\nquark strong interactions play a key role, requiring at least a $20\\%$\ndeviation from the free-quark limit. We also find that color superconductivity\nis relevant, with the gap parameter reaching up to $\\sim 230$ MeV for a strange\nquark mass of $100$ MeV. The surface-to-vacuum energy density jump lies in the\nrange $(1.1-2.2)$ $\\rho_{\\rm{sat}}$, where $\\rho_{\\rm{sat}} \\simeq 2.7 \\times\n10^{14}$ g cm$^{-3}$.

We detect two distinct\ncomponents of ionized absorbers in this source. The ionization parameter of the\nlow-ionization warm absorber component tracks changes in the ionizing flux with\nno measurable time lag. This rapid response implies photoionization equilibrium\nand places a lower limit on the electron density of about 9 x 10^6 cm^-3, based\non the most abundant ionic species, O VII. The absorber is located within\napproximately 0.02 parsecs of the central source, consistent with an origin in\nthe inner regions of the active nucleus.

This suggests that it may be collisional plasma, as also indicated\nin previous studies.

However, some sub-samples of calibrated SNe Ia\nemployed to measure H0 yield noteworthy differences due to small sample\nstatistics but also due to differences in sample selection.

Specifically, are the explanations rationalizing\npredictions from the output rather than reflecting the true decision process?\nTo investigate such explanatory inversion, we propose Inversion Quantification\n(IQ), a framework that quantifies the degree to which explanations rely on\noutputs and deviate from faithful input-output relationships. Using the\nframework, we demonstrate on synthetic datasets that widely used methods such\nas LIME and SHAP are prone to such inversion, particularly in the presence of\nspurious correlations, across tabular, image, and text domains.

We detect H$_2$O (3.09 $\\sigma$) both across NIRISS/SOSS wavelengths\nrange and at the bluest end of NIRSpc/G395H as well as a gray cloud deck (1.90\n$\\sigma$). We constrain the atmospheric metallicity of HAT-P-14 b to be roughly\nSolar, with [Fe/H] $= -0.08^{+0.89}_{-0.98}$, consistent with the planet\nmass-metallicity relationship. The differences compared to previous works are\nlikely due to the improved STScI jwst pipeline, which highlights the need to\nreanalyze the early NIRISS/SOSS transiting exoplanet targets with the latest\nmethods. As HAT-P-14 b is placed as the 805th best target for transmission\nspectroscopy according to Transmission Spectroscopy Metrics (TSM), our results\nshowcase JWST's unparalleled photometric precision which can easily\ncharacterize a thousand exoplanets' atmospheres through transmission\nspectroscopy.",

Their true form only reveals\nitself when seen from a specific viewpoint, which can be through some\ncatadioptric device like a mirror or a lens. While the construction of these\nmathematical devices can be traced back to as early as the 17th century, they\nare only interpretable when viewed from a specific vantage point and tend to\nlose meaning when seen normally. In this paper, we revisit these famous optical\nillusions with a generative twist.

At a large scale, real-world data often\nexhibit inherently non-Euclidean structures, such as multi-way relationships,\nhierarchies, symmetries, and non-isotropic scaling, in a variety of domains,\nsuch as languages, vision, and the natural sciences. It is challenging to\neffectively capture these structures within the constraints of Euclidean\nspaces. This position paper argues that moving beyond Euclidean geometry is not\nmerely an optional enhancement but a necessity to maintain the scaling law for\nthe next-generation of foundation models. By adopting these geometries,\nfoundation models could more efficiently leverage the aforementioned\nstructures. Task-aware adaptability that dynamically reconfigures embeddings to\nmatch the geometry of downstream applications could further enhance efficiency\nand expressivity. Our position is supported by a series of theoretical and\nempirical investigations of prevalent foundation models.Finally, we outline a\nroadmap for integrating non-Euclidean geometries into foundation models,\nincluding strategies for building geometric foundation models via fine-tuning,\ntraining from scratch, and hybrid approaches.",

Two competing tendencies can be\nanticipated: (i) following the quantum order-by-disorder paradigm, quantum\nfluctuations could induce symmetry-breaking (charge) order, or (ii) the\nclassical liquid builds up long-range entanglement and turns into a quantum\nliquid.

Unlike\nmost magnetars, the source has only moderate foreground extinction with minimal\ncrowding. Our observations began only 2 hours after the first activation of SGR\n0501+4516 in August 2008, and continued for 4 years, including two epochs of\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. The proper motion constraint is improved\nby a third HST epoch 10 years later. The near-infrared and X-rays faded slowly\nduring the first week, thereafter following a steeper power-law decay. The\nbehaviour is satisfactorily fit by a broken power-law. Three epochs of HST\nimaging with a 10-year baseline allow us to determine a quiescent level, and to\nmeasure a proper motion of 5.4+/-0.6 mas/yr. This corresponds to a low\ntransverse peculiar velocity of 51+/-14 km/s (at 2 kpc). The magnitude and\ndirection of the proper motion rules out supernova remnant HB9 as the\nbirth-site. We can find no other supernova remnants or groups of massive stars\nwithin the region traversed by SGR 0501+4516 during its characteristic lifetime\n(20 kyr). Our observations of SGR 0501+4516 suggest that some magnetars may be\neither significantly older than expected, that their progenitors produce low\nsupernova ejecta masses, or alternatively that they can be formed through\naccretion-induced collapse (AIC) or low-mass neutron star mergers.

    "abstract": "Physical constraints and engineering challenges, including wafer dimensions,\nclassical control cabling, and refrigeration volumes, impose significant\nlimitations on the scalability of quantum computing units. As a result, a\nmodular quantum computing architecture, comprising small processors\ninterconnected by quantum links, is emerging as a promising approach to\nfault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the requirements that the network\nmust fulfill to enable distributed quantum computation remain largely\nunexplored. We consider an architecture tailored for qubits with\nnearest-neighbor physical connectivity, leveraging the surface code for error\ncorrection and enabling fault-tolerant operations through lattice surgery and\nmagic state distillation. We propose measurement teleportation as a tool to\nextend lattice surgery techniques to qubits located on different computing\nunits interconnected via Bell pairs. Through memory simulations, we build an\nerror model for logical operations and deduce an end-to-end resource estimation\nof Shor's algorithm over a minimalist distributed architecture. Concretely, for\na characteristic physical gate error rate of 1e-3, a processor cycle time of 1\nmicrosecond, factoring a 2048-bit RSA integer is shown to be possible with 379\ncomputing processors, each made with 89781 qubits, with negligible space and\ntime overhead with respect to a monolithic approach without parallelization, if\n70 Bell pairs are available per cycle time between each processor with a\nfidelity exceeding 98.4 percent.",

Low-mass galaxies tend to follow a steep slope, close\nto one, while the slope flattens for high-mass early type galaxies. In our\nstudy, we investigate the $\\Sigma_1 - M_{\\star}$ scaling relation and its\nevolution using the NIHAO suite of cosmological simulations and compare our\nfindings with recent results from the MaNGA survey. Our analysis shows that\nNIHAO galaxies successfully reproduce the observed scaling relation based on\nMANGA survey. Our analysis suggests that AGN feedback plays a critical role in\nflattening the $\\Sigma_1$ slope by expelling gas from galactic centers, leading\nto a decrease in both stellar and dark matter density as the gravitational\npotential becomes shallower. To further support our findings, we conducted\nhigh-resolution N-body simulations, which confirmed that\n  ({\\it sudden}) gas removal does substantially alter the stellar density in\nthe central region, consistent with results from NIHAO. Furthermore, our\nnumerical experiments show that even if the same amount of gas is re-accreted\non a typical ({\\it longer}) free-fall time, it is not able to restore the\noriginal stellar density. Our study concludes that AGN feedback assisted gas\nremoval presents a plausible explanation for the decline in central stellar\nsurface density as observed in massive elliptical galaxies.",

    "abstract": "With a small sample of fast X-ray transients (FXTs) with multi-wavelength\ncounterparts discovered to date, the progenitors of FXTs and their connections\nto gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and supernovae (SNe) remain ambiguous. Here, we\npresent photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2025kg, the supernova\ncounterpart to the FXT EP 250108a. At $z=0.17641$, this is the closest known SN\ndiscovered following an Einstein Probe (EP) FXT. We show that SN 2025kg's\noptical spectra reveal the hallmark features of a broad-lined Type Ic SN. Its\nlight curve evolution and expansion velocities are also comparable to those of\nGRB-SNe, including SN 1998bw, and several past FXT SNe. We present JWST/NIRSpec\nspectroscopy taken around SN 2025kg's maximum light, and find weak absorption\ndue to He I $\\lambda 1.0830, \\lambda 2.0581$ $\\mu$m and a broad, unidentified\nfeature at $\\sim$ 4-4.5 $\\mu$m. Further, we observe clear evidence for\nbroadened H$\\alpha$ in optical data at 42.5 days that is not detected at other\nepochs, indicating interaction with hydrogen-rich material. From its light\ncurve, we derive a $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.2 - 0.6 $M_{\\odot}$. Together with our\ncompanion paper (Eyles-Ferris et al. 2025), our broadband data of EP 250108a/SN\n2025kg are consistent with a trapped or low energy ($\\lesssim 10^{51}$ ergs)\njet-driven explosion from a collapsar with a zero-age main sequence mass of\n15-30 $M_{\\odot}$. Finally, we show that the sample of EP FXT SNe support past\nrate estimates that low-luminosity jets seen through FXTs are more common than\nsuccessful (GRB) jets, and that similar FXT-like signatures are likely present\nin at least a few percent of the brightest Ic-BL SNe.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there is interest in coincident 'sharpening' and 'learnability'\ntransitions in monitored quantum systems. In the latter, an outside observer's\nability to infer properties of a quantum system from measurements undergoes a\nphase transition. Such transitions appear to be related to the decodability\ntransition in quantum error correction, but the precise connection is not\nclear. Here, we study these problems under one framework we call the general\nquantum inference problem. In cases as above where the system has a Markov\nstructure, we say that the inference is on a quantum hidden Markov model. We\nshow a formal connection to classical hidden Markov models and that they\ncoincide for certain setups. For example, we prove this for those involving\nHaar-random unitaries and measurements. We introduce the notion of Bayes\nnon-optimality, where parameters used for inference differs from true ones.\nThis allows us to expand the phase diagrams of above models. At Bayes\noptimality, we obtain an explicit relation between 'sharpening' and\n'learnability' order parameters, explicitly showing that the two transitions\ncoincide. Next, we study concrete examples. We review quantum error correction\non the toric and repetition code and their mapping to 2D random-bond Ising\nmodel (RBIM) through our framework. We study the Haar-random U(1)-symmetric\nmonitored quantum circuit and tree, mapping each to inference models that we\ncall the planted SSEP and planted XOR, respectively, and expanding the phase\ndiagram to Bayes non-optimality. For the circuit, we deduce the phase boundary\nnumerically and analytically argue that it is of a single universality class.\nFor the tree, we present an exact solution of the entire phase boundary, which\ndisplays re-entrance as does the 2D RBIM. We discuss these phase diagrams, with\ntheir interpretations for quantum inference problems and rigorous arguments on\ntheir shapes.",

In this work,\nwe introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully\nplanar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present\nplanar code families with logical dimensions $6 \\leq k\\leq13$, e.g., $[[78, 6,\n6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$,\n$[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically\nlocal weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a\n$[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of\nmagnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary\nanyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding\nhigh-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware\narchitectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose\ndistance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC\ncodes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold\nfault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic\ntwo-dimensional hardware.",

We find that the source is well-modelled by a rapidly expanding\ncooling blackbody. We show the observed X-ray and radio properties are\nconsistent with a collapsar-powered jet that is low energy ($\\lesssim10^{51}$\nerg) and/or fails to break out of the dense material surrounding it. While we\nexamine the possibility that the optical emission emerges from the shock\nproduced as the supernova ejecta expand into a dense shell of circumstellar\nmaterial, due to our X-ray and radio inferences, we favour a model where it\narises from a shocked cocoon resulting from the trapped jet.

The ultra-high sensitivity of NV\nmagnetometers has enabled the detection and spectroscopy of individual electron\nspins, with potentially far-reaching applications in condensed matter physics,\nspintronics, and molecular biology. However, the surfaces of these diamond\nsensors naturally contain electron spins, which create a background signal that\ncan be hard to differentiate from the signal of the target spins. In this\nstudy, we develop a surface modification approach that eliminates the unwanted\nsignal of these so-called dark electron spins. Our surface passivation\ntechnique, based on coating diamond surfaces with a thin titanium oxide (TiO2)\nlayer, reduces the dark spin density. The observed reduction in dark spin\ndensity aligns with our findings on the electronic structure of the\ndiamond-TiO2 interface. The reduction, from a typical value of\n$2,000$~$\\mu$m$^{-2}$ to a value below that set by the detection limit of our\nNV sensors ($200$~$\\mu$m$^{-2}$), results in a two-fold increase in spin echo\ncoherence time of near surface NV centers. Furthermore, we derive a\ncomprehensive spin model that connects dark spin depolarization with NV\ncoherence, providing additional insights into the mechanisms behind the\nobserved spin dynamics.

DF may decelerate the moving stellar object and may\nalso, under certain conditions, produce an acceleration. In this paper, we\nstudy the DF and its effects in the interaction between a star and the ambient\ngaseous medium through a set of two-dimensional, hydrodynamical numerical\nsimulations using a wind tunnel configuration. Three different stellar wind\nconfigurations are considered: isotropic, polar, and equatorial. We confirm\nthat the DF can decelerate and accelerate the star and find the critical value\nof the normalized velocity ($u_c$) that marks the transition between these\nregimes, for the three wind profiles. The value of $u_c$ for the isotropic wind\ndiffers slightly from that obtained in the thin shell approximation; for an\naspherical wind, it may either be larger or smaller. Aspherical winds with\nsmall $u$ values produce larger accelerations than isotropic winds, while at\nhigh $u$ values, they lead to greater deceleration than the isotropic case. The\ntimescale for DF to substantially affect the velocity of a stellar object is\ncalculated. It is shown to be relevant in AGN discs and CEs.",

Their evolution is mainly driven by\nstrong wind mass loss, yet current evolution models make simplistic assumptions\non their atmospheric physics which are incompatible with the nature of VMS. In\nthis work, we aim to understand VMS atmospheres throughout their evolution by\nsupplementing structure models (computed with GENEC) with detailed atmosphere\nmodels (computed with PoWR) capable of capturing the physics of a\nradially-expanding medium in non-LTE. An important aspect is the computation of\natmosphere models reaching into deeper layers of the star, notably including\nthe iron-opacity peak as an important source of radiative driving. In this\nstudy, we compute atmosphere models at 16 snapshots along the main sequence of\na 150 $M_\\odot$ star. For each snapshot, we compute two atmosphere models\nconnected to the underlying structure model at different depths (below and\nabove the hot iron bump). We perform a detailed spectroscopic and structural\ncomparison of the two sequences of model atmospheres, and present a generalized\nmethod for the correction of the effective temperature in evolution models with\nstrong winds. The choice of connection point between structure and atmosphere\nmodels has a severe influence on the predicted spectral appearance, which\nconstitutes a previously unexplored source of uncertainty in quantitative\nspectroscopy. The simplified atmosphere treatment of current stellar structure\ncodes likely leads to an overestimation of the spatial extension of very\nmassive stars, caused by opacity-induced sub-surface inflation. This inflation\ndoes not occur in our deep atmosphere models, resulting in a discrepancy in\npredicted effective temperatures of up to 20 kK. Future improvements with\nturbulence and dynamically-consistent models may resolve these discrepancies.",

While\nscaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often\ndegrades downstream generation quality -- a challenge not adequately addressed\nin existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first\napproach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and\nrepresentation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing\ncomplexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs.\ngeneration dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which\naligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a\npre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space\ncomplexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both\nreconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic\nregularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using\n1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when\nexpanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize\ntraining for billion-scale tokenizers. By scaling to $\\bf{3 \\space billion}$\nparameters, GigaTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction,\ndownstream AR generation, and downstream AR representation quality.",

Motivated by this, we\nconsider a bilayer model in which the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee model on\none layer interact with topological spin textures on the second layer via a\nspin-spin interaction. Unlike the Kitaev model, the Yao-Lee model remains\nexactly solvable, allowing us to perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine\nits ground state. Our analysis indicates that skyrmion crystals can give rise\nto a variety of vison crystals that are periodic arrangements of the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes with unusual patterns such as a kagome pattern. In\naddition, Majorana fermions acquire a substantial Berry phase from skyrmion\ncrystals, resulting in phases with finite Chern numbers up to $\\nu =5$. In the\ncase of a single skyrmion defect in the magnetic layer, a corresponding defect\nin the vison configuration can be realized. These defects support localized\nstates when the spin liquid is gapped. Similar to skyrmion crystals, spiral\nspin textures also give rise to a diverse range of flux crystals. However, in\nthis case, most of these phases are gapless, with only a few being\ntrivially-gapped.

The former challenge is addressed by\nSurrogate-Based Optimization (SBO) algorithms, in particular Bayesian\nOptimization (BO) using Gaussian Process (GP) models. An overview is provided\nof how BO can deal with challenges specific to architecture optimization, such\nas design variable hierarchy and multiple objectives: specific measures include\nensemble infills and a hierarchical sampling algorithm. Evaluations might fail\ndue to non-convergence of underlying solvers or infeasible geometry in certain\nareas of the design space. Such failed evaluations, also known as hidden\nconstraints, pose a particular challenge to SBO/BO, as the surrogate model\ncannot be trained on empty results. This work investigates various strategies\nfor satisfying hidden constraints in BO algorithms. Three high-level strategies\nare identified: rejection of failed points from the training set, replacing\nfailed points based on viable (non-failed) points, and predicting the failure\nregion. Through investigations on a set of test problems including a jet engine\narchitecture optimization problem, it is shown that best performance is\nachieved with a mixed-discrete GP to predict the Probability of Viability\n(PoV), and by ensuring selected infill points satisfy some minimum PoV\nthreshold.

For validation\nof our results, we investigate additional observables in $^{48}$Ca as well as\nM1 transitions in $^{48}$Ti. For these, our results agree with experiment.\nFinally, our results show that for medium-mass nuclei 2BC contributions to M1\nand Gamow-Teller transitions are, as expected, very different. Therefore, using\nsimilar quenching factors for both in phenomenological calculations is not\nsupported from first principles.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in computer vision have highlighted the scalability of\nVision Transformers (ViTs) across various tasks, yet challenges remain in\nbalancing adaptability, computational efficiency, and the ability to model\nhigher-order relationships. Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer an\nalternative by leveraging graph-based methodologies but are hindered by the\ncomputational bottlenecks of clustering algorithms used for edge generation. To\naddress these issues, we propose the Hypergraph Vision Transformer (HgVT),\nwhich incorporates a hierarchical bipartite hypergraph structure into the\nvision transformer framework to capture higher-order semantic relationships\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency.

Resilient to stray magnetic fields and susceptible to electric\nmanipulation, toroidal moments have attracted interest for spintronic,\nmagnonic, and photonic applications.

    "abstract": "Context: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic extragalactic bursts whose\nproperties are still largely unknown, but based on their extremely small time\nduration, they are proposed to have a compact structure, making them candidates\nfor wave-optical effects if gravitational lensed. If an FRB is lensed into\nmultiple-images bursts at different times by a galaxy or cluster, a likely\nscenario is that only one image is detected, because the others fall outside\nthe survey area and time frame. Aims: In this work we explore the FRB analog of\nquasar microlensing, namely the collective microlensing by stars in the lensing\ngalaxy, now with wave optics included. The eikonal regime is applicable here.\nMethods. We study the voltage (rather than the intensity) in a simple\nsimulation consisting of (a) microlensing stars, and (b) plasma scattering by a\nturbulent interstellar medium. Results: The auto-correlation of the voltage\nshows peaks (at order-microsecond separations) corresponding to wave-optical\ninterference between lensed micro-images. The peaks are frequency dependent if\nplasma-scattering is significant. While qualitative and still in need of more\nrealistic simulations, the results suggest that a strongly-lensed FRB could be\nidentified from a single image. Conclusions: Microlensing could sniff out\nmacro-lensed FRBs",

While existing benchmarks focus on basic plan validity, they\nneglect critical aspects such as route efficiency, POI appeal, and real-time\nadaptability. This paper introduces TP-RAG, the first benchmark tailored for\nretrieval-augmented, spatiotemporal-aware travel planning. Our dataset includes\n2,348 real-world travel queries, 85,575 fine-grain annotated POIs, and 18,784\nhigh-quality travel trajectory references sourced from online tourist\ndocuments, enabling dynamic and context-aware planning. Through extensive\nexperiments, we reveal that integrating reference trajectories significantly\nimproves spatial efficiency and POI rationality of the travel plan, while\nchallenges persist in universality and robustness due to conflicting references\nand noisy data. To address these issues, we propose EvoRAG, an evolutionary\nframework that potently synergizes diverse retrieved trajectories with LLMs'\nintrinsic reasoning. EvoRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving\nspatiotemporal compliance and reducing commonsense violation compared to\nground-up and retrieval-augmented baselines.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been gradually employed to solve\ncomplex tasks. To face the challenge, task decomposition has become an\neffective way, which proposes to divide a complex task into multiple simpler\nsubtasks and then solve them separately so that the difficulty of the original\ntask can be reduced. However, the performance of existing task decomposition\nmethods can be suboptimal when the task contains overly complex logic and\nconstraints. In this situation, the solution generated by LLMs may deviate from\nthe original purpose of the task, or contain redundant or even erroneous\ncontent. Therefore, inspired by the fact that humans possess two thinking\nsystems including fast thinking and slow thinking, this paper introduces a new\ntask decomposition method termed ``Fast-Slow-Thinking'' (FST), which stimulates\nLLMs to solve tasks through the cooperation of Fast Thinking (FT) and Slow\nThinking (ST) steps. Here FT focuses more on the general and concise aspect of\nthe task, and ST focuses more on the details of the task. In FT, LLMs are\nprompted to remove the constraints of the original task, therefore simplifying\nit to a general and concise one. In ST, we recall the constraints removed in\nFT, so that LLMs can improve the answer generated in FT to meet the\nrequirements of the original task. Therefore, our FST method enables LLMs to\nconsider a complex problem via a human-like cognition process from coarse to\nfine, the effectiveness of which has been well demonstrated by the experiments\non three types of tasks.",

Recent advancements in multi-modal large language\nmodels (LLMs) now offer new possibilities for supporting interactive and\nexpressive voice-based reflection in writing. In particular, we propose that\nLLM-generated static feedback can be repurposed as conversation starters,\nallowing writers to seek clarification, request examples, and ask follow-up\nquestions, thereby fostering deeper reflection on their writing. We argue that\nvoice-based interaction can naturally facilitate this conversational exchange,\nencouraging writers' engagement with higher-order concerns, facilitating\niterative refinement of their reflections, and reduce cognitive load compared\nto text-based interactions. To investigate these effects, we propose a\nformative study exploring how text vs. voice input influence writers'\nreflection and subsequent revisions.

We mapped the\nresult of a 3D MHD stellar merger simulation between a 9 and an 8 solar-mass MS\nstar to 1D and evolved it through the MS. We compare the predicted pressure (p)\nand gravity (g) modes for the merger product model with those predicted for a\ncorresponding genuine single-star model. The p-mode frequencies are\nconsistently lower for the merger product than for the genuine single star, and\nthe differences between them are more than a thousand times larger than the\ncurrent best observational uncertainties for measured mode frequencies of this\nkind. Even though g-mode period spacing differences vary in value and sign\nthroughout the MS, they, too, are larger than the current best observational\nuncertainties for such long-period modes. This, combined with additional\nvariability in the merger product's period spacing patterns, shows the\npotential of identifying merger products in future-forward modelling. We also\nattempt to replicate the merger product's structure using three widely applied\n1D merger prescriptions and repeat the asteroseismic analysis. Although none of\nthe 1D prescriptions reproduces the entire merger product's structure, we\nconclude that the prescription with shock heating shows the highest potential,\nprovided that it can be calibrated on binary-evolution-driven 3D merger\nsimulations. Our work should be expanded to encompass the various possible\nmerger product structures predicted to exist in the Universe. (abridged)",

In this context, a large number of mixed continuous, integer and\ncategorical variables might arise during the optimization process and practical\napplications involve a large number of design variables. Recently, there has\nbeen a growing interest in mixed variables constrained Bayesian optimization\nbut most existing approaches severely increase the number of the\nhyperparameters related to the surrogate model. In this paper, we address this\nissue by constructing surrogate models using less hyperparameters. The\nreduction process is based on the partial least squares method.

The\nperformance of the proposed approach is confirmed on analytical tests as well\nas two real applications related to aircraft design.

Our analysis uses\ngauge ensembles generated by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC)\nwith $N_{f} = 2 + 1 + 1$ flavors of Wilson-clover twisted mass fermions. For\nthe first time, we go beyond the electroquenched approximation by including\nquark-disconnected contributions. Several key improvements have been\nimplemented: (i) the simulations are now performed directly at physical light-\nand strange-quark masses, (ii) finite-size effects are carefully investigated\nusing lattices with spatial extents ranging from $L \\simeq 3.8\\,\\mathrm{fm}$ to\n$L \\simeq 7.7\\,\\mathrm{fm}$, and (iii) the continuum extrapolation is based on\nthree lattice spacings in the range $a \\in [0.08, 0.058]\\,\\mathrm{fm}$. As a\nresult of the high-precision determination of the relevant correlation\nfunctions, we reduce the uncertainties on both the axial and vector form\nfactors by nearly a factor of two compared to our previous analysis. When\ncompared to experimental measurements in the electron channel ($K^- \\to e^-\n\\bar{\\nu}_e \\gamma$), our results show a tension -- at the level of $2.6$\nstandard deviations -- with respect to KLOE data. On the other hand, they are\ncompatible with measurements from the E36 Collaboration at J-PARC. In the\nmuonic decay channel ($K^- \\to \\mu^- \\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\gamma$), we confirm the\ntensions, already observed in our previous study, between lattice QCD\npredictions and ISTRA+ and OKA data, which are both primarily sensitive to the\nvalue of the negative-helicity form factor $F^{-}$.",

This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant\nsetting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens --\nto a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures\nthat something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses\nStrategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage\npermissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal\ninterference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically\ncontrol interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance\nformal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to\ntrigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized\npolicy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to\nchanging specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for\ncyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to\ndemonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally\nupdated) $\\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic\npolicies.",

To further refine anatomical accuracy, X2BR\nintegrates a patient-specific template mesh, constructed using YOLOv9-based\ndetection and the SKEL biomechanical skeleton model.

The\nuniversal nature of the charged moments of these states has already been noted\npreviously. Here, we investigate this problem further, by writing general\nformulae for the entropies of excited states consisting of an arbitrary number\nof subsets of identical excitations. When the initial state is written in terms\nof qubits with appropriate probabilistic coefficients, we find the final\nformulae to be of a combinatorial nature too. We analyse some of their features\nnumerically and analytically and find that for qubit states consisting of\nparticles of the same charge, the symmetry resolved entropies are independent\nof region size relative to system size, even if the number and configuration\nentropies are not.",

The parameter in question is\nthe nesting width, a measure of the extent to which a graph can be represented\nas a nested collection of graphs. We present a novel directed graph\ndecomposition called the acyclic-connected tree (A-C tree), which breaks the\ngraph into a recursively nested sequence of strongly connected components in\ntopological order. We prove that the A-C tree is optimal in the sense that its\nwidth, the size of the largest nested graph, is equal to the nesting width of\nthe graph. We then provide a linear-time algorithm for constructing the A-C\ntree of any graph. Finally, we show how the A-C tree allows us to construct a\nsimple variant of Dijkstra's algorithm which achieves a time complexity of\n$O(e+n\\log w)$, where $n$ ($e$) is the number of nodes (arcs) in the graph and\n$w$ is the nesting width. The idea is to apply the shortest path algorithm\nseparately to each component in the order dictated by the A-C tree. We obtain\nan asymptotic improvement over Dijkstra's algorithm: when $w=n$, our algorithm\nreduces to Dijkstra's algorithm, but it is faster when $w \\in o(n)$, and\nlinear-time for classes of graphs with bounded width, such as directed acyclic\ngraphs.",

This\npaper presents a low-complexity formalism for incorporating inequality\nconstraints into the cost function of QAOA using an oracle-based subroutine\nthat evaluates constraint satisfaction in an additional register, subsequently\ncalled Indicator Function QAOA (IF-QAOA). The IF-QAOA cost function consists of\na step-function but does not require a penalty term with additional parameters.\nApplied to the Knapsack problem, we demonstrate the superior performance of\nIF-QAOA over conventional penalty-based approaches in simulated experiments.\nUsing advanced QAOA simulation techniques with instances consisting of up to 22\nitems, we find that IF-QAOA achieves significantly higher solution quality and\na faster time-to-solution in 82% of our benchmark cases. Analysis of the\nscaling behavior shows favorable scaling of IF-QAOA compared to penalty-based\nmethods. Also, benchmarked against the recently developed Quantum Tree\nGenerator QAOA for Knapsack Problems, we demonstrate higher solution quality\nfor circuits of similar complexity.

    "abstract": "The twin star configuration, where two neutron stars share the same mass but\nexhibit different radii, arises from a strong first-order phase transition\nwithin the stellar interior. In widely used equation of state (EoS)\nmeta-models, such as the Polytrope (PP) and Speed-of-Sound (CS) models, this\nfirst-order phase transition behavior can be naturally mimicked by tuning some\nmodel parameters. Here, we systematically explore the under-explored parameter\nspace within one of a widely adopted CS model that leads to twin stars via a\nstrong first-order phase transition. Within this twin-star subspace, we perform\na comprehensive Bayesian analysis that integrates mass--radius (MR) constraints\nfrom X-ray observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. The resultant\ntwin star branch, situated within the 1--1.2 $M_{\\odot}$ mass range and\napproximately 7 km in radius, surprisingly coincides with the MR ranges\nproposed for the recent anomaly in the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars XTE\nJ1814--338 (J1814), suggesting a hybrid twin star configuration. Moreover,\nincorporating the J1814 observation as an additional constraint yields an\nextreme phase transition pressure $P_{\\text{trans}} = 108.9_{-4.85}^{+6.46}$\nMeV/fm$^3$, a transition density of $\\varepsilon_{\\text{trans}}/\\varepsilon_0 =\n4.847_{-0.134}^{+0.271}$(where $\\varepsilon_0$ is the nuclear saturation energy\ndensity) and an energy density jump $\\Delta \\varepsilon =\n558.7_{-278.7}^{+303.6}$ MeV/fm$^3$, corresponding to $\\Delta\n\\varepsilon/\\varepsilon_0 = 3.716_{-1.854}^{+2.020}$. Notably, to satisfy all\nastrophysical constraints, the speed of sound inside of the hybrid twin star\ncore is driven toward the speed of light ($c_s^2/c^2 > 0.9$), indicating the\npotential presence of strongly interacting, exotic matter in this core region.",

However, existing methods focus solely on\npredicting positions without considering articulation, and only when the hands\nare visible in the field of view. This limitation overlooks the fact that\napproximate hand positions can still be inferred even when they are outside the\ncamera's view. In this paper, we propose a method to forecast the 3D\ntrajectories and poses of both hands from an egocentric video, both in and out\nof the field of view. We propose a diffusion-based transformer architecture for\nEgocentric Hand Forecasting, EgoH4, which takes as input the observation\nsequence and camera poses, then predicts future 3D motion and poses for both\nhands of the camera wearer. We leverage full-body pose information, allowing\nother joints to provide constraints on hand motion. We denoise the hand and\nbody joints along with a visibility predictor for hand joints and a 3D-to-2D\nreprojection loss that minimizes the error when hands are in-view. We evaluate\nEgoH4 on the Ego-Exo4D dataset, combining subsets with body and hand\nannotations. We train on 156K sequences and evaluate on 34K sequences,\nrespectively. EgoH4 improves the performance by 3.4cm and 5.1cm over the\nbaseline in terms of ADE for hand trajectory forecasting and MPJPE for hand\npose forecasting.

Drawing search can be simplified by\nleveraging the information stored in the title block portion of the drawing,\nwhich can be seen as drawing metadata.

The pipeline is obtained by combining a\nlightweight Convolutional Neural Network and GPT-4o, the proposed inference\npipeline detects building engineering title blocks with high accuracy, and then\nextract structured drawing metadata from the title blocks, which can be used\nfor drawing search, filtering and grouping.

We observe\nthat, in case of full trust by users, incentives are effective to promote\neffective regulation; however, conditional trust may deteriorate the \"social\npact\". Establishing a virtuous feedback between users' trust and regulators'\nreputation thus appears to be key to nudge developers towards creating safe AI.\nHowever, the level at which this trust emerges may depend on the specific LLM\nused for testing. Our results thus provide guidance for AI regulation systems,\nand help predict the outcome of strategic LLM agents, should they be used to\naid regulation itself.",

    "abstract": "Apartness of states in transition systems has seen growing interest recently\nas an inductive counterpart to many well-established bisimilarity notions. The\nconstructive nature of apartness allows the definition of derivation systems\nfor reasoning about apartness of states. It further corresponds closely to\ndistinguishing formulas in suitable modal logics. Both the derivations and\ndistinguishing formulas provide (finite) evidence for differences in the\nbehaviour of states. The current paper provides a derivation system in the\nsetting of behavioural distances on labelled Markov chains. Rather than showing\npairs of states apart, the system allows the derivation of lower bounds on\ntheir distance, complementing existing work giving upper bounds. We further\nshow the soundness and (approximate) completeness of the system with respect to\nthe behavioural distance. We go on to give a constructive correspondence\nbetween our derivation system and formulas in a modal logic with quantitative\nsemantics. This logic was used in recent work of Rady and van Breugel to\nconstruct evidence for lower bounds on behavioural distances. Our constructions\nwill provide smaller witnessing formulas in many examples.",

This study investigates\nthe role of parenthood in shaping gender disparities in academic careers,\nfocusing on the complex interplay between gender, childcare responsibilities,\ngender role beliefs, institutional support, and scientists' career\nachievements. Using a large-scale survey of 5,670 U.S. and Canadian academics,\nsupplemented with bibliometric data from Web of Science, it reveals that\nchildcare responsibilities significantly mediate gender disparities in both\nsubjective and objective academic achievements, with women assuming a\ndisproportionate share of childcare duties. In particular, women shoulder a\ngreater caregiving load when their partners are employed full-time outside\nacademia. However, egalitarian gender role beliefs have been playing an\nimportant role in shifting this structure by transforming women academics'\nbehaviors. As women's egalitarian gender role beliefs strengthen, their\nchildcare responsibilities tend to diminish-an effect not mirrored in men.\nInstitutional parental support policies show mixed effects. While flexible work\nschedules and childcare support can mitigate the negative association between\nchildcare responsibilities and career outcomes of women academics, policies\nsuch as tenure clock extensions and paternity leave may inadvertently intensify\nit.

Unlike conventional\ndiffusion autoencoders operating in image space, LDAE applies the diffusion\nprocess in a compressed latent representation, improving computational\nefficiency and making 3D medical imaging representation learning tractable. To\nvalidate the proposed approach, we explore two key hypotheses: (i) LDAE\neffectively captures meaningful semantic representations on 3D brain MR\nassociated with AD and ageing, and (ii) LDAE achieves high-quality image\ngeneration and reconstruction while being computationally efficient.\nExperimental results support both hypotheses: (i) linear-probe evaluations\ndemonstrate promising diagnostic performance for AD (ROC-AUC: 90%, ACC: 84%)\nand age prediction (MAE: 4.1 years, RMSE: 5.2 years); (ii) the learned semantic\nrepresentations enable attribute manipulation, yielding anatomically plausible\nmodifications; (iii) semantic interpolation experiments show strong\nreconstruction of missing scans, with SSIM of 0.969 (MSE: 0.0019) for a 6-month\ngap. Even for longer gaps (24 months), the model maintains robust performance\n(SSIM > 0.93, MSE < 0.004), indicating an ability to capture temporal\nprogression trends; (iv) compared to conventional diffusion autoencoders, LDAE\nsignificantly increases inference throughput (20x faster) while also enhancing\nreconstruction quality.

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges in machine learning is maintaining the accuracy\nof the deployed model (e.g., a classifier) in a non-stationary environment. The\nnon-stationary environment results in distribution shifts and, consequently, a\ndegradation in accuracy. Continuous learning of the deployed model with new\ndata could be one remedy. However, the question arises as to how we should\nupdate the model with new training data so that it retains its accuracy on the\nold data while adapting to the new data. In this work, we propose a\ntask-conditioned ensemble of models to maintain the performance of the existing\nmodel. The method involves an ensemble of expert models based on task\nmembership information. The in-domain models-based on the local outlier concept\n(different from the expert models) provide task membership information\ndynamically at run-time to each probe sample. To evaluate the proposed method,\nwe experiment with three setups: the first represents distribution shift\nbetween tasks (LivDet-Iris-2017), the second represents distribution shift both\nbetween and within tasks (LivDet-Iris-2020), and the third represents disjoint\ndistribution between tasks (Split MNIST). The experiments highlight the\nbenefits of the proposed method. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/iPRoBe-lab/Continuous_Learning_FE_DM.",

    "abstract": "The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in engineering and scientific\ncomputing, but its pre-processing, solver configuration, and post-processing\nstages are often time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. This paper\nproposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics\nsimulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language\nmodels (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand\nuser-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task\ndecomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to\nautomatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model\nhallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing\nannotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted\nexperimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer,\nmechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that\nMooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent,\nespecially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively\nsimple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the\nproposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its\npotential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the\nuser barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite\nelement simulation software.

CryptoChaos\nharnesses the intrinsic unpredictability of four discrete chaotic maps\n(Logistic, Chebyshev, Tent, and Henon) to generate a high-entropy,\nmultidimensional key from a unified entropy pool. This key is derived through a\nlayered process that combines SHA3-256 hashing with an ephemeral X25519\nDiffie-Hellman key exchange and is refined using an HMAC-based key derivation\nfunction (HKDF). The resulting encryption key powers AES-GCM, providing both\nconfidentiality and integrity. Comprehensive benchmarking against established\nsymmetric ciphers confirms that CryptoChaos attains near-maximal Shannon\nentropy (approximately 8 bits per byte) and exhibits negligible adjacent-byte\ncorrelations, while robust performance on the NIST SP 800-22 test suite\nunderscores its statistical rigor. Moreover, quantum simulations demonstrate\nthat the additional complexity inherent in chaotic key generation dramatically\nelevates the resource requirements for Grover-based quantum attacks, with an\nestimated T gate count of approximately 2.1 x 10^9. The modular and\ninteroperable design of CryptoChaos positions it as a promising candidate for\nhigh-assurance applications, ranging from secure communications and financial\ntransactions to IoT systems, paving the way for next-generation post-quantum\nencryption standards.",

However, most studies on these systems focus on planar motion\nplanning without addressing rapid vertical motion. Despite their success on\nmild rugged terrains, recent field tests reveal a critical need for 3D\nbehaviors (e.g., climbing or traversing tall obstacles). The challenges of 3D\nmotion planning partially lie in designing sensing and control for a complex\nhigh-degree-of-freedom system, typically with over 25 degrees of freedom. To\naddress the first challenge regarding sensing, we propose a tactile antenna\nsystem that enables the robot to probe obstacles to gather information about\ntheir structure. Building on this sensory input, we develop a control framework\nthat integrates data from the antenna and foot contact sensors to dynamically\nadjust the robot's vertical body undulation for effective climbing. With the\naddition of simple, low-bandwidth tactile sensors, a robot with high static\nstability and redundancy exhibits predictable climbing performance in complex\nenvironments using a simple feedback controller. Laboratory and outdoor\nexperiments demonstrate the robot's ability to climb obstacles up to five times\nits height. Moreover, the robot exhibits robust climbing capabilities on\nobstacles covered with shifting, robot-sized random items and those\ncharacterized by rapidly changing curvatures.

This\nand the large volume of hateful online content prompted both practitioners',\ni.e., in content moderation or law enforcement, and researchers' interest in\nmachine learning models to automatically classify instances of hate speech.\nWhereas most scientific works address hate speech classification as a binary\ntask, practice often requires a differentiation into sub-types, e.g., according\nto target, severity, or legality, which may overlap for individual content.\nHence, researchers created datasets and machine learning models that approach\nhate speech classification in textual data as a multi-label problem. This work\npresents the first systematic and comprehensive survey of scientific literature\non this emerging research landscape in English (N=46). We contribute with a\nconcise overview of 28 datasets suited for training multi-label classification\nmodels that reveals significant heterogeneity regarding label-set, size,\nmeta-concept, annotation process, and inter-annotator agreement. Our analysis\nof 24 publications proposing suitable classification models further establishes\ninconsistency in evaluation and a preference for architectures based on\nBidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) and Recurrent\nNeural Networks (RNNs).

Our approach measures the two-point spectral correlation function\nof the pulse by interfering its different frequency components using a quantum\npulse gate (QPG) driven by a reference pump pulse. We demonstrate its\ncompatibility with quantum light by characterizing partially coherent pulses\ngenerated by a type-0 parametric down-conversion process. We also overcome this\nrequirement of a known pump pulse by introducing spectral shear into our\ninterferometric scheme using a multi-output QPG (mQPG). This enables\nsimultaneous characterization of a single-photon-level input pulse alongside an\nunknown pump pulse.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning can seamlessly transfer agile locomotion and\nnavigation skills from the simulator to real world. However, bridging the\nsim-to-real gap with domain randomization or adversarial methods often demands\nexpert physics knowledge to ensure policy robustness. Even so, cutting-edge\nsimulators may fall short of capturing every real-world detail, and the\nreconstructed environment may introduce errors due to various perception\nuncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose Neural Fidelity\nCalibration (NFC), a novel framework that employs conditional score-based\ndiffusion models to calibrate simulator physical coefficients and residual\nfidelity domains online during robot execution. Specifically, the residual\nfidelity reflects the simulation model shift relative to the real-world\ndynamics and captures the uncertainty of the perceived environment, enabling us\nto sample realistic environments under the inferred distribution for policy\nfine-tuning. Our framework is informative and adaptive in three key ways: (a)\nwe fine-tune the pretrained policy only under anomalous scenarios, (b) we build\nsequential NFC online with the pretrained NFC's proposal prior, reducing the\ndiffusion model's training burden, and (c) when NFC uncertainty is high and may\ndegrade policy improvement, we leverage optimistic exploration to enable\nhallucinated policy optimization. Our framework achieves superior simulator\ncalibration precision compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse\nrobots with high-dimensional parametric spaces. We study the critical\ncontribution of residual fidelity to policy improvement in simulation and\nreal-world experiments.

We represent the environment\nas a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate\nmap representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM\nsystem corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation\nbetween submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from\nefficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into\nobject-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary\nqueries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The\nopen-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art\nsemantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset.

This proved useful\nto uncover biases between different target (foreground or concept) classes.\nHowever, given that the background is mostly uncontrolled during training, an\nimportant question has been left unattended so far: Are/to what extent are\nstate-of-the-art, data-driven post-hoc C-XAI approaches themselves prone to\nbiases with respect to their backgrounds?

A\ndangerous performance degradation of the concept-corner cases of animals on the\nroad could thus remain undiscovered.

MedHal addresses these gaps by: (1) incorporating diverse medical\ntext sources and tasks; (2) providing a substantial volume of annotated samples\nsuitable for training medical hallucination detection models; and (3) including\nexplanations for factual inconsistencies to guide model learning. We\ndemonstrate MedHal's utility by training and evaluating a baseline medical\nhallucination detection model, showing improvements over general-purpose\nhallucination detection approaches. This resource enables more efficient\nevaluation of medical text generation systems while reducing reliance on costly\nexpert review, potentially accelerating the development of medical AI research.",

    "abstract": "An oscillating scalar field can behave like cold dark matter in the expanding\nUniverse. In relativistic cosmology, this perspective is primarily reasoned by\nan evolution of a background scalar field and its subhorizon perturbations in a\nmatter-dominated era. A corresponding relativistic description is usually based\non the ansatz that the perturbations oscillate in the same way as the\nbackground field and on time averaging to find the oscillation amplitudes. In\ncontrast, the presented approach makes no initial assumptions about the\nperturbation behavior and does not use time averages. It is shown that although\nthe previous treatments are valid only well inside the Hubble scale, the scalar\nfield reproduces the CDM scenarios on the superhorizon scale and also\nthroughout the evolution of the Universe from the beginning of the\noscillations. The misunderstanding about the Jeans length scale in the\nmatter-dominated epoch is also clarified. An analog of the Jeans effect is\nfound in a radiation-dominated era. It can prevent an overproduction of small\nhalos for the scalars with $m\\sim 10^{-13}$~eV.",

We propose a decentralised deployment strategy that\ncombines auction-based task allocation with online learning. Each UAV\nindependently decides whether to bid for orders based on its energy storage\ncharge level, the parcel mass, and delivery distance.

Simulations using\nrealistic UAV energy models reveal that, counter-intuitively, assigning orders\nto the least confident bidders reduces delivery times and increases the number\nof successfully fulfilled orders. This strategy is shown to outperform\nthreshold-based methods which require UAVs to exceed specific charge levels at\ndeployment. We propose a variant of the strategy which uses learned policies\nfor forecasting. This enables UAVs with insufficient charge levels to commit to\nfulfilling orders at specific future times, helping to prioritise early orders.\nOur work provides new insights into long-term deployment of UAV swarms,\nhighlighting the advantages of decentralised energy-aware decision-making\ncoupled with online learning in real-world dynamic environments.",

In addition, the lattice dynamics of the crystals have been analyzed\nby revisiting the Raman spectroscopy.

    "abstract": "The semantically interactive radiance field has long been a promising\nbackbone for 3D real-world applications, such as embodied AI to achieve scene\nunderstanding and manipulation. However, multi-granularity interaction remains\na challenging task due to the ambiguity of language and degraded quality when\nit comes to queries upon object components. In this work, we present FMLGS, an\napproach that supports part-level open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS). We propose an efficient pipeline for building and querying\nconsistent object- and part-level semantics based on Segment Anything Model 2\n(SAM2). We designed a semantic deviation strategy to solve the problem of\nlanguage ambiguity among object parts, which interpolates the semantic features\nof fine-grained targets for enriched information. Once trained, we can query\nboth objects and their describable parts using natural language. Comparisons\nwith other state-of-the-art methods prove that our method can not only better\nlocate specified part-level targets, but also achieve first-place performance\nconcerning both speed and accuracy, where FMLGS is 98 x faster than LERF, 4 x\nfaster than LangSplat and 2.5 x faster than LEGaussians. Meanwhile, we further\nintegrate FMLGS as a virtual agent that can interactively navigate through 3D\nscenes, locate targets, and respond to user demands through a chat interface,\nwhich demonstrates the potential of our work to be further expanded and applied\nin the future.",

While deep learning methods have been\nproposed to address this task, most rely on a single modality, typically video.\nHowever, including additional modalities may improve the robustness of the\napproaches to common issues in egocentric videos, such as blurriness and\nocclusions. Recent efforts in multimodal egocentric action recognition often\nassume the availability of all modalities, leading to failures or performance\ndrops when any modality is missing. To address this, we introduce an efficient\nmultimodal knowledge distillation approach for egocentric action recognition\nthat is robust to missing modalities (KARMMA) while still benefiting when\nmultiple modalities are available. Our method focuses on resource-efficient\ndevelopment by leveraging pre-trained models as unimodal feature extractors in\nour teacher model, which distills knowledge into a much smaller and faster\nstudent model. Experiments on the Epic-Kitchens and Something-Something\ndatasets demonstrate that our student model effectively handles missing\nmodalities while reducing its accuracy drop in this scenario.",

This condensation results\nfrom an elasto-active feedback between the deformations of the structure and\nthe orientations of forces exerted by the active units. An external field that\npolarizes these forces is thus likely to strongly affect the transition to\ncollective actuation. Here, we study the dynamics of elastically coupled polar\nactive units in the presence of such a field, through a combination of model\nexperiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis. Experimentally,\nwe observe that tilting the plane of the experiment polarizes the orientation\nof the active units and thereby the forces they exert on the elastic structure.\nTaking advantage of this gravity-induced polarization, we uncover a novel\noscillatory regime, distinct from the different oscillating regimes observed in\nthe zero-field limit. The theoretical analysis of the dynamics for a single\nagent demonstrates that the two oscillating dynamics in the presence of a field\nmap onto the bounded and unbounded phase dynamics of a weighing pendulum. In\nthe many agents case, we observe experimentally and numerically, and\ndemonstrate theoretically, that the polarizing field may facilitate the\ntransition to collective actuation, leading to a reentrant transition.",

However, the\nphase transitions from the UUD phase to the two supersolid phases exhibit\ndramatically different behaviors upon cooling. Prior to entering the Y phase,\n$1/T_1$ identifies a gapless regime within the UUD phase, suggesting a\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase above a second-order phase transition. In\ncontrast, the coexistence of the UUD and V phases observed in our experiments\nprovides direct evidence of a first-order phase transition between these\nphases.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and massive multi-input\nmulti-output (MIMO) are promising technologies for next generation wireless\ncommunication systems for their abilities to counteract the issue of high\nmobility with large Doppler spread and mitigate the channel path attenuation,\nrespectively. The natural integration of massive MIMO with OTFS in\nmillimeter-wave systems can improve communication data rate and enhance the\nspectral efficiency. However, when transmitting wideband signals with\nlarge-scale arrays, the beam squint effect may occur, causing discrepancies in\nbeam directions across subcarriers in multi-carrier systems. Moreover, the\nhigh-mobility wideband millimeter wave communications\n  can induce the Doppler squint effect, leading to different Doppler shifts\namong the subcarriers. Both beam squint effect and Doppler squint effect\n(denoted as doubly squint effect) can degrade communication performance\nsignificantly. In this paper, we present an efficient channel estimation and\nhybrid precoding scheme to address the doubly squint effect in massive\nMIMO-OTFS systems. We first characterize the wideband channel model and the\ninput-output relationship for massive MIMO-OTFS transmission considering doubly\nsquint effect. We then mathematically derive the impact of channel parameters\non chirp pilots under the doubly squint effect. Additionally, we develop a\npeak-index-based channel estimation scheme. By leveraging the results from\nchannel estimation, we propose a hybrid precoding method to mitigate the doubly\nsquint effect in downlink transmission scenarios. Finally, simulation results\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and show its superiority over\nthe existing schemes.",

We further demonstrate a\nlocking effect between the chirality of the (anti)merons and the parity of the\nirreps.

Focusing on translation-invariant non-interacting fermionic\nmodels with U(1) symmetry, we present a theoretical framework to understand the\nstructure of the steady-state of these models and their entanglement content\nbased on two ingredients: the nature of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian and the constraints imposed on the steady-state single-particle\noccupation by the conserved quantities. These emerge from an interplay between\nHamiltonian symmetries and initial state, due to the non-linearity of\nmeasurement back-action. For models with complex energy spectrum, we show that\nthe steady state is obtained by filling single-particle right eigenstates with\nthe largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue. As a result, one can have\npartially filled or fully filled bands in the steady-state, leading to an\nentanglement entropy undergoing a filling-driven transition between critical\nsub volume scaling and area-law, similar to ground-state problems. Conversely,\nwhen the spectrum is fully real, we provide evidence that local observables can\nbe captured using a diagonal ensemble, and the entanglement entropy exhibits a\nvolume-law scaling independently on the initial state, akin to unitary\ndynamics. We illustrate these principles in the Hatano-Nelson model with\nperiodic boundary conditions and the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model,\nuncovering a rich interplay between the single-particle spectrum and\nconservation laws in determining the steady-state structure and the\nentanglement transitions.

By applying out-of-plane electric field,\nthe confined excitons exhibit energy shifts exceeding 100~meV and changes in\nthe fine-structure splitting by up to a factor of two.

Developers often use a sequential approach to optimize\ndesign variables and market participation for grid-integrated offshore wind\nfarms.

This paper proposes a control co-design approach, optimizing\ndesign and control decisions for integrating OWFs into the power grid while\nconsidering energy market and primary frequency market participation.\nAdditionally, we introduce optimal sizing solutions for energy storage systems\ndeployed onshore to enhance revenue for OWF developers over time.

By extending spontaneous\nscalarization to vector fields, we demonstrate how the effective mass of the\nvector field drives tachyonic instability, leading to a transition from the\nAdS-RN phase to a vectorized phase. Thermodynamic analysis reveals the critical\ntemperature $ T_c $ and coupling $ \\alpha_c $ for this transition, with the\nvectorized phase exhibiting lower free energy. A central discovery is the\nemergence of a ``screened volume law'' in the holographic entanglement entropy\n(HEE), a novel phenomenon where the entanglement entropy scales with the\nsubregion size via a screened entropy density distinct from thermal entropy.\nThis arises from a geometric constraint tied to the vanishing of the\nChristoffel symbol $ \\Gamma^z{}_{xx} $, which defines an effective boundary\noutside the horizons. Unlike conventional ``entanglement shadows'' in black\nhole systems, this surface acts as a boundary for minimal surfaces in a\ntranslationally invariant geometry. This screening effect suggests the\ninability of entanglement measure to fully probe the Hilbert space of this\nthermal system. Additionally, the HEE in the vectorized phase displays\nnon-monotonic temperature dependence.

    "abstract": "Accurate lane detection is essential for automated driving, enabling safe and\nreliable vehicle navigation in a variety of road scenarios. Numerous datasets\nhave been introduced to support the development and evaluation of lane\ndetection algorithms, each differing in terms of the amount of data, sensor\ntypes, annotation granularity, environmental conditions, and scenario\ndiversity. This paper provides a comprehensive review of over 30 publicly\navailable lane detection datasets, systematically analysing their\ncharacteristics, advantages and limitations. We classify these datasets based\non key factors such as sensor resolution, annotation types and diversity of\nroad and weather conditions. By identifying existing challenges and research\ngaps, we highlight opportunities for future dataset improvements that can\nfurther drive innovation in robust lane detection. This survey serves as a\nresource for researchers seeking appropriate datasets for lane detection, and\ncontributes to the broader goal of advancing autonomous driving.",

    "abstract": "Automated scoring (AS) systems are increasingly used for evaluating L2\nwriting, but require ongoing refinement for construct validity. While prior\nwork suggested lexical bundles (LBs) - recurrent multi-word sequences\nsatisfying certain frequency criteria - could inform assessment, their\nempirical integration into AS models needs further investigation. This study\ntested the impact of incorporating LB frequency features into an AS model for\nTOEFL independent writing tasks. Analyzing a sampled subcorpus (N=1,225 essays,\n9 L1s) from the TOEFL11 corpus, scored by ETS-trained raters (Low, Medium,\nHigh), 3- to 9-word LBs were extracted, distinguishing prompt-specific from\nnon-prompt types. A baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) scoring model using\nestablished linguistic features (e.g., mechanics, cohesion, sophistication) was\ncompared against an extended model including three aggregate LB frequency\nfeatures (total prompt, total non-prompt, overall total). Results revealed\nsignificant, though generally small-effect, relationships between LB frequency\n(especially non-prompt bundles) and proficiency (p < .05). Mean frequencies\nsuggested lower proficiency essays used more LBs overall. Critically, the\nLB-enhanced model improved agreement with human raters (Quadratic Cohen's Kappa\n+2.05%, overall Cohen's Kappa +5.63%), with notable gains for low (+10.1% exact\nagreement) and medium (+14.3% Cohen's Kappa) proficiency essays.

One key difficulty is that existing encoders struggle to\nefficiently fuse low-level features. Additionally, the query selection\nstrategies are not effectively tailored for small objects. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes an efficient model, Small Object Detection\nTransformer (SO-DETR). The model comprises three key components: a dual-domain\nhybrid encoder, an enhanced query selection mechanism, and a knowledge\ndistillation strategy. The dual-domain hybrid encoder integrates spatial and\nfrequency domains to fuse multi-scale features effectively. This approach\nenhances the representation of high-resolution features while maintaining\nrelatively low computational overhead. The enhanced query selection mechanism\noptimizes query initialization by dynamically selecting high-scoring anchor\nboxes using expanded IoU, thereby improving the allocation of query resources.\nFurthermore, by incorporating a lightweight backbone network and implementing a\nknowledge distillation strategy, we develop an efficient detector for small\nobjects. Experimental results on the VisDrone-2019-DET and UAVVaste datasets\ndemonstrate that SO-DETR outperforms existing methods with similar\ncomputational demands.

However, optimizing learning at the network edge entails\nunique challenges, particularly when moving beyond conventional settings and\nobjectives. While Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for\ndistributed model training, critical challenges persist. First, existing\napproaches often overlook the trade-off between predictive accuracy and\ninterpretability. Second, they struggle to integrate inherently explainable\nmodels such as decision trees because their non-differentiable structure makes\nthem not amenable to backpropagation-based training algorithms. Lastly, they\nlack meaningful mechanisms for continual Machine Learning (ML) model adaptation\nthrough Continual Learning (CL) in resource-limited environments. In this\npaper, we pave the way for a set of novel optimization problems that emerge in\ndistributed learning at the network edge with wirelessly interconnected edge\ndevices, and we identify key challenges and future directions. Specifically, we\ndiscuss how Multi-objective optimization (MOO) can be used to address the\ntrade-off between predictive accuracy and explainability when using complex\npredictive models. Next, we discuss the implications of integrating inherently\nexplainable tree-based models into distributed learning settings.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents for\nmulti-step tasks. However, most existing frameworks fail to maintain a\nstructured understanding of the task state, often relying on linear prompt\nconcatenation or shallow memory buffers. This leads to brittle performance,\nfrequent hallucinations, and poor long-range coherence. In this work, we\npropose the Task Memory Engine (TME), a lightweight and structured memory\nmodule that tracks task execution using a hierarchical Task Memory Tree (TMT).\nEach node in the tree corresponds to a task step, storing relevant input,\noutput, status, and sub-task relationships. We introduce a prompt synthesis\nmethod that dynamically generates LLM prompts based on the active node path,\nsignificantly improving execution consistency and contextual grounding. Through\ncase studies and comparative experiments on multi-step agent tasks, we\ndemonstrate that TME leads to better task completion accuracy and more\ninterpretable behavior with minimal implementation overhead. A reference\nimplementation of the core TME components is available at\nhttps://github.com/biubiutomato/TME-Agent, including basic examples and\nstructured memory integration. While the current implementation uses a\ntree-based structure, TME is designed to be graph-aware, supporting reusable\nsubsteps, converging task paths, and shared dependencies. This lays the\ngroundwork for future DAG-based memory architectures.",

To address this, we\nintroduce a Universal Semantic Matching (USM) residual block to a content\nextractor. The residual block consists of two weighted branches: 1) universal\nsemantic dictionary based Content Feature Re-expression (CFR) module, supplying\ntimbre-free content representation. 2) skip connection to the original content\nlayer, providing complementary fine-grained information. In the CFR module,\neach dictionary entry in the universal semantic dictionary represents a phoneme\nclass, computed statistically using speech from multiple speakers, creating a\nstable, speaker-independent semantic set. We introduce a CFR method to obtain\ntimbre-free content representations by expressing each content frame as a\nweighted linear combination of dictionary entries using corresponding phoneme\nposteriors as weights.

In this\nstudy, we present a new geometrical interpretation of the sign factors by\ninvestigating the domain of the delta functions on the real twistor space. In\naddition, we propose a new definition of delta functions on the complex twistor\nspace in terms of the Cech cohomology group without any sign factors and show\nthat these delta functions have conformal invariance.

It is known that the\nrecurrence coefficients $\\beta_n$ satisfy a fourth-order nonlinear discrete\nequation, which is a special case of the second member of the discrete\nPainlev\\'{e} I hierarchy, often known as the ''string equation''. The\nrecurrence coefficients have been studied in the context of Hermitian\none-matrix models and random symmetric matrix ensembles with researchers in the\n1990s observing ''chaotic, pseudo-oscillatory'' behaviour. More recently, this\n''chaotic phase'' was described as a dispersive shockwave in a hydrodynamic\nchain. Our emphasis is a comprehensive study of the behaviour of the recurrence\ncoefficients as the parameters $\\tau$ and $t$ vary. Extensive computational\nanalysis is carried out, using Maple, for critical parameter ranges, and\ngraphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence\ncoefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice\nhierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to\nsatisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The\nmoments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral\nrepresentations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form\nexpressions for moments are obtained in several special cases in terms of\ngeneralised hypergeometric functions and modified Bessel functions. The results\nhighlight the rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the Freud\nweight and its connections to integrable systems.",

Defects in\nuniaxial, biaxial nematics and cholesterics are represented by elements\nbelonging to different Clifford algebras, suggesting that there are fundamental\ndistinctions between topological defects in each of these phases. Our theory\nallows nematic defects to be interpreted as Majorana-like spinors, as defects\nand antidefects are topologically equivalent, whilst some cholesteric defects,\nsuch as screw dislocations, are better viewed as Weyl-like spinors of\nwell-defined chirality. Defects can be described by a ``defect bivector'', an\nalgebraic element which quantifies the rototranslation associated with them. In\ncholesterics, fermionic defects of different types can combine to yield\ncomposite quasiparticles with either fermionic or bosonic nature. Under\ncylindrical confinement, these quasiparticles provide the way to understand the\nstructure of screw dislocations.

    "abstract": "Two-photon states are essential for quantum technologies such as metrology,\nlithography, and communication. One of the main methods of two-photon\ngeneration is based on parametric down-conversion, but this suffers from low\nefficiency and a large footprint. This work is a detailed investigation of an\nalternative approach: two-photon generation from an atom in a doubly resonant\ncavity. The system, consisting of an atom interacting with two modes of the\ncavity, is modelled by the Lindblad Master Equation. An approximate analytical\nsolution is derived, using a novel approximation method, to determine the\npractically achievable limits on efficiency and brightness. The model also\npredicts the optimal cavity parameters for achieving these limits. For\nexperimentally feasible parameters, the maximum efficiency turns out to be\napproximately $0.1\\%$, which is about three orders of magnitude greater than\nthat of parametric down-conversion-based methods. The optimal rate and\nefficiency for two-photon generation are achieved when the outcoupling rate of\nthe cavity mode at the two-photon emission frequency matches the single-photon\natom-field coupling strength. Moreover, the outcoupling rate of the cavity mode\nat the one-photon emission frequency for single photons should be minimized.\nThe cavity field properties are also examined by studying the second-order\ncorrelation function at zero time delay and the Fano Factor. The quantum-jump\nframework, combined with Monte Carlo simulations, is used to characterize the\nmechanism of two-photon emission and the emission spectra of the cavity.\nTwo-photon emission is demonstrated to be a rapid cascade process of quantum\njumps, and the spectrum exhibits distinct peaks that correspond to transitions\nbetween the manifolds of the system.",

    "abstract": "Radiation therapy is one of the most common cancer treatments, and dose\noptimization and targeting of radiation are crucial since both cancerous and\nhealthy cells are affected. Different mathematical and computational approaches\nhave been developed for this task. The most common mathematical approach,\ndating back to the late 1970's, is the linear-quadratic (LQ) model for the\nsurvival probability given the radiation dose. Most simulation models consider\ntissue as a continuum rather than consisting of discrete cells. While\nreasonable for large scale models, e.g., for human organs, any cellular scale\neffects become, by necessity, neglected. They do, however, influence growth,\nmorphology, and metastasis of tumors. Here, we propose a method for modeling\nthe effect of radiation on cells based on the mechanobiological\n\\textsc{CellSim3D} simulation model for growth, division, and proliferation of\ncells. To model the effect of a radiation beam, we incorporate a Monte Carlo\nprocedure into \\textsc{CellSim3D} with the LQ model by introducing a survival\nprobability at each beam delivery. Effective removal of dead cells by\nphagocytosis was also implemented. Systems with two types of cells were\nsimulated: stiff slowly proliferating healthy cells and soft rapidly\nproliferating cancer cells. For model verification, the results were compared\nto prostate cancer (PC-3 cell line) data for different doses and we found good\nagreement. In addition, we simulated proliferating systems and analyzed the\nprobability density of the contact forces. We determined the state of the\nsystem with respect to the jamming transition and found very good agreement\nwith experiments.",

We also suggest\na new technique where we explore the correlation between the translation and\npitch rotation to study extent of activity. Given that a spherical birefringent\nparticle phagosome is almost a sphere, the fact that it turns due to the\nactivity of the motors is not obvious, even implying high rigidity of shell.\nApplying a minimal model for the roto-translational coupling, we further show\nthat this coupling manifests itself as sustained fluxes in phase space, a\nsignature of broken detailed balance.",

Transfer learning can\nbolster the effectiveness of BO algorithms in low-data regimes by leveraging\npre-existing chemical information or data outside the direct optimization task\n(i.e., source data). Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that\nchemical information present in foundation training data can give them utility\nfor processing chemical data. Furthermore, they can be augmented with and help\nsynthesize potentially multiple modalities of source chemical data germane to\nthe optimization task. In this work, we examine how chemical information from\nLLMs can be elicited and used for transfer learning to accelerate the BO of\nreaction conditions to maximize yield. Specifically, we show that a survey-like\nprompting scheme and preference learning can be used to infer a utility\nfunction which models prior chemical information embedded in LLMs over a\nchemical parameter space; we find that the utility function shows modest\ncorrelation to true experimental measurements (yield) over the parameter space\ndespite operating in a zero-shot setting.

Despite the reduced maintenance costs on an individual\nservice level, increased integration complexity arises.

    "abstract": "We study the pay-as-bid auction game, a supply function model with\ndiscriminatory pricing and asymmetric firms. In this game, strategies are\nnon-decreasing supply functions relating pric to quantity and the exact choice\nof the strategy space turns out to be a crucial issue: when it includes all\nnon-decreasing continuous functions, pure-strategy Nash equilibria often fail\nto exist. To overcome this, we restrict the strategy space to the set of\nLipschitz-continuous functions and we prove that Nash equilibria always exist\n(under standard concavity assumptions) and consist of functions that are affine\non their own support and have slope equal to the maximum allowed Lipschitz\nconstant. We further show that the Nash equilibrium is unique up to the\nmarket-clearing price when the demand is affine and the asymmetric marginal\nproduction costs are homogeneous in zero. For quadratic production costs, we\nderive a closed-form expression and we compute the limit as the allowed\nLipschitz constant grows to infinity. Our results show that in the limit the\npay-as-bid auction game achieves perfect competition with efficient allocation\nand induces a lower market-clearing price compared to supply function models\nbased on uniform price auctions.",

Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been\ndeveloped to combine the strengths of both architectures.

These attacks exploit common\nvulnerabilities in machine learning models to bypass security measures and\ncompromise systems. Although the transferability concept has been widely\nstudied, its practical feasibility remains limited due to assumptions of high\nsimilarity between source and target models. This paper analyzes the core\nfactors that contribute to transferability, including feature alignment, model\narchitectural similarity, and overlap in the data distributions that each IDS\nexamines. We propose a novel metric, the Transferability Feasibility Score\n(TFS), to assess the feasibility and reliability of such attacks based on these\nfactors. Through experimental evidence, we demonstrate that TFS and actual\nattack success rates are highly correlated, addressing the gap between\ntheoretical understanding and real-world impact.

Forced\nmeasurement is used to measure low Signal to Noise (SNR) sources in individual\nexposures. We find the weak lensing significance map recovers the galaxy\nclusters and most galaxy groups in the wide 40$'$ $\\times$ 40$'$ field.\nSignificant parts of the filamentary structures over this field, as indicated\nby the galaxy number density map, were also successfully recovered in lensing\nsignificance maps.

One\nwell-known model is the $T$-Interval Connectivity model, where the graph\nremains connected in every round, and the parameter $T$ reflects the duration\nof structural stability. Another model is Connectivity Time, where the union of\nedges across any $T$ consecutive rounds forms a connected graph. This is a\nweaker model, as the graph may be disconnected in individual rounds.\n  In this work, we introduce a new connectivity model called $T$-Path\nConnectivity. Unlike $T$-Interval Connectivity, the graph may not be connected\nin each round, but for every pair of nodes $u,v$, there must exist a path\nconnecting them in at least one round within any $T$ consecutive rounds. This\nmodel is strictly weaker than $T$-Interval Connectivity but stronger than the\nConnectivity Time model.\n  We study the dispersion problem in the $T$-Path Connectivity model. While\ndispersion has been explored in the 1-Interval Connectivity model, we show that\nthe existing algorithm with termination does not work in our model. We then\nidentify the minimal necessary assumptions required to solve dispersion in the\n$T$-Path Connectivity model and provide an algorithm that solves it optimally\nunder those conditions. Moreover, we prove that dispersion is unsolvable in the\nConnectivity Time model, even under several strong assumptions.\n  We further initiate the study of the exploration problem under all three\nconnectivity models. We present multiple impossibility results and, in most\ncases, establish tight bounds on the number of agents and time required.

    "abstract": "Recently, neural speech codecs (NSCs) trained as generative models have shown\nsuperior performance compared to conventional codecs at low bitrates. Although\nmost state-of-the-art NSCs are trained as Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs), Diffusion Models (DMs), a recent class of generative models, represent\na promising alternative due to their superior performance in image generation\nrelative to GANs. Consequently, DMs have been successfully applied for audio\nand speech coding among various other audio generation applications. However,\nthe design of diffusion-based NSCs has not yet been explored in a systematic\nway. We address this by providing a comprehensive analysis of diffusion-based\nNSCs divided into three contributions. First, we propose a categorization based\non the conditioning and output domains of the DM. This simple conceptual\nframework allows us to define a design space for diffusion-based NSCs and to\nassign a category to existing approaches in the literature. Second, we\nsystematically investigate unexplored designs by creating and evaluating new\ndiffusion-based NSCs within the conceptual framework. Finally, we compare the\nproposed models to existing GAN and DM baselines through objective metrics and\nsubjective listening tests.",

Current methods for detecting artifacts in\nsleep EEG rely on simple threshold-based algorithms that require manual\nintervention, which is time-consuming and impractical due to the vast volume of\ndata that novel mobile recording systems generate. We propose a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) model incorporating a convolutional block attention module\n(CNN-CBAM) to detect and identify the location of artifacts in the sleep EEG\nwith attention maps. We benchmarked this model against six other machine\nlearning and signal processing approaches.

We tested\nthem on 26 separate recordings from 6 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age\nof 68.33 y ($\\pm$4.08), with contained artifacts in 4\\% of epochs. CNN-CBAM\nachieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(0.88), sensitivity (0.81), and specificity (0.86) when compared to the other\napproaches.

One of the after effects due to evolution of\nmicro-structure is the swelling of fuel which can damage the fuel cladding and\ncause environmental contamination by leakage of radioactive particles. Hence,\nit is vital to continually monitor the evolution of micro-structure and to\nanalyze the changes in mechanical properties of the fuel.

One of the measurable\neffects of a stellar cycle is the significant (more than one order of\nmagnitude) variation in XUV irradiance. As a first step in modelling stellar\nirradiances, we present EUV irradiances in a sample of strong spectral lines\nformed in different layers and regions of the solar atmosphere, obtained from\nSolar Dynamics Observatory Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (SDO\nEVE). These irradiances span half a solar cycle. We present correlations with\nseveral proxies of solar activity, such as the Mg II index, sunspot numbers,\nand cm radio fluxes. Among these, the sunspot number proves to be the poorest\nproxy, whereas the Mg II index is a very good proxy for coronal lines (hotter\ntemperature lines). We find a relatively strong linear relationship, which\nenables us to build a model essential for various applications. Additionally,\nwe compare our results with the previous EUV standard solar irradiances\nreported by Del Zanna and Andretta 2014, derived from Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (SOHO CDS) data, as well as\nhistorical records from the literature.

    "abstract": "Recommender Systems (RS) have become essential tools in a wide range of\ndigital services, from e-commerce and streaming platforms to news and social\nmedia. As the volume of user-item interactions grows exponentially, especially\nin Big Data environments, selecting the most appropriate RS model becomes a\ncritical task. This paper presents a comparative study of several\nstate-of-the-art recommender algorithms, including EASE-R, SLIM, SLIM with\nElasticNet regularization, Matrix Factorization (FunkSVD and ALS), P3Alpha, and\nRP3Beta. We evaluate these models according to key criteria such as\nscalability, computational complexity, predictive accuracy, and\ninterpretability. The analysis considers both their theoretical underpinnings\nand practical applicability in large-scale scenarios. Our results highlight\nthat while models like SLIM and SLIM-ElasticNet offer high accuracy and\ninterpretability, they suffer from high computational costs, making them less\nsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, algorithms such as EASE-R and\nRP3Beta achieve a favorable balance between performance and scalability,\nproving more effective in large-scale environments. This study aims to provide\nguidelines for selecting the most appropriate recommender approach based on\nspecific Big Data constraints and system requirements.",

We propose a Correlation-based Iterative and Decompose-Restore\n(CIDR) interpolation method to address the dual limitations of conventional\nSingular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) methods: instability caused by flawed\niterative strategy and accuracy degradation due to inadequate denoising. CIDR\nsolves the above issues with two key ways: (i) a correlation-driven iteration\nstopping rule ensuring the method's overall consistency, and (ii)\ncomponent-specific interpolation with optimized denoising through a\ndecompose-restore framework. The 0.5{\\deg} downscaled GRACE(-FO) TWSA dataset\nwas employed with artificial gaps replicating intra-mission and inter-mission\nscenarios to evaluate the method's performance. At the grid scale, the global\naverage relative Root Mean Square (rRMS) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)\nimproved by 17.5% and 42.6% compared to the SSA method for intra-mission gaps,\nand by 18.6% and 27.6% for inter-mission gap interpolation, respectively.

By comparing entire output distributions rather than conducting\npairwise similarity checks, our approach directly contrasts creative\nprocesses--overcoming the computational challenges inherent in evaluating AI\noutputs against unbounded prior art corpora. Through experiments combining\nkernel mean embeddings with domain-specific machine learning representations\n(LeNet-5 for MNIST digits, CLIP for art), we demonstrate exceptional\nsensitivity: our method distinguishes MNIST digit classes with 95% confidence\nusing just 5-6 samples and differentiates AI-generated art from human art in\nthe AI-ArtBench dataset (n=400 per category; p<0.0001) using as few as 7-10\nsamples per distribution despite human evaluators' limited discrimination\nability (58% accuracy).

This work introduces a novel framework for comparing the\nperformance of link prediction versus node-pair classification tasks, analyses\nthe performance of state of the art gene-disease association approaches, and\ncompares the different order-based formalizations of gene-disease association\nprediction. It also evaluates the impact of the semantic richness through a\ndisease-specific ontology and additional links between ontologies. The\nframework involves five steps: data splitting, knowledge graph integration,\nembedding, modeling and prediction, and method evaluation. Results show that\nenriching the semantic representation of diseases slightly improves\nperformance, while additional links generate a greater impact. Link prediction\nmethods better explore the semantic richness encoded in knowledge graphs.\nAlthough node-pair classification methods identify all true positives, link\nprediction methods outperform overall.",

In this study, we\ndemonstrate that misaligned protoplanetary disks combined with stellar\noblateness drive complex dynamical evolution in planetary systems during their\ndisk dispersal stages.

This libration and eccentricity\nexcitation process can propagate inward-outward in compact multi-planet\nsystems, forming an excitation chain that can destabilize the entire system.\nThe non-adiabatic transition arises from the dynamical bifurcation-induced\neffect, which occurs during disk dissipation when\n$\\psi_{\\star0}\\gtrsim44.6^\\circ$ (for one-planet systems).

Here, we consider\na class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular\n(circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a\ntime-fluctuating environment where demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow\ncell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly\nswitches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental\nconditions. It is known that environmental variability can lead to population\nbottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced\nextinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and\nfluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle,\nand square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large,\nbottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus\ncaptured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean\ntime of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in\ncontrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the\nrate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation\ntime can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the\ncarrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and\nthe metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and\nstrain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we\nidentify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the\nmetapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in\nthe context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible\ngeneralisations of our models.",

This approach dynamically\ncomputes a fused yaw angle based on the real-time reliability of each sensor\nmodality, thereby eliminating the need for physical navigation lines.\nExperimental validation in actual poultry house environments demonstrates that\nour method not only resolves the inherent drawbacks of single-sensor systems,\nbut also significantly enhances navigation precision and operational\nefficiency. As such, it presents a promising solution for improving the\nperformance of inspection robots in complex indoor poultry farming settings.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a hybrid modeling approach that couples an Agent-Based\nModel (ABM) with a partial differential equation (PDE) model in an epidemic\nsetting to simulate the spatial spread of infectious diseases using a\ncompartmental structure with seven health states. The goal is to reduce the\ncomputational complexity of a full-ABM by introducing a coupled ABM-PDE model\nthat offers significantly faster simulations while maintaining comparable\naccuracy. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid model not only reduces the\noverall simulation runtime (defined as the number of runs required for stable\nresults multiplied by the duration of a single run) but also achieves smaller\nerrors across both 25% and 100% population samples. The coupling mechanism\nensures consistency at the model interface: agents crossing from the ABM into\nthe PDE domain are removed and represented as density contributions at the\ncorresponding grid node, while surplus density in the PDE domain is used to\ngenerate agents with plausible trajectories derived from mobile phone data. We\nevaluate the hybrid model using real-world mobility and infection data for the\nBerlin-Brandenburg region in Germany, showing that it captures the core\nepidemiological dynamics while enabling efficient large-scale simulations.",

Consequently, the literature fails to articulate\nthe true potency of transferable black-box attacks. We provide an empirical\nstudy of these biases and propose a framework that aids in a prior-free\ntransparent study of this paradigm.

Among these, X social network (formerly Twitter) stands as a\njuggernaut, boasting approximately 420 million active users. Extracting users'\nemotional and mental states from their expressed opinions on social media has\nbecome a common pursuit. While past methodologies predominantly focused on the\ntextual content of messages to analyze user sentiment, the interactive nature\nof these platforms suggests a deeper complexity. This study employs hybrid\nmethodologies, integrating textual analysis, profile examination, follower\nanalysis, and emotion dissemination patterns. Initially, user interactions are\nleveraged to refine emotion classification within messages, encompassing\nexchanges where users respond to each other. Introducing the concept of a\ncommunication tree, a model is extracted to map these interactions.\nSubsequently, users' bios and interests from this tree are juxtaposed with\nmessage text to enrich analysis. Finally, influential figures are identified\namong users' followers in the communication tree, categorized into different\ntopics to gauge interests. The study highlights that traditional sentiment\nanalysis methodologies, focusing solely on textual content, are inadequate in\ndiscerning sentiment towards significant events, notably the presidential\nelection. Comparative analysis with conventional methods reveals a substantial\nimprovement in accuracy with the incorporation of emotion distribution patterns\nand user profiles. The proposed approach yields a 12% increase in accuracy with\nemotion distribution patterns and a 15% increase when considering user\nprofiles, underscoring its efficacy in capturing nuanced sentiment dynamics.",

However, in recent years, several weighted versions of the\noriginal Spearman and Kendall coefficients have emerged that take into account\nthe greater importance of top ranks compared to low ranks, which is common in\nmany contexts. The weighting schemes break the symmetry, causing a non-zero\nexpected value between two random rankings. This issue is very relevant, as it\nundermines the concept of uncorrelation between rankings.

We compiled a TDE sample from the catalog of eROSITA's\nextragalactic transients and variables eRO-ExTra, which includes X-ray sources\nwith a variability significance and fractional amplitude over four between\neRASS1 and eRASS2, not associated with known AGNs.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter for\nmulti-target filtering based on sensor measurements that are sets of\ntrajectories in the last two-time step window. The proposed filter, the\ntrajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the\nset of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the\nset of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated\nwith the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM\nposterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM\ndensity on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution\nfor multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating\nthe set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the\npaper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by\nderiving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The\nperformance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.",

We propose the use of learned beliefs on the underlying\nstate of the system to overcome these challenges and enable reinforcement\nlearning with fully decentralized training and execution. Our approach\nleverages state information to pre-train a probabilistic belief model in a\nself-supervised fashion. The resulting belief states, which capture both\ninferred state information as well as uncertainty over this information, are\nthen used in a state-based reinforcement learning algorithm to create an\nend-to-end model for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning under\npartial observability.

    "abstract": "One of the most alarming issues in digital society is hate speech (HS) on\nsocial media. The severity is so high that researchers across the globe are\ncaptivated by this domain. A notable amount of work has been conducted to\naddress the identification and alarm system. However, a noticeable gap exists,\nespecially for low-resource languages. Comprehensive datasets are the main\nproblem among the constrained resource languages, such as Bangla.\nInterestingly, hate speech or any particular speech has no single\ndimensionality. Similarly, the hate component can simultaneously have multiple\nabusive attributes, which seems to be missed in the existing datasets. Thus, a\nmulti-label Bangla hate speech dataset named BOISHOMMO has been compiled and\nevaluated in this work. That includes categories of HS across race, gender,\nreligion, politics, and more. With over two thousand annotated examples,\nBOISHOMMO provides a nuanced understanding of hate speech in Bangla and\nhighlights the complexities of processing non-Latin scripts. Apart from\nevaluating with multiple algorithmic approaches, it also highlights the\ncomplexities of processing Bangla text and assesses model performance. This\nunique multi-label approach enriches future hate speech detection and analysis\nstudies for low-resource languages by providing a more nuanced, diverse\ndataset.",

    "abstract": "Legal retrieval is a widely studied area in Information Retrieval (IR) and a\nkey task in this domain is retrieving relevant cases based on a given query\ncase, often done by applying language models as encoders to model case\nsimilarity. Recently, Tang et al. proposed CaseLink, a novel graph-based method\nfor legal case retrieval, which models both cases and legal charges as nodes in\na network, with edges representing relationships such as references and shared\nsemantics. This approach offers a new perspective on the task by capturing\nhigher-order relationships of cases going beyond the stand-alone level of\ndocuments. However, while this shift in approaching legal case retrieval is a\npromising direction in an understudied area of graph-based legal IR, challenges\nin reproducing novel results have recently been highlighted, with multiple\nstudies reporting difficulties in reproducing previous findings. Thus, in this\nwork we reproduce CaseLink, a graph-based legal case retrieval method, to\nsupport future research in this area of IR. In particular, we aim to assess its\nreliability and generalizability by (i) first reproducing the original study\nsetup and (ii) applying the approach to an additional dataset. We then build\nupon the original implementations by (iii) evaluating the approach's\nperformance when using a more sophisticated graph data representation and (iv)\nusing an open large language model (LLM) in the pipeline to address limitations\nthat are known to result from using closed models accessed via an API.

To address the challenge, prior work has explored\nquantization, but achieving low-precision quantization for DiT inferencing with\nboth high accuracy and substantial speedup remains an open problem. To this\nend, this paper proposes MixDiT, an algorithm-hardware co-designed acceleration\nsolution that exploits mixed Microscaling (MX) formats to quantize DiT\nactivation values. MixDiT quantizes the DiT activation tensors by selectively\napplying higher precision to magnitude-based outliers, which produce\nmixed-precision GEMM operations.

The proposed methodology consists of both a feature extraction phase\nand a statistical analysis phase. The first phase introduces a novel\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture specifically designed for\nextracting sensitive features with a limited number of manual annotations. The\nsecond phase compares the distributions of sensitive features across subgroups\nusing a novel statistical test that accounts for the imprecision of the feature\nextraction model.

    "abstract": "Sensing and discriminating between enantiomers of chiral molecules remains a\nsignificant challenge in the design of sensor platforms. In the case of\nchemoresistive sensors, where detection relies on changes in electrical\nresponse upon analyte adsorption, the sensor substrate is typically\nfunctionalized with chirality sensitive molecular receptors. In this\ncomputational study, we investigate whether a chirality-blind substrate, such\nas a graphene nanoribbon, is still capable of discriminating between\nenantiomers. To this end, we employ a density-functional parametrized\ntight-binding method combined with nonequilibrium Green functions. For a small\nset of chiral amino acids, we demonstrate that accounting for the\nnonequilibrium response of the device leads to significant differences in the\nelectrical currents of enantiomeric pairs of the order tens of nanoamperes.\nThis effect is further amplified when structural fluctuations of the device's\nactive region are considered (1-2 microAmp). Moreover, we propose new\nquantum-mechanical quantities for enantioselective discrimination in molecular\nsensors, with an emphasis on binding features and property-property\ncorrelations. Therefore, our work demonstrates the significance of\nnonequilibrium effects in chiral discrimination, laying the foundation for\nfuture investigations addressing the design of chiral molecular sensors.",

Using imaging data from the DAocheng solar Radio Telescope (DART) in\nthe 150-450 MHz frequency range, we present two eruptive filaments that\nmanifest as radio dimmings (i.e., emission depressions). Simultaneously,\nportions of these eruptive filaments are discernible as dark features in the\nchromospheric images. The sun-as-a-star flux curves of brightness temperature,\nderived from the DART images, exhibit obvious radio dimmings.

TS based on silver (Ag) conductive filaments has been\nobserved in many materials, including layered two-dimensional (2D) transition\nmetal dichalcogenides (TMDs). 2D TMDs are particularly promising for metal ion\nmovement due to their van der Waals (vdW) gaps between their sheets,\nfacilitating ion migration and filament formation without disturbing covalent\nchemical bonds.

Common approaches tend to converge to local minima and typically\npoorly reconstruct regions with low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). This\ninstrumental revolution thus calls for new scalable data analysis techniques.\nWe present Beetroots, a Python software that performs Bayesian reconstruction\nof maps of physical conditions from observation maps and an astrophysical\nmodel.

It\nalso assesses the ability of the astrophysical model to explain the\nobservations, providing feedback to improve ISM models. We demonstrate the\npower of Beetroots with the Meudon PDR code on synthetic data, and then apply\nit to estimate physical condition maps in the full Orion molecular cloud 1\n(OMC-1) star forming region based on Herschel molecular line emission maps. The\napplication to the synthetic case shows that Beetroots can currently analyse\nmaps with up to ten thousand pixels, addressing large variations of S/N,\nescaping from local minima, and providing consistent uncertainty\nquantifications. On a laptop, the inference runtime ranges from a few minutes\nfor 100-pixel maps to 28 hours for 8100-pixel maps.

Traditionally, EEG signals have\nbeen the primary standard for seizure prediction due to their precision in\ncapturing brain activity. However, their high cost, susceptibility to noise,\nand logistical constraints limit their practicality, restricting their use to\nclinical settings. In order to overcome these limitations, this study focuses\non leveraging ECG signals as an alternative for seizure prediction. In this\npaper, we present a novel method for predicting seizures based on detecting\nanomalies in ECG signals during their reconstruction. By extracting\ntime-frequency features and leveraging various advanced deep learning\narchitectures, the proposed method identifies deviations in heart rate dynamics\nassociated with seizure onset.

In a sufficiently large magnetic field the ground\nstate is either a chiral soliton lattice (CSL), an array of solitons of the\nneutral pion field, or a domain-wall Skyrmion phase in which Skyrmions emerge\ninside the chiral solitons. In the region of large chemical potential and a\nmagnetic field lower than its critical value for CSL, a Skyrmion crystal is\nexpected to take up the ground state based on the chiral perturbation theory at\nthe next leading order. We determine the phase boundary between such a Skyrmion\ncrystal and the QCD vacuum. There was a conjecture that a magnetic field\ndeforms the Skyrmion into a pancake shape whose boundary is a superconducting\nring of charged pions. In contrast, through the exact Skyrmion solution, we\nfind that the pancake conjecture holds approximately in a strong magnetic\nfield, but fails for a weak one. We also validate that a Skyrmion would shrink\nto null without the Skyrme term, although Derrick's scaling law is modified by\na background magnetic field, and the stability at the leading order is not\nruled out in theory.",

The framework is based on the novel\nconcept of active weight DRAM-flash swapping and incorporates three novel\ntechniques: (1) Cross-layer active weights preloading. It uses the activations\nfrom the current layer to predict the active weights of several subsequent\nlayers, enabling computation and data loading to overlap, as well as\nfacilitating large I/O transfers. (2) Sparsity-aware self-distillation. It\nadjusts the active weights to align with the dense-model output distribution,\ncompensating for approximations introduced by contextual sparsity. (3) Active\nweight DRAM-flash swapping pipeline. It orchestrates the DRAM space allocation\namong the hot weight cache, preloaded active weights, and computation-involved\nweights based on available memory.

Such a set $S'$ serves as a proof that $x$ indeed has\nlabel $y$ under the assumption that (1) the target function $h^\\star$ belongs\nto $H$, and (2) the set $S$ contains at most $b$ corrupted points. For example,\nif $b=0$ and $H$ is the family of linear classifiers in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and if\n$x$ lies inside the convex hull of the positive data points in $S$ (and hence\nevery consistent linear classifier labels $x$ as positive), then\nCarath\\'eodory's theorem states that $x$ lies inside the convex hull of $d+1$\nof those points. So, a set $S'$ of size $d+1$ could be released as an\nexplanation for a positive prediction, and would serve as a short proof of\ncorrectness of the prediction under the assumption of realizability.\n  In this work, we consider this problem more generally, for general hypothesis\nclasses $H$ and general values $b\\geq 0$.

The total order of the events in a sequential trace is typically based\non their temporal occurrence. However, real-life processes are partially\nordered by nature. Different activities can occur in different parts of the\nprocess and, thus, independently of each other. Therefore, the temporal total\norder of events does not necessarily reflect their causal order, as also\ncausally unrelated events may be ordered in time. Only partial orders allow to\nexpress concurrency, duration, overlap, and uncertainty of events.\nConsequently, there is a growing need for process mining algorithms that can\ndirectly handle partially ordered input. In this paper, we combine two\nwell-established and efficient algorithms, the eST Miner from the process\nmining community and the Firing LPO algorithm from the Petri net community, to\nintroduce the eST$^2$ Miner.

Open-source Verilog repositories from the real world,\nalong with an extended context size, are used for domain-specific fine-tuning.\nThe optimized RAG system improves the information density of the input context\nby retrieving relevant code snippets. Tailored optimizations for RAG are\ncarried out, including the embedding model, the cross-file context splitting\nstrategy, and the chunk size. Our solution achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on public benchmark, significantly surpassing GPT-4 and advanced\ndomain-specific LLMs on Edit Similarity and Exact Match rate. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our approach and offer\ninsights for future work.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new problem, In-2-4D, for generative 4D (i.e., 3D + motion)\ninbetweening from a minimalistic input setting: two single-view images\ncapturing an object in two distinct motion states. Given two images\nrepresenting the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to\ngenerate and reconstruct the motion in 4D. We utilize a video interpolation\nmodel to predict the motion, but large frame-to-frame motions can lead to\nambiguous interpretations. To overcome this, we employ a hierarchical approach\nto identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states and show\nsignificant motion, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each\nfragment, we construct the 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian\nSplatting. The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling\ntheir transformation into dynamic Gaussians through a deformation field. To\nimprove temporal consistency and refine 3D motion, we expand the self-attention\nof multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation\nregularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion\nsegments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to\nalign with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions.\nThrough extensive qualitative and quantitiave experiments as well as a user\nstudy, we show the effectiveness of our method and its components.

This is especially true in the\npresence of aliasing and spurious signals caused by environmental influences\naffecting the instrument. Our goal is to test a clustering algorithm to find\nsignals with the same periodicity, (i.e. with the stellar rotation period) in\nthe periodograms of a large number of activity indicators. On this basis, we\nhave looked to evaluate the correlations between activity indicators and\nfundamental stellar parameters. We used generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms\nto find periodic signals in 24 activity indicators, spanning the VIS and NIR\nchannels of the CARMENES spectrograph. Common periods were subsequently\ndetermined by a machine learning algorithm for density-based spatial clustering\nof applications with noise (DBSCAN). The clustering analysis of the signals\napparent in the spectral activity indicators is a powerful tool for the\ndetection of stellar rotation periods. It is straightforward to implement and\ncan be easily automated, so that large data sets can be analysed. For a sample\nof 136 stars, we were able to recover the stellar rotation period in a total of\n59 cases, including 3 with a previously unknown rotation period. In addition,\nwe analysed spurious signals frequently occurring at the period of one year and\nits integer fractions, concluding that they are likely aliases of one\nunderlying signal. Furthermore, we reproduced the results of several previous\nstudies on the relationships between activity indicators and the stellar\ncharacteristics.",

In this study, we use MUSE integral-field spectroscopy to investigate\nthe stellar rotation of ~2300 stars in the 1.5 Gyr old cluster NGC 1783 in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud. The effective temperature, surface gravity, radial\nvelocity, and projected rotational velocity ($v\\mathrm{sin}i$) of the entire\nsample were obtained within a Bayesian framework to derive robust estimates of\nthese parameters along with their associated errors. The analysis shows that\nstars along the extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) cover a wide range of\nrotational velocities, from values consistent with no/slow rotation up to\n$v\\mathrm{sin}i$ ~ 250 km/s. The distribution of stellar rotation velocities\nappears to play a crucial role in explaining the broadening of the eMSTO in\nthis cluster, and a correlation is observed between $v\\mathrm{sin}i$ and the\ncolor of the eMSTO stars, with $v\\mathrm{sin}i$ increasing as the color becomes\nredder. Among the eMSTO stars, we investigate the peculiar population of stars\nstrongly dimmed in the UV (so-called UV-dim stars), recently discovered in NGC\n1783. UV-dim stars show clear photometric evidence of self-extinction and mild\nspectroscopic signatures typically observed in shell stars, thus suggesting\nthat they have likely a decretion disc observed nearly equator-on.\nInterestingly, the study also shows that a significant fraction of UV-dim stars\nare slow rotators. We discuss potential implications these results may have on\nour understanding of the formation and evolution of UV-dim stars and we propose\nthat the rotational properties of the UV-dim stars should vary with cluster\nage.",

Our results reveal a\nsharp transition in estimation performance between short-memory (SM) and\nlong-memory (LM) regimes, reflected in a non-monotonic estimation error that\nresembles a phase transition. This behavior is accompanied by an\navoided-crossing-like structure in the estimated parameter space, indicative of\ntwo competing solutions near the critical point. These features underscore the\ninterplay between control, decoherence, and inference in open quantum systems.\nBeyond their fundamental significance, these critical phenomena offer a\npractical diagnostic tool for identifying dynamical regimes and optimizing\nquantum sensing protocols. By exploiting this criticality, our findings pave\nthe way for adaptive control strategies aimed at enhancing precision in quantum\nparameter estimation -- particularly in complex or structured environments such\nas spin networks, diffusive media, and quantum materials.",

    "abstract": "The concept of a `persistent worm' is introduced, representing the smallest\npossible length of a wormlike micelle, and modelled by a bead-spring chain with\nsticky beads at the ends. Persistent worms are allowed to combine with each\nother at their sticky ends to form wormlike micelles with a distribution of\nlengths, and the semiflexibility of a wormlike micelle is captured with a\nbending potential between springs, both within and across persistent worms that\nstick to each other. Multi-particle Brownian dynamics simulations of such\npolydisperse and `polyflexible' wormlike micelles, with hydrodynamic\ninteractions included and coupled with reversible scission/fusion of persistent\nworms, are used to investigate the static and dynamic properties of wormlike\nmicellar solutions in the dilute and unentangled semidilute concentration\nregimes. The influence of the sticker energy and persistent worm concentration\nare examined and simulations are shown to validate theoretical mean-field\npredictions of the universal scaling with concentration of the chain length\ndistribution of linear wormlike micelles, independent of the sticker energy.\nThe presence of wormlike micelles that form rings is shown not to affect the\nstatic properties of linear wormlike micelles and mean-field predictions of\nring length distributions are validated. Linear viscoelastic storage and loss\nmoduli are computed and the unique features in the intermediate frequency\nregime compared to those of homopolymer solutions are highlighted. The\ninclusion of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) enables the distinction between\nRouse and Zimm dynamics in wormlike micelle solutions to be elucidated. While\nthe neglect of HI is justified in the case of entangled wormlike micelle\nsolutions, here the concentration at which the onset of the screening of\nhydrodynamic interactions occurs is clearly identified.",

    "abstract": "LC technology is a promising hardware solution for realizing extremely large\nRISs due to its advantages in cost-effectiveness, scalability, energy\nefficiency, and continuous phase shift tunability. However, the slow response\ntime of the LC cells, especially in comparison to the silicon-based\nalternatives like radio frequency switches and PIN diodes, limits the\nperformance. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in TDMA applications\nwhere RIS must sequentially serve users in different locations, as the\nphase-shifting response time of LC cells can constrain system performance. This\npaper addresses the slow phase-shifting limitation of LC by developing a\nphysics-based model for the time response of an LC unit cell and proposing a\nnovel phase-shift design framework to reduce the transition time. Specifically,\nexploiting the fact that LC-RIS at milimeter wave bands have a large electric\naperture, we optimize the LC phase shifts based on user locations, eliminating\nthe need for full channel state information and minimizing reconfiguration\noverhead. Moreover, instead of focusing on a single point, the RIS phase\nshifters are designed to optimize coverage over an area. This enhances\ncommunication reliability for mobile users and mitigates performance\ndegradation due to user location estimation errors. The proposed design\nminimizes the transition time between configurations, a critical requirement\nfor TDMA schemes. Our analysis reveals that the impact of RIS reconfiguration\ntime on system throughput becomes particularly significant when TDMA intervals\nare comparable to the reconfiguration time. In such scenarios, optimizing the\nphase-shift design helps mitigate performance degradation while ensuring\nspecific QoS requirements. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has been tested\nthrough experimental evaluations, which demonstrate that it also performs\neffectively in practice.",

Here we use a combination of\nexperiments, theory and simulations to show that small magnetic particles of\ndifferent densities, exploring flow regions of distinct vorticity statistics,\ncan act as effective probes for measuring and forcing turbulence at its\nsmallest scale. The interplay between the magnetic torque, from an externally\ncontrollable magnetic field, and hydrodynamic stresses, from small-scale\nturbulent vorticity, reveals an extremely rich phenomenology.

We identify a pronounced resonant peak in particle rotational\nphase-lag when the applied magnetic field matches the characteristic intensity\nof small-scale vortices. Furthermore, we uncover a novel symmetry-breaking\nmechanism: an oscillating magnetic field with zero-mean angular velocity\nremarkably induces net particle rotation in turbulence with zero-mean\nvorticity, as turbulent fluctuations aid the particle in \"surfing\" the magnetic\nfield.

Traditional methods\nrequire deriving a multi-phase ansatz to close the moment system of the\nLiouville equation, a process that is often computationally intensive and\nimpractical. Our method offers an efficient alternative by introducing a novel\ntwo-stage neural network framework to close the $2N\\times 2N$ moment system,\nwhere $N$ represents the number of phases in the solution ansatz. In the first\nstage, we train neural networks to learn the mapping between higher-order\nmoments and lower-order moments (along with their derivatives). The second\nstage incorporates physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), where we\nsubstitute the learned higher-order moments to systematically close the system.\nWe provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of both the loss\nfunctions and the neural network approximations. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method for one- and two-dimensional\nproblems with various phase numbers $N$ in the multi-phase solutions.

    "abstract": "As the demand for efficient, low-power computing in embedded and edge devices\ngrows, traditional computing methods are becoming less effective for handling\ncomplex tasks. Stochastic computing (SC) offers a promising alternative by\napproximating complex arithmetic operations, such as addition and\nmultiplication, using simple bitwise operations, like majority or AND, on\nrandom bit-streams. While SC operations are inherently fault-tolerant, their\naccuracy largely depends on the length and quality of the stochastic\nbit-streams (SBS). These bit-streams are typically generated by CMOS-based\nstochastic bit-stream generators that consume over 80% of the SC system's power\nand area. Current SC solutions focus on optimizing the logic gates but often\nneglect the high cost of moving the bit-streams between memory and processor.\nThis work leverages the physics of emerging ReRAM devices to implement the\nentire SC flow in place: (1) generating low-cost true random numbers and SBSs,\n(2) conducting SC operations, and (3) converting SBSs back to binary.\nConsidering the low reliability of ReRAM cells, we demonstrate how SC's\nrobustness to errors copes with ReRAM's variability. Our evaluation shows\nsignificant improvements in throughput (1.39x, 2.16x) and energy consumption\n(1.15x, 2.8x) over state-of-the-art (CMOS- and ReRAM-based) solutions,\nrespectively, with an average image quality drop of 5% across multiple SBS\nlengths and image processing tasks.",

    "abstract": "Vector processors frequently suffer from inefficient memory accesses,\nparticularly for strided and segment patterns. While coalescing strided\naccesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at\nfixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead\ncrossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical\ndesign issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically\nhandled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading\nperformance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area\noverhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access\narchitecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based\noptimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift\nnetworks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple\naccesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and\nregisters through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment\noperations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise\naccess, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance,\nin-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an\nopen-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory\naccesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided\noperations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9%\nand power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and\nefficiency of vector processors.",

We propose two sets of methods, cross-block feature\naggregation PCA (CFA-PCA) and moving average PCA (MA-PCA), designed for sparse\nand dense block signals, respectively. Both methods adaptively utilize block\nsignal structures, applicable to non-Gaussian data with heterogeneous variances\nand non-diagonal covariance matrices. Specifically, the CFA method utilizes a\nblock-wise U-statistic to aggregate and select block signals non-parametrically\nfrom data with unknown cluster labels. We show that the proposed methods are\nconsistent for both clustering and signal recovery under mild conditions and\nweaker signal strengths than the existing methods without considering block\nstructures of signals. Furthermore, we derive both statistical and\ncomputational minimax lower bounds (SMLB and CMLB) for high-dimensional\nclustering and signal recovery under block signals, where the CMLBs are\nrestricted to algorithms with polynomial computation complexity. The minimax\nboundaries partition signals into regions of impossibility and possibility. No\nalgorithm (or no polynomial time algorithm) can achieve consistent clustering\nor signal recovery if the signals fall into the statistical (or computational)\nregion of impossibility. We show that the proposed CFA-PCA and MA-PCA methods\ncan achieve the CMLBs for the sparse and dense block signal regimes,\nrespectively, indicating the proposed methods are computationally minimax\noptimal.

However, most existing OT approaches are\nincapable of conditioning on different treatment contexts (e.g., time, drug\ntreatment, drug dosage, or cell type) and we still lack methods that\nunanimously show promising generalization performance to unseen treatments.\nHere, we propose the Conditional Monge Gap which learns OT maps conditionally\non arbitrary covariates.

    "abstract": "Secure aggregation enables a group of mutually distrustful parties, each\nholding private inputs, to collaboratively compute an aggregate value while\npreserving the privacy of their individual inputs. However, a major challenge\nin adopting secure aggregation approaches for practical applications is the\nsignificant computational overhead of the underlying cryptographic protocols,\ne.g. fully homomorphic encryption. This overhead makes secure aggregation\nprotocols impractical, especially for large datasets. In contrast,\nhardware-based security techniques such as trusted execution environments\n(TEEs) enable computation at near-native speeds, making them a promising\nalternative for reducing the computational burden typically associated with\npurely cryptographic techniques. Yet, in many scenarios, parties may opt for\neither cryptographic or hardware-based security mechanisms, highlighting the\nneed for hybrid approaches. In this work, we introduce several secure\naggregation architectures that integrate both cryptographic and TEE-based\ntechniques, analyzing the trade-offs between security and performance.",

A Latent\nFactorization of Tensors (LFT) model is one of the most effective models for\nlearning the representation of a target network. However, an academic network\nis often High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) because the relationships among\nnumerous network entities are impossible to be fully explored, making it\ndifficult for an LFT model to learn accurate representation of the academic\nnetwork. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Prediction-sampling-based\nLatent Factorization of Tensors (PLFT) model with two ideas: 1) constructing a\ncascade LFT architecture to enhance model representation learning ability via\nlearning academic network hierarchical features, and 2) introducing a nonlinear\nactivation-incorporated predicting-sampling strategy to more accurately learn\nthe network representation via generating new academic network data layer by\nlayer.

The flare radiation reveals five prominent\nperiods in multiple wavelengths.

A quasi-period at 14\nminutes is observed in the SXR and high-temperature EUV wavebands, and it may\nbe caused by repeatedly heated plasmas in hot flare loops. A quasiperiod at\nabout 18 minutes is only observed by STIX, with reconstructed SXR images\nsuggesting that the 18-min period pulsations should be considered as different\nflares. Meanwhile, a 3-min QPP is simultaneously detected in wavelengths of\nHXR, radio, and UV/ EUV, which is directly modulated by the slow\nmagnetoacoustic wave leaking from sunspot umbrae. At last, a 2-min QPP is\nsimultaneously detected in HXR and radio emissions during the pre-flare phase,\nwhich is possibly generated by a quasi-periodic regime of magnetic reconnection\nthat is triggered by the kink wave.",

    "abstract": "Frozen hydrogen filaments or droplets/pellets in vacuum are of great interest\nas target for many experiments at hadron and lepton accelerators as well as at\nhigh-power laser systems. Especially in case of large distances between the\nposition of target beam generation and the interaction point with an\naccelerator or laser beam, a high target beam stability in space and time is\ncrucial. Here we present recent results on the long-term stability of frozen\nhydrogen filaments in vacuum, which have been obtained using a new cryogenic\ntarget generator. It could be shown that the trajectory of the frozen hydrogen\ntarget beam with a diameter of $10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ remains stable for over 60\nhours, with angular fluctuations below $0.08\\,^\\circ$. Furthermore, we present\na novel strategy for the manipulation of the target beam, named cryobending.\nHere, the produced hydrogen filament is deflected by helium gas emerging from\ncorrection nozzles. We demonstrate the deflection of the hydrogen beam with one\nand two nozzles, achieving deflection angles up to $(15.7\\pm 0.4)\\,^\\circ$. The\npresented results open the door for further developments of this beam position\nsystem, which enables target beam adjustment without any mechanical movement of\nthe target components itself. Potential applications of these stable hydrogen\ntarget filaments are, e.g., the upcoming MAGIX (MAinz Gas Injection target\neXperiment) or the planned $\\mathrm{\\bar{P}ANDA}$ (anti-Proton ANnihilation at\nDArmstadt) experiment.",

Existing approaches that\nuse VLMs for 3D Visual Grounding tasks often focus on obtaining scene\ninformation through geometric and visual information, overlooking the\nextraction of diverse semantic information from the scene and the understanding\nof rich implicit semantic attributes, such as appearance, physics, and\naffordance. The 3D scene graph, which combines geometry and language, is an\nideal representation method for environmental perception and is an effective\ncarrier for language models in 3D Visual Grounding tasks. To address these\nissues, we propose a diverse semantic map construction method specifically\ndesigned for robotic agents performing 3D Visual Grounding tasks. This method\nleverages VLMs to capture the latent semantic attributes and relations of\nobjects within the scene and creates a Diverse Semantic Map (DSM) through a\ngeometry sliding-window map construction strategy.

In this work, we propose PolyConf, a pioneering tailored polymer\nconformation generation method that leverages hierarchical generative models to\nunlock new possibilities. Specifically, we decompose the polymer conformation\ninto a series of local conformations (i.e., the conformations of its repeating\nunits), generating these local conformations through an autoregressive model,\nand then generating their orientation transformations via a diffusion model to\nassemble them into the complete polymer conformation. Moreover, we develop the\nfirst benchmark with a high-quality polymer conformation dataset derived from\nmolecular dynamics simulations to boost related research in this area. The\ncomprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PolyConf consistently outperforms\nexisting conformation generation methods, thus facilitating advancements in\npolymer modeling and simulation.",

    "abstract": "To answer questions of \"causes of effects\", the probability of necessity is\nintroduced for assessing whether or not an observed outcome was caused by an\nearlier treatment. However, the statistical inference for probability of\nnecessity is understudied due to several difficulties, which hinders its\napplication in practice. The evaluation of the probability of necessity\ninvolves the joint distribution of potential outcomes, and thus it is in\ngeneral not point identified and one can at best obtain lower and upper bounds\neven in randomized experiments, unless certain monotonicity assumptions on\npotential outcomes are made. Moreover, these bounds are non-smooth functionals\nof the observed data distribution and standard estimation and inference methods\ncannot be directly applied. In this paper, we investigate the statistical\ninference for the probability of necessity in general situations where it may\nnot be point identified. We introduce a mild margin condition to tackle the\nnon-smoothness, under which the bounds become pathwise differentiable. We\nestablish the semiparametric efficiency theory and propose novel asymptotically\nefficient estimators of the bounds, and further construct confidence intervals\nfor the probability of necessity based on the proposed bounds estimators. The\nresultant confidence intervals are less conservative than existing methods and\ncan effectively make use of the observed covariates.",

Here, we employ temporal coupled mode theory\n(CMT) to determine the irreducible representations of the energy bands at the\nHSPs in 2D square lattice photonic systems. Our CMT on plasmonic nanohole\narrays formulates how Bloch-like surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) interact not\nonly with each other and but also with the continuum, revealing the importance\nof mode coupling in defining the field symmetries as well as their radiative\nand nonradiative characteristics. Such formulation facilitates the assignments\nof the band representations. From the representations, we find, unlike the\nconventional 2D tight-binding model, several band inversions occur at the\n{\\Gamma}and X points as hole size increases, leading to changes in band\ntopology in a subtle manner. In addition, the radiations arising from the\ncoupled SPPs that carry different field symmetries are strongly polarization-\nand phase-dependent. We then conduct angle- and polarization-resolved\ndiffraction spectroscopy on plasmonic arrays to verify the theory.

Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional\nintracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the\ntheoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of\nthe second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii)\nsingle-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of\nstatic and dynamical phases. However, matter-wave superradiance, captured\nwithin the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show\nthat they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the\nsingle-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher\nenergy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner\napproximation (TWA), we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We\ndemonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the\nphoton-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave (DW)\nphase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of\ninteratomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be\nobserved in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the\nfragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities, which may hint at an\neventual transition to a Mott insulating (MI) phase.",

Once started, the\nagents operate in synchronous rounds. We focus on \\emph{weakly} Byzantine\nenvironments, where Byzantine agents can behave arbitrarily but cannot falsify\ntheir IDs. The goal is for all \\emph{non-Byzantine} agents to eventually\nterminate at a single node simultaneously.\n  In this paper, we first prove two impossibility results: (1) for any number\nof non-Byzantine agents, no algorithm can solve this problem without global\nknowledge of the network size or the number of agents, and (2) no\nself-stabilizing algorithm exists if $k\\leq 2f$ even with $n$, $k$, $f$, and\nthe length $\\Lambda_g$ of the largest ID among IDs of non-Byzantine agents,\nwhere the self-stabilizing algorithm enables agents to gather starting from\narbitrary (inconsistent) initial states. Next, based on these results, we\nintroduce a \\emph{perpetual gathering} problem and propose a self-stabilizing\nalgorithm for this problem.

Existing methods for Multimodal Multi-hop Question\nAnswering (MMQA) often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities, reliance on\nmodality conversion, and inadequate alignment between visual and textual\nrepresentations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces\nVision-Language Multimodal Transformer (VLMT), a unified architecture that\nintegrates a transformer-based vision encoder with a sequence-to-sequence\nlanguage model. VLMT employs a direct token-level injection mechanism to fuse\nvisual and textual inputs within a shared embedding space, eliminating the need\nfor intermediate projection layers. To enhance cross-modal alignment and\nreasoning, a three-stage pretraining strategy is proposed to progressively\nalign vision-language representations and improve the model's capacity for\nmultimodal understanding. Based on the pretrained backbone, two task-specific\nmodules are instantiated to form a two-stage MMQA framework: a multimodal\nreranker that predicts document relevance scores and utilizes a relative\nthreshold with top-k strategy for context retrieval, and a multimodal question\nanswering model that generates contextually grounded answers based on the\nretrieved evidence. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. On MultimodalQA\nvalidation set, VLMT-Large achieves 76.5% Exact Match and 80.1% F1,\noutperforming the previous state-of-the-art by +9.1% in Exact Match and +8.8%\nin F1. On WebQA, it attains a QA score of 47.6, surpassing prior models such as\nPERQA by +3.2.

Common strategies for QBA address either a single source of bias\nor multiple sources one at a time, thus not informing the overall impact of the\npotential biases. We propose a systematic approach (roadmap) for identifying\nand analysing multiple biases together. Briefly, this consists of (i)\narticulating the assumptions underlying the primary analysis through\nspecification and emulation of the \"ideal trial\" that defines the causal\nestimand of interest and depicting these assumptions using casual diagrams;\n(ii) depicting alternative assumptions under which biases arise using causal\ndiagrams; (iii) obtaining a single estimate simultaneously adjusted for all\nbiases under the alternative assumptions. We illustrate the roadmap in an\ninvestigation of the effect of breastfeeding on risk of childhood asthma.

A promising strategy to overcome these limitations is to utilize\nmultimode fibers, which exhibit higher thresholds for both nonlinear effects\nand transverse mode instability, combined with wavefront shaping techniques to\nconvert the output speckle pattern into a single concentrated spot.

    "abstract": "Image-based surface reconstruction and characterization is crucial for\nmissions to small celestial bodies, as it informs mission planning, navigation,\nand scientific analysis. However, current state-of-the-practice methods, such\nas stereophotoclinometry (SPC), rely heavily on human-in-the-loop verification\nand high-fidelity a priori information. This paper proposes\nPhotoclinometry-from-Motion (PhoMo), a novel framework that incorporates\nphotoclinometry techniques into a keypoint-based structure-from-motion (SfM)\nsystem to estimate the surface normal and albedo at detected landmarks to\nimprove autonomous surface and shape characterization of small celestial bodies\nfrom in-situ imagery. In contrast to SPC, we forego the expensive maplet\nestimation step and instead use dense keypoint measurements and correspondences\nfrom an autonomous keypoint detection and matching method based on deep\nlearning. Moreover, we develop a factor graph-based approach allowing for\nsimultaneous optimization of the spacecraft's pose, landmark positions,\nSun-relative direction, and surface normals and albedos via fusion of Sun\nvector measurements and image keypoint measurements. The proposed framework is\nvalidated on real imagery taken by the Dawn mission to the asteroid 4 Vesta and\nthe minor planet 1 Ceres and compared against an SPC reconstruction, where we\ndemonstrate superior rendering performance compared to an SPC solution and\nprecise alignment to a stereophotogrammetry (SPG) solution without relying on\nany a priori camera pose and topography information or humans-in-the-loop.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the problem of characteristic mode analysis using\neigendecomposition of the method of moments impedance matrix has been\nsimplified using the eigen-subspace approach. The idea behind the\neigen-subspace arises from the physical properties of antenna or scatterers,\nwhere only a few eigenmodes are enough to characterize the antenna or\nscatterer. Therefore, entire space eigenanalysis is a waste of computational\nresources, and eigen-subspace analysis with few modes is good enough to\ncharacterize antennas and scatterers. It has been assumed that there is an\neigen-subspace (or hyperplane) of coupled characteristic mode, which coincides\nwith the eigen-hyperplane of uncoupled characteristic mode. We can say the\ncoupled characteristic modes are linear combinations of isolated modes based on\nthis assumption. The linear combination is mapped via modal coupling matrix.\nUsing the modal coupling matrix, we can explain the behavior of arbitrarily\nshaped antennas and scatterers. A computationally efficient method is developed\nto compute coupled characteristic modes of two mutually coupled scatterers or\nantennas using the eigen-subspace. The method is summarized as a theorem of\ntwo-body coupled characteristic mode. The theorem of two-body coupled\ncharacteristic mode has been extended to the N-body coupled characteristic\nmode. Two algorithms have been developed for the two-body multimode coupled\ncharacteristic mode and N-body multimode coupled characteristic mode. Two\nnumerical examples are provided to validate the proposed concepts.",

NaF is capable of faithfully describing the interplay between\nelectronic and nuclear motion in a broad regime, which covers where the\nrelevant electronic states keep coupled in a wide range or all the time and\nwhere the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion is essential. NaF is\nderived from the exact generalized phase space formulation with\ncoordinate-momentum variables, where constraint phase space (CPS) is employed\nfor discrete electronic-state degrees of freedom. We propose efficient\nintegrators for the equations of motion of NaF in both adiabatic and diabatic\nrepresentations. Since the formalism in the CPS formulation is not unique, NaF\ncan in principle be implemented with various phase space representations of the\ntime correlation function (TCF) for the time-dependent property. They are\napplied to a suite of representative gas-phase and condensed-phase benchmark\nmodels where numerically exact results are available for comparison. It is\nshown that NaF is relatively insensitive to the phase space representation of\nthe electronic TCF and will be a potential tool for practical and reliable\nsimulations of the quantum mechanical behavior of both electronic and nuclear\ndynamics of nonadiabatic transition processes in real systems.",

While CBF-based controllers\noffer safety guarantees, they can compromise the performance of the system,\nleading to undesirable behaviors such as unbounded trajectories and emergence\nof locally stable spurious equilibria. Computing reachable sets for systems\nwith CBF-based controllers is an effective approach for runtime performance and\nstability verification, and can potentially serve as a tool for trajectory\nre-planning. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient interval\nreachability method for performance verification of systems with\noptimization-based controllers by: (i) approximating the optimization-based\ncontroller by a pre-trained neural network to avoid solving optimization\nproblems repeatedly, and (ii) using mixed monotone theory to construct an\nembedding system that leverages state-of-the-art neural network verification\nalgorithms for bounding the output of the neural network. Results in terms of\ncloseness of solutions of trajectories of the system with the\noptimization-based controller and the neural network are derived.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in training agile and\nadaptable controllers for legged robots, enabling them to learn complex\nlocomotion behaviors directly from experience. However, policies trained in\nsimulation often fail to transfer to real-world robots due to unrealistic\nassumptions such as infinite actuator bandwidth and the absence of torque\nlimits. These conditions allow policies to rely on abrupt, high-frequency\ntorque changes, which are infeasible for real actuators with finite bandwidth.\n  Traditional methods address this issue by penalizing aggressive motions\nthrough regularization rewards, such as joint velocities, accelerations, and\nenergy consumption, but they require extensive hyperparameter tuning.\nAlternatively, Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP) enforce finite bandwidth\naction control by penalizing policy gradients, but their reliance on gradient\ncalculations introduces significant GPU memory overhead. To overcome this\nlimitation, this work proposes Spectral Normalization (SN) as an efficient\nreplacement for enforcing Lipschitz continuity. By constraining the spectral\nnorm of network weights, SN effectively limits high-frequency policy\nfluctuations while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Experimental\nevaluations in both simulation and real-world humanoid robot show that SN\nachieves performance comparable to gradient penalty methods while enabling more\nefficient parallel training.",

The molecular axis distribution is influenced by the interacting\npulses and is intrinsically linked to the electronic coherences of the excited\nmolecules. However, in typical theoretical calculations of such interactions,\nthe signal is either calculated for a single molecule in the molecular frame or\naveraged over all possible molecular orientations to compare with the\nexperiment. This averaging leads to the loss of information about anisotropy in\nthe molecular-axis distribution, which could significantly affect the measured\nexperimental signal. Here, we calculate the laboratory frame transient\nelectronic first-order polarization ($P^{(1)}$) spectra in terms of separated\nmolecular frame and laboratory frame quantities.

The\napproach is based on monitoring the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB)\noperator of each scanned part estimated using finite element methods (FEM). The\nspectrum of the LB operator is an intrinsic summary of the geometry of a part,\nindependent of the ambient space. Hence, registration of scanned parts is\nunnecessary when comparing them.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a framework (CATCH-FORM-3D) for the precise contact\nforce control and surface deformation regulation in viscoelastic material\nmanipulation. A partial differential equation (PDE) is proposed to model the\nspatiotemporal stress-strain dynamics, integrating 3D Kelvin-Voigt\n(stiffness-damping) and Maxwell (diffusion) effects to capture the material's\nviscoelastic behavior. Key mechanical parameters (stiffness, damping, diffusion\ncoefficients) are estimated in real time via a PDE-driven observer. This\nobserver fuses visual-tactile sensor data and experimentally validated forces\nto generate rich regressor signals. Then, an inner-outer loop control structure\nis built up. In the outer loop, the reference deformation is updated by a novel\nadmittance control law, a proportional-derivative (PD) feedback law with\ncontact force measurements, ensuring that the system responds adaptively to\nexternal interactions. In the inner loop, a reaction-diffusion PDE for the\ndeformation tracking error is formulated and then exponentially stabilized by\nconforming the contact surface to analytical geometric configurations (i.e.,\ndefining Dirichlet boundary conditions). This dual-loop architecture enables\nthe effective deformation regulation in dynamic contact environments.\nExperiments using a PaXini robotic hand demonstrate sub-millimeter deformation\naccuracy and stable force tracking. The framework advances compliant robotic\ninteractions in applications like industrial assembly, polymer shaping,\nsurgical treatment, and household service.",

Specifically, compared with some\nprevious shift vector-based methods, MimIC more strictly approximates the shift\neffects by integrating lightweight learnable modules into LMMs with four key\nenhancements: 1) inserting shift vectors after attention layers, 2) assigning a\nshift vector to each attention head, 3) making shift magnitude query-dependent,\nand 4) employing a layer-wise alignment loss. Extensive experiments on two LMMs\n(Idefics-9b and Idefics2-8b-base) across three multimodal tasks (VQAv2, OK-VQA,\nCaptioning) demonstrate that MimIC outperforms existing shift vector-based\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Understanding quantum materials at the atomic scale requires precise 3D\ncharacterization of atomic positions and crystal defects. However, resolving\nthe 3D structure of light-element materials (Z <= 8) remains a major challenge\ndue to their low contrast and beam damage in electron microscopy. Here, we\ndemonstrate ptychographic atomic electron tomography (pAET), achieving\nsub-angstrom 3D atomic precision (11 pm) in light elements, marking the\nfirst-ever experimental realization of 3D atomic imaging for light-element\nmaterials. Using twisted bilayer graphene as a model system, we determine the\n3D atomic coordinates of individual carbon atoms, revealing chiral lattice\ndistortions driven by van der Waals interactions that exhibit meron-like and\nskyrmion-like structures. These findings provide direct insights into the\ninterplay between 3D chiral lattice deformation and electronic properties in\nmoire materials. Beyond TBG, pAET offers a transformative approach for 3D\natomic-scale imaging across quantum materials, 2D heterostructures, functional\noxides, and energy materials.",

Observationally, voids are identified within the\nlarge scale distribution of galaxies and are therefore sensitive to certain\nfeatures of the galaxy-halo connection. This sensitivity makes the combination\nof void and galaxy summary statistics particularly powerful probes of both\ncosmology and the galaxy-halo connection through self-calibration of the\nvoid-galaxy relation. In particular the combination of void and galaxy summary\nstatistics breaks degeneracies in the galaxy-halo connection and cosmology\nrelative to the case of galaxy clustering alone.

In related\napplications, Bayesian factor models have been popular; these approaches\nexpress the covariance as low rank plus diagonal and can infer the number of\nfactors adaptively. However, they have the disadvantage of shrinking towards a\ndiagonal covariance, often under estimating important covariation patterns in\nthe data. Alternatively, the dimensionality problem is addressed by collapsing\nthe detailed exposure data within chemical classes, potentially obscuring\nimportant information. We apply a covariance meta regression extension of\nBayesian factor analysis, which improves performance by including information\nfrom features summarizing properties of the different exposures. This approach\nenables shrinkage to more flexible covariance structures, reducing the\nover-shrinkage problem, as we illustrate in the TESIE data using various\nchemical features as meta covariates.",

Under mild\nassumptions, our algorithm achieves a regret of $O(KT \\log T)$, which is nearly\noptimal in terms of its dependence on the time horizon. The algorithm is simple\nto implement and computationally efficient.

    "abstract": "Gradient acoustic metasurfaces have shown strong potential for manipulation\nof acoustic waves across the audible and ultrasonic frequency ranges. The key\nchallenge in designing acoustic metasurfaces is to create a series of\nsub-wavelength unit cells that match the desired phase response. The most\ncommonly used geometry is a series of Helmholtz resonators, side-coupled to a\nnarrow channel. Despite the existence of a closed-form solution for 3\nside-coupled resonators, most reported designs instead make use of 4 or more\nresonators, which require opaque, optimization-based design approaches. We show\nthat the limiting factor in designs based on side-coupled resonators is the\nrequirement to use elements with a positive imaginary part of impedance, which\nimplies a Helmholtz resonator operating above its fundamental resonance -\ncontradicting the requirement for sub-wavelength volume. We show that by\nreplacing some of the Helmholtz resonators with meander-line elements, the\nrequired impedance values can readily be realized within a sub-wavelength\nvolume. The metasurface design approach is demonstrated for a lens operating at\n3 kHz and verified numerically. Furthermore, incorporating meander-line\nelements leads to improved broadband focusing performance, even when no\nexplicit dispersion engineering is included in the design. As this design\nincludes narrow channels, we include the effects of thermo-viscous losses in\nour modeling, and confirm that our design still gives superior performance to\nthe reference design using only Helmholtz resonators. Our design is expected to\nlead to more optimal performance of acoustic metasurface designs, and the\nability to make use of a closed-form design formula is expected to facilitate\nthe analysis of fundamental performance bounds and enable more explicit\nachromatic design processes.",

A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user\nneeds, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding\nuser intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks.

Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the\nintent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the\nnecessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most\napplications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and\nrobots.

The images\ngenerated by these detectors are extremely sparse, as the energy values\ndetected by most of the detector are equal to 0, meaning that despite their\nhigh resolution, most of the detector is unused in a particular interaction.\nInstead of representing all of the empty detections, the interaction is usually\nstored as a sparse matrix, a list of detection locations paired with their\nenergy values. Traditional machine learning methods that have been applied to\nparticle reconstruction such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), however,\ncannot operate over data stored in this way and therefore must have the matrix\nfully instantiated as a dense matrix. Operating on dense matrices requires a\nlot of memory and computation time, in contrast to directly operating on the\nsparse matrix. We propose a machine learning model using a point set neural\nnetwork that operates over a sparse matrix, greatly improving both processing\nspeed and accuracy over methods that instantiate the dense matrix, as well as\nover other methods that operate over sparse matrices.
