    "abstract": "Reasoning is a critical frontier for advancing medical image analysis, where\ntransparency and trustworthiness play a central role in both clinician trust\nand regulatory approval. Although Medical Visual Language Models (VLMs) show\npromise for radiological tasks, most existing VLMs merely produce final answers\nwithout revealing the underlying reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce\nMedVLM-R1, a medical VLM that explicitly generates natural language reasoning\nto enhance transparency and trustworthiness. Instead of relying on supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), which often suffers from overfitting to training\ndistributions and fails to foster genuine reasoning, MedVLM-R1 employs a\nreinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the model to discover\nhuman-interpretable reasoning paths without using any reasoning references.\nDespite limited training data (600 visual question answering samples) and model\nparameters (2B), MedVLM-R1 boosts accuracy from 55.11% to 78.22% across MRI,\nCT, and X-ray benchmarks, outperforming larger models trained on over a million\nsamples. It also demonstrates robust domain generalization under\nout-of-distribution tasks. By unifying medical image analysis with explicit\nreasoning, MedVLM-R1 marks a pivotal step toward trustworthy and interpretable\nAI in clinical practice.

A total of 19974 proper motion vectors with uncertainty\n$<10$\\,mas\\,yr$^{-1}$ located over the majority of the Crab Nebula are used to\nmap the supernova remnant's two-dimensional expansion properties that reflect\nthe dynamics of the original explosion, acceleration of ejecta imparted by\nspin-down energy from the pulsar, and interaction between the ejecta and\nsurrounding cicumstellar material (CSM). The average convergence date we derive\nis 1105.5 $\\pm$ 0.5 CE, which is 15-35 yr earlier compared to most previous\nestimates. We find that it varies as a function of position angle around the\nnebula, with the earliest date and smallest proper motions measured along the\nequator defined by the east and west bays. The lower acceleration of material\nalong the equatorial plane may be indicative of the supernova's interaction\nwith a disk-like CSM geometry. Comparing our measurements to previous\nanalytical solutions of the Crab's expansion and our own numerical simulation\nusing the moving mesh hydrodynamics code \\texttt{Sprout}, we conclude that the\nejecta have relaxed closer to homologous expansion than expected for the\ncommonly adopted pulsar spindown age of $\\tau \\sim 700$ yr and a pulsar wind\nnebula (PWN) still evolving inside the flat part of the ejecta density profile.\nThese findings provide further evidence that the PWN has broken out of the\ninner flat part of the supernova ejecta density profile and has experienced\n``blowout''.",

Traditional models targeting a\nsingle task often focus on specific business metrics, neglecting the\ncomprehensive user behavior, and thus limiting their effectiveness. To develop\nmore generalized user representations, some existing work adopts Multi-task\nLearning (MTL)approaches. But they all face the challenges of optimization\nimbalance and inefficiency in adapting to new tasks. Continual Learning (CL),\nwhich allows models to learn new tasks incrementally and independently, has\nemerged as a solution to MTL's limitations.

    "abstract": "The properties of amorphous solid water at and near the calorimetric glass\ntransition temperature, $T_{g}$, of 136 K have been debated for years. One\nhypothesis is that water turns into a \"true\" liquid at $T_{g}$ (i.e., it\nbecomes ergodic) and exhibits all the characteristics of an ergodic liquid,\nincluding translational diffusion. A competing hypothesis is that only\nrotational motion becomes active at $T_{g}$, while the \"real\" glass transition\nin water is at a considerably higher temperature. To address this dispute, we\nhave investigated the diffusive mixing in nanoscale water films, with\nthicknesses up to ~100 nm, using infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The experiments\nused films that were composed of at least 90% $H_{2}O$ with $D_{2}O$ making up\nthe balance and were conducted in conditions where H/D exchange was essentially\neliminated. Because the IR spectra of multilayer $D_{2}O$ films (e.g.,\nthicknesses of ~3 - 6 nm) embedded within thick $H_{2}O$ films are distinct\nfrom the spectrum of isolated $D_{2}O$ molecules within $H_{2}O$, the diffusive\nmixing of (initially) isotopically layered water films could be followed as a\nfunction of annealing time and temperature. The results show that water films\nwith total thicknesses ranging from ~20 to 100 nm diffusively mixed prior to\ncrystallization for temperatures between 120 and 144 K. The translational\ndiffusion had an Arrhenius temperature dependence with an activation energy of\n40.8 kJ/mol, which indicates that water at and near $T_{g}$ is a strong liquid.\nThe measured diffusion coefficient at 136 K is 6.25 x 10$^{-21} m^{2}/s$.",

A dataset comprising 327 patients who underwent\nthree-phase CTU (mean $\\pm$ SD age, 63 $\\pm$ 15 years; 174 males, 153 females)\nwas curated for deep learning model development. The three phases for each\npatient were aligned with an affine registration algorithm. A custom deep\nlearning model coined dsSNICT (diffusion model with a Swin transformer for\nsynthetic nephrographic phase images in CT) was developed and implemented to\nsynthesize the nephrographic images. Performance was assessed using Peak\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Mean Absolute\nError (MAE), and Fr\\'{e}chet Video Distance (FVD). Qualitative evaluation by\ntwo fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists was performed. Results: The\nsynthetic nephrographic images generated by our proposed approach achieved high\nPSNR (26.3 $\\pm$ 4.4 dB), SSIM (0.84 $\\pm$ 0.069), MAE (12.74 $\\pm$ 5.22 HU),\nand FVD (1323). Two radiologists provided average scores of 3.5 for real images\nand 3.4 for synthetic images (P-value = 0.5) on a Likert scale of 1-5,\nindicating that our synthetic images closely resemble real images. Conclusion:\nThe proposed approach effectively synthesizes high-quality 3D nephrographic\nphase images.

    "abstract": "Triple difference designs have become increasingly popular in empirical\neconomics. The advantage of a triple difference design is that, within a\ntreatment group, it allows for another subgroup of the population --\npotentially less impacted by the treatment -- to serve as a control for the\nsubgroup of interest. While literature on difference-in-differences has\ndiscussed heterogeneity in treatment effects between treated and control groups\nor over time, little attention has been given to the implications of\nheterogeneity in treatment effects between subgroups. In this paper, I show\nthat the parameter identified under the usual triple difference assumptions\ndoes not allow for causal interpretation of differences between subgroups when\nsubgroups may differ in their underlying (unobserved) treatment effects.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a residential heating system with renewable and\nnon-renewable heat generation and different consumption units and investigate a\nstochastic optimal control problem for its cost-optimal management. As a\nspecial feature, the heating system is equipped with a geothermal storage that\nenables the intertemporal transfer of thermal energy by storing surplus heat\nfor later use. In addition to the numerous technical challenges, economic\nissues such as cost-optimal control also play a central role in the design and\noperation of such systems. The latter leads to challenging mathematical\noptimization problems, as the response of the storage to charging and\ndischarging decisions depends on the spatial temperature distribution in the\nstorage. We take into account uncertainties regarding randomly fluctuating heat\ngeneration from renewable energies and the environmental conditions that\ndetermine heat demand and supply. The dynamics of the multidimensional\ncontrolled state processes is governed by a partial, a random ordinary and two\nstochastic differential equations. We first apply a spatial discretization to\nthe partial differential equation and use model reduction techniques to reduce\nthe dimension of the associated system of ordinary differential equations.\nFinally, a time-discretization leads to a Markov decision process for which we\napply a state discretization to determine approximations of the cost-optimal\ncontrol and the associated value function.",

We\nparticularly focus on the representative task of self-correction, where models\nautonomously detect errors in their responses, revise outputs, and decide when\nto terminate iterative refinement loops. To enable this, we propose a\ntwo-staged algorithmic framework for constructing self-rewarding reasoning\nmodels using only self-generated data. In the first stage, we employ sequential\nrejection sampling to synthesize long chain-of-thought trajectories that\nincorporate both self-rewarding and self-correction mechanisms. Fine-tuning\nmodels on these curated data allows them to learn the patterns of\nself-rewarding and self-correction. In the second stage, we further enhance the\nmodels' ability to assess response accuracy and refine outputs through\nreinforcement learning with rule-based signals.

The problem of detecting hate speech\nis intrinsically multifaceted due to cultural, linguistic, and contextual\ncomplexities and adversarial manipulations. In this study, we systematically\ninvestigate the performance of LLMs on detecting hate speech across\nmultilingual datasets and diverse geographic contexts. Our work presents a new\nevaluation framework in three dimensions: binary classification of hate speech,\ngeography-aware contextual detection, and robustness to adversarially generated\ntext. Using a dataset of 1,000 comments from five diverse regions, we evaluate\nthree state-of-the-art LLMs: Llama2 (13b), Codellama (7b), and DeepSeekCoder\n(6.7b). Codellama had the best binary classification recall with 70.6% and an\nF1-score of 52.18%, whereas DeepSeekCoder had the best performance in\ngeographic sensitivity, correctly detecting 63 out of 265 locations. The tests\nfor adversarial robustness also showed significant weaknesses; Llama2\nmisclassified 62.5% of manipulated samples.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we apply quantum machine learning (QML) to predict the stock\nprices of multiple assets using a contextual quantum neural network. Our\napproach captures recent trends to predict future stock price distributions,\nmoving beyond traditional models that focus on entire historical data,\nenhancing adaptability and precision. Utilizing the principles of quantum\nsuperposition, we introduce a new training technique called the quantum batch\ngradient update (QBGU), which accelerates the standard stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) in quantum applications and improves convergence. Consequently,\nwe propose a quantum multi-task learning (QMTL) architecture, specifically, the\nshare-and-specify ansatz, that integrates task-specific operators controlled by\nquantum labels, enabling the simultaneous and efficient training of multiple\nassets on the same quantum circuit as well as enabling efficient portfolio\nrepresentation with logarithmic overhead in the number of qubits. This\narchitecture represents the first of its kind in quantum finance, offering\nsuperior predictive power and computational efficiency for multi-asset stock\nprice forecasting. Through extensive experimentation on S\\&P 500 data for\nApple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon stocks, we demonstrate that our approach\nnot only outperforms quantum single-task learning (QSTL) models but also\neffectively captures inter-asset correlations, leading to enhanced prediction\naccuracy.

This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of\nmodel compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and\nhardware acceleration strategies for ViTs.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of structural failure modes under seismic excitations is\nessential for seismic risk and resilience assessment. Traditional\nsimulation-based approaches often result in imbalanced datasets dominated by\nnon-failure or frequently observed failure scenarios, limiting the\neffectiveness in machine learning-based prediction. To address this challenge,\nthis study proposes a framework for constructing balanced datasets that include\ndistinct failure modes. The framework consists of three key steps. First,\ncritical ground motion features (GMFs) are identified to effectively represent\nground motion time histories. Second, an adaptive algorithm is employed to\nestimate the probability densities of various failure domains in the space of\ncritical GMFs and structural parameters. Third, samples generated from these\nprobability densities are transformed into ground motion time histories by\nusing a scaling factor optimization process. A balanced dataset is constructed\nby performing nonlinear response history analyses on structural systems with\nparameters matching the generated samples, subjected to corresponding\ntransformed ground motion time histories. Deep neural network models are\ntrained on balanced and imbalanced datasets to highlight the importance of\ndataset balancing. To further evaluate the framework's applicability, numerical\ninvestigations are conducted using two different structural models subjected to\nrecorded and synthetic ground motions. The results demonstrate the framework's\nrobustness and effectiveness in addressing dataset imbalance and improving\nmachine learning performance in seismic failure mode prediction.",

In response,\nsignificant observational efforts have shifted toward emission spectroscopy as\na potentially more robust alternative, exemplified by initiatives such as the\n500-hour JWST Rocky Worlds Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) program.\nHowever, the extent to which emission spectroscopy may be affected by stellar\neffects remains mostly unexplored, in stark contrast with the\nextensiveexploration and mitigation work for transmission spectroscopy. In this\nstudy, we assess the impact of imperfect knowledge of stellar spectra on\nexoplanet atmospheric retrievals from emission spectroscopy. At 12.8 um, none\nof the considered bare surface types-basalt, ultramafic, Fe-oxidized, and\ngranitoid-can be reliably distinguished when accounting for the 3 sigma model\nprecision between SPHINX and PHOENIX. At 15.0 um, only the granitoid surface is\ndistinguishable from all others above this threshold. These results show that\nstellar model uncertainty alone substantially limits our ability to constrain\nsurface composition from photometric data, even before including other sources\nof uncertainty such as stellar radius. Also, we find that current 15 um eclipse\ndepth estimations using different stellar models introduce a 60 ppm difference\nfor M8 and 20 ppm for M5 stars. This model discrepancy leads to a degeneracy in\nretrieved planetary albedos and weakens constraints on the presence of an\natmosphere. We therefore recommend that future JWST secondary eclipse\nobservations systematically include stellar mid-infrared spectroscopy to\nmitigate these uncertainties.",

Determining the rigidity of\ninteresting explicit families of matrices remains a major open problem, and is\ncentral to understanding the complexities of these matrices in many different\nmodels of computation and communication. We focus in this paper on the\nWalsh-Hadamard transform and on the `distance matrix', whose rows and columns\ncorrespond to binary vectors, and whose entries calculate whether the row and\ncolumn are close in Hamming distance. Our results also generalize to other\nKronecker powers and `Majority powers' of fixed matrices. We prove two new\nresults about such matrices.\n  First, we prove new rigidity lower bounds in the low-rank regime where $r <\n\\log N$. For instance, we prove that over any finite field, there are constants\n$c_1, c_2 > 0$ such that the $N \\times N$ Walsh-Hadamard matrix $H_n$ satisfies\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{H_n}(c_1 \\log N) \\geq N^2 \\left( \\frac12 - N^{-c_2} \\right),$$\nand a similar lower bound for the other aforementioned matrices. This is tight,\nand is the new best rigidity lower bound for an explicit matrix family at this\nrank; the previous best was $\\mathcal{R}(c_1 \\log N) \\geq c_3 N^2$ for a small\nconstant $c_3>0$.\n  Second, we give new hardness amplification results, showing that rigidity\nlower bounds for these matrices for slightly higher rank would imply\nbreakthrough rigidity lower bounds for much higher rank. For instance, if one\ncould prove $$\\mathcal{R}_{H_n}(\\log^{1 + \\varepsilon} N) \\geq N^2 \\left(\n\\frac12 - N^{-1/2^{(\\log \\log N)^{o(1)}}} \\right)$$ over any finite field for\nsome $\\varepsilon>0$, this would imply that $H_n$ is Razborov rigid, giving a\nbreakthrough lower bound in communication complexity.",

In the underdamped regime, the energy\ninjected by odd forces can counteract dissipation due to friction, leading to\nquasi-dissipation-free excitations with finite frequency and wavelength. In the\nresulting non-equilibrium steady state, the system exhibits angular momentum\nand velocity correlations. When the strength of the odd forces exceeds a\ncertain threshold or friction is too low, a crystal with only harmonic springs\nbecomes linearly unstable due to transverse fluctuations. This instability can\nbe mitigated by introducing nonlinear central interactions, which suppress the\ndivergence of short-wavelength velocity fluctuations and allows us to\nnumerically explore the linearly unstable regime. This is characterized by\npronounced temporal oscillations in the velocity featuring the existence of\nvortex structures and kinetic temperature values larger than the thermal\ntemperature.",

Inexactness stems from low-rank\ncompression, enabling efficient representation of high-dimensional vectors in a\nlow-rank tensor format. A primary challenge in these methods is that standard\noperations, such as matrix-vector products and linear combinations, increase\ntensor rank, necessitating rank truncation and hence approximation. The Lanczos\nmethod constructs an approximate orthonormal Krylov basis, which is often\ndifficult to represent accurately using low-rank tensor formats, even when the\neigenvectors themselves exhibit low-rank structure. In contrast, the low-rank\npolynomial-filtered subspace iteration uses approximate eigenvectors (Ritz\nvectors) directly as a subspace basis, bypassing the need for an orthonormal\nKrylov basis. Our analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that inexact\nsubspace iteration is much more robust to rank-truncation errors compared to\nthe inexact Lanczos method. We further demonstrate that rank-truncated subspace\niteration can converge for problems where the density matrix renormalization\ngroup method (DMRG) stagnates.",

    "abstract": "Many quantum many-body wavefunctions, such as Jastrow-Slater, tensor network,\nand neural quantum states, are studied with the variational Monte Carlo\ntechnique, where stochastic optimization is usually performed to obtain a\nfaithful approximation to the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian. While\nfirst-order gradient descent methods are commonly used for such optimizations,\nquasi-second-order optimization formulations offer the potential of faster\nconvergence under certain theoretical conditions, but with a similar cost per\nsample to first-order methods. However, the relative performance of first-order\nand second-order optimizers is influenced in practice by many factors,\nincluding the sampling requirements for a faithful optimization step, the\ninfluence of wavefunction quality, as well as the wavefunction parametrization\nand expressivity. Here we analyze these performance characteristics of\nfirst-order and quasi-second-order optimization methods for a variety of\nHamiltonians, with the additional context of understanding the scaling of these\nmethods (for good performance) as a function of system size. Our findings help\nclarify the role of first-order and quasi-second-order methods in variational\nMonte Carlo calculations and the conditions under which they should\nrespectively be used. In particular, we find that unlike in deterministic\noptimization, where closeness to the variational minimum determines the\nsuitability of second-order methods, in stochastic optimization the main factor\nis the overall expressivity of the wavefunction: quasi-second-order methods\nlead to an overall reduction in cost relative to first-order methods when the\nwavefunction is sufficiently expressive to represent the ground-state, even\nwhen starting far away from the ground state. This makes quasi-second-order\nmethods an important technique when used with wavefunctions with arbitrarily\nimprovable accuracy.",

To do so, we generated random sequences based on\ncloned fragments, embedded the fragments into a retrieval augmented generation\n(RAG) database to group them by similarity, then fine-tuned large language\nmodel (LLM) prompts to predict whether a novel sequence could bind SERCA.

    "abstract": "We present a novel form of scalable knowledge representation about agents in\na simulated democracy, e-polis, where real users respond to social challenges\nassociated with democratic institutions, structured as Smart Spatial Types, a\nnew type of Smart Building that changes architectural form according to the\nphilosophical doctrine of a visitor. At the end of the game players vote on the\nSmart City that results from their collective choices. Our approach uses\ndeductive systems in an unusual way: by integrating a model of democracy with a\nmodel of a Smart City we are able to prove quality aspects of the simulated\ndemocracy in different urban and social settings, while adding ease and\nflexibility to the development. Second, we can infer and reason with abstract\nknowledge, which is a limitation of the Unity platform; third, our system\nenables real-time decision-making and adaptation of the game flow based on the\nplayer's abstract state, paving the road to explainability. Scalability is\nachieved by maintaining a dual-layer knowledge representation mechanism for\nreasoning about the simulated democracy that functions in a similar way to a\ntwo-level cache. The lower layer knows about the current state of the game by\ncontinually processing a high rate of events produced by the in-built physics\nengine of the Unity platform, e.g., it knows of the position of a player in\nspace, in terms of his coordinates x,y,z as well as their choices for each\nchallenge. The higher layer knows of easily-retrievable, user-defined abstract\nknowledge about current and historical states, e.g., it knows of the political\ndoctrine of a Smart Spatial Type, a player's philosophical doctrine, and the\ncollective philosophical doctrine of a community players with respect to\ncurrent social issues.",

This study explores an alternative approach by\nleveraging clothing identification, specifically focusing on African\ntraditional attire, which carries culturally significant and gender-specific\nfeatures.\n  We use the AFRIFASHION1600 dataset, a curated collection of 1,600 images of\nAfrican traditional clothing labeled into two gender classes: male and female.\nA deep learning model, based on a modified VGG16 architecture and trained using\ntransfer learning, was developed for classification. Data augmentation was\napplied to address the challenges posed by the relatively small dataset and to\nmitigate overfitting. The model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test set,\ndemonstrating strong predictive capability despite dataset imbalances favoring\nfemale samples.\n  These findings highlight the potential of clothing-based identification as a\ncomplementary technique to facial recognition for gender classification in\nAfrican contexts.

To identify\nthe reasons for this issue, eight human experts analyze 170 multi-agent\ndiscussions suffering from problem drift.

    "abstract": "Since the recent discovery of the directly imaged super-Jovian planet AF Lep\nb, several studies have been conducted to characterize its atmosphere and\nconstrain its orbital parameters. AF Lep b has a measured dynamical mass of\n$3.68 \\pm 0.48$ MJup, a radius of $1.3 \\pm 0.15$ RJup, a nearly circular orbit\nin spin-orbit alignment with the host star, a relatively high metallicity, and\na near-solar to super-solar C/O ratio. However, key parameters such as the\nrotational velocity and radial velocity could not be estimated as they require\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic data that is impossible to obtain with classical\nspectrographs. AF Lep b was recently observed with the new HiRISE visitor\ninstrument at the VLT, with the goal of obtaining high-resolution (R~140,000)\nspectroscopic observations to better constrain the orbital and atmospheric\nparameters of the young giant exoplanet. We compare the extracted spectrum of\nAF Lep b to self-consistent atmospheric models using ForMoSA. We then use our\nmeasurements of the radial velocity of the planet to provide new constraints on\nthe orbit of the planet. From the forward modeling, we find a C/O ratio that\naligns with previous low-resolution analyses, and we confirm the super-solar\nmetallicity. We also confirm unambiguously the presence of methane in the\natmosphere of the companion. Based on all available relative astrometry and\nradial velocity measurements of the host star, we show that two distinct\norbital populations are possible for the companion. We derive the radial\nvelocity of AF Lep b to be $10.51 \\pm 1.03$ km/s, and show that this value\nagrees well with one of the two orbital solutions, allowing us to rule out an\nentire family of orbits. Additionally, assuming that the rotation and orbit are\ncoplanar, the derived planet's rotation rate is consistent with the observed\ntrend of increasing spin velocity with higher planet mass.",

    "abstract": "The goal of causal discovery is to learn a directed acyclic graph from data.\nOne of the most well-known methods for this problem is Greedy Equivalence\nSearch (GES). GES searches for the graph by incrementally and greedily adding\nor removing edges to maximize a model selection criterion. It has strong\ntheoretical guarantees on infinite data but can fail in practice on finite\ndata. In this paper, we first identify some of the causes of GES's failure,\nfinding that it can get blocked in local optima, especially in denser graphs.\nWe then propose eXtremely Greedy Equivalent Search (XGES), which involves a new\nheuristic to improve the search strategy of GES while retaining its theoretical\nguarantees. In particular, XGES favors deleting edges early in the search over\ninserting edges, which reduces the possibility of the search ending in local\noptima. A further contribution of this work is an efficient algorithmic\nformulation of XGES (and GES). We benchmark XGES on simulated datasets with\nknown ground truth. We find that XGES consistently outperforms GES in\nrecovering the correct graphs, and it is 10 times faster. XGES implementations\nin Python and C++ are available at https://github.com/ANazaret/XGES.",

Traditional calibration methods, e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC), that yield a probability density function for the parameters being\ncalibrated, are often computationally expensive. When applied to ABMs which are\nhighly parametrized, the calibration process becomes computationally\ninfeasible. This paper investigates the utility of Stein Variational Inference\n(SVI) as an alternative calibration technique for stochastic epidemiological\nABMs approximated by Gaussian process (GP) surrogates. SVI leverages gradient\ninformation to iteratively update a set of particles in the space of parameters\nbeing calibrated, offering potential advantages in scalability and efficiency\nfor high-dimensional ABMs. The ensemble of particles yields a joint probability\ndensity function for the parameters and serves as the calibration. We compare\nthe performance of SVI and MCMC in calibrating CityCOVID, a stochastic\nepidemiological ABM, focusing on predictive accuracy and calibration\neffectiveness. Our results demonstrate that SVI maintains predictive accuracy\nand calibration effectiveness comparable to MCMC, making it a viable\nalternative for complex epidemiological models. We also present the practical\nchallenges of using a gradient-based calibration such as SVI which include\ncareful tuning of hyperparameters and monitoring of the particle dynamics.",

Both ground motion datasets are calibrated to a shared response\nspectrum, ensuring consistency in spectral characteristics, including spectral\nmedian, variance, and correlation structure. The analysis incorporates both\naleatory uncertainties from ground motion variability and epistemic\nuncertainties associated with structural parameters, providing a comprehensive\ncomparison of seismic responses.

To advance this\nconcept, CoCal introduces a hierarchical formulation of dictionary components\nthat aligns with the semantic hierarchy.

In comparison,\nthe YOLOv11 series was led by YOLO11x, which achieved the highest precision at\n0.857, recall at 0.85, and mAP@50 at 0.91. For the YOLOv10 series, YOLOv10b and\nYOLOv10l both achieved the highest precision at 0.85, with YOLOv10n achieving\nthe highest recall at 0.8 and mAP@50 at 0.89. These findings demonstrated that\nYOLOv12, when trained on realistic LLM-generated datasets surpassed its\npredecessors in key performance metrics. The technique also offered a\ncost-effective solution by reducing the need for extensive manual data\ncollection in the agricultural field. In addition, this study compared the\ncomputational efficiency of all versions of YOLOv12, v11 and v10, where\nYOLOv11n reported the lowest inference time at 4.7 ms, compared to YOLOv12n's\n5.6 ms and YOLOv10n's 5.9 ms. Although YOLOv12 is new and more accurate than\nYOLOv11, and YOLOv10, YOLO11n still stays the fastest YOLO model among YOLOv10,\nYOLOv11 and YOLOv12 series of models.

To prevent abuse,\nthese providers apply filters to block fine-tuning on overtly harmful data. In\nthis setting, we make three contributions: First, while past work has shown\nthat safety alignment is \"shallow\", we correspondingly demonstrate that\nexisting fine-tuning attacks are shallow -- attacks target only the first\nseveral tokens of the model response, and consequently can be blocked by\ngenerating the first several response tokens with an aligned model. Second, we\nconceptually illustrate how to make attacks deeper by introducing a new\nfine-tuning attack that trains models to first refuse harmful requests before\nanswering them; this \"refuse-then-comply\" strategy bypasses shallow defenses\nand produces harmful responses that evade output filters. Third, we demonstrate\nthe potency of our new fine-tuning attack by jailbreaking both open-source\nmodels equipped with defenses and production models, achieving attack success\nrates of 57% and 72% against GPT-4o and Claude Haiku, respectively. Our attack\nreceived a $2000 bug bounty from OpenAI and was acknowledged as a vulnerability\nby Anthropic.

Using\nphoton asymmetry ($A_{\\text{phot}}$) to quantify X-ray morphologies, we find\nevidence that the four most dynamically disturbed clusters are likely to be\nmergers. Employing a luminosity cut of $7.6\\times10^{42}$ erg/s to identify AGN\nin the 0.7-7.0 keV, we show that the majority of these clusters host excess AGN\ncompared to the local field. We use the cumulative number-count ($\\log N-\\log\nS$) model to predict AGN incidence in cluster isophotes under this luminosity\ncut. Our analysis finds evidence (at $> 2\\sigma$) of a positive correlation\nbetween AGN surface densities and photon asymmetry, suggesting that a disturbed\ncluster environment plays a pivotal role in regulating AGN triggering. Studying\nAGN incidence in cluster X-ray isophotes equivalent in area to $1.0r_{500}$, we\nfind that the AGN space density inversely scales with cluster mass as $\\sim\nM^{-0.5^{+0.18}_{-0.18}}$ at the 3.18$\\sigma$ level. Finally, when we\nseparately explore the cluster mass dependence of excess AGN surface density in\ndisturbed and relaxed clusters, we see tentative evidence that the two\nmorphologically distinct sub-populations exhibit diverging trends, especially\nnear the outskirts, likely due to cluster merger-driven AGN\ntriggering/suppression.",

In phase-II we send a second\nprobe beam through the sample and detect single photons scattered into the\nsignal mode.

Even\nthough steady progress has been made, existing quantum optimization techniques\nremain asymptotically and practically inefficient and are unable to offer\nguarantees on the quality of the optimization. Because many global quantum\ncircuit optimization problems belong to the complexity class QMA (the quantum\nanalog of NP), it is not clear whether quality and efficiency guarantees can\nboth be achieved.\n  In this paper, we present optimization techniques for quantum programs that\ncan offer both efficiency and quality guarantees. Rather than requiring global\noptimality, our approach relies on a form of local optimality that requires\neach and every segment of the circuit to be optimal. We show that the local\noptimality notion can be attained by a cut-and-meld circuit optimization\nalgorithm. The idea behind the algorithm is to cut a circuit into subcircuits,\noptimize each subcircuit independently by using a specified \"oracle\" optimizer,\nand meld the subcircuits by optimizing across the cuts lazily as needed. We\nspecify the algorithm and prove that it ensures local optimality. To prove\nefficiency, we show that, under some assumptions, the main optimization phase\nof the algorithm requires a linear number of calls to the oracle optimizer. We\nimplement and evaluate the local-optimality approach to circuit optimization\nand compare with the state-of-the-art optimizers. The empirical results show\nthat our cut-and-meld algorithm can outperform existing optimizers\nsignificantly, by more than an order of magnitude on average, while also\nslightly improving optimization quality. These results show that local\noptimality can be a relatively strong optimization criterion and can be\nattained efficiently.",

However, key aspects such as intercalated phase structure\nand intercalation mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we investigate\nchanges in morphology, chemistry, and electronic structure for both buffer\nlayer and monolayer graphene grown on SiC(0001) following Pt deposition and\nannealing cycles, which eventually led to Pt intercalation at temperatures\nabove 500{\\deg}C. Atomic-resolution imaging of the buffer layer reveals a\nsingle intercalated Pt layer that removes the periodic corrugation of the\nbuffer layer, arising from partial bonding of C-atoms with Si-atoms of the\nsubstrate. In monolayer graphene, the Pt-intercalated regions exhibit a\ntwo-level structure: the first level corresponds to a Pt layer intercalated\nbelow the buffer layer, while the second level contains a second Pt layer,\ngiving rise to a $(12\\times12)$ superstructure relative to graphene. Upon\nintercalation, Pt atoms appear as silicides, indicating a reaction with Si\natoms from the substrate. Additionally, charge neutral $\\pi$-bands\ncorresponding to quasi-free-standing monolayer and bilayer graphene emerge.\nAnalysis of multiple samples, coupled with a temperature-dependent study of the\nintercalation rate, demonstrates the pivotal role of buffer layer regions in\nfacilitating the Pt intercalation in monolayer graphene. These findings provide\nvaluable insight into Pt intercalation, advancing the potential for\napplications.",

This leads to\ntwo complementary notions of derivatives for a quantity of interest $J(G)$\ndepending on a region $G \\subset \\partial \\Omega$: on the one hand, we\nelaborate on the boundary variation method of Hadamard for evaluating the\nsensitivity of $J(G)$ with respect to ``small'' perturbations of the boundary\nof $G$ within $\\partial \\Omega$. On the other hand, we use techniques from\nasymptotic analysis to appraise the sensitivity of $J(G)$ with respect to the\naddition of a new connected component to the region $G$, shaped as a ``small''\nsurface disk. The calculation of both types of derivatives raises original\ndifficulties, which are carefully detailed in a simple mathematical setting\nbased on the conductivity equation. We notably propose formal arguments to\ncalculate our derivatives with a minimum amount of technicality, and show how\nthey can be generalized to handle more intricate problems, arising for instance\nin the contexts of acoustics and structural mechanics, respectively governed by\nthe Helmholtz and linear elasticity equations. In numerical applications, our\nderivatives are incorporated into a recent algorithmic framework for tracking\narbitrarily dramatic motions of a region $G$ within a fixed ambient surface,\nwhich combines the level set method with remeshing techniques to offer a clear,\nbody-fitted discretization of the evolving region. Finally, various 3d\nnumerical examples are presented to illustrate the salient features of our\nanalysis.",

This model incorporates three modes of\nfeedback: negative (preventing excessive cooling), positive (enhancing star\nformation), and hot gas ejection (expelling gas beyond the virial radius of\nhalos). These modes operate in a coordinated manner: the negative mode\nregulates the cooling process, the positive mode promotes bursts of star\nformation, and the hot gas ejection mode expels gas beyond the virial radius\nwhen the AGN is sufficiently powerful. Our updated semi-analytic model,\n\\texttt{FEGA25}, retains the qualitative and quantitative consistency of the\nanalyses presented in \\cite{contini2024d}, while delivering more robust\nresults. Notably, \\texttt{FEGA25} provides a more detailed characterization of\nthe fraction of passive galaxies as a function of stellar mass and redshift,\npredicts a main sequence of star-forming galaxies more consistent with\nobservations and a more accurate cosmic star formation rate density with\nredshift. Moreover, it estimates the fraction of hot gas in halos closer to\nobserved values. These findings underscore the importance of a physical\nmechanism capable of ejecting hot gas beyond the virialized region of dark\nmatter halos without significantly altering the stellar and cold gas\ncomponents. Such a mechanism is crucial to ensure the proper functioning of\nother processes, such as cooling and star formation. Since supernova feedback\nis already modeled at its maximum efficiency, AGN feedback emerges as the\nnatural candidate for this role.",

    "abstract": "In the coming years, surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of\nSpace and Time (LSST) are expected to increase the number of observed Tidal\nDisruption Events (TDEs) substantially. We employ Monte Carlo integration to\ncalculate the unlensed and lensed TDE rate as a function of limiting magnitude\nin $u$, $g$, $r$, and $i$-bands. We investigate the impact of multiple\nluminosity models, black hole mass functions (BHMFs), and flare temperatures on\nthe TDE rate. Notably, this includes a semi-analytical model, which enables the\ndetermination of the TDE temperature in terms of black hole (BH) mass. We\npredict the highest unlensed TDE rate to be in $g$-band. It ranges from $16$ to\n$5,440\\;\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\\;(20,000\\;\\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$ for the Zwicky\nTransient Facility, being more consistent with the observed rate at the low\nend. For LSST, we expect a rate in $g$-band between $3,580$ and\n$82,060\\;\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\\;(20,000\\;\\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$. A higher theoretical\nprediction is understandable, as we do not consider observational effects such\nas completeness. The unlensed and lensed TDE rates are insensitive to the\nredshift evolution of the BHMF, even for LSST limiting magnitudes. The best\nband for detecting lensed TDEs is also $g$-band. Its predicted rates range from\n$0.43$ to $15\\;\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\\;(20,000\\;\\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$ for LSST. The\nscatter of predicted rates reduces when we consider the fraction of lensed\nTDEs; that is, a few in ten thousand TDEs will be lensed. Despite the large\nscatter in the rates of lensed TDEs, our comprehensive considerations of\nmultiple models suggest that lensed TDEs will occur in the $10$-year LSST\nlifetime, providing an exciting prospect for detecting such events. We expect\nthe median redshift of a lensed TDE to be between $1.5$ and $2$. In this paper,\nwe additionally report on lensed TDE properties, such as the BH mass and time\ndelays.",

Detailed particle observations from the Solar\nProbe Cup (SPC) have primarily focused on examining the proton population in\nthe solar wind. However, several periods throughout the Parker mission have\nindicated that SPC has observed a pronounced and distinctive population of\nfully ionized helium, He$^{2+}$. Minor ions are imprinted with properties of\nthe solar wind's source region, as well as mechanisms active during outflow,\nmaking them sensitive markers of its origin and formation at the Sun. Through a\ndetailed analysis of the He$^{2+}$ velocity distributions functions, this work\nexamines periods where significant and persistent He$^{2+}$ peaks are observed\nwith SPC. We compute the helium abundance and examine the stream's bulk speed,\ndensity, temperature, magnetic field topology, and electron strahl properties\nto identify distinctive solar wind features that can provide insight to their\nsolar source. We find that nearly all periods exhibit an elevated mean helium\ncomposition ($8.34\\%$) compared to typical solar wind and a majority\n($\\sim87\\%$) of these periods are connected to coronal mass ejections, with the\nhighest abundance reaching $23.1\\%$. The helium abundance and number of events\nincreases as the solar cycle approaches maximum with a weak dependence on\nspeed. Additionally, the events not associated with a CME are clustered near\nthe heliospheric current sheet suggesting they are connected to streamer belt\noutflows. However, there are currently no theoretical explanations that fully\ndescribe the range of depleted and elevated helium abundances observed.",

Unlike conventional studies, which typically\nassume fermionic dark matter (DM), we explore the phenomenological implications\nof scalar DM within this ALP portal framework. A key challenge arises from the\nfact that the interaction between the ALP spacetime derivative and the spin-one\ncurrent of the scalar DM can be a redundant operator, which may be removed via\na field redefinition. However, this interaction reveals a profound connection\nto the underlying global symmetry that stabilizes the DM particle. We choose a\nnon-Abelian discrete symmetry, ensuring the persistence of the DM-ALP\ninteractions, and in doing so, unveil a rich phenomenology. Working within a\ngeneral effective field theory approach, we identify the following hallmark\nfeatures of our scenario: (i) a relic density determined by semi-annihilations,\nwith an abundance independent of ALP couplings to the visible sector; (ii)\ndirect detection rates naturally suppressed; (iii) indirect detection spectra\nenriched relative to pure annihilation scenarios, with rates also independent\nof ALP couplings to visible particles.

To\nenhance the signal-to-noise ratio of H$_2$ emission features in the rest-frame\nwavelength range of 155-191 nm, we stack JWST/NIRSpec spectra from\n$z=7.0-13.4$. These stacked spectra also exhibit atomic emission features, such\nas CIV emission with a P-Cygni profile, as well as CIII], OIII], and HeII. The\npresence of these features and the slightly blue-shifted fluorescent H$_2$\nlines suggest active multiphase atomic and molecular outflows may be common at\nthese redshifts. Our results suggest that it is possible to search for FUV\nfluorescent H$_2$ lines in high redshift galaxies using JWST, which would\nenable the characterization of interstellar radiation fields, densities, and\ntemperatures in extreme photodissociation environments.",

In the\nadiabatic regime, the product of half-light radius and average velocity\ndispersion is conserved.

Our findings challenge two common assumptions: (1) clusters in some\nUDGs may be younger than generally assumed, and thus more luminous than\nstandard globular clusters (GCs), affecting GC counts and the derived GC\nluminosity function in these UDGs, and (2) quiescent UDGs can be rotationally\nsupported, making kinematic measurements viewing-angle dependent in such cases.\nThe Disco Ball, while unremarkable in mass, size, projected structural\nproperties, or color, reveals surprising complexity, highlighting the need for\ndetailed studies of more UDGs.",

We focus on link complements which\ncan be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show\nthat the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is\ncontrolled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus,\nthe entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a\nfunction of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is\nembedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some\nbackground that leads to Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger state (GHZ)-like\nentanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic\nmonodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link\ncomponent produces a separable state. These results generalize to any three\ndimensional topological field theory with a dual chiral rational conformal\nfield theory.",

This increasing norm\nis especially detrimental for localized knowledge editing, where only a subset\nof matrices are updated in a model .

Such growth disrupts model\nbalance, particularly when isolated matrices are updated while the rest of the\nmodel remains static, leading to potential instability and degradation of\ndownstream performance. Upon deeper investigations of the intermediate\nactivation vectors, we find that the norm of internal activations decreases and\nis accompanied by shifts in the subspaces occupied by these activations, which\nshows that these activation vectors now occupy completely different regions in\nthe representation space compared to the unedited model.

We aim to verify whether it\nevolved into a PN without experiencing the third dredge-up (TDU) during the\nthermal pulse asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase and to investigate its origin\nand evolution through accurate measurements of the physical parameters of the\nnebula and its central star. We perform a comprehensive investigation of DdDm1\nusing multiwavelength spectra. The KOOLS-IFU emission line images achieve ~0.9\narcsec resolution, resolving the elliptical nebula and revealing a compact\nspatial distribution of the [Fe III] line compared to the [O III] line, despite\ntheir similar volume emissivities. This indicates that iron, with its higher\ncondensation temperature than oxygen, is easily incorporated into dust grains\nsuch as silicate, making the iron abundance estimate prone to underestimation.\nUsing a fully data-driven approach, we directly derive ten elemental\nabundances, the gas-to-dust mass ratio, and the gas and dust masses based on\nour own heliocentric distance scale (19.4 kpc) and the emitting volumes of gas\nand dust. Our analysis reveals that DdDm1 is a unique PN evolved from a single\nstar with an initial mass of ~1.0 Msun and a metallicity Z of 0.18 Zsun. Thus,\nDdDm1 is the only known PN that is confirmed to have evolved without\nexperiencing TDUs. The photoionization model reproduces all observed quantities\nin excellent agreement with predictions from AGB nucleosynthesis, post-AGB\nevolution, and AGB dust production models. Our study provides new insights into\nthe internal evolution of low-mass and metal-deficient stars like DdDm1 and\nhighlights the role of PN progenitors in the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy.",

    "abstract": "Despite its real-world significance, model performance on tabular data\nremains underexplored, leaving uncertainty about which model to rely on and\nwhich prompt configuration to adopt. To address this gap, we create ToRR, a\nbenchmark for Table Reasoning and Robustness, measuring model performance and\nrobustness on table-related tasks. The benchmark includes 10 datasets that\ncover different types of table reasoning capabilities across varied domains.\nToRR goes beyond model performance rankings, and is designed to reflect whether\nmodels can handle tabular data consistently and robustly, across a variety of\ncommon table representation formats. We present a leaderboard as well as\ncomprehensive analyses of the results of leading models over ToRR. Our results\nreveal a striking pattern of brittle model behavior, where even strong models\nare unable to perform robustly on tabular data tasks. Although no specific\ntable format leads to consistently better performance, we show that testing\nover multiple formats is crucial for reliably estimating model capabilities.\nMoreover, we show that the reliability boost from testing multiple prompts can\nbe equivalent to adding more test examples. Overall, our findings show that\ntable understanding and reasoning tasks remain a significant challenge.",

Video complaints,\nintegrating text and image content, offer invaluable insights by addressing\ncustomer grievances and delineating product benefits and drawbacks. However,\ncomprehending nuanced complaint aspects within vast daily multimodal financial\ndata remains a formidable challenge. Addressing this gap, we have curated a\nproprietary multimodal video complaint dataset comprising 433 publicly\naccessible instances. Each instance is meticulously annotated at the utterance\nlevel, encompassing five distinct categories of financial aspects and their\nassociated complaint labels. To support this endeavour, we introduce Solution\n3.0, a model designed for multimodal aspect-based complaint identification\ntask. Solution 3.0 is tailored to perform three key tasks: 1) handling\nmultimodal features ( audio and video), 2) facilitating multilabel aspect\nclassification, and 3) conducting multitasking for aspect classifications and\ncomplaint identification parallelly. Solution 3.0 utilizes a CLIP-based dual\nfrozen encoder with an integrated image segment encoder for global feature\nfusion, enhanced by contextual attention (ISEC) to improve accuracy and\nefficiency. Our proposed framework surpasses current multimodal baselines,\nexhibiting superior performance across nearly all metrics by opening new ways\nto strengthen appropriate customer care initiatives and effectively assisting\nindividuals in resolving their problems.",

    "abstract": "The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is the workhorse method to study excitons\nin materials. The size of the BSE Hamiltonian, that is how many valence to\nconduction band transitions are considered in those calculations, needs to be\nchosen to be sufficiently large to converge excitons' energies and\nwavefunctions but should be minimized to make calculations tractable, as BSE\ncalculations scale with the number of atoms as $ (N_{\\rm{atoms}}^6)$. In\nparticular, in the case of supercell (SC) calculations composed of\n$N_{\\rm{rep}}$ replicas of the primitive cell (PC), a natural choice to build\nthis BSE Hamiltonian is to include all transitions from PC calculations by zone\nfolding. However, this greatly increases the size of the BSE Hamiltonian, as\nthe number of matrix elements in it is $(N_k N_c N_v)^2$, where $N_k$ is the\nnumber of $k$-points, and $N_{c(v)}$ is the number of conduction (valence)\nstates. The number of $k$-points decreases by a factor $N_{\\rm{rep}}$ but both\nthe number of conduction and valence states increase by the same factor,\ntherefore the BSE Hamiltonian increases by a factor $N_{\\rm{rep}}^2$, making\nexactly corresponding calculations prohibitive. Here we provide an analysis to\ndecide how many transitions are necessary to achieve comparable results. With\nour method, we show that to converge with an energy tolerance of 0.1 eV the\nfirst exciton binding energy of a LiF SC composed of 64 PCs, we only need 12\\%\nof the valence to conduction transitions that are given by zone folding. We\nalso show that exciton energies are much harder to converge than Random Phase\nApproximation transition energies, underscoring the necessity of careful\nconvergence studies. The procedure in our work helps in evaluating excitonic\nproperties in large SC calculations such as defects, self-trapped excitons,\npolarons, and interfaces.",

To overcome this difficulty, there is\nincreasing interest in developing generative models that can synthesize missing\ntarget modality images from the available source ones. Therefore, our team,\nPLAVE, design a generative model for missing MRI that integrates multi-modal\ncontrastive learning with a focus on critical tumor regions. Specifically, we\nintegrate multi-modal contrastive learning, tailored for multiple source\nmodalities, and enhance its effectiveness by selecting features based on\nentropy during the contrastive learning process. Additionally, our network not\nonly generates the missing target modality images but also predicts\nsegmentation outputs, simultaneously.

By leveraging a combination of\ncontrastive, segmentation, and additional self-representation losses, our model\neffectively reflects target-specific information and generate high-quality\ntarget images.

Subsequently, we describe Hawking radiation as a\ntunneling process using the Painlev\\'e-Gullstrand metric representation,\nallowing the evaluation of divergent integrals via the residue method. This\napproach yields the particle creation density for bosonic modes. Next, we\nextend the analysis to fermions, obtaining the corresponding particle creation\ndensity. The black hole evaporation is then examined through the\nStefan-Boltzmann law, leading to an estimate of the black hole's lifetime. In\nthis context, we identify the presence of a remnant mass when the black hole\nreaches the final stage of its evaporation. Furthermore, we compute greybody\nfactors for bosons, taking into account scalar, vector, and tensorial\nperturbations. Finally, we determine the greybody factors for fermions as well.\nOverall, compared to the Schwarzschild case ($\\Theta = 0$), the presence of the\nnon-commutative parameter $\\Theta$ lowers the Hawking temperature and reduces\nthe particle creation density for both bosons and fermions, causing the\nevaporation process to proceed more slowly. Additionally, $\\Theta$ decreases\nthe magnitude of the greybody factors for bosons and fermions across all\nperturbations considered in this analysis.",

    "abstract": "Temporal networks, whose links are activated or deactivated over time, are\nused to represent complex systems such as social interactions or collaborations\noccurring at specific times. Such networks facilitate the spread of information\nand epidemics. The average number of nodes infected via a spreading process on\na network starting from a single seed node over a given period is called the\ninfluence of that node. In this paper, we address the question of how to\nutilize the partially observed temporal network (local and of short duration)\naround each node, to estimate the ranking of nodes in spreading influence on\nthe full network over a long period. This is essential for target marketing and\nepidemic/misinformation mitigation where only partial network information is\npossibly accessible. This would also enable us to understand which network\nproperties of a node, observed locally and shortly after the start of the\nspreading process, determine its influence. We systematically propose a set of\nnodal centrality metrics based on partial temporal network information,\nencoding diverse properties of (time-respecting) walks. It is found that\ndistinct centrality metrics perform the best in estimating nodal influence\ndepending on the infection probability of the spreading process. For a broad\nrange of the infection probability, a node tends to be influential if it can\nreach many distinct nodes via time-respecting walks and if these nodes can be\nreached early in time. We find and explain why the proposed metrics generally\noutperform classic centrality metrics derived from both full and partial\ntemporal networks.",

In this paper, we show that\nthe reason for this is that the Verilog standard is inconsistent both with\nVerilog practice and itself. We pinpoint a series of problems in the Verilog\nstandard that we have identified in how the standard defines the semantics of\nthe subset of Verilog used to describe hardware designs, that is, the\nsynthesisable subset of Verilog. We show how the most complete Verilog\nformalisation to date inherits these problems and how, after we repair these\nproblems in an executable implementation of the formalisation, the repaired\nimplementation can be used to execute real-world hardware designs. The existing\nformalisation together with the repairs hence constitute the first\nformalisation of Verilog's simulation semantics compatible with real-world\nhardware designs. Additionally, to make the results of this paper accessible to\na wider (nonmathematical) audience, we provide a visual formalisation of\nVerilog's simulation semantics.",

    "abstract": "Network alignment, which aims to find node correspondence across different\nnetworks, is the cornerstone of various downstream multi-network and Web mining\ntasks. Most of the embedding-based methods indirectly model cross-network node\nrelationships by contrasting positive and negative node pairs sampled from\nhand-crafted strategies, which are vulnerable to graph noises and lead to\npotential misalignment of nodes. Another line of work based on the optimal\ntransport (OT) theory directly models cross-network node relationships and\ngenerates noise-reduced alignments. However, OT methods heavily rely on fixed,\npre-defined cost functions that prohibit end-to-end training and are hard to\ngeneralize. In this paper, we aim to unify the embedding and OT-based methods\nin a mutually beneficial manner and propose a joint optimal transport and\nembedding framework for network alignment named JOENA. For one thing (OT for\nembedding), through a simple yet effective transformation, the noise-reduced OT\nmapping serves as an adaptive sampling strategy directly modeling all\ncross-network node pairs for robust embedding learning.For another (embedding\nfor OT), on top of the learned embeddings, the OT cost can be gradually trained\nin an end-to-end fashion, which further enhances the alignment quality. With a\nunified objective, the mutual benefits of both methods can be achieved by an\nalternating optimization schema with guaranteed convergence. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world networks validate the effectiveness and scalability\nof JOENA, achieving up to 16% improvement in MRR and 20x speedup compared with\nthe state-of-the-art alignment methods.",

Second, a lightweight training\nstrategy that pre-trains audio-language alignment on the state-of-the-art\nvision-language model Qwen2.5-VL, thus avoiding the costly pre-training of\nvision-specific modalities. Third, an audio synthesis pipeline that generates\nhigh-quality audio-text data from diverse real-world scenarios, supporting\napplications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech-to-Speech chat. To\nthis end, we introduce an industry-level omni-modal LLM, Nexus. Extensive\nexperiments validate the efficacy of our pipeline, yielding the following key\nfindings:(1) In the visual understanding task, Nexus exhibits superior\nperformance compared with its backbone model - Qwen2.5-VL-7B, validating the\nefficiency of our training strategy.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which preceded 3DGS, are based on a\nprincipled ray-marching approach for volumetric rendering. In contrast, while\nsharing a similar image formation model with NeRF, 3DGS uses a hybrid rendering\nsolution that builds on the strengths of volume rendering and primitive\nrasterization. A crucial benefit of 3DGS is its performance, achieved through a\nset of approximations, in many cases with respect to volumetric rendering\ntheory. A naturally arising question is whether replacing these approximations\nwith more principled volumetric rendering solutions can improve the quality of\n3DGS. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the various\napproximations and assumptions used by the original 3DGS solution. We\ndemonstrate that, while more accurate volumetric rendering can help for low\nnumbers of primitives, the power of efficient optimization and the large number\nof Gaussians allows 3DGS to outperform volumetric rendering despite its\napproximations.",

The competition on a platform\nis captured by a value and a cost function, mapping bidding strategies to value\nand cost respectively. We assume a diminishing returns property, whereby the\nmarginal cost is increasing in value. The advertiser uses an autobidder that\nselects a bidding strategy for each platform, aiming to maximize total value\nsubject to budget and return-on-spend constraint. The advertiser has no prior\ninformation and learns about the value and cost functions by querying a\nplatform with a specific bidding strategy. Our goal is to design algorithms\nthat find the optimal bidding strategy with a small number of queries.\n  We first present an algorithm that requires \\(O(m \\log (mn) \\log n)\\)\nqueries, where $m$ is the number of platforms and $n$ is the number of possible\nbidding strategies in each platform. Moreover, we adopt the learning-augmented\nframework and propose an algorithm that utilizes a (possibly erroneous)\nprediction of the optimal bidding strategy. We provide a $O(m \\log (m\\eta) \\log\n\\eta)$ query-complexity bound on our algorithm as a function of the prediction\nerror $\\eta$.

    "abstract": "Corporate fraud detection aims to automatically recognize companies that\nconduct wrongful activities such as fraudulent financial statements or illegal\ninsider trading. Previous learning-based methods fail to effectively integrate\nrich interactions in the company network. To close this gap, we collect 18-year\nfinancial records in China to form three graph datasets with fraud labels. We\nanalyze the characteristics of the financial graphs, highlighting two\npronounced issues: (1) information overload: the dominance of (noisy)\nnon-company nodes over company nodes hinders the message-passing process in\nGraph Convolution Networks (GCN); and (2) hidden fraud: there exists a large\npercentage of possible undetected violations in the collected data. The hidden\nfraud problem will introduce noisy labels in the training dataset and\ncompromise fraud detection results. To handle such challenges, we propose a\nnovel graph-based method, namely, Knowledge-enhanced GCN with Robust Two-stage\nLearning (${\\rm KeGCN}_{R}$), which leverages Knowledge Graph Embeddings to\nmitigate the information overload and effectively learns rich representations.\nThe proposed model adopts a two-stage learning method to enhance robustness\nagainst hidden frauds. Extensive experimental results not only confirm the\nimportance of interactions but also show the superiority of ${\\rm KeGCN}_{R}$\nover a number of strong baselines in terms of fraud detection effectiveness and\nrobustness.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient, $D$, for ultrasound\npropagating in a multiple scattering medium, such as a dense granular\nsuspension, can be measured using a time reversal experiment. This requires an\nunprecedented experimental setup in which a piezoelectric transducer, acting as\na Time-Reversal Mirror (TRM), is embedded within the granular suspension at a\ndepth much larger than the scattering mean free path, while an array of\ntransducers is placed in the far field of the scattering sample. A single\nelement of the array emits a short pulse and the TRM records the resulting\nultrasonic field, which consists of a ballistic coherent wave followed by a\ncoda wave. When the entire coda wave is time-reversed and re-emitted from the\nTRM, it is observed to refocus on the original source, with a focal spot size\nthat decreases with the inverse depth of the TRM, characteristic of a diffusive\nregime. Time-reversal of short windows selected at different times $t$ in the\ncoda wave reveals a focal spot size that decreases as the inverse square root\nof time, i.e., $1 / \\sqrt{Dt}$. By fitting the predictions of a microscopic\ndiffusion theory to our experimental data, we are able to accurately measure\nthe diffusion coefficient in the granular suspension. Remarkably, this method\ndoes not require ensemble averaging due to stability of time-reversal against\nstatistical fluctuations.",

To address this problem, many\ndeep learning-based methods, basically data-driven and data-free approaches,\nhave been developed to solve these problems. However, most data-driven methods\nrequire a large amount of data, which consumes significant computational\nresources and fails to utilize all the necessary information embedded\nunderlying the partial differential equations (PDEs). Moreover, data-free\napproaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) may not be that\nideal in practice, as traditional PINNs, which primarily rely on multilayer\nperceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), tend to overlook\nthe crucial temporal dependencies inherent in real-world physical systems. We\npropose a method denoted as \\textbf{PhysicsSolver} that merges the strengths of\ntwo approaches: data-free methods that can learn the intrinsic properties of\nphysical systems without using data, and data-driven methods, which are\neffective at making predictions.

This paper\ninvestigates algorithm performance for unstructured sparse matrices, which are\nmore common than ever because of the trend towards large-scale data collection.\nThe development of an SpMV multiplication algorithm for this type of data is\nhard due to two factors. First, parallel load balancing issues arise because of\nthe unpredictable nonzero structure. Secondly, SpMV multiplication algorithms\nare inevitably memory-bound because the sparsity causes a low arithmetic\nintensity. Three state-of-the-art algorithms for parallel SpMV multiplication\non shared-memory systems are discussed. Six new hybrid algorithms are developed\nwhich combine optimization techniques of the current algorithms. These\ntechniques include parallelization strategies, storage formats, and nonzero\norderings. A modern and high-performance implementation of all discussed\nalgorithms is provided as open-source software. Using this implementation the\nalgorithms are compared. Furthermore, SpMV multiplication algorithms require\nthe matrix to be stored in a specific storage format. Therefore, the conversion\ntime between these storage formats is also analyzed. Both tests are performed\nfor multiple unstructured sparse matrices on different machines: two multi-CPU\nand two single-CPU architectures. We show that one of the newly developed\nalgorithms outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 19% on one of the\nmulti-CPU architectures.

Unlike traditional\nlinear tests that administer a fixed set of pre-assembled items, CATs\nadaptively tailor the test to an examinee's latent trait level by selecting a\nsmaller subset of items based on their previous responses. Existing CAT\nframeworks predominantly rely on item response theory (IRT) models with a\nsingle latent variable, a choice driven by both conceptual simplicity and\ncomputational feasibility. However, many real-world item response datasets\nexhibit complex, multi-factor structures, limiting the applicability of CATs in\nbroader settings. In this work, we develop a novel CAT system that incorporates\nmultivariate latent traits, building on recent advances in Bayesian sparse\nmultivariate IRT. Our approach leverages direct sampling from the latent factor\nposterior distributions, significantly accelerating existing\ninformation-theoretic item selection criteria by eliminating the need for\ncomputationally intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.\nRecognizing the potential sub-optimality of existing item selection rules,\nwhich are often based on myopic one-step-lookahead optimization of some\ninformation-theoretic criterion, we propose a double deep Q-learning algorithm\nto learn an optimal item selection policy. Through simulation and real-data\nstudies, we demonstrate that our approach not only accelerates existing item\nselection methods but also highlights the potential of reinforcement learning\nin CATs.",

To alleviate the\nthreat, existing defense strategies primarily focus on fine-tuning the entire\nsuspicious model, yet offer only marginal resistance to state-of-the-art\nattacks and often result in a decrease in clean accuracy, particularly in\ndata-limited scenarios. Their failure may be attributed to the mismatch between\ninsufficient fine-tuning data and massive parameters in VLMs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Class-wise Backdoor Prompt Tuning (CBPT) defense, an\nefficient and effective method that operates on the text prompts to indirectly\npurify the poisoned VLMs. Specifically, we first employ the advanced\ncontrastive learning via our carefully crafted positive and negative samples,\nto effectively invert the backdoor triggers that are potentially adopted by the\nattacker. Once the dummy trigger is established, we utilize the efficient\nprompt tuning technique to optimize these class-wise text prompts for modifying\nthe model's decision boundary to further reclassify the feature regions of\nbackdoor triggers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CBPT significantly\nmitigates backdoor threats while preserving model utility, e.g. an average\nClean Accuracy (CA) of 58.86\\% and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 0.39\\%\nacross seven mainstream backdoor attacks.

In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing\nthe methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital\nmoment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes.",

    "abstract": "In the study of Ramanujan sums, the so-called regular $A$-function is a\nset-valued multiplicative function that tracks certain subsets of the divisor\nsets of natural numbers. McCarthy provided a generalization of the Ramanujan\nsum using these regular $A$-function based arithmetic convolutions. This\napproach has recently attracted considerable interest from several researchers.\nIn this paper, we extend McCarthy's generalization by introducing two regular\n$A$-functions corresponding to both parameters in the Ramanujan sum.\nFortunately, these sums exhibit several properties of the Ramanujan sums. We\nalso generalize the greatest common divisor (GCD) function and the Von Sterneck\nformula. Our introduction of two regular $A$-functions into these expressions\nenables us to explore a novel perspective on the connection between these\nexpressions and the order relation between the two regular $A$-functions. In\nparticular, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for\northogonality and Dedekind-H\\\"older's identity (i.e., Ramanujan sum = Von\nSterneck function) to hold. Our primary motivation for this further\ngeneralization proposed in this paper is expansions of arithmetic functions\nbased on arbitrary regular $A$-functions. To the best of our knowledge, the\nexpansions of arbitrary $A$-functions discussed here are new in the literature.",

That is not wise, because\nthe internal structures of these stars can be quite different from those on the\nMain Sequence, which is populated by stars whose structure is regular. Here I\nreport on pondering this matter, and point out two fundamental deviations from\nthe commonly adopted relation. There are aspects of the regular relation that\nare connected in a simple way to gross properties of the star, such as the\ndependence of the eigenfrequencies on the linear combination\n$n+\\textstyle{\\frac {1}{2}}l$ of the order $n$ and degree $l$, which is\ncharacteristic of a regular spherical acoustic cavity.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning has proven to be highly effective in teaching robots\ndexterous manipulation skills. However, it typically relies on large amounts of\nhuman demonstration data, which limits its scalability and applicability in\ndynamic, real-world environments. One key challenge in this context is object\ngeneralization, where a robot trained to perform a task with one object, such\nas \"hand over the apple,\" struggles to transfer its skills to a semantically\nsimilar but visually different object, such as \"hand over the peach.\" This gap\nin generalization to new objects beyond those in the same category has yet to\nbe adequately addressed in previous work on end-to-end visuomotor policy\nlearning. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for\nachieving object generalization through Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models,\nreferred to as \\textbf{ObjectVLA}. Our model enables robots to generalize\nlearned skills to novel objects without requiring explicit human demonstrations\nfor each new target object. By leveraging vision-language pair data, our method\nprovides a lightweight and scalable way to inject knowledge about the target\nobject, establishing an implicit link between the object and the desired\naction. We evaluate ObjectVLA on a real robotic platform, demonstrating its\nability to generalize across 100 novel objects with a 64\\% success rate in\nselecting objects not seen during training. Furthermore, we propose a more\naccessible method for enhancing object generalization in VLA models, using a\nsmartphone to capture a few images and fine-tune the pre-trained model. These\nresults highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enabling object-level\ngeneralization and reducing the need for extensive human demonstrations, paving\nthe way for more flexible and scalable robotic learning systems.",

Which features of the formal language impart an inductive\nbias that leads to effective transfer? Drawing on insights from linguistics and\ncomplexity theory, we hypothesize that effective transfer occurs when two\nconditions are met: the formal language should capture the dependency\nstructures present in natural language, and it should remain within the\ncomputational limitations of the model architecture. We experiment with\npre-pretraining (training on formal language before natural languages) on\ntransformers and find that formal languages capturing hierarchical dependencies\nindeed enable language models to achieve lower loss on natural language and\nbetter linguistic generalization compared to other formal languages. We also\nfind modest support for the hypothesis that the formal language should fall\nwithin the computational limitations of the architecture. Strikingly,\npre-pretraining reduces loss more efficiently than training on a matched amount\nof natural language. For a 1B-parameter language model trained on roughly 1.6B\ntokens of natural language, pre-pretraining achieves the same loss and better\nlinguistic generalization with a 33% smaller token budget.

Typically, the time series of such a detector\ncontains contributions from nonstationary noise. In order to reduce the\ninfluence of such noise we propose and demonstrate paired detectors: two\nnominally identical detectors whose signals are synchronously recorded. The\ncross-spectrum of the two individual beat time series is then analyzed for UDM\nsignatures. This approach permits us to suppress spurious signals appearing in\nuncorrelated fashion in either detector. We furthermore demonstrate detectors\nthat are based on a vibrational molecular transition, which are advantageous\ndue to their larger sensitivity to oscillations of the nuclear masses. The\nanalysis of 274 hours of data yielded improved bounds for the coupling\nconstants of UDM to nuclear mass and to electron mass in the frequency ranges\n10-500 Hz and 10-122 kHz, with improvement factors between 6 and 10.

    "abstract": "This thesis centers around the concept of Subset Search Problems (SSP), a\ntype of computational problem introduced by Gr\\\"une and Wulf to analyze the\ncomplexity of more intricate optimization problems. These problems are given an\ninput set, a so-called universe, and their solution lies within their own\nuniverse, e.g. the shortest path between two point is a subset of all possible\npaths. Due to this, reductions upholding the SSP property require an injective\nembedding from the universe of the first problem into that of the second. This,\nhowever, appears inherently similar to the concept of a Parsimonious reduction,\na reduction type requiring a bijective function between the solution spaces of\nthe two problems. Parsimonious reductions are mainly used within the complexity\nclass #P, as this class of problems concerns itself with the number of possible\nsolutions in a given problem. These two concepts, SSP and Parsimonious\nreductions, are inherently similar but, crucially, not equivalent. We therefore\nexplore the interplay between reductions upholding the SSP and Parsimonious\nproperties, highlighting both the similarities and differences by providing a\ncomprehensive theorem delineating the properties required for reductions to\nuphold both attributes. We also compile and evaluate 46 reductions between 30\nsubset search variants of computational problems, including those of classic\nNP-complete problems such as Satisfiability, Vertex Cover, Hamiltonian Cycle,\nthe Traveling Salesman Problem and Subset Sum, providing reduction proofs,\nillustrative examples and insights as to where the SSP and Parsimonious\nproperties coexist or diverge.

No known astrophysical\nmechanism can generate black holes of such low mass, leaving primordial black\nholes (PBHs)-potentially formed at the end of cosmic inflation-as the only\nviable candidates. Black holes with masses below 10^7 g have lifetimes shorter\nthan 10^-5 seconds, meaning PBHs in this mass range should have fully\nevaporated by now. However, recent studies suggest that quantum effects,\ncollectively referred to as the \"memory burden\", may slow down black hole\nevaporation, potentially extending the lifetimes of low-mass PBHs to timescales\ncomparable to or exceeding the Hubble time. We systematically explore the\nparameter space of memory-burdened PBHs, assuming that they constitute a\nfraction of the dark matter (f-PBH) within current constraints, and identify\nviable regions that could explain the KM3-230213A event.

By normalizing point density, we project LiDAR\npoint clouds into BEV images, thereby enabling efficient feature extraction and\nmatching. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature\nextractor is employed to extract distinctive local and global descriptors from\nthe BEV images. Local descriptors are used to match BEV images with FAST\nkeypoints for reprojection error construction, while global descriptors\nfacilitate loop closure detection. Reprojection error minimization is then\nintegrated with point-to-plane registration within an iterated Extended Kalman\nFilter (iEKF). In the back-end, global descriptors are used to create a\nKD-tree-indexed keyframe database for accurate loop closure detection. When a\nloop closure is detected, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) computes a coarse\ntransform from BEV image matching, which serves as the initial estimate for\nIterative Closest Point (ICP). The refined transform is subsequently\nincorporated into a factor graph along with odometry factors, improving the\nglobal consistency of localization.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end pipeline to\nsimultaneously refocus multiple arbitrary planar or volumetric regions of a\ndense or a sparse LF.

However,\nunlike other legged robots, exoskeletons face specific constraints on where\ndepth sensors can be mounted due to the presence of a human user. These\nconstraints lead to a limited Field Of View (FOV) and greater sensor motion,\nmaking odometry particularly challenging. To address this, we propose a novel\nodometry algorithm that integrates proprioceptive data from the exoskeleton\nwith point clouds from a depth camera to produce accurate elevation maps\ndespite these limitations. Our method builds on an extended Kalman filter (EKF)\nto fuse kinematic and inertial measurements, while incorporating a tailored\niterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to register new point clouds with the\nelevation map. Experimental validation with a leg exoskeleton demonstrates that\nour approach reduces drift and enhances the quality of elevation maps compared\nto a purely proprioceptive baseline, while also outperforming a more\ntraditional point cloud map-based variant.",

Effective tiered memory management is\nessential for optimizing system performance in such systems. However, designing\nan effective memory tiering system for CXL-extended heterogeneous memory faces\nchallenges: 1) Existing evaluation methods, such as NUMA-based emulation and\nfull-system simulations like GEM5, are limited in assessing hardware-based\ntiered memory management solutions and handling real-world workloads at scale.\n2) Previous memory tiering systems struggle to simultaneously achieve high\nresolution, low overhead, and high flexibility and compatibility.\n  In this study, we first introduce HeteroBox, a configurable emulation\nplatform that leverages real CXL-enabled FPGAs to emulate the performance of\nvarious CXL memory architectures. HeteroBox allows one to configure a memory\nspace with multiple regions, each exhibiting distinct CPU-access latency and\nbandwidth. HeteroBox helps assess the performance of both software-managed and\nhardware-managed memory tiering systems with high efficiency and fidelity.\nBased on HeteroBox, we further propose HeteroMem, a hardware-managed memory\ntiering system that operates on the device side.

In response to these limitations, current\nresearch has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and\nsolid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural\nnetworks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when\napplied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of\nground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger\ntraining set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable\nmodel for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce\na loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction\nAlignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the\npredicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting\ndifferences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing\nmodels to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies\nthan previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates\nself-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations.

Hedging and\nnon-affirmation are behaviours that express ambiguity or a lack of clear\nendorsement on specific statements. These behaviours are undesirable in certain\ncontexts, such as queries about whether different groups are entitled to\nspecific human rights; since all people are entitled to human rights. Here, we\npresent the first systematic attempt to measure these behaviours in the context\nof human rights, with a particular focus on between-group comparisons. To this\nend, we design a novel prompt set on human rights in the context of different\nnational or social identities. We develop metrics to capture hedging and\nnon-affirmation behaviours and then measure whether LLMs exhibit demographic\nparity when responding to the queries. We present results on three leading LLMs\nand find that all models exhibit some demographic disparities in how they\nattribute human rights between different identity groups. Futhermore, there is\nhigh correlation between different models in terms of how disparity is\ndistributed amongst identities, with identities that have high disparity in one\nmodel also facing high disparity in both the other models. While baseline rates\nof hedging and non-affirmation differ, these disparities are consistent across\nqueries that vary in ambiguity and they are robust across variations of the\nprecise query wording. Our findings highlight the need for work to explicitly\nalign LLMs to human rights principles, and to ensure that LLMs endorse the\nhuman rights of all groups equally.",

Early-phase\ntrials with randomized doses can facilitate additional investigation of the\nidentified OBD in targeted populations by incorporating safety, efficacy, and\nbiomarker data. To support dose comparison in such settings, we propose to\nextend the utility score-based approach (U-MET) and introduce the clinical\nutility index-based approach (CUI-MET) to account for multiple endpoints and\ndoses. The utility-based dose optimization approach for multiple-dose\nrandomized trial designs accounting for multiple endpoints and doses (U-MET-m)\nextends the U-MET, using a utility score to account for multiple endpoints\njointly (e.g., toxicity-efficacy trade-off), while the CUI-MET uses a utility\nindex to do this marginally. U-MET-m and CUI-MET use Bayesian inference within\na hypothesis framework to compare utility metrics across doses to identify the\nOBD. Here we describe simulation studies and present an example to compare the\nU-MET-m design, CUI-MET, and empirical design. The U-MET-m design and CUI-MET\nwere shown to have satisfactory operating characteristics for selecting the\nOBD.

A key parameter in\nage-structured epidemic models is the contact matrix, which defines the\ninteraction structure between age groups. However, accurately estimating\ncontact matrices is challenging, as different age groups respond differently to\nsurveys and are accessible through different channels. This variability\nintroduces significant epistemic uncertainty in epidemic models.\n  In this study, we introduce the Age Group Sensitivity Analysis (AGSA) method,\na novel framework for assessing the impact of age-structured contact patterns\non epidemic outcomes.

We show that while worst-case input sequences do exist, a necessary\ncondition for them to occur is that the girth of the graph released up to time\n$t$ be at most $4$.\n  Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a collection of real,\nincremental social networks of different sizes, which typically have low girth.\nEmpirical results are consistent with and typically better than our theoretical\nanalysis anticipates. This further supports the robustness of our theoretical\nfindings: forcing our algorithm into a worst-case behavior not only requires\ntopologies characterized by a low girth, but also carefully crafted input\nsequences that are unlikely to occur in practice.\n  Combined with standard sketching techniques, our lazy approach proves an\neffective and efficient tool to support key neighborhood queries on large,\nincremental graphs, including neighborhood size, Jaccard similarity between\nneighborhoods and, in general, functions of the union and/or intersection of\n$2$-hop neighborhoods.",

    "abstract": "Feature extraction is crucial in intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating\nmachinery. It is easier for convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to visually\nrecognize and learn fault features by converting the complicated\none-dimensional (1D) vibrational signals into two-dimensional (2D) images with\nsimple textures. However, the existing representation methods for encoding 1D\nsignals as images have two main problems, including complicated computation and\nlow separability. Meanwhile, the existing 2D-CNN fault diagnosis methods taking\n2D images as the only inputs still suffer from the inevitable information loss\nbecause of the conversion process. Considering the above issues, this paper\nproposes a new 1D-to-2D conversion method called Embedding Gramian\nRepresentation (EGR), which is easy to calculate and shows good separability.\nIn EGR, 1D signals are projected in the embedding space and the intrinsic\nperiodicity of vibrational signals is captured enabling the faulty\ncharacteristics contained in raw signals to be uncovered. Second, aiming at the\ninformation loss problem of existing CNN models with the single input of\nconverted images, a double-branch EGR-based CNN, called EGR-Net, is proposed to\nlearn faulty features from both raw signal feature maps and their corresponding\nEGRs. The bridge connection is designed to improve the feature learning\ninteraction between the two branches. Widely used open domain gearbox dataset\nand bearing dataset are used to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the\nproposed methods.

In this framework, participant agents, as social media\nusers, continuously evolve their language expression, while supervisory agents\nemulate platform-level regulation by assessing policy violations. To achieve a\nmore faithful simulation, we employ a dual design of language strategies\n(constraint and expression) to differentiate conflicting goals and utilize an\nLLM-driven GA (Genetic Algorithm) for the selection, mutation, and crossover of\nlanguage strategies. The framework is evaluated using two distinct scenarios:\nan abstract password game and a realistic simulated illegal pet trade scenario.\nExperimental results demonstrate that as the number of dialogue rounds\nincreases, both the number of uninterrupted dialogue turns and the accuracy of\ninformation transmission improve significantly. Furthermore, a user study with\n40 participants validates the real-world relevance of the generated dialogues\nand strategies. Moreover, ablation studies validate the importance of the GA,\nemphasizing its contribution to long-term adaptability and improved overall\nresults.",

It also\nexamines how these frameworks endeavour to measure creativity, semantic\ncoherence, and cultural relevance in AI-generated texts, whilst highlighting\nthe persistent challenges in replicating the nuance of human poetic expression.\n  The review contributes a Marketing Theory discussion that deconstructs the\nfigurative marketing narratives employed by AI companies, which utilise\nsanitised language and anthropomorphic metaphors to humanise their\ntechnologies. This discussion reveals the reductive nature of such narratives\nand underscores the tension between algorithmic precision and the realities of\nhuman creativity.The review also incorporates an auto-ethnographic account that\noffers a self-reflexive commentary on its own composition. By acknowledging the\nuse of AI in crafting this review, the auto-ethnographic account destabilises\nconventional notions of authorship and objectivity, resonating with\ndeconstruction and challenging logocentric assumptions in academic discourse.\n  Ultimately, the review calls for a re-evaluation of creative processes that\nrecognises the interdependence of technological innovation and human\nsubjectivity.

However, estimating these quantities remains an open\nproblem, particularly in the case of high-dimensional discrete distributions.\nCurrent approaches typically rely on embedding discrete data into a continuous\nspace and applying neural estimators originally designed for continuous\ndistributions, a process that may not fully capture the discrete nature of the\nunderlying data. We consider Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs), stochastic\nprocesses on discrete state-spaces which have gained popularity due to their\ngenerative modeling applications. In this work, we introduce INFO-SEDD, a novel\nmethod for estimating information-theoretic quantities of discrete data,\nincluding mutual information and entropy. Our approach requires the training of\na single parametric model, offering significant computational and memory\nadvantages. Additionally, it seamlessly integrates with pretrained networks,\nallowing for efficient reuse of pretrained generative models. To evaluate our\napproach, we construct a challenging synthetic benchmark. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that INFO-SEDD is robust and outperforms neural competitors that\nrely on embedding techniques. Moreover, we validate our method on a real-world\ntask: estimating the entropy of an Ising model. Overall, INFO-SEDD outperforms\ncompeting methods and shows scalability to high-dimensional scenarios, paving\nthe way for new applications where estimating MI between discrete distribution\nis the focus. The promising results in this complex, high-dimensional scenario\nhighlight INFO-SEDD as a powerful new estimator in the toolkit for\ninformation-theoretical analysis.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning has achieved remarkable success in the field\nof image restoration. However, most convolutional neural network-based methods\ntypically focus on a single scale, neglecting the incorporation of multi-scale\ninformation. In image restoration tasks, local features of an image are often\ninsufficient, necessitating the integration of global features to complement\nthem. Although recent neural network algorithms have made significant strides\nin feature extraction, many models do not explicitly model global features or\nconsider the relationship between global and local features. This paper\nproposes multi-level attention-guided graph neural network. The proposed\nnetwork explicitly constructs element block graphs and element graphs within\nfeature maps using multi-attention mechanisms to extract both local structural\nfeatures and global representation information of the image. Since the network\nstruggles to effectively extract global information during image degradation,\nthe structural information of local feature blocks can be used to correct and\nsupplement the global information. Similarly, when element block information in\nthe feature map is missing, it can be refined using global element\nrepresentation information. The graph within the network learns real-time\ndynamic connections through the multi-attention mechanism, and information is\npropagated and aggregated via graph convolution algorithms. By combining local\nelement block information and global element representation information from\nthe feature map, the algorithm can more effectively restore missing information\nin the image. Experimental results on several classic image restoration tasks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

Our findings indicate that the standard\ncross-validation method used in existing model training overestimates\nperformance by inadequately accounting for drift. This is primarily because\ntypical cross-validation techniques allow data instances to appear in both\ntraining and testing sets, thereby distorting the accuracy of the predictive\nevaluation. As a result, these models are unable to precisely predict future\ndrift effects, compromising their ability to generalize and adapt to evolving\ndata conditions. This paper presents two solutions: (1) a novel sensor drift\ncompensation learning paradigm for validating models, and (2) automated machine\nlearning (AutoML) techniques to enhance classification performance and\ncompensate sensor drift. By employing strategies such as data balancing,\nmeta-learning, automated ensemble learning, hyperparameter optimization,\nfeature selection, and boosting, our AutoML-DC (Drift Compensation) model\nsignificantly improves classification performance against sensor drift.\nAutoML-DC further adapts effectively to varying drift severities.",

To address the latter, low-cost\ntransmit/radiating architectures, e.g., based on reconfigurable intelligent\nsurfaces (RISs), have shown great potential. Beyond diagonal (BD) RIS is a\nnovel branch of RIS offering enhanced performance over traditional diagonal RIS\n(D-RIS) in wireless communications, but its potential gains in RF-WPT remain\nunexplored. Motivated by this, we analyze a BD-RIS-assisted single-antenna\nRF-WPT system to charge a single rectifier, and formulate a joint beamforming\nand multi-carrier waveform optimization problem aiming to maximize the\nharvested power. We propose two solutions relying on semi-definite programming\nfor fully connected BD-RIS and an efficient low-complexity iterative method\nrelying on successive convex approximation. Numerical results show that the\nproposed algorithms converge to a local optimum and that adding transmit\nsub-carriers or RIS elements improves the harvesting performance. We show that\nthe transmit power budget impacts the relative power allocation among different\nsub-carriers depending on the rectifier's operating regime, while BD-RIS shapes\nthe cascade channel differently for frequency-selective and flat scenarios.\nFinally, we verify by simulation that BD-RIS and D-RIS achieve the same\nperformance under pure far-field line-of-sight conditions (in the absence of\nmutual coupling).

A camera is utilized in the so-called eye-in-hand configuration\nto estimate directly the poses of a tool and a target object of interest (OOI).\nBased on the pose error between the tool and the target, along with\nmotion-based calibration between the camera and the robot, precise tool\npositioning can be reliably achieved using conventional robotic modeling and\ncontrol methods prevalent in the industry.

The methods seek to avert the inaccuracies resulting from\nrigid-body--based kinematics of structurally flexible HDLR manipulators via\nimage-based algorithms. To train deep neural networks for OOI pose estimation,\nonly synthetic data are utilized. The methods are validated in a real-world\nsetting using an HDLR manipulator with a 5 m reach. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that an image-based average tool positioning error of less than 2\nmm along the non-depth axes is achieved, which facilitates a new way to\nincrease the task flexibility and automation level of non-rigid HDLR\nmanipulators.",

    "abstract": "Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based blood pressure (BP) estimation represents a\npromising alternative to cuff-based BP measurements. Recently, an increasing\nnumber of deep learning models have been proposed to infer BP from the raw PPG\nwaveform. However, these models have been predominantly evaluated on\nin-distribution test sets, which immediately raises the question of the\ngeneralizability of these models to external datasets. To investigate this\nquestion, we trained five deep learning models on the recently released PulseDB\ndataset, provided in-distribution benchmarking results on this dataset, and\nthen assessed out-of-distribution performance on several external datasets. The\nbest model (XResNet1d101) achieved in-distribution MAEs of 9.4 and 6.0 mmHg for\nsystolic and diastolic BP respectively on PulseDB (with subject-specific\ncalibration), and 14.0 and 8.5 mmHg respectively without calibration.\nEquivalent MAEs on external test datasets without calibration ranged from 15.0\nto 25.1 mmHg (SBP) and 7.0 to 10.4 mmHg (DBP). Our results indicate that the\nperformance is strongly influenced by the differences in BP distributions\nbetween datasets.

Despite safeguards, these biases\noften persist in model behavior, potentially leading to representational harm\nin outputs. While sociolinguistic research provides valuable insights into the\nformation of stereotypes, NLP approaches for stereotype detection rarely draw\non this foundation and often lack objectivity, precision, and interpretability.\nTo fill this gap, in this work we propose a new approach that detects and\nquantifies the linguistic indicators of stereotypes in a sentence. We derive\nlinguistic indicators from the Social Category and Stereotype Communication\n(SCSC) framework which indicate strong social category formulation and\nstereotyping in language, and use them to build a categorization scheme. To\nautomate this approach, we instruct different LLMs using in-context learning to\napply the approach to a sentence, where the LLM examines the linguistic\nproperties and provides a basis for a fine-grained assessment. Based on an\nempirical evaluation of the importance of different linguistic indicators, we\nlearn a scoring function that measures the linguistic indicators of a\nstereotype. Our annotations of stereotyped sentences show that these indicators\nare present in these sentences and explain the strength of a stereotype. In\nterms of model performance, our results show that the models generally perform\nwell in detecting and classifying linguistic indicators of category labels used\nto denote a category, but sometimes struggle to correctly evaluate the\nassociated behaviors and characteristics.

In this work, we further investigate the strong lensing properties\nof the black hole, which form the basis of shadow formation, and employ\nobservational data from the Event Horizon Telescope to derive more precise\nconstraints on the scalar hair parameter. Additionally, we compute the shape\nand position of different lensed images of a thin accretion disk and argue that\nthe observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the\nemitting disk. Using this interpretation, we perform a new set of constraints\non the scalar hair. Furthermore, we discuss why higher-order images are not\nsuitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by\ntheir faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models\nsatisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities.",

Our analysis\nreveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling\nwhen the system size is odd.

Defect calculations of the relatively\nlow-mobility Ti show how it can influence the extent of Spinel ordering, domain\nmorphology and size significantly; leading to guidelines for engineering\nelectrochemical performance through changes in composition.",

In this\nresearch, we build upon the bias correction method using pulse injections for\nthe first CHIME/FRB catalog, to include correlations between properties, and to\nanalyze the FRB population spectrum. This model includes six FRB properties:\ndispersion measure (DM), pulse width, scattering timescale, spectral index,\nspectral running, and fluence. By applying the multidimensional weight function\ncalculated by the model, we update the corrected distributions, suggesting that\nmore low-DM, short and long-width, and short-scattering timescale events may\nexist. Using one-off events and the first bursts from repeaters, the derived\nintrinsic population spectrum has a best-fit power-law of\n$F(\\nu)\\propto\\nu^{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha=-2.29\\pm0.29$. This confirms\nprevious indications that FRBs are brighter or more numerous at low\nfrequencies.

    "abstract": "Dynamical maps are the principal subject of the open system theory. Formally,\nthe dynamical map of a given open quantum system is a density matrix\ntransformation that takes any initial state and sends it to the state at a\nlater time. Physically, it encapsulates the system's evolution due to coupling\nwith its environment. Hence, the theory provides a flexible and accurate\nframework for computing expectation values of open system observables. However,\nexpectation values -- or more generally, single-time correlation functions --\ncapture only the simplest aspects of a quantum system's dynamics. A complete\ncharacterization of the dynamics requires access to multi-time correlation\nfunctions as well: phenomena like detailed balance, linear and non-linear\nresponse, non-equilibrium transport in general, or even sequential measurements\nof system observables are all described in terms of multi-time correlations.\nFor closed systems, such correlations are well-defined, even though knowledge\nof the system's state alone is insufficient to determine them fully. In\ncontrast, the standard dynamical map formalism for open systems does not\naccount for multi-time correlations, as it is fundamentally limited to\ndescribing state evolution. Here, we extend the scope of open quantum system\ntheory by developing a systematic perturbation theory for computing multi-time\ncorrelation functions.",

This study focuses on Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the initial\nstage of a water droplet impact onto a highly conducting heated surface, below\nthe saturation temperature of the liquid. The maximum spreading diameters at\ndifferent impact velocities in the presence of a heated surface, are analysed.\nFree Surface 3D (FS3D), an in-house code developed at the Institute of\nAerospace Thermodynamics, University of Stuttgart, is used for this work. A\ngrid independence study investigates the resolution required to resolve the\nflow field around the droplet. As evaporation effects during the initial stage\nof the droplet impact process are negligible, they are ignored.

Both the scaling limit and efficiency were improved by using the\nhybrid (MPI with OpenMP) parallelisation, while the red-black scheme\noptimization raised the efficiency only.

So far, it has been largely\nunknown how decision-making influences different tasks.

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce SCA3D, a novel 3D shape and caption online data augmentation method\nfor cross-modal 3D retrieval. Our approach uses the LLaVA model to create a\ncomponent library, captioning each segmented part of every 3D shape within the\ndataset.

We employ both inter and intra distances to\nalign various components into a new 3D shape, ensuring that the components do\nnot overlap and are closely fitted. Further, text templates are utilized to\nprocess the captions of each component and generate new text descriptions.\nBesides, we use unimodal encoders to extract embeddings for 3D shapes and texts\nbased on the enriched dataset. We then calculate fine-grained cross-modal\nsimilarity using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and enhance cross-modal matching\nwith contrastive learning, enabling bidirectional retrieval between texts and\n3D shapes.

With the proliferation of NeRF-based\ncreations, the need for copyright protection has emerged as a critical issue.\nAlthough some approaches have been proposed to embed digital watermarks into\nNeRF, they often neglect essential model-level considerations and incur\nsubstantial time overheads, resulting in reduced imperceptibility and\nrobustness, along with user inconvenience. In this paper, we extend the\nprevious criteria for image watermarking to the model level and propose NeRF\nSignature, a novel watermarking method for NeRF. We employ a Codebook-aided\nSignature Embedding (CSE) that does not alter the model structure, thereby\nmaintaining imperceptibility and enhancing robustness at the model level.\nFurthermore, after optimization, any desired signatures can be embedded through\nthe CSE, and no fine-tuning is required when NeRF owners want to use new binary\nsignatures. Then, we introduce a joint pose-patch encryption watermarking\nstrategy to hide signatures into patches rendered from a specific viewpoint for\nhigher robustness. In addition, we explore a Complexity-Aware Key Selection\n(CAKS) scheme to embed signatures in high visual complexity patches to enhance\nimperceptibility. The experimental results demonstrate that our method\noutperforms other baseline methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness.\nThe source code is available at: https://github.com/luo-ziyuan/NeRF_Signature.",

First, in an offline stage, we appropriately sample the\nLaplace parameter and solve the collection of problems using the finite element\nmethod. Next, we apply a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to this\ncollection of solutions in order to obtain a reduced basis that is of dimension\nmuch smaller than that of the original solution space. This reduced basis, in\nturn, is then used to solve the evolution problem using any suitable\ntime-stepping method. A key insight to justify the formulation of the method\nresorts to Hardy spaces of analytic functions. By applying the widely-known\nPaley-Wiener theorem we can then define an isometry between the solution of the\ntime-dependent problem and its Laplace transform. As a consequence of this\nresult, one may conclude that computing a POD with samples taken in the Laplace\ndomain produces an exponentially accurate reduced basis for the time-dependent\nproblem. Numerical experiments characterizing the performance of the method, in\nterms of accuracy and speed-up, are included for a variety of relevant\ntime-evolution equations.",

This paradigm\nposes considerable privacy risks as it necessitates broad data availability\nacross organizational boundaries and frequent data transmission between\nentities, potentially exposing proprietary information to unauthorized access\nor interception during storage and transfer.

Instead of gathering raw reaction data, CKIF learns\nretrosynthesis models through iterative, chemical knowledge-informed\naggregation of model parameters.

    "abstract": "Language model outputs are not always reliable, thus prompting research into\nhow to adapt model responses based on uncertainty. Common approaches include:\n\\emph{abstention}, where models refrain from generating responses when\nuncertain; and \\emph{linguistic calibration}, where models hedge their\nstatements using uncertainty quantifiers. However, abstention can withhold\nvaluable information, while linguistically calibrated responses are often\nchallenging to leverage in downstream tasks. We propose a unified view,\nConformal Linguistic Calibration (CLC), which reinterprets linguistic\ncalibration as \\emph{answer set prediction}. First we present a framework\nconnecting abstention and linguistic calibration through the lens of linguistic\npragmatics. We then describe an implementation of CLC that allows for\ncontrolling the level of imprecision in model responses. Results demonstrate\nour method produces calibrated outputs with conformal guarantees on factual\naccuracy. Further, our approach enables fine-tuning models to perform\nuncertainty-aware adaptive claim rewriting, offering a controllable balance\nbetween factuality and specificity.",

Recently, the\nemergence of foundation models has brought visual and textual semantic prior\nknowledge. Many methods are based on foundation models (FM) to improve the\naccuracy of detection, but at the same time, increase model complexity and slow\ndown inference speed.

Correlation of spectral indices between remote\nand in-situ energy spectra presents the possibility of a common source\nacceleration region within the corona, however the properties and location of\nthis region are not well constrained. To investigate this we perform a\nparameter study for both the properties of the ambient plasma of a simulated\nacceleration region and the turbulent acceleration profile acting on an\ninitially isotropic thermal electron population. We find that the independently\nvarying the turbulent acceleration timescale $\\tau_{acc}$, acceleration profile\nstandard deviation ${\\sigma}$ and acceleration region length L result in\nin-situ spectral index variation of between 0.5 and 2.0 at 1.0 AU for < 100 keV\nelectrons. Short timescale turbulent scattering in the flaring corona steepens\nthe spectra by $\\sim$ 0.5. It was also found that the in-situ spectral index\n$\\delta$ derived from the peak electron flux produces a spectral index $\\sim$\n1.6 harder than that from a full-flare X-ray photon flux (of spectral index\n$\\gamma$) simulated with the same intermediate parameters. Previous studies\nhave indicated an approximate $\\delta \\approx \\gamma$ relationship for selected\nflares with measured in-situ electron and X-ray photon observations, suggesting\nthat an extended source region with non-uniform plasma and/or acceleration\nproperties may be necessary to reproduce this relationship.",

The model simulates debates\naround the \"Ship of Theseus\" paradox, in which agents with discrete opinions\ninteract with each other and evolve their opinions by accepting, rejecting, or\nignoring the arguments presented. We study three different scenarios: balanced,\npolarized, and unbalanced opinion distributions.

Recent works have endeavored to address the conflicts between task\nvectors, one of the significant challenges faced by model merging, through\nsparsification; however, two issues significantly limit their performance: high\nparameter overlap and unbalanced weight distribution. To address these issues,\nwe propose a simple, yet effective framework called CABS (Conflict-Aware and\nBalanced Sparsification), consisting of Conflict-Aware Sparsification (CA) and\nBalanced Sparsification (BS). CA can reduce parameter overlap by applying masks\nduring sequential pruning, ensuring that each task vector retains distinct,\nnon-overlapping parameters.

It goes without saying that a priori architectural designs can\nlimit the scalability and domain adaptability of a given MAS.\n  To address these challenges, in this paper we introduce Nexus: a lightweight\nPython framework designed to easily build and manage LLM-based MASs. Nexus\nintroduces the following innovations: (i) a flexible multi-supervisor\nhierarchy, (ii) a simplified workflow design, and (iii) easy installation and\nopen-source flexibility: Nexus can be installed via pip and is distributed\nunder a permissive open-source license, allowing users to freely modify and\nextend its capabilities.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that architectures built with Nexus exhibit\nstate-of-the-art performance across diverse domains. In coding tasks,\nNexus-driven MASs achieve a 99% pass rate on HumanEval and a flawless 100% on\nVerilogEval-Human, outperforming cutting-edge reasoning language models such as\no3-mini and DeepSeek-R1. Moreover, these architectures display robust\nproficiency in complex reasoning and mathematical problem solving, achieving\ncorrect solutions for all randomly selected problems from the MATH dataset.

To\naddress these issues, we present EndoMamba, a foundation model designed for\nreal-time inference while learning generalized spatiotemporal representations.\nFirst, to mitigate computational inefficiencies, we propose the EndoMamba\nbackbone, optimized for real-time inference.

Specifically, our approach\ncombines masked reconstruction with auxiliary supervision, leveraging low-level\nreconstruction to capture spatial-temporal structures and high-level alignment\nto transfer broader knowledge from a pretrained general-video domain foundation\nmodel.

    "abstract": "In the field of computer graphics, conformal surface flattening has been\nwidely studied for tasks such as texture mapping, geometry processing, and mesh\ngeneration. Typically, existing methods aim to flatten a given input geometry\nwhile preserving conformality as much as possible, meaning the result is only\nas conformal as possible. By contrast, this study focuses on surfaces that can\nbe flattened conformally without singularities, making the process a coupled\nproblem: the input (or target) surface must be recursively refined while its\nflattening is computed.\n  Although the uniformization theorem or the Riemann mapping theorem guarantees\nthe existence of a conformal flattening for any simply connected, orientable\nsurface, those theorems permit singularities in the flattening. If\nsingularities are not allowed, only a special class of surfaces can be\nconformally flattened-though many practical surfaces do fall into this class.\n  To address this, we develop a NURBS-based approach in which both the input\nsurface and its flattening are refined in tandem, ensuring mutual conformality.\nBecause NURBS surfaces cannot represent singularities, the resulting pair of\nsurfaces is naturally singularity-free. Our work is inspired by the\nform-finding method by [Miki and Mitchell 2022, 2024], which solves bilinear\nPDEs by iteratively refining two surfaces together. Building on their\ndemonstration of the effectiveness of variable projection (VarPro), we adopt a\nsimilar strategy: VarPro alternates between a linear projection and a nonlinear\niteration, leveraging a partially linear (separable) problem structure.\nHowever, since our conformal condition separates into two nonlinear\nsubproblems, we introduce a nonlinear extension of VarPro. Although this\nsignificantly increases computational cost, the quality of the results is\nnoteworthy.",

However, numerical results on chiral symmetry\nbreaking in rotating plasmas of interacting fermions reveal surprisingly close\ncorrespondence in predictions between rigorous bounded and formal unbounded\napproaches. Within the mean-field approach, we adopt three consecutive levels\nof approximation to the ground state of the system that feature a uniform\n(model 1), weakly-inhomogeneous (model 2) and fully inhomogeneus (model 3)\ncondensates. Models 1 and 2 that do not take into account spatial gradients of\nthe condensate, show agreement with the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. Model 3 exhibits\na deviation from the Tolman-Ehrenfest prediction due to the appearance of a new\nenergy scale set by the inhomogeneity of the ground state. Its boundary\nconditions are fixed by imposing regularity at the rotation axis and by\ndemanding the global minimization of the grand potential. We dub the latter as\n``firewall boundary conditions,'' translating into the requirement of vanishing\ncondensate on the light cylinder, which follows from the fact that the system\nstate formally diverges at the light cylinder. In all models, we present the\nphase diagram of the system and point out that in models 2 and 3, the system\nresides either in a chirally-restored phase, or in a mixed phase that possesses\nspatially-separated chirally-restored and chirally-broken phases.",

Inspired by human brain's\ndual-process mechanisms - predictive coding (N400) for backbone sparsity and\nstructural reanalysis (P600) for complex context - we propose CLADA, a\n\\textit{\\textbf{C}ognitive-\\textbf{L}oad-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{D}ynamic\n\\textbf{A}ctivation} framework that synergizes statistical sparsity with\nsemantic adaptability.

CLADA employs\na hierarchical thresholding strategy: a baseline from offline error-controlled\noptimization ensures 40\\%+ sparsity, dynamically adjusted by real-time\ncognitive signals. Evaluations across six mainstream LLMs and nine benchmarks\ndemonstrate that CLADA achieves \\textbf{~20\\% average speedup with <2\\%\naccuracy drop}, outperforming Griffin (5\\%+ degradation) and TT (negligible\nspeedup).

D$^3$Net achieves\ndegradation-adaptive image restoration with guided prompt through cross-domain\ninteraction and dynamic degradation decomposition. Concretely, in D$^3$Net, the\nproposed Cross-Domain Degradation Analyzer (CDDA) engages in deep interaction\nbetween frequency domain degradation characteristics and spatial domain image\nfeatures to identify and model variations of different degradation types on the\nimage manifold, generating degradation correction prompt and strategy prompt,\nwhich guide the following decomposition process. Furthermore, the prompt-based\nDynamic Decomposition Mechanism (DDM) for progressive degradation\ndecomposition, that encourages the network to adaptively select restoration\nstrategies utilizing the two-level prompt generated by CDDA. Thanks to the\nsynergistic cooperation between CDDA and DDM, D$^3$Net achieves superior\nflexibility and scalability in handling unknown degradation, while effectively\nreducing unnecessary computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple\nimage restoration tasks demonstrate that D$^3$Net significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art approaches, especially improving PSNR by 5.47dB and 3.30dB on\nthe SOTS-Outdoor and GoPro datasets, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\ncode generation from natural language prompts, revolutionizing software\ndevelopment workflows. As we advance towards agent-based development paradigms,\nthese models form the cornerstone of next-generation software development\nlifecycles. However, current benchmarks for evaluating multilingual code\ngeneration capabilities are predominantly English-centric, limiting their\napplicability across the global developer community. To address this\nlimitation, we present IndicEval-XL, a comprehensive benchmark for code\ngeneration that incorporates 6 major Indic languages, collectively spoken by\napproximately 14\\% of the world's population. Our benchmark bridges these\nlanguages with 12 programming languages, creating a robust evaluation\nframework. This work is particularly significant given India's representation\nof one-eighth of the global population and the crucial role Indic languages\nplay in Indian society. IndicEval-XL represents a significant step toward\nexpanding the linguistic diversity in code generation systems and evaluation\nframeworks. By developing resources that support multiple languages, we aim to\nmake AI-powered development tools more inclusive and accessible to developers\nof various linguistic backgrounds.

    "abstract": "Electrotactile feedback is a promising method for delivering haptic\nsensations, but challenges such as the naturalness of sensations hinder its\nadoption in commercial devices. In this study, we introduce a novel device that\nenables the exploration of complex stimulation signals to enhance sensation\nnaturalness. We designed six stimulation signals with linearly modulated\nfrequency, amplitude, or both, across two frequency levels based on a\nramp-and-hold shape, aiming to replicate sensation of pressing a button. Our\nresults showed that these modulated signals achieve higher naturalness scores\nthan tonic stimulations, with a 6.8% improvement. Moreover, we examined the\nrelationship between perceived intensity and signal energy for these\nstimulation patterns. Our findings indicate that, under conditions of constant\nperceived intensity, signal energy is not uniform across different stimulation\npatterns. Instead, there is a distinct relationship between the energy levels\nof different patterns, which is consistently reflected in the energy of the\nstimulations selected by the participants. Based on our findings, we propose a\npredictive model that estimates the desired intensity for any stimulation\npattern using this relationship between signal energies and the user's\npreferred intensity for a single reference pattern. This model demonstrated\nhigh reliability, with a mean R2 score of 83.33%. Using this approach,\nintensity calibration for different stimulation patterns can be streamlined,\nreducing calibration time by 87.5%, as only one out of eight reference pattern\nmust be calibrated. These findings highlight the potential of stimulation\nsignal modulation to improve sensation quality and validate the viability of\nour predictive model for automating intensity calibration. This approach is an\nessential step toward delivering complex and naturalistic sensations in\nadvanced haptic systems.",

    "abstract": "There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in\nthe next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is\nthe absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to\nthis situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear\ndifferential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is\nable to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the\nglobal population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years\nuntil now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst)\nplateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth\nregimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various\nlimits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population\ndynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In\nparticular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which\nassumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the\npast decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the\nresource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden\nrise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as\n2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in\ntoday, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates\nof the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce\nby half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new\naggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so\nas to avoid the doomsday scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new approach to measure the magnetic pitch angle profile in\ntokamak plasmas with Doppler backscattering (DBS), a technique traditionally\nused for measuring flows and density fluctuations. The DBS signal is maximised\nwhen its probe beam's wavevector is perpendicular to the magnetic field at the\ncutoff location, independent of the density fluctuations. Hence, if one could\nisolate this effect, DBS would then yield information about the magnetic pitch\nangle. By varying the toroidal launch angle, the DBS beam reaches cutoff with\ndifferent angles with respect to the magnetic field, but with other properties\nremaining similar. Hence, the toroidal launch angle which gives maximum\nbackscattered power is thus that which is matched to the pitch angle at the\ncutoff location, enabling inference of the magnetic pitch angle. We performed\nsystematic scans of the DBS toroidal launch angle for repeated DIII-D tokamak\ndischarges. Experimental DBS data from this scan were analysed and combined\nwith Gaussian beam-tracing simulations using the Scotty code. The pitch-angle\ninferred from DBS is consistent with that from magnetics-only and\nmotional-Stark-effect-constrained (MSE) equilibrium reconstruction in the edge.\nIn the core, the pitch angles from DBS and magnetics-only reconstructions\ndiffer by one to two degrees, while simultaneous MSE measurements were not\navailable. The uncertainty in these measurements was under a degree; we show\nthat this uncertainty is primarily due to the error in toroidal steering, the\nnumber of toroidally separated measurements, and shot-to-shot repeatability. We\nfind that the error of pitch-angle measurements can be reduced by optimising\nthe poloidal launch angle and initial beam properties.",

However, the performance of current devices is limited by different\nperturbations sources and especially by its sensitivity to any phase\naberrations. The work presented here attempts to overcome those limitations by\nusing a four-telescopes nulling interferometer architecture, called\nKernel-Nuller, which includes a recombiner that positions the four signals in\nphase quadrature. This architecture is based on an integrated optical component\ncontaining 14 electronically controlled phase shifters, used to correct optical\npath differences that would be induced by manufacturing defects. The first part\nof the study consists in the development of an algorithm providing the delays\nto be injected into the component to optimize the performance of that device.\nThe next step of this study deals with the analysis of the intensity\ndistributions produced at the output of the Kernel-Nuller through a series of\nobservations.

For some of these VHE GRBs, we\npreviously proposed a two-component jet model, consisting of two uniform jets\nwith narrow and wide opening angles to explain their multiwavelength afterglows\nincluding VHE gamma rays. In this paper, we show that the VHE spectra and light\ncurves of GRBs 201216C and 221009A can also be reasonably explained by our\ntwo-component jet model, based on two top-hat jets propagating into a\nconstant-density circumburst medium. We find that for the five VHE GRBs, the\ncollimation-corrected kinetic energies of the narrow and wide jets have typical\nvalues of 5*10^{49} erg and 5*10^{50} erg, respectively. We discuss the\nsimilarities and differences among the VHE GRBs, and the implications for the\nstructure of their jets.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative frameworks,\nexcelling in producing high-quality multi-modal samples. However, recent\nstudies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where backdoored\nmodels generate specific, undesirable outputs called backdoor target (e.g.,\nharmful images) when a pre-defined trigger is embedded to their inputs. In this\npaper, we propose PureDiffusion, a dual-purpose framework that simultaneously\nserves two contrasting roles: backdoor defense and backdoor attack\namplification. For defense, we introduce two novel loss functions to invert\nbackdoor triggers embedded in diffusion models. The first leverages\ntrigger-induced distribution shifts across multiple timesteps of the diffusion\nprocess, while the second exploits the denoising consistency effect when a\nbackdoor is activated. Once an accurate trigger inversion is achieved, we\ndevelop a backdoor detection method that analyzes both the inverted trigger and\nthe generated backdoor targets to identify backdoor attacks. In terms of attack\namplification with the role of an attacker, we describe how our trigger\ninversion algorithm can be used to reinforce the original trigger embedded in\nthe backdoored diffusion model. This significantly boosts attack performance\nwhile reducing the required backdoor training time. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that PureDiffusion achieves near-perfect detection accuracy,\noutperforming existing defenses by a large margin, particularly against complex\ntrigger patterns. Additionally, in an attack scenario, our attack amplification\napproach elevates the attack success rate (ASR) of existing backdoor attacks to\nnearly 100\\% while reducing training time by up to 20x.",

The performance of a given\nattention mechanism turns out to depend on the pollutant, highlighting the\ndifferences in their creation and dissipation processes.

However, their high value also attracts attackers\nwho exploit vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts for illegal profits, thereby\nharming the NFT ecosystem. One notable vulnerability in NFT smart contracts is\nsleepminting, which allows attackers to illegally transfer others' tokens.\nAlthough some research has been conducted on sleepminting, these studies are\nbasically qualitative analyses or based on historical transaction data. There\nis a lack of understanding from the contract code perspective, which is crucial\nfor identifying such issues and preventing attacks before they occur. To\naddress this gap, in this paper, we categoriz four distinct types of\nsleepminting in NFT smart contracts. Each type is accompanied by a\ncomprehensive definition and illustrative code examples to provide how these\nvulnerabilities manifest within the contract code. Furthermore, to help detect\nthe defined defects before the sleepminting problem occurrence, we propose a\ntool named WakeMint, which is built on a symbolic execution framework and is\ndesigned to be compatible with both high and low versions of Solidity. The tool\nalso employs a pruning strategy to shorten the detection period. Additionally,\nWakeMint gathers some key information, such as the owner of an NFT and\nemissions of events related to the transfer of the NFT's ownership during\nsymbolic execution. Then, it analyzes the features of the transfer function\nbased on this information so that it can judge the existence of sleepminting.\nWe ran WakeMint on 11,161 real-world NFT smart contracts and evaluated the\nresults.

As empirical hypergraphs\ngrow in size, characterizing their structural properties becomes increasingly\nchallenging due to computational complexity and, in some cases, restricted\naccess to complete data, requiring efficient sampling methods. Random walks\noffer a practical approach to hypergraph sampling, as they rely solely on local\nneighborhood information from nodes and hyperedges. In this study, we\ninvestigate methods for simultaneously sampling nodes and hyperedges via random\nwalks on large hypergraphs. First, we compare three existing random walks in\nthe context of hypergraph sampling and identify an advantage of the so-called\nhigher-order random walk. Second, by extending an established technique for\ngraphs to the case of hypergraphs, we present a non-backtracking variant of the\nhigher-order random walk. We derive theoretical results on estimators based on\nthe non-backtracking higher-order random walk and validate them through\nnumerical simulations on large empirical hypergraphs. Third, we apply the\nnon-backtracking higher-order random walk to a large hypergraph of\nco-authorships indexed in the OpenAlex database, where full access to the data\nis not readily available.

This would create new\nchallenges for the mobile system to efficiently serve such behind-UE\nsubnetworks, as the latter are commonly not visible to the mobile system. In\n3GPP, there have been works on Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and\nDeterministic Networking (DetNet), where the 5G System (5GS) is considered as a\nbridge or a DetNet node. In order to efficiently serve behind-UE IP\nsubnetworks, we foresee the need for a further generalization where the mobile\nsystem (5GS and beyond) acts as a set of IP routers with more generic\ncapabilities. In this article, we introduce the concept of Mobile System Router\n(MS-Router) which aims to provide a reference architectural design to enable\nthe support of IP routing in the next generation of mobile telecommunication\nsystems. The concept models a mobile system as an IP router per User Plane\ngranularity. Each MS-Router implements an IP routing protocol, exchanges\nrouting messages with the external routers and constructs a routing table,\nenabling the mobile system to dynamically learn the topology of the IP\nsubnetwork behind the UEs and Data Network. The learned topology is translated\ninto User Plane configuration to serve the IP subnetworks in an optimal way.\nThe article also advocates different approaches where routing protocols can be\nimplemented in the mobile system.",

ESOMs are frequently formulated as linear\n(LPs) and mixed-integer linear (MIP) problems. MIPs allow continuous and\ndiscrete decision variables. Consequently, they are substantially more\nexpressive than LPs but also more challenging to solve. The ever-growing size\nand complexity of ESOMs take a toll on the computational time of\nstate-of-the-art commercial solvers. Indeed, for large-scale ESOMs, solving the\nLP relaxation -- the basis of modern MIP solution algorithms -- can be very\ncostly. These time requirements can render ESOM MIPs impractical for real-world\napplications. This article considers a set of large-scale\ndecarbonization-focused unit commitment models with expansion decisions based\non the REMix framework (up to 83 million variables and 900,000 discrete\ndecision variables). For these particular instances, the solution to the LP\nrelaxation and the MIP optimum lie close. Based on this observation, we\ninvestigate the application of relaxation-enforced neighborhood search (RENS),\nmachine learning guided rounding, and a fix-and-propagate (FP) heuristic as a\nstandalone solution method. Our approach generated feasible solutions 20 to 100\ntimes faster than GUROBI, achieving comparable solution quality with\nprimal-dual gaps as low as 1% and up to 35%. This enabled us to solve numerous\nscenarios without lowering the quality of our models. For some instances that\nGUROBI could not solve within two days, our \\FP method provided feasible\nsolutions in under one hour.",

However, with Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), Yao\nand Hussain (J.

In\nthis work, a recently developed numerical technique called log-lattice\n(Campolina and Mailybaev, Nonlinearity, 2021), where interacting Fourier modes\nare logarithmically sampled, is applied to the same oblique vortex ring\ninteraction problem. It is shown that this technique is not only capable of\ncapturing the two key physical processes overlooked by the MK model but also\nother quantitative and qualitative attributes generally seen with DNS, at a\nfraction of the computational cost. Furthermore, the sparsity of the Fourier\nmodes allows us to probe very large $Re_{\\Gamma} = 10^8$ until which the peak\nof the maximum norm of vorticity, while increasing with $Re_{\\Gamma}$, remains\nfinite, and a blowup is observed only for the inviscid case.",

The GCN-based\nmodel captures both spatial and temporal dependencies within the vehicular\nnetwork; the Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism fosters cooperation\nbetween vehicles and infrastructure; and the MADRL algorithm jointly optimizes\nresource allocation and VT migration in real time. By modeling this dynamic and\nmulti-tier vehicular Metaverse as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop a\nMADRL-based algorithm dubbed the Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic\nPolicy Gradient (MO-MADDPG), which can effectively balances the various\nconflicting objectives.

The output of our stochastic optimal control\nimplementation consists of an optimal trajectory in a square domain for the\nautonomous vehicle such that the total mission time is minimized for a given\nresidual risk of not detecting sea mines. We model this risk as an expected\nvalue integral. We found that upon completion of the simulation, the user\nrequested residual risk is usually not satisfied. We solved this by\nimplementing a relaxation strategy which consists of incrementally increasing\nthe square search domain. We then combined this strategy with different\nquasi-Monte Carlo schemes used for solving the integral. We found that using a\nRank-1 Lattice scheme yields a speedup up to a factor two with respect to the\nMonte Carlo scheme.

To solve the latent confounding problem in\nlong-term observational studies, existing methods leverage short-term\nexperimental data. Ghassami et al. propose an approach based on the Conditional\nAdditive Equi-Confounding Bias (CAECB) assumption, which asserts that the\nconfounding bias in the short-term outcome is equal to that in the long-term\noutcome, so that the long-term confounding bias and the causal effects can be\nidentified. While effective in certain cases, this assumption is limited to\nscenarios where there is only one short-term outcome with the same scale as the\nlong-term outcome. In this paper, we introduce a novel assumption that extends\nthe CAECB assumption to accommodate temporal short-term outcomes. Our proposed\nassumption states a functional relationship between sequential confounding\nbiases across temporal short-term outcomes, under which we theoretically\nestablish the identification of long-term causal effects. Based on the\nidentification result, we develop an estimator and conduct a theoretical\nanalysis of its asymptotic properties.

    "abstract": "Biomedical ontologies, which comprehensively define concepts and relations\nfor biomedical entities, are crucial for structuring and formalizing\ndomain-specific information representations. Biomedical code mapping identifies\nsimilarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining\nhigh-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined\nmapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by\nmanual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain\nexpertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide\nunrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or\nsupporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested\ncandidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a\nrecurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new\nresearch findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual\nrefinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work,\nwe created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge\ngraphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our\nsolution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between\nontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of\nresults that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our\nsolution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be\nreflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation\nresults on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to\nenable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping.

    "abstract": "Among all privacy attacks against Machine Learning (ML), membership inference\nattacks (MIA) attracted the most attention. In these attacks, the attacker is\ngiven an ML model and a data point, and they must infer whether the data point\nwas used for training. The attacker also has an auxiliary dataset to tune their\ninference algorithm.\n  Attack papers commonly simulate setups in which the attacker's and the\ntarget's datasets are sampled from the same distribution. This setting is\nconvenient to perform experiments, but it rarely holds in practice. ML\nliterature commonly starts with similar simplifying assumptions (i.e., \"i.i.d.\"\ndatasets), and later generalizes the results to support heterogeneous data\ndistributions. Similarly, our work makes a first step in the generalization of\nthe MIA evaluation to heterogeneous data.\n  First, we design a metric to measure the heterogeneity between any pair of\ntabular data distributions. This metric provides a continuous scale to analyze\nthe phenomenon. Second, we compare two methodologies to simulate a data\nheterogeneity between the target and the attacker. These setups provide\nopposite performances: 90% attack accuracy vs. 50% (i.e., random guessing). Our\nresults show that the MIA accuracy depends on the experimental setup; and even\nif research on MIA considers heterogeneous data setups, we have no standardized\nbaseline of how to simulate it. The lack of such a baseline for MIA experiments\nposes a significant challenge to risk assessments in real-world machine\nlearning scenarios.",

We provide a full convergence analysis of Q-learning with varying\nparameters and learning rates. A wide range of phenomena emerges, broadly\neither settling into Nash or cycling continuously in ways reminiscent of\n\"Edgeworth cycles\" (i.e. jumping suddenly from Nash toward social optimum and\nthen deteriorating gradually back to Nash). Our results reveal an important\nincentive incompatibility when thinking in terms of a meta-game being played by\nthe designers of the individual Q-learners who set their agents' parameters.\nIndeed, Nash equilibria of the meta-game are characterized by heterogeneous\nparameters, and resulting outcomes achieve little to no cooperation beyond\nNash. In conclusion, we suggest a novel perspective for thinking about\nregulation and collusion, and discuss the implications of our results for\nBertrand oligopoly pricing games.",

It features a systolic array based on an innovative\ndataflow, where input feature map (ifmap) activations are locally reused\nthrough a triangular movement. However, ifmaps still suffer from memory\naccesses overhead. This work proposes 3D-TrIM, an upgraded version of TrIM that\naddresses the memory access overhead through few extra shadow registers. In\naddition, due to a change in the architectural orientation, the local shift\nregister buffers are now shared between different slices, thus improving area\nand energy efficiency. An architecture of 576 processing elements is\nimplemented on commercial 22 nm technology and achieves an area efficiency of\n4.47 TOPS/mm$^2$ and an energy efficiency of 4.54 TOPS/W. Finally, 3D-TrIM\noutperforms TrIM by up to $3.37\\times$ in terms of operations per memory access\nconsidering CNN topologies like VGG-16 and AlexNet.",

Traditional frame-based methods\noften struggle to balance latency, accuracy, and energy efficiency. To address\nthese challenges, we leverage event streams from event-based\ncameras-bio-inspired sensors that trigger events in response to changes in the\nscene. Specifically, we analyze the number of events triggered between\nsuccessive frames, with a high number indicating significant changes and a low\nnumber indicating minimal changes.

Therefore, a quartz glass window mounted from the vacuum\nvessel side is designed to withstand the reverse pressure. A mechanical shutter\nis also designed to open at a large angle of 235 degree so that the viewing\nangle of nearby ports is not blocked.

Purpose: This study assessed how DL-generated uncertainty maps\nimpact radiation oncologists during manual correction of prostate radiotherapy\nDL segmentations. Methods: Two nnUNet models were trained by 10-fold\ncross-validation on 434 MRI-only prostate cancer cases to segment the prostate\nand rectum. Each model was evaluated on 35 independent cases. Voxel-wise\nuncertainty was calculated using the SoftMax standard deviation (n=10) and\nvisualized as a color-coded map. Four oncologists performed segmentation in two\nsteps: Step 1: Rated segmentation quality and confidence using Likert scales\nand edited DL segmentations without uncertainty maps. Step 2 ($\\geq 4$ weeks\nlater): Repeated step 1, but with uncertainty maps available. Segmentation time\nwas recorded for both steps, and oncologists provided qualitative free-text\nfeedback. Histogram analysis compared voxel edits across uncertainty levels.\nResults: DL segmentations showed high agreement with oncologist edits. Quality\nratings varied: rectum segmentation ratings slightly decreased overall in step\n2, while prostate ratings differed among oncologists. Confidence ratings also\nvaried. Three oncologists reduced segmentation time with uncertainty maps,\nsaving 1-2 minutes per case. Histogram analysis showed 50% fewer edits for step\n2 in low-uncertainty areas. Conclusions: Presenting DL segmentation uncertainty\ninformation to radiation oncologists influences their decision-making, quality\nperception, and confidence in the DL segmentations. Low-uncertainty regions\nwere edited less frequently, indicating increased trust in DL predictions.\nUncertainty maps improve efficiency by reducing segmentation time and can be a\nvaluable clinical tool, enhancing radiotherapy planning efficiency.",

To address these issues, we introduce the User\nSimulator with Implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user\nprofiles from human-machine interactions to simulate personalized and realistic\ndialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a comprehensive\nprofile schema, then refine the simulation using conditional supervised\nfine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle consistency, optimizing at\nboth the utterance and conversation levels. Finally, a diverse profile sampler\ncaptures the distribution of real-world user profiles. Experimental results\nshow that USP outperforms strong baselines in terms of authenticity and\ndiversity while maintaining comparable consistency. Additionally, using USP to\nevaluate LLM on dynamic multi-turn aligns well with mainstream benchmarks,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.",

However, most modern recommender systems adopt a\nretrieve-and-rank strategy, where the generative model functions only as a\nselector during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we propose OneRec, which\nreplaces the cascaded learning framework with a unified generative model. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end generative model that\nsignificantly surpasses current complex and well-designed recommender systems\nin real-world scenarios. Specifically, OneRec includes: 1) an encoder-decoder\nstructure, which encodes the user's historical behavior sequences and gradually\ndecodes the videos that the user may be interested in. We adopt sparse\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) to scale model capacity without proportionally\nincreasing computational FLOPs. 2) a session-wise generation approach. In\ncontrast to traditional next-item prediction, we propose a session-wise\ngeneration, which is more elegant and contextually coherent than point-by-point\ngeneration that relies on hand-crafted rules to properly combine the generated\nresults. 3) an Iterative Preference Alignment module combined with Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the quality of the generated results.\nUnlike DPO in NLP, a recommendation system typically has only one opportunity\nto display results for each user's browsing request, making it impossible to\nobtain positive and negative samples simultaneously. To address this\nlimitation, We design a reward model to simulate user generation and customize\nthe sampling strategy. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that a limited\nnumber of DPO samples can align user interest preferences and significantly\nimprove the quality of generated results. We deployed OneRec in the main scene\nof Kuaishou, achieving a 1.6\\% increase in watch-time, which is a substantial\nimprovement.",

A two-stage modeling\nframework has the advantage of being more computationally efficient than a\nfully Bayesian approach when the first-stage model is already complex in\nitself, and avoids the potential problem of unwanted feedback effects. Two ways\nof doing two-stage modeling are the crude plug-in method and the posterior\nsampling method. The former ignores the uncertainty in the first-stage model,\nwhile the latter can be computationally expensive. This paper validates the two\naforementioned approaches and proposes a new approach to do uncertainty\npropagation, which we call the $\\mathbf{Q}$ uncertainty method, implemented\nusing the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). We validate the\ndifferent approaches using the simulation-based calibration method, which tests\nthe self-consistency property of Bayesian models. Results show that the crude\nplug-in method underestimates the true posterior uncertainty in the\nsecond-stage model parameters, while the resampling approach and the proposed\nmethod are correct.

The accuracy of KGs directly impacts the reliability of the\ninferred knowledge and outcomes. Therefore, assessing the accuracy of a KG is\nessential for ensuring the quality of facts used in these tasks. However, the\nlarge size of real-world KGs makes manual triple-by-triple annotation\nimpractical, thereby requiring sampling strategies to provide accuracy\nestimates with statistical guarantees. The current state-of-the-art approaches\nrely on Confidence Intervals (CIs), derived from frequentist statistics. While\nefficient, CIs have notable limitations and can lead to interpretation\nfallacies. In this paper, we propose to overcome the limitations of CIs by\nusing \\emph{Credible Intervals} (CrIs), which are grounded in Bayesian\nstatistics. These intervals are more suitable for reliable post-data inference,\nparticularly in KG accuracy evaluation. We prove that CrIs offer greater\nreliability and stronger guarantees than frequentist approaches in this\ncontext.

    "abstract": "Text-to-audio (TTA), which generates audio signals from textual descriptions,\nhas received huge attention in recent years. However, recent works focused on\ntext to monaural audio only. As we know, spatial audio provides more immersive\nauditory experience than monaural audio, e.g. in virtual reality. To address\nthis issue, we propose a text-to-spatial-audio (TTSA) generation framework\nnamed DualSpec. Specifically, it first trains variational autoencoders (VAEs)\nfor extracting the latent acoustic representations from sound event audio.\nThen, given text that describes sound events and event directions, the proposed\nmethod uses the encoder of a pretrained large language model to transform the\ntext into text features. Finally, it trains a diffusion model from the latent\nacoustic representations and text features for the spatial audio generation. In\nthe inference stage, only the text description is needed to generate spatial\naudio. Particularly, to improve the synthesis quality and azimuth accuracy of\nthe spatial sound events simultaneously, we propose to use two kinds of\nacoustic features. One is the Mel spectrograms which is good for improving the\nsynthesis quality, and the other is the short-time Fourier transform\nspectrograms which is good at improving the azimuth accuracy. We provide a\npipeline of constructing spatial audio dataset with text prompts, for the\ntraining of the VAEs and diffusion model. We also introduce new spatial-aware\nevaluation metrics to quantify the azimuth errors of the generated spatial\naudio recordings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can\ngenerate spatial audio with high directional and event consistency.",

Unlike traditional Keller-Segel\nmodels, this framework introduces an explicit representation of ligand-receptor\nbindings on the cell membrane, where the percentage of occupied receptors\nconstitutes the trait that influences cellular phenotype. The model posits that\nthe cell's phenotypic state directly modulates its capacity for chemotaxis and\nproliferation, governed by a trade-off due to a finite energy budget: cells\nhighly proficient in chemotaxis exhibit lower proliferation rates, while more\nproliferative cells show diminished chemotactic abilities. The model is derived\nfrom the principles of a biased random walk, resulting in a system of two\nnon-local partial differential equations, describing the densities of both\ncells and ligands. Using a Hopf-Cole transformation, we derive an equation that\ncharacterises the distribution of cellular traits within travelling wave\nsolutions for the total cell density, allowing us to uncover the monotonicity\nproperties of these waves. Numerical investigations are conducted to examine\nthe model's behaviour across various biological scenarios, providing insights\ninto the complex interplay between chemotaxis, proliferation, and phenotypic\ndiversity in migrating cell populations.",

Although prior research has\nextensively explored MIAs in Large Language Models (LLMs), they typically\nrequire accessing to complete output logits (\\ie, \\textit{logits-based\nattacks}), which are usually not available in practice. In this paper, we study\nthe vulnerability of pre-trained LLMs to MIAs in the \\textit{label-only\nsetting}, where the adversary can only access generated tokens (text). We first\nreveal that existing label-only MIAs have minor effects in attacking\npre-trained LLMs, although they are highly effective in inferring fine-tuning\ndatasets used for personalized LLMs. We find that their failure stems from two\nmain reasons, including better generalization and overly coarse perturbation.\nSpecifically, due to the extensive pre-training corpora and exposing each\nsample only a few times, LLMs exhibit minimal robustness differences between\nmembers and non-members. This makes token-level perturbations too coarse to\ncapture such differences.\n  To alleviate these problems, we propose \\textbf{PETAL}: a label-only\nmembership inference attack based on \\textbf{PE}r-\\textbf{T}oken\nsem\\textbf{A}ntic simi\\textbf{L}arity. Specifically, PETAL leverages\ntoken-level semantic similarity to approximate output probabilities and\nsubsequently calculate the perplexity. It finally exposes membership based on\nthe common assumption that members are `better' memorized and have smaller\nperplexity. We conduct extensive experiments on the WikiMIA benchmark and the\nmore challenging MIMIR benchmark. Empirically, our PETAL performs better than\nthe extensions of existing label-only attacks against personalized LLMs and\neven on par with other advanced logit-based attacks across all metrics on five\nprevalent open-source LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the pedagogical capabilities of AI-based tutoring models is\ncritical for making guided progress in the field. Yet, we lack a reliable,\neasy-to-use, and simple-to-run evaluation that reflects the pedagogical\nabilities of models. To fill this gap, we present MathTutorBench, an\nopen-source benchmark for holistic tutoring model evaluation. MathTutorBench\ncontains a collection of datasets and metrics that broadly cover tutor\nabilities as defined by learning sciences research in dialog-based teaching. To\nscore the pedagogical quality of open-ended teacher responses, we train a\nreward model and show it can discriminate expert from novice teacher responses\nwith high accuracy. We evaluate a wide set of closed- and open-weight models on\nMathTutorBench and find that subject expertise, indicated by solving ability,\ndoes not immediately translate to good teaching. Rather, pedagogy and subject\nexpertise appear to form a trade-off that is navigated by the degree of\ntutoring specialization of the model. Furthermore, tutoring appears to become\nmore challenging in longer dialogs, where simpler questioning strategies begin\nto fail. We release the benchmark, code, and leaderboard openly to enable rapid\nbenchmarking of future models.",

    "abstract": "Low voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) suffer from limited visibility due\nto sparse or nonexistent measurement systems, leaving distribution network\nservice providers with incomplete data. Maintenance activities, such as\ntransformer upgrades and power line replacements, sometimes go undocumented,\nleading to unmonitored topology changes. This lack of oversight hinders network\noptimization, fault detection, and outage management, as utilities cannot fully\nmonitor or control the system. With the rise of electric vehicles, having an\naccurate understanding of LVDN topology is crucial to avoid infrastructure\ndamage from potential overloads. This paper introduces a method to reconstruct\nLVDN topology using incremental voltage and current changes from smart meters\nat customer endpoints. The approach identifies and maps network topologies with\nhigh accuracy, overcoming limitations of prior methods by discarding\nunrealistic assumptions. Specifically, it addresses grids with fewer than three\npole connections and employs an AC power flow model over simplified DC\napproximations. Simulations across diverse configurations validate the method's\neffectiveness in accurately reconstructing LVDN topologies, enhancing\nreal-world applicability.",

    "abstract": "To understand the complex interplay of topography and surface chemistry in\nwetting, fundamental studies investigating both parameters are needed. Due to\nthe sensitivity of wetting to miniscule changes in one of the parameters it is\nimperative to precisely control the experimental approach. A profound\nunderstanding of their influence on wetting facilitates a tailored design of\nsurfaces with unique functionality. We present a multi-step study: The\ninfluence of surface chemistry is analyzed by determining the adsorption of\nvolatile carbonous species (A) and by sputter deposition of metallic copper and\ncopper oxides on flat copper substrates (B). A precise surface topography is\ncreated by laser processing. Isotropic topography is created by ps laser\nprocessing (C), and hierarchical anisotropic line patterns are produced by\ndirect laser interference patterning (DLIP) with different pulse durations (D).\nOur results reveal that the long-term wetting response of polished copper\nsurfaces stabilizes with time despite ongoing accumulation of hydrocarbons and\nis dominated by this adsorption layer over the oxide state of the substrate\n(Cu, CuO, Cu2O). The surfaces' wetting response can be precisely tuned by\ntailoring the topography via laser processing. The sub-pattern morphology of\nprimary line-like patterns showed great impact on the static contact angle,\nwetting anisotropy, and water adhesion. An increased roughness inside the\npattern valleys combined with a minor roughness on the peaks favors\nair-inclusions, isotropic hydrophobicity, and low water adhesion. Increasing\nthe aspect ratio showed to enhance air-inclusions and hydrophobicity despite\nincreased peak roughness while time dependent wetting transitions were\nobserved.",

Hence, we propose \\method{}, a novel probabilistic framework to\nrealize iterative self-training with new self-ensemble strategies, achieving\nbetter physical consistency and generalization on extreme events. Following any\nbase forecasting model, we can encode its deterministic outputs into a latent\nspace and retrieve multiple codebook entries to generate probabilistic outputs.\nThen BeamVQ extends the beam search from discrete spaces to the continuous\nstate spaces in this field. We can further employ domain-specific metrics\n(e.g., Critical Success Index for extreme events) to filter out the top-k\ncandidates and develop the new self-ensemble strategy by combining the\nhigh-quality candidates. The self-ensemble can not only improve the inference\nquality and robustness but also iteratively augment the training datasets\nduring continuous self-training. Consequently, BeamVQ realizes the exploration\nof rare but critical phenomena beyond the original dataset. Comprehensive\nexperiments on different benchmarks and backbones show that BeamVQ consistently\nreduces forecasting MSE (up to 39%), enhancing extreme events detection and\nproving its effectiveness in handling data scarcity.",

This study aims to measure trade costs and explore the driving\nforces behind the growth of bilateral trade between Cambodia and its top 30\ntrading partners from 1993 to 2019. Using a micro-founded measure of trade\ncosts derived from the gravity model, we find that Cambodia's average trade\ncosts decreased by 35.43 percent between 1993 and 2019. Fluctuations in average\ntrade costs persisted until 2014, despite Cambodia's accession to the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) in 2004. Since then, these costs have declined more\nrapidly. Cambodia's bilateral trade costs are lower with its major trading\npartners in Southeast Asia and East Asia than with those in South Asia,\nOceania, Europe, and North America. Cambodia's average trade costs with\ndeveloping and emerging economies are lower than those with developed\neconomies. Between 2014 and 2019, Cambodia experienced a notable decline in\naverage trade costs with trading partners along the Belt and Road Initiative\n(BRI) corridors by 34.78 percent, twice as fast as with non-BRI trading\npartners. Regarding the decomposition of trade growth, we find that the\nexpansion of Cambodian trade over the period from 1993 to 2019 was driven by\nthree factors: the rise in income (59.65 percent), the decline in trade costs\n(56.69 percent), and the decline in multilateral resistance (minus 16.34\npercent). The findings of this study have significant implications for a better\nunderstanding of Cambodia's development process toward global trade integration\nover the past two decades. Our results suggest that Cambodia can optimize its\ntrade expansion potential by focusing on its relations with trading partners\nexhibiting high economic growth potential and those showing substantial\nreductions in trade costs.",

The imbalanced nature of classes on the internet presents a\ncritical challenge in classification tasks. For example, some classes of\napplications are much more prevalent than others, such as HTTP. As a result,\nmachine learning classification models do not perform well on those classes\nwith fewer data. To address this problem, we propose a pipeline to balance the\ndataset and classify it using a robust and accurate embedding technique. First,\nwe generate artificial data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and\nKernel Density Estimation (KDE). Next, we propose replacing one-hot encoding\nfor categorical features with a novel embedding framework based on the \"Flow as\na Sentence\" perspective, which we name FS-Embedding. This framework treats the\nsource and destination ports, along with the packet's direction, as one word in\na flow, then trains an embedding vector space based on these new features\nthrough the learning classification task. Finally, we compare our pipeline with\nthe training of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) and\nTransformers, both with imbalanced and sampled datasets, as well as with the\none-hot encoding approach.

Several approaches have been proposed to\nautomatically generate commit messages, but they still suffer from critical\nlimitations, such as time-consuming training and poor generalization ability.\nTo tackle these limitations, we propose to borrow the weapon of large language\nmodels (LLMs) and in-context learning (ICL). Our intuition is based on the fact\nthat the training corpora of LLMs contain extensive code changes and their\npairwise commit messages, which makes LLMs capture the knowledge about commits,\nwhile ICL can exploit the knowledge hidden in the LLMs and enable them to\nperform downstream tasks without model tuning. However, it remains unclear how\nwell LLMs perform on commit message generation via ICL. In this paper, we\nconduct an empirical study to investigate the capability of LLMs to generate\ncommit messages via ICL. Specifically, we first explore the impact of different\nsettings on the performance of ICL-based commit message generation. We then\ncompare ICL-based commit message generation with state-of-the-art approaches on\na popular multilingual dataset and a new dataset we created to mitigate\npotential data leakage. The results show that ICL-based commit message\ngeneration significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on subjective\nevaluation and achieves better generalization ability.

Most existing approaches focus primarily on point-to-point\nfidelity, often neglecting the importance of perceptual quality as interpreted\nby the human visual system. To address this issue, we propose a generative\nadversarial network for point cloud quality enhancement (PCE-GAN), grounded in\noptimal transport theory, with the goal of simultaneously optimizing both data\nfidelity and perceptual quality. The generator consists of a local feature\nextraction (LFE) unit, a global spatial correlation (GSC) unit and a feature\nsqueeze unit. The LFE unit uses dynamic graph construction and a graph\nattention mechanism to efficiently extract local features, placing greater\nemphasis on points with severe distortion. The GSC unit uses the geometry\ninformation of neighboring patches to construct an extended local neighborhood\nand introduces a transformer-style structure to capture long-range global\ncorrelations. The discriminator computes the deviation between the probability\ndistributions of the enhanced point cloud and the original point cloud, guiding\nthe generator to achieve high quality reconstruction. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically,\nwhen applying PCE-GAN to the latest geometry-based point cloud compression\n(G-PCC) test model, it achieves an average BD-rate of -19.2% compared with the\nPredLift coding configuration and -18.3% compared with the RAHT coding\nconfiguration.

In this work,\nwe propose a novel approach that integrates human-like motion transfer with\nprecise velocity tracking by a series of improvements to classical imitation\nlearning. To enhance generalization, we employ the Wasserstein divergence\ncriterion (WGAN-div). Furthermore, a Hybrid Internal Model provides structured\nestimates of hidden states and velocity to enhance mobile stability and\nenvironment adaptability, while a curiosity bonus fosters exploration. Our\ncomprehensive method promises highly human-like locomotion that adapts to\nvarying velocity requirements, direct generalization to unseen motions and\nmultitasking, as well as zero-shot transfer to the simulator and the real world\nacross different terrains. These advancements are validated through simulations\nacross various robot models and extensive real-world experiments.",

In addition, the algorithm uses subareas boundary to\nrefine predictions results and filter out substandard results without requiring\nadditional models.

At the same time, traditional TTS systems often struggle to\nbalance the inference speed of the model with the quality of the synthesized\nspeech. Methods that generate high-quality synthesized speech tend to have\nslower inference speeds, while faster inference methods often sacrifice speech\nquality.

    "abstract": "Cross-dataset testing is critical for examining machine learning (ML) model's\nperformance. However, most studies on modelling transcriptomic and clinical\ndata only conducted intra-dataset testing. It is also unclear whether\nnormalization and non-differentially expressed genes (NDEG) can improve\ncross-dataset modeling performance of ML. We thus aim to understand whether\nnormalization, NDEG and data source are associated with performance of ML in\ncross-dataset testing. The transcriptomic and clinical data shared by the lung\nadenocarcinoma cases in TCGA and ONCOSG were used. The best cross-dataset ML\nperformance was reached using transcriptomic data alone and statistically\nbetter than those using transcriptomic and clinical data. The best balance\naccuracy, area under curve and accuracy were significantly better in ML\nalgorithms training on TCGA and tested on ONCOSG than those trained on ONCOSG\nand tested on TCGA (p<0.05 for all). Normalization and NDEG greatly improved\nintra-dataset ML performances in both datasets, but not in cross-dataset\ntesting. Strikingly, modelling transcriptomic data of ONCOSG alone outperformed\nmodelling transcriptomic and clinical data whereas including clinical data in\nTCGA did not significantly impact ML performance, suggesting limited clinical\ndata value or an overwhelming influence of transcriptomic data in TCGA.\nPerformance gains in intra-dataset testing were more pronounced for ML models\ntrained on ONCOSG than TCGA. Among the six ML models compared, Support vector\nmachine was the most frequent best-performer in both intra-dataset and\ncross-dataset testing.

    "abstract": "Piezoelectric materials play a vital role in energy harvesting, piezotronics\nand various self-powered sensing applications. The piezoelectric strength of 2D\nmaterials is limited by the carrier charge screening, leading to reduced open\ncircuit voltages and poor piezotronic performances. Reducing the carrier\nscreening in devices is a key requirement to fully utilize the potential of 2D\nmaterials for piezoelectric applications. In this work, we demonstrate that\nlateral heterojunction devices offer an excellent way to improve the\npiezoelectric open circuit voltages and rectification ratios.

However, training and testing\ndistributions often differ, as training datasets rarely encompass the entire\ndistribution, while testing distribution tends to shift over time. Hence, when\nconfronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) instances that differ from the\ntraining data, a reliable and trustworthy SE ML model must be capable of\ndetecting them to either abstain from making predictions, or potentially\nforward these OODs to appropriate models handling other categories or tasks.\n  In this paper, we develop two types of SE-specific OOD detection models,\nunsupervised and weakly-supervised OOD detection for code. The unsupervised OOD\ndetection approach is trained solely on in-distribution samples while the\nweakly-supervised approach utilizes a tiny number of OOD samples to further\nenhance the detection performance in various OOD scenarios.

DeepTernary leverages\nan SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN) with both intra-graph and\nternary inter-graph attention mechanisms to capture intricate ternary\ninteractions from our collected high-quality training dataset, TernaryDB. The\nproposed query-based Pocket Points Decoder extracts the 3D structure of the\nfinal binding ternary complex from learned ternary embeddings, demonstrating\nstate-of-the-art accuracy and speed in existing PROTAC benchmarks without prior\nknowledge from known PROTACs. It also achieves notable accuracy on the more\nchallenging MGD benchmark under the blind docking protocol. Remarkably, our\nexperiments reveal that the buried surface area calculated from predicted\nstructures correlates with experimentally obtained degradation potency-related\nmetrics. Consequently, DeepTernary shows potential in effectively assisting and\naccelerating the development of TPDs for previously undruggable targets.",

Previous studies have attempted to\nfine-tune open-source LLMs to replicate the evaluation explanations and\njudgments of powerful proprietary models, such as GPT-4. However, these methods\nare largely limited to text-based analyses under predefined general criteria,\nresulting in reduced adaptability for unseen instructions and demonstrating\ninstability in evaluating adherence to quantitative and structural constraints.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel evaluation framework, ARJudge,\nthat adaptively formulates evaluation criteria and synthesizes both text-based\nand code-driven analyses to evaluate LLM responses. ARJudge consists of two\ncomponents: a fine-tuned Analyzer that generates multi-faceted evaluation\nanalyses and a tuning-free Refiner that combines and refines all analyses to\nmake the final judgment. We construct a Composite Analysis Corpus that\nintegrates tasks for evaluation criteria generation alongside text-based and\ncode-driven analysis generation to train the Analyzer. Our results demonstrate\nthat ARJudge outperforms existing fine-tuned evaluators in effectiveness and\nrobustness. Furthermore, it demonstrates the importance of multi-faceted\nevaluation and code-driven analyses in enhancing evaluation capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Steering vectors (SVs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting\nand controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive\ndatasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious\ncorrelations. We propose directly optimizing SVs through gradient descent on a\nsingle training example, and systematically investigate how these SVs\ngeneralize. We consider several SV optimization techniques and find that the\nresulting SVs effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models.\nIndeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize\none-shot SVs that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose\nnegations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on\nrefusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized SVs can transfer\nacross inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore,\nwe extend work on \"emergent misalignment\" and show that SVs optimized to induce\na model to write vulnerable code cause the model to respond harmfully on\nunrelated open-ended prompts. Finally, we use one-shot SV optimization to\ninvestigate how an instruction-tuned LLM recovers from outputting false\ninformation, and find that this ability is independent of the model's explicit\nverbalization that the information was false. Overall, our findings suggest\nthat optimizing SVs on a single example can mediate a wide array of misaligned\nbehaviors in LLMs. Code can be found at\nhttps://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro and\nhttps://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-misalignment.",

    "abstract": "Conversational assistants often require a question rewriting algorithm that\nleverages a subset of past interactions to provide a more meaningful (accurate)\nanswer to the user's question or request. However, the exact rewriting approach\nmay often depend on the use case and application-specific tasks supported by\nthe conversational assistant, among other constraints. In this paper, we\nsystematically investigate two different approaches, denoted as rewriting and\nfusion, on two fundamentally different generation tasks, including a\ntext-to-text generation task and a multimodal generative task that takes as\ninput text and generates a visualization or data table that answers the user's\nquestion. Our results indicate that the specific rewriting or fusion approach\nhighly depends on the underlying use case and generative task. In particular,\nwe find that for a conversational question-answering assistant, the query\nrewriting approach performs best, whereas for a data analysis assistant that\ngenerates visualizations and data tables based on the user's conversation with\nthe assistant, the fusion approach works best. Notably, we explore two datasets\nfor the data analysis assistant use case, for short and long conversations, and\nwe find that query fusion always performs better, whereas for the\nconversational text-based question-answering, the query rewrite approach\nperforms best.",

Building on this idea, we introduce\nSurvival Game as a framework to evaluate intelligence based on the number of\nfailed attempts in a trial-and-error process. Fewer failures indicate higher\nintelligence. When the expectation and variance of failure counts are both\nfinite, it signals the ability to consistently find solutions to new\nchallenges, which we define as the Autonomous Level of intelligence. Using\nSurvival Game, we comprehensively evaluate existing AI systems. Our results\nshow that while AI systems achieve the Autonomous Level in simple tasks, they\nare still far from it in more complex tasks, such as vision, search,\nrecommendation, and language. While scaling current AI technologies might help,\nthis would come at an astronomical cost. Projections suggest that achieving the\nAutonomous Level for general tasks would require $10^{26}$ parameters. To put\nthis into perspective, loading such a massive model requires so many H100 GPUs\nthat their total value is $10^{7}$ times that of Apple Inc.'s market value.\nEven with Moore's Law, supporting such a parameter scale would take $70$ years.\nThis staggering cost highlights the complexity of human tasks and the\ninadequacies of current AI technologies. To further investigate this\nphenomenon, we conduct a theoretical analysis of Survival Game and its\nexperimental results. Our findings suggest that human tasks possess a\ncriticality property. As a result, Autonomous Level requires a deep\nunderstanding of the task's underlying mechanisms. Current AI systems, however,\ndo not fully grasp these mechanisms and instead rely on superficial mimicry,\nmaking it difficult for them to reach an autonomous level.

A combination of spectroastrometry and reverberation mapping (SARM)\nof broad-line regions (BLRs) constitutes a novel means to probe the geometric\ndistance of AGNs, which has recently become practically feasible owing to\nsuccessful interferometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY. Here, we perform\nSARM analysis of four nearby quasars: Mrk 509, PDS 456, 3C 273, and NGC 3783.\nResults for the former two are reported for the first time and the latter two\nare revisited using our improved BLR dynamical modeling that includes the\nradial-dependent responsivity of BLRs. This allows us to self-consistently\naccount for the emissivity weighting of the BLR in spectroastrometry and\nresponsivity weighting in reverberation mapping. We obtain angular-diameter\ndistances of the four quasars, from which we derive a Hubble constant of\n$H_0=69_{-10}^{+12}\\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}$. Although this constitutes a\nlarge uncertainty for a measurement of $H_0$, it is anticipated that the\nprecision will improve to a competitive level once a greater number of AGNs are\naccessible following the upgrade of GRAVITY in the near future. From SARM\nanalysis, the black hole masses of the four quasars are also measured with the\nstatistical uncertainty ranging from 0.06 to 0.23 dex, consistent with the\ncorrelations between black hole masses and properties of the host bulges.",

    "abstract": "Accurate beam alignment is a critical challenge in XL-MIMO systems,\nespecially in the near-field regime, where conventional far-field assumptions\nno longer hold. Although 2D grid-based codebooks in the polar domain are widely\naccepted for capturing near-field effects, they often suffer from high\ncomplexity and inefficiency in both time and computational resources. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel line-of-sight (LoS) near-field beam\nalignment scheme that leverages the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix,\nwhich is commonly used in far-field environments. This approach ensures\nbackward compatibility with the legacy DFT codebook for far-field signals by\nallowing its reuse. By introducing a new method to analyze the energy spread\neffect, we define the concept of an $\\epsilon$-approximated signal subspace,\nspanned by DFT vectors that exhibit significant correlation with the near-field\nchannel vector. Building on this analysis, the proposed hybrid scheme\nintegrates model-based principles with data-driven techniques. Specifically, it\nutilizes the properties of the DFT matrix for efficient coarse alignment while\nemploying a deep neural network (DNN)-aided fine alignment process. The fine\nalignment operates within the reduced search space defined by the coarse\nalignment stage, significantly enhancing accuracy while reducing complexity.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior\nalignment performance while reducing both computational and model complexity\ncompared to existing methods.",

While attention-based architectures and\nself-supervised learning have achieved notable success, their application to\ntabular data remains less effective over linear and tree based models. Although\nseveral breakthroughs have been achieved by models which transform tables into\nuni-modal transformations like image, language and graph, these models often\nunderperform in the presence of feature heterogeneity. To address this gap, we\nintroduce TabGLM (Tabular Graph Language Model), a novel multi-modal\narchitecture designed to model both structural and semantic information from a\ntable. TabGLM transforms each row of a table into a fully connected graph and\nserialized text, which are then encoded using a graph neural network (GNN) and\na text encoder, respectively. By aligning these representations through a\njoint, multi-modal, self-supervised learning objective, TabGLM leverages\ncomplementary information from both modalities, thereby enhancing feature\nlearning. TabGLM's flexible graph-text pipeline efficiently processes\nheterogeneous datasets with significantly fewer parameters over existing Deep\nLearning approaches. Evaluations across 25 benchmark datasets demonstrate\nsubstantial performance gains, with TabGLM achieving an average AUC-ROC\nimprovement of up to 5.56% over State-of-the-Art (SoTA) tabular learning\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous parking has become a critical application in automatic driving\nresearch and development. Parking operations often suffer from limited space\nand complex environments, requiring accurate perception and precise\nmaneuvering. Traditional rule-based parking algorithms struggle to adapt to\ndiverse and unpredictable conditions, while learning-based algorithms lack\nconsistent and stable performance in various scenarios. Therefore, a hybrid\napproach is necessary that combines the stability of rule-based methods and the\ngeneralizability of learning-based methods. Recently, reinforcement learning\n(RL) based policy has shown robust capability in planning tasks. However, the\nsimulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer gap seriously blocks the\nreal-world deployment. To address these problems, we employ a hybrid policy,\nconsisting of a rule-based Reeds-Shepp (RS) planner and a learning-based\nreinforcement learning (RL) planner. A real-time LiDAR-based Occupancy Grid Map\n(OGM) representation is adopted to bridge the sim-to-real gap, leading the\nhybrid policy can be applied to real-world systems seamlessly. We conducted\nextensive experiments both in the simulation environment and real-world\nscenarios, and the result demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms\npure rule-based and learning-based methods.

    "abstract": "The precise identification of tree species is fundamental to forestry,\nconservation, and environmental monitoring. Though many studies have\ndemonstrated that high accuracy can be achieved using bark-based species\nclassification, these models often function as \"black boxes\", limiting\ninterpretability, trust, and adoption in critical forestry applications.\nAttribution-based Explainable AI (XAI) methods have been used to address this\nissue in related works. However, XAI applications are often dependent on local\nfeatures (such as a head shape or paw in animal applications) and cannot\ndescribe global visual features (such as ruggedness or smoothness) that are\npresent in texture-dominant images such as tree bark. Concept-based XAI\nmethods, on the other hand, offer explanations based on global visual features\nwith concepts, but they tend to require large overhead in building external\nconcept image datasets and the concepts can be vague and subjective without\ngood means of precise quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a\nlightweight post-hoc method to interpret visual models for tree species\nclassification using operators and quantifiable concepts. Our approach\neliminates computational overhead, enables the quantification of complex\nconcepts, and evaluates both concept importance and the model's reasoning\nprocess. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first study to explain\nbark vision models in terms of global visual features with concepts.

Next, a\nnonlinear relationship between damping and random disturbances is established\nwith Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE). The uncertainty in the distribution of\ndisturbances is captured by ambiguity sets.

We find that standard estimation techniques are biased, but the sign of\nthis bias depends strongly on this design choice.

Rex builds upon language-based\nsafety to provide safety properties desired by kernel extensions, along with a\nlightweight extralingual runtime for properties that are unsuitable for static\nanalysis, including safe exception handling, stack safety, and termination.\nWith Rex, kernel extensions are written in safe Rust and interact with the\nkernel via a safe interface provided by Rex's kernel crate. No separate static\nverification is needed. Rex addresses usability issues of eBPF kernel\nextensions without compromising performance.",

    "abstract": "Clear monitoring images are crucial for the safe operation of coal mine\nInternet of Video Things (IoVT) systems. However, low illumination and uneven\nbrightness in underground environments significantly degrade image quality,\nposing challenges for enhancement methods that often rely on\ndifficult-to-obtain paired reference images. Additionally, there is a trade-off\nbetween enhancement performance and computational efficiency on edge devices\nwithin IoVT systems.To address these issues, we propose a multimodal image\nenhancement method tailored for coal mine IoVT, utilizing an ISP-CNN fusion\narchitecture optimized for uneven illumination. This two-stage strategy\ncombines global enhancement with detail optimization, effectively improving\nimage quality, especially in poorly lit areas. A CLIP-based multimodal\niterative optimization allows for unsupervised training of the enhancement\nalgorithm. By integrating traditional image signal processing (ISP) with\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN), our approach reduces computational\ncomplexity while maintaining high performance, making it suitable for real-time\ndeployment on edge devices.Experimental results demonstrate that our method\neffectively mitigates uneven brightness and enhances key image quality metrics,\nwith PSNR improvements of 2.9%-4.9%, SSIM by 4.3%-11.4%, and VIF by 4.9%-17.8%\ncompared to seven state-of-the-art algorithms.

    "abstract": "It is the purpose of this paper to give a characterisation of circular light\nrays in a plasma on an axially symmetric and stationary spacetime. We restrict\nto the case of an unmagnetised, pressure-free electron-ion plasma and we assume\nthat the plasma shares the symmetry of the spacetime. As a main tool we use two\npotentials, one for prograde and one for retrograde light rays, whose critical\npoints are exactly the circular light rays in the plasma. In the case that the\nplasma density vanishes, the corresponding equipotential surfaces reduce to the\nrelativistic Von Zeipel cylinders which have been discussed in many papers\nsince the 1970s. In a plasma, the gradients of the potentials give the\ncentrifugal and the Coriolis forces experienced by a light ray, where the\nplasma has an influence only on the centrifugal force. The introduction of\nthese potentials allows us to generalise topological methods that have been\nsuccessfully used for proving the existence or non-existence of circular vacuum\nlight rays to the plasma case.

The pump actuates the resonator\nbeyond the threshold for large-amplitude parametric oscillations, while the\ndrive breaks the symmetry between the parametric phase states. By increasing\nand decreasing a gate voltage to detune $\\omega_0$ in the presence of the pump\nand the drive, we observe a double hysteresis in the response.

There are two\nmethods to measure $R$: 1) A direct determination using spatially resolved\nIntegral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) of the outflow in emission. 2) An indirect\nmethod which uses the absorption troughs from ionic excited states. The column\ndensity ratio between the excited and resonance states yields the outflow\nnumber density. Combined with a knowledge of the outflow's ionization\nparameter, $R$ can be determined. Generally, the IFS method probes $R$ range of\nseveral kpc or more, while the absorption method usually yields $R$ values of\nless than 1 kpc. There is no inconsistency between the two methods as the\ndeterminations come from different objects. Here we report the results of\napplying both methods to the same quasar outflow, where we derive consistent\ndeterminations of $R$ $\\approx$ 5 kpc. This is the first time where the\nindirect absorption $R$ determination is verified by a direct spatially\nresolved IFS observation. In addition, the velocities (and energetics) from the\nIFS and absorption data are also found to be consistent. Therefore, these are\ntwo manifestations of the same outflow. In this paper we concentrate on the\nabsorption $R$ determination for the outflow seen in quasar 3C 191 using\nVLT/X-shooter observations. We also reanalyze an older absorption determination\nfor the outflow based on Keck/HIRES data and find that revised measurement to\nbe consistent with ours.

    "abstract": "From observations, column density ratios or integrated intensity ratios\nbetween some species exhibit monotonic increase or decrease along with the\nevolution of high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs). Such ratios are defined\nas chemical clocks, which can be used to constrain the evolutionary stage. We\nperformed chemical simulations to reproduce the observed column density ratio\nof HC3N/N2H+ and the abundances of these two species across various\nevolutionary stages in HMSFRs. Simultaneously, we identified the chemical\nprocesses responsible for the observed time-dependent trends in these stages.\nOur simulations utilized the astrochemical code Nautilus and the existing 1D\nmodels of HMSFRs that cover four evolutionary stages, accompanied by variations\nin density and temperature throughout the entire evolution. When averaging over\nlarge spatial scales, the best model produced successfully matches the observed\ncolumn density ratio of HC3N/N2H+ and the abundances of the species involved at\nspecific times for each evolutionary stage; that is, the late high-mass\nstarless core stage, the early high-mass protostellar object stage, and the\nearly ultracompact HII stage. HC3N is mainly affected by the warm carbon-chain\nchemistry (WCCC) and its own thermal desorption, while N2H+ is primarily\ninfluenced by the thermal desorption of N2, CO, CH4, NH3, and H2O followed by\ndissociative recombination and ion-molecule reactions. The results obtained\nfrom the best-fitting model timescales broadly agree with statistical\nestimates. Based on our best-fit model, we further examined other 350 ratios\ninvolving 27 species, and 178 ratios exhibit an increasing or decreasing\nevolutionary trend around the best-fit timescales of HC3N/N2H+. Among them, 157\nratios are observable and could be considered as candidate chemical clocks.",

This paper introduces the Judge-Consistency (ConsJudge) method,\nwhich aims to enhance LLMs to generate more accurate evaluations for RAG\nmodels. Specifically, ConsJudge prompts LLMs to generate different judgments\nbased on various combinations of judgment dimensions, utilize the\njudge-consistency to evaluate these judgments and select the accepted and\nrejected judgments for DPO training. Our experiments show that ConsJudge can\neffectively provide more accurate judgments for optimizing RAG models across\nvarious RAG models and datasets.

For instance, Laguerre- and\nInce-Gauss vector beams are ambiguously represented using the same unitary\nsphere, even though their spatial profiles are circular and elliptical,\nrespectively. As such, in this manuscript, we propose a generalisation of the\nHOPS that we call the Higher-Order Poincar\\'e Ellipsoid (HOPE). Our approach\nallows an unambiguous representation of helical Ince-Gauss vector modes of\nellipticity $\\varepsilon$ onto the surface of an ellipsoid of eccentricity $\\bf\ne$, providing a unique way to visualise elliptically-shaped vector modes. We\nprovide a transformation that links the ellipticity $\\varepsilon$ of helical\nInce-Gauss vector modes to the eccentricity $\\bf e$ of an ellipsoid, such that\nthe HOPS is recovered for $\\varepsilon=0$. Since this representation preserves\nthe Stokes parameters formalism, the transition from the HOPS to the HOPE is\nstraightforward, thus making its implementation appealing for the structured\nlight community.

This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by\ncoupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological\ntype, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The\namount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic\nnonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are\nknown to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field\ntheory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source\ncouples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that\nthe work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this\nquasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work\ndistribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit\ncoupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the\nphysical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise\nquantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of\nperformance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation\ntheorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath\nsystem generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other\ntwo alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics.",

    "abstract": "The classic notion of \\emph{truthfulness} requires that no agent has a\nprofitable manipulation -- an untruthful report that, for \\emph{some}\ncombination of reports of the other agents, increases her utility. This strong\nnotion implicitly assumes that the manipulating agent either knows what all\nother agents are going to report, or is willing to take the risk and act as-if\nshe knows their reports.\n  Without knowledge of the others' reports, most manipulations are \\emph{risky}\n-- they might decrease the manipulator's utility for some other combinations of\nreports by the other agents. Accordingly, a recent paper (Bu, Song and Tao,\n``On the existence of truthful fair cake cutting mechanisms'', Artificial\nIntelligence 319 (2023), 103904) suggests a relaxed notion, which we refer to\nas \\emph{risk-avoiding truthfulness (RAT)}, which requires only that no agent\ncan gain from a \\emph{safe} manipulation -- one that is sometimes beneficial\nand never harmful.\n  Truthfulness and RAT are two extremes: the former considers manipulators with\ncomplete knowledge of others, whereas the latter considers manipulators with no\nknowledge at all. In reality, agents often know about some -- but not all -- of\nthe other agents. This paper introduces the \\emph{RAT-degree} of a mechanism,\ndefined as the smallest number of agents whose reports, if known, may allow\nanother agent to safely manipulate, or $n$ if there is no such number. This\nnotion interpolates between classic truthfulness (degree $n$) and RAT (degree\nat least $1$): a mechanism with a higher RAT-degree is harder to manipulate\nsafely.\n  To illustrate the generality and applicability of this concept, we analyze\nthe RAT-degree of prominent mechanisms across various social choice settings,\nincluding auctions, indivisible goods allocations, cake-cutting, voting, and\ntwo-sided matching.",

To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective\nframework, named Glad, to generate video data in a frame-by-frame style. To\nensure the temporal consistency of synthetic video, we introduce a latent\nvariable propagation module, which views the latent features of previous frame\nas noise prior and injects it into the latent features of current frame. In\naddition, we design a streaming data sampler to orderly sample the original\nimage in a video clip at continuous iterations. Given the reference frame, our\nGlad can be viewed as a streaming simulator by generating the videos for\nspecific scenes. Extensive experiments are performed on the widely-used\nnuScenes dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Glad\nachieves promising performance, serving as a strong baseline for online video\ngeneration.

    "abstract": "Point cloud bundle adjustment is critical in large-scale point cloud mapping.\nHowever, it is both computationally and memory intensive, with its complexity\ngrowing cubically as the number of scan poses increases. This paper presents\nBALM3.0, an efficient and distributed large-scale point cloud bundle adjustment\nmethod. The proposed method employs the majorization-minimization algorithm to\ndecouple the scan poses in the bundle adjustment process, thus performing the\npoint cloud bundle adjustment on large-scale data with improved computational\nefficiency. The key difficulty of applying majorization-minimization on bundle\nadjustment is to identify the proper surrogate cost function. In this paper,\nthe proposed surrogate cost function is based on the point-to-plane distance.\nThe primary advantages of decoupling the scan poses via a\nmajorization-minimization algorithm stem from two key aspects. First, the\ndecoupling of scan poses reduces the optimization time complexity from cubic to\nlinear, significantly enhancing the computational efficiency of the bundle\nadjustment process in large-scale environments. Second, it lays the theoretical\nfoundation for distributed bundle adjustment. By distributing both data and\ncomputation across multiple devices, this approach helps overcome the\nlimitations posed by large memory and computational requirements, which may be\ndifficult for a single device to handle. The proposed method is extensively\nevaluated in both simulated and real-world environments. The results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves the same optimal residual with\ncomparable accuracy while offering up to 704 times faster optimization speed\nand reducing memory usage to 1/8.

We then conduct an\nautomated literature analysis of frontier LLMs, reducing the effort of paper\nsurveying and data extraction by more than 93% compared to manual approaches.\nWe validate LLMEvalDB by showing that it reproduces key findings from a recent\nmanual analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and also uncovers new\ninsights that go beyond it, showing, for example, that in-context examples\nbenefit coding & multimodal tasks but offer limited gains in math reasoning\ntasks compared to zero-shot CoT. Our automatically updatable dataset enables\ncontinuous tracking of target models by extracting evaluation studies as new\ndata becomes available. Through LLMEvalDB and empirical analysis, we provide\ninsights into LLMs while facilitating ongoing literature analyses of their\nbehavior.",

    "abstract": "The detection of primordial B-modes, a key probe of cosmic inflation, is\nincreasingly challenged by contamination from weak gravitational lensing\nB-modes induced by large-scale structure (LSS). We present a delensing pipeline\ndesigned to enhance the sensitivity to the inflationary parameter r, minimizing\nreliance on foreground mitigation during lensing reconstruction. Using\nsimulations of Simons Observatory-like CMB observations and Euclid-like LSS\nsurveys in the Northern hemisphere, we demonstrate that excluding low-l modes\n(l<200) effectively mitigates foreground biases, enabling robust lensing\npotential reconstruction using observed CMB polarization maps. We reconstruct\nthe lensing potential with a minimum-variance (MV) quadratic estimator (QE)\napplied to CMB polarization data and combine this with external LSS tracers to\nimprove delensing efficiency. Two complementary methods, the Gradient-order\ntemplate and the Inverse-lensing approach, are used to generate lensing B-mode\ntemplates, which are cross-correlated with observed B-modes. This achieves a 40\npercent reduction in the uncertainty of r with CMB-only reconstruction,\nimproving to 60 percent when incorporating external LSS tracers. We validate\nour results using both the Hamimeche and Lewis likelihood and a Gaussian\napproximation, finding consistent constraints on r.

However, $T_{\\rm form}$ has a global influence on\nall elements, contributing to their overall chemical evolution, albeit\nsecondary to $\\sigma_*$ for most elements.

Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding (MDSD) is a recent\napproach where, when generating each token, a small draft model generates\nmultiple drafts, and the target LLM verifies them in parallel, ensuring that\nthe final output conforms to the target model distribution. The two main design\nchoices in MDSD are the draft sampling method and the verification algorithm.\nFor a fixed draft sampling method, the optimal acceptance rate is a solution to\nan optimal transport problem, but the complexity of this problem makes it\ndifficult to solve for the optimal acceptance rate and measure the gap between\nexisting verification algorithms and the theoretical upper bound. This paper\ndiscusses the dual of the optimal transport problem, providing a way to\nefficiently compute the optimal acceptance rate. For the first time, we measure\nthe theoretical upper bound of MDSD efficiency for vocabulary sizes in the\nthousands and quantify the gap between existing verification algorithms and\nthis bound. We also compare different draft sampling methods based on their\noptimal acceptance rates. Our results show that the draft sampling method\nstrongly influences the optimal acceptance rate, with sampling without\nreplacement outperforming sampling with replacement. Additionally, existing\nverification algorithms do not reach the theoretical upper bound for both\nwithout replacement and with replacement sampling. Our findings suggest that\ncarefully designed draft sampling methods can potentially improve the optimal\nacceptance rate and enable the development of verification algorithms that\nclosely match the theoretical upper bound.",

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end GISCnet with\nsuper-Rayleigh speckle modulation to improve the imaging quality of the GISC\nspectral camera. The structure of GISCnet is very simple but effective, and we\ncan easily adjust the network structure parameters to improve the image\nreconstruction quality. Relative to Rayleigh speckles, our super-Rayleigh\nspeckles modulation exhibits a wealth of detail in reconstructing 3D HSIs.\nAfter evaluating 648 3D HSIs, it was found that the average peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio increased from 27 dB to 31 dB. Overall, the proposed\nGISCnet with super-Rayleigh speckle modulation can effectively improve the\nimaging quality of the GISC spectral camera by taking advantage of both\noptimized super-Rayleigh modulation and deep-learning image reconstruction,\ninspiring joint optimization of light-field modulation and image reconstruction\nto improve ghost imaging performance.",

While the Korean VLBI Network has pioneered the\nuse of simultaneous multi-band systems for routine FPT up to an observing\nfrequency of 130 GHz, this technique remains largely untested in the\n(sub)millimeter regime. A recent effort has been made to outfit dual-band\nsystems at (sub)millimeter observatories participating in the Event Horizon\nTelescope (EHT) and to test the feasibility and performance of FPT up to the\nobserving frequencies of the EHT. We present the results of simultaneous\ndual-frequency observations conducted in January 2024 on an Earth-sized\nbaseline between the IRAM 30-m in Spain and the JCMT and SMA in Hawai`i.

We show that the application of FPT systematically\nincreases the 215 GHz coherence on all averaging timescales.

The MRI images from BraTS datasets were used in this work. The images\nwere pre-processed using max-min normalization to ensure consistency in pixel\nintensity values across different images. The segmentation of the necrotic\ncore, peritumoral edema, and enhancing tumor was performed on 2D and 3D images\nseparately using UNET architecture. Further, the segmented regions from\nmultimodal MRI images were fused using the weighted averaging technique.\nIntegrating 2D and 3D segmented outputs enhances classification accuracy by\ncapturing detailed features like tumor shape, boundaries, and intensity\ndistribution in slices, while also providing a comprehensive view of spatial\nextent, shape, texture, and localization within the brain volume. The fused\nimages were used as input to the pre-trained ResNet50 model for glioma subclass\nclassification.

To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive\nstudy of the prevalent reward shaping methods.

However,\napplying LLMs to the communication domain faces three major challenges: 1)\nInadequate communication data; 2) Restricted input modalities; and 3)\nDifficulty in knowledge retrieval. To overcome these issues, we propose\nCommGPT, a multimodal foundation model designed specifically for\ncommunications. First, we create high-quality pretraining and fine-tuning\ndatasets tailored in communication, enabling the LLM to engage in further\npretraining and fine-tuning with communication concepts and knowledge. Then, we\ndesign a multimodal encoder to understand and process information from various\ninput modalities. Next, we construct a Graph and Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(GRG) framework, efficiently coupling Knowledge Graph (KG) with\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for multi-scale learning. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the CommGPT through\nexperimental validation.",

While recent advances have\nproduced efficient memory-free methods in the offline CL (offCL) setting, where\ntasks are known in advance and data can be revisited, online CL (onCL) remains\ndominated by memory-based approaches. The transition from offCL to onCL is\nchallenging, as many offline methods rely on (1) prior knowledge of task\nboundaries and (2) sophisticated scheduling or optimization schemes, both of\nwhich are unavailable when data arrives sequentially and can be seen only once.\nIn this paper, we investigate the adaptation of state-of-the-art memory-free\noffCL methods to the online setting. We first show that augmenting these\nmethods with lightweight prototypes significantly improves performance, albeit\nat the cost of increased Gradient Imbalance, resulting in a biased learning\ntowards earlier tasks. To address this issue, we introduce Fine-Grained\nHypergradients, an online mechanism for rebalancing gradient updates during\ntraining. Our experiments demonstrate that the synergy between prototype memory\nand hypergradient reweighting substantially enhances the performance of\nmemory-free methods in onCL and surpasses onCL baselines.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are one of the most important killer computer\napplications. The recent algorithmic advancement proposes a fine-grained\ngroup-wise quantization for LLMs, which treats a small set (e.g., 64) of values\nin a tensor as a compression unit. It effectively preserves the model accuracy\nwithout retraining, and has become the standard approach to efficiently deploy\nLLMs. On the other hand, there are works that propose various adaptive data\ntypes to better adapt to different distributions and further reduce the\nrequired bit length for LLMs. In this work, our detailed analysis unveils a key\nfinding that while different tensors exhibit similar distributions, small\ngroups can have markedly different distributions. As such, the group-level\ndiversity requires a new level of adaptivity for which existing adaptive data\ntypes fail to provide.\n  In this paper, we propose MANT, a mathematically adaptive numeric type,\nfeaturing a more flexible encoding paradigm with a wider range of data\ndistribution and more efficient decodingcomputation fusion mechanism to address\nthese challenges. Based on MANT, we develop a supporting framework to assign\nthe appropriate data type for each group adaptively. Meanwhile, the dynamically\ngenerated Key-Value (KV) caches in LLMs introduce further complexity for\nreal-time quantization. To tackle this, we propose an efficient real-time\nquantization mechanism. Besides, we implement a specific processing element\n(PE) to efficiently support MANT and incorporate a real-time quantization unit.\nBy integrating these components into a systolic array, MANT unifies the\ngroup-wise weight and KV cache quantization and addresses the associated\nchallenges. Our evaluation shows achieving, on average, 2.99x (up to 4.46x)\nspeedup and 2.81x (up to 4.10x) energy reduction to the state-of-the-art LLM\naccelerator.",

    "abstract": "We propose one-at-a-time knockoffs (OATK), a new methodology for detecting\nimportant explanatory variables in linear regression models while controlling\nthe false discovery rate (FDR). For each explanatory variable, OATK generates a\nknockoff design matrix that preserves the Gram matrix by replacing\none-at-a-time only the single corresponding column of the original design\nmatrix. OATK is a substantial relaxation and simplification of the knockoff\nfilter by Barber and Cand\\`es (BC), which simultaneously generates all columns\nof the knockoff design matrix to satisfy a much larger set of constraints. To\ntest each variable's importance, statistics are then constructed by comparing\nthe original vs. knockoff coefficients. Under a mild correlation assumption on\nthe original design matrix, OATK asymptotically controls the FDR at any desired\nlevel.

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable performance of vision language models (VLMs) such as\nContrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP), the large size of these models\nis a considerable obstacle to their use in federated learning (FL) systems\nwhere the parameters of local client models need to be transferred to a global\nserver for aggregation. Another challenge in FL is the heterogeneity of data\nfrom different clients, which affects the generalization performance of the\nsolution. In addition, natural pre-trained VLMs exhibit poor generalization\nability in the medical datasets, suggests there exists a domain gap. To solve\nthese issues, we introduce a novel method for the Federated Adversarial\nAdaptation (FAA) of CLIP. Our method, named FAA-CLIP, handles the large\ncommunication costs of CLIP using a light-weight feature adaptation module\n(FAM) for aggregation, effectively adapting this VLM to each client's data\nwhile greatly reducing the number of parameters to transfer. By keeping CLIP\nfrozen and only updating the FAM parameters, our method is also computationally\nefficient. Unlike existing approaches, our FAA-CLIP method directly addresses\nthe problem of domain shifts across clients via a domain adaptation (DA)\nmodule. This module employs a domain classifier to predict if a given sample is\nfrom the local client or the global server, allowing the model to learn\ndomain-invariant representations. Extensive experiments on six different\ndatasets containing both natural and medical images demonstrate that FAA-CLIP\ncan generalize well on both natural and medical datasets compared to recent FL\napproaches.

In response, we present QueryAdapter; a novel framework for\nrapidly adapting a pre-trained VLM in response to a natural language query.\nQueryAdapter leverages unlabelled data collected during previous deployments to\nalign VLM features with semantic classes related to the query. By optimising\nlearnable prompt tokens and actively selecting objects for training, an adapted\nmodel can be produced in a matter of minutes. We also explore how objects\nunrelated to the query should be dealt with when using real-world data for\nadaptation. In turn, we propose the use of object captions as negative class\nlabels, helping to produce better calibrated confidence scores during\nadaptation. Extensive experiments on ScanNet++ demonstrate that QueryAdapter\nsignificantly enhances object retrieval performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised VLM adapters and 3D scene graph methods.\nFurthermore, the approach exhibits robust generalization to abstract affordance\nqueries and other datasets, such as Ego4D.",

PASA introduces two novel techniques:\nonline pseudo-average shifting and global recovering. These techniques enable\nthe use of half-precision computation throughout the Flash Attention process\nwithout incurring overflow instability or unacceptable numerical accuracy loss.\nThis algorithm enhances performance on memory-restricted AI hardware\narchitectures, such as the Ascend Neural-network Processing Unit(NPU), by\nreducing data movement and increasing computational FLOPs. The algorithm is\nvalidated using both designed random benchmarks and real large models.

Specifically, overflow arises due\nto the large bias in the sequence dimension and the resonance mechanism between\nthe query and key in the head dimension of the Stable-Video-Diffusion models.\nThe resonance mechanism is defined as phase coincidence or 180-degree phase\nshift between query and key matrices. It will remarkably amplify the element\nvalues of attention score matrix.

Despite\nthis, existing benchmarks such as DS-1000 are limited, as they primarily focus\non small DL code snippets related to pre/post-processing tasks and lack a\ncomprehensive coverage of the full DL pipeline, including different DL phases\nand input data types.\n  To address this, we introduce DeepBench, a novel benchmark dataset designed\nfor function-level DL code generation. DeepBench categorizes DL problems based\non three key aspects: phases such as pre-processing, model construction, and\ntraining; tasks, including classification, regression, and recommendation; and\ninput data types such as tabular, image, and text.\n  GPT-4o -- the state-of-the-art LLM -- achieved 31% accuracy on DeepBench,\nsignificantly lower than its 60% on DS-1000.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks on deep learning models have proliferated in recent\nyears. In many cases, a different adversarial perturbation is required to be\nadded to each image to cause the deep learning model to misclassify it. This is\nineffective as each image has to be modified in a different way. Meanwhile,\nresearch on universal perturbations focuses on designing a single perturbation\nthat can be applied to all images in a data set, and cause a deep learning\nmodel to misclassify the images. This work advances the field of universal\nperturbations by exploring universal perturbations in the context of traffic\nsigns and autonomous vehicle systems. This work introduces a novel method for\ngenerating universal perturbations that visually look like simple black and\nwhite stickers, and using them to cause incorrect street sign predictions.\nUnlike traditional adversarial perturbations, the adversarial universal\nstickers are designed to be applicable to any street sign: same sticker, or\nstickers, can be applied in same location to any street sign and cause it to be\nmisclassified. Further, to enable safe experimentation with adversarial images\nand street signs, this work presents a virtual setting that leverages Street\nView images of street signs, rather than the need to physically modify street\nsigns, to test the attacks. The experiments in the virtual setting demonstrate\nthat these stickers can consistently mislead deep learning models used commonly\nin street sign recognition, and achieve high attack success rates on dataset of\nUS traffic signs. The findings highlight the practical security risks posed by\nsimple stickers applied to traffic signs, and the ease with which adversaries\ncan generate adversarial universal stickers that can be applied to many street\nsigns.",

    "abstract": "Understanding convergent learning -- the degree to which independently\ntrained neural systems -- whether multiple artificial networks or brains and\nmodels -- arrive at similar internal representations -- is crucial for both\nneuroscience and AI. Yet, the literature remains narrow in scope -- typically\nexamining just a handful of models with one dataset, relying on one alignment\nmetric, and evaluating networks at a single post-training checkpoint. We\npresent a large-scale audit of convergent learning, spanning dozens of vision\nmodels and thousands of layer-pair comparisons, to close these long-standing\ngaps. First, we pit three alignment families against one another -- linear\nregression (affine-invariant), orthogonal Procrustes\n(rotation-/reflection-invariant), and permutation/soft-matching\n(unit-order-invariant). We find that orthogonal transformations align\nrepresentations nearly as effectively as more flexible linear ones, and\nalthough permutation scores are lower, they significantly exceed chance,\nindicating a privileged representational basis. Tracking convergence throughout\ntraining further shows that nearly all eventual alignment crystallizes within\nthe first epoch -- well before accuracy plateaus -- indicating it is largely\ndriven by shared input statistics and architectural biases, not by the final\ntask solution. Finally, when models are challenged with a battery of\nout-of-distribution images, early layers remain tightly aligned, whereas deeper\nlayers diverge in proportion to the distribution shift. These findings fill\ncritical gaps in our understanding of representational convergence, with\nimplications for neuroscience and AI.",

    "abstract": "Online structured prediction is a task of sequentially predicting outputs\nwith complex structures based on inputs and past observations, encompassing\nonline classification. Recent studies showed that in the full-information\nsetting, we can achieve finite bounds on the \\textit{surrogate regret}, i.e.\nthe extra target loss relative to the best possible surrogate loss. In\npractice, however, full-information feedback is often unrealistic as it\nrequires immediate access to the whole structure of complex outputs. Motivated\nby this, we propose algorithms that work with less demanding feedback, bandit\nand delayed feedback. For bandit feedback, by using a standard inverse-weighted\ngradient estimator, we achieve a surrogate regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{KT})$ for\nthe time horizon $T$ and the size of the output set $K$. However, $K$ can be\nextremely large when outputs are highly complex, resulting in an undesirable\nbound. To address this issue, we propose another algorithm that achieves a\nsurrogate regret bound of $O(T^{2/3})$, which is independent of $K$. This is\nachieved with a carefully designed pseudo-inverse matrix estimator.\nFurthermore, we numerically compare the performance of these algorithms, as\nwell as existing ones. Regarding delayed feedback, we provide algorithms and\nregret analyses that cover various scenarios, including full-information and\nbandit feedback, as well as fixed and variable delays.",
