    "abstract": "The proliferation of fake news in the digital age has raised critical\nconcerns, particularly regarding its impact on societal trust and democratic\nprocesses. Diverging from conventional agent-based simulation approaches, this\nwork introduces an innovative approach by employing a large language model\n(LLM)-driven multi-agent simulation to replicate complex interactions within\ninformation ecosystems. We investigate key factors that facilitate news\npropagation, such as agent personalities and network structures, while also\nevaluating strategies to combat misinformation. Through simulations across\nvarying network structures, we demonstrate the potential of LLM-based agents in\nmodeling the dynamics of misinformation spread, validating the influence of\nagent traits on the diffusion process. Our findings emphasize the advantages of\nLLM-based simulations over traditional techniques, as they uncover underlying\ncauses of information spread -- such as agents promoting discussions -- beyond\nthe predefined rules typically employed in existing agent-based models.\nAdditionally, we evaluate three countermeasure strategies, discovering that\nbrute-force blocking influential agents in the network or announcing news\naccuracy can effectively mitigate misinformation. However, their effectiveness\nis influenced by the network structure, highlighting the importance of\nconsidering network structure in the development of future misinformation\ncountermeasures.",

Federated Learning (FL) offers an\nappealing solution by preserving user privacy, as sensitive data remains on\nlocal devices during training. Nonetheless, integrating PEFT methods into FL\nintroduces two main challenges: communication overhead and data heterogeneity.\nIn this paper, we introduce FedTT and FedTT+, methods for adapting LLMs by\nintegrating tensorized adapters into client-side models' encoder/decoder\nblocks. FedTT is versatile and can be applied to both cross-silo FL and\nlarge-scale cross-device FL. FedTT+, an extension of FedTT tailored for\ncross-silo FL, enhances robustness against data heterogeneity by adaptively\nfreezing portions of tensor factors, further reducing the number of trainable\nparameters.

A key\nfunction of a DAO is collective decision-making, typically carried out through\na series of proposals where members vote on organizational events using\ngovernance tokens, signifying relative influence within the DAO. In just a few\nyears, the deployment of DAOs surged with a total treasury of $24.5 billion and\n11.1M governance token holders collectively managing decisions across over\n13,000 DAOs as of 2024. In this study, we examine the operational dynamics of\n100 DAOs, like pleasrdao, lexdao, lootdao, optimism collective, uniswap, etc.\nWith large-scale empirical analysis of a diverse set of DAO categories and\nsmart contracts and by leveraging on-chain (e.g., voting results) and off-chain\ndata, we examine factors such as voting power, participation, and DAO\ncharacteristics dictating the level of decentralization, thus, the efficiency\nof management structures. As such, our study highlights that increased\ngrassroots participation correlates with higher decentralization in a DAO, and\nlower variance in voting power within a DAO correlates with a higher level of\ndecentralization, as consistently measured by Gini metrics. These insights\nclosely align with key topics in political science, such as the allocation of\npower in decision-making and the effects of various governance models. We\nconclude by discussing the implications for researchers, and practitioners,\nemphasizing how these factors can inform the design of democratic governance\nsystems in emerging applications that require active engagement from\nstakeholders in decision-making.",

Both increasing and decreasing nonlinearities are considered. Our\nanalysis is exhaustive both analytically and numerically as we examine the\nbifurcations of the system for various combinations of increasing and\ndecreasing nonlinearities. We identify rich bifurcation patterns including\nBautin, Bogdanov-Takens, cusp, fold, homoclinic, and Hopf bifurcations whose\nexistence depend on the derivative signs of nonlinearities. Our analysis\nconfirms many of these patterns in the limit where the nonlinearities are\nswitch-like and change their value abruptly at a threshold.

However, the pervasively used M2D latency metric, which measures\nthe delay between the most recent motion and its corresponding display update,\nonly accounts for head motions. This oversight can leave users prone to motion\nsickness if significant body motion is involved. Although existing methods\noptimize M2D latency through asynchronous task scheduling and reprojection\nmethods, they introduce challenges like resource contention between tasks and\noutdated pose data. These challenges are further complicated by user motion\ndynamics and scene changes during runtime. To address these issues, we for the\nfirst time introduce the C2D latency metric, which captures the delay caused by\nbody motions, and present BOXR, a framework designed to co-optimize both body\nand head motion delays within an XR system. BOXR enhances the coordination\nbetween M2D and C2D latencies by efficiently scheduling tasks to avoid\ncontentions while maintaining an up-to-date pose in the output frame. Moreover,\nBOXR incorporates a motion-driven visual inertial odometer to adjust to user\nmotion dynamics and employs scene-dependent foveated rendering to manage\nchanges in the scene effectively. Our evaluations show that BOXR significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art solutions in 11 EuRoC MAV datasets across 4 XR\napplications across 3 hardware platforms. In controlled motion and scene\nsettings, BOXR reduces M2D and C2D latencies by up to 63% and 27%, respectively\nand increases frame rate by up to 43%. In practical deployments, BOXR achieves\nsubstantial reductions in real-world scenarios up to 42% in M2D latency and 31%\nin C2D latency while maintaining remarkably low miss rates of only 1.6% for M2D\nrequirements and 1.0% for C2D requirements.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL), an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,\nhas been applied to various privacy-preserving scenarios. However, due to its\ndistributed nature, FL faces two key issues: the non-independent and identical\ndistribution (non-IID) of user data and vulnerability to Byzantine threats. To\naddress these challenges, in this paper, we propose FedCAP, a robust FL\nframework against both data heterogeneity and Byzantine attacks. The core of\nFedCAP is a model update calibration mechanism to help a server capture the\ndifferences in the direction and magnitude of model updates among clients.\nFurthermore, we design a customized model aggregation rule that facilitates\ncollaborative training among similar clients while accelerating the model\ndeterioration of malicious clients. With a Euclidean norm-based anomaly\ndetection mechanism, the server can quickly identify and permanently remove\nmalicious clients. Moreover, the impact of data heterogeneity and Byzantine\nattacks can be further mitigated through personalization on the client side. We\nconduct extensive experiments, comparing multiple state-of-the-art baselines,\nto demonstrate that FedCAP performs well in several non-IID settings and shows\nstrong robustness under a series of poisoning attacks.",

To address these issues, knowledge graphs (KGs) have\nbeen utilized to enhance LLM reasoning through their structured knowledge.\nHowever, existing KG-enhanced methods, either retrieval-based or agent-based,\nencounter difficulties in accurately retrieving knowledge and efficiently\ntraversing KGs at scale. In this work, we introduce graph-constrained reasoning\n(GCR), a novel framework that bridges structured knowledge in KGs with\nunstructured reasoning in LLMs. To eliminate hallucinations, GCR ensures\nfaithful KG-grounded reasoning by integrating KG structure into the LLM\ndecoding process through KG-Trie, a trie-based index that encodes KG reasoning\npaths. KG-Trie constrains the decoding process, allowing LLMs to directly\nreason on graphs and generate faithful reasoning paths grounded in KGs.\nAdditionally, GCR leverages a lightweight KG-specialized LLM for\ngraph-constrained reasoning alongside a powerful general LLM for inductive\nreasoning over multiple reasoning paths, resulting in accurate reasoning with\nzero reasoning hallucination. Extensive experiments on several KGQA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that GCR achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong\nzero-shot generalizability to unseen KGs without additional training.",

This paper develops an Alexandrov topological semantics of\nintuitionistic propositional modal logic internally in any elementary topos.\nThis is done by constructing interior and closure operators on the power-object\nassociated to a given relation in the ambient topos. When the relation is an\norder, these operators model intuitionistic S4; when the relation is an\nequivalence relation, they also model the characteristic (B) axiom of classical\nS5. The running example of interest arises from the Branching space-time of\nNuel Belnap, which is shown to induce a histories presheaf upon which can be\ndefined an equivalence relation of being obviously undivided at a given point\nevent.

    "abstract": "We numerically investigate a crucial parameter for understanding particle\nacceleration theory via turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection: the particle\nacceleration time. We examine particles accelerated either during the jet's\ndynamic evolution or in a post-processing, nearly stationary regime. We derive\nthe particle acceleration time and compare it with theoretical predictions for\nboth the Fermi and drift regimes identified in the simulations. In the Fermi\nregime, the acceleration time is expected to be independent of the particles'\nenergy, for constant reconnection velocity, as energy increases exponentially\nwith time. Conversely, we expect the reconnection acceleration time to depend\non the current sheet's thickness and the reconnection velocity, a dependence\nrecently revisited by xu and lazarian 2023. They identified three conditions\nfor \\(t_{acc}\\). We tested these relations using statistical distributions of\nthe current sheets' thickness and reconnection velocities in the turbulent jet\nover time. The resulting average value of \\(t_{acc}\\) was found to be nearly\nconstant with particle energy. We compared this acceleration time with the\naverage acceleration time derived directly from 50,000 particles accelerated in\nsitu in the same relativistic jet. When considering a longer time interval for\nparticle acceleration in a nearly stationary snapshot of the turbulent jet, we\nfind that the acceleration time during the Fermi regime remains nearly\nindependent of particle energy and aligns with the acceleration time\ntheoretical relations up to the threshold energy, attained when the particles\nLarmor radius becomes as large as the thickness of the largest current sheets.\nBeyond this threshold, the acceleration regime shifts to the slower drift\nregime, showing strong energy dependence, as predicted. The results also\nindicate a clear dominance of the Fermi regime of acceleration.",

Utilization of\nthe multiconfigurational time dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB) to\nsolve the many-boson Schroedinger equation, facilitates to understand the\nmicroscopic effect of disorder on the different kinds of Mott phases in the\nprimary lattice. The many-body properties are analyzed by distinct measures of\nthe reduced one-body density in real and momentum space, fragmentation, order\nparameter, variance of spatial single-shot measurements, compressibility and\nthe Glauber normalized correlation functions. We find very complex competition\nof localization due to disorder and Mott correlation. We observe distinct\nresponse of four different Mott phases in the disordered lattice. When the\nweakly interacting Mott exhibits the Bose Glass phase, the strongly correlated\nand fully fragmented Mott exhibits leakage, melting and central localization.\nIn contrast, weak Mott with double filling which is a spatially separated dimer\nin each site, exhibits only some dissociation of intra-well coherence and\nassist in the development of inter-well coherence in the presence of strong\ndisorder.

Drawing from structuralist and post-structuralist theories\nof language-specifically the works of Ferdinand de Saussure and Jacques\nDerrida-I argue that LLMs should be understood as models of language itself,\naligning with Derrida's concept of 'writing' (l'ecriture). The paper is\nstructured into three parts. First, I lay the theoretical groundwork by\nexplaining how the word2vec embedding algorithm operates within Saussure's\nframework of language as a relational system of signs. Second, I apply\nDerrida's critique of Saussure to position 'writing' as the object modeled by\nLLMs, offering a view of the machine's 'mind' as a statistical approximation of\nsign behavior. Finally, the third section addresses how modern LLMs reflect\npost-structuralist notions of unfixed meaning, arguing that the \"next token\ngeneration\" mechanism effectively captures the dynamic nature of meaning. By\nreconceptualizing LLMs as semiotic machines rather than cognitive models, this\nframework provides an alternative lens through which to assess the strengths\nand limitations of LLMs, offering new avenues for future research.",

Most AAD algorithms are relying on the increase in neural\nentrainment to the envelope of attended speech, as compared to unattended\nspeech, typically using a two-step approach. First, the algorithm predicts\nrepresentations of the attended speech signal envelopes; second, it identifies\nthe attended speech by finding the highest correlation between the predictions\nand the representations of the actual speech signals.

    "abstract": "Large scale grid expansion planning studies are essential to rapidly and\nefficiently decarbonizing the electricity sector. These studies help policy\nmakers and grid participants understand which renewable generation, storage,\nand transmission assets should be built and where they will be most cost\neffective or have the highest emissions impact. However, these studies are\noften either too computationally expensive to run repeatedly or too coarsely\nmodeled to give actionable decision information. In this study, we present an\nimplicit gradient descent algorithm to solve expansion planning studies at\nscale, i.e., problems with many scenarios and large network models. Our\nalgorithm is also interactive: given a base plan, planners can modify\nassumptions and data then quickly receive an updated plan. This allows the\nplanner to study expansion outcomes for a wide variety of technology cost,\nweather, and electrification assumptions. We demonstrate the scalability of our\ntool, solving a case with over a hundred million variables. Then, we show that\nusing warm starts can speed up subsequent runs by as much as 100x. We highlight\nhow this can be used to quickly conduct storage cost uncertainty analysis.",

However, the flexibility of\nagents' actions or tipping points in the environmental process can change the\nqualitative dynamics of the system. As a result, new causal relationships may\nemerge, while existing ones change or disappear, resulting in an altered causal\ngraph. To analyze these qualitative changes on the causal graph, we propose the\nconcept of meta-causal states, which groups classical causal models into\nclusters based on equivalent qualitative behavior and consolidates specific\nmechanism parameterizations. We demonstrate how meta-causal states can be\ninferred from observed agent behavior, and discuss potential methods for\ndisentangling these states from unlabeled data. Finally, we direct our analysis\ntowards the application of a dynamical system, showing that meta-causal states\ncan also emerge from inherent system dynamics, and thus constitute more than a\ncontext-dependent framework in which mechanisms emerge only as a result of\nexternal factors.",

Reachability-type decision problems\nof linear dynamical systems, most notably the Skolem Problem, lie at the\nforefront of decidability: typically, sound and complete algorithms are known\nonly in low dimensions, and these rely on sophisticated tools from number\ntheory and Diophantine approximation. Recently, however, o-minimality has\nemerged as a counterpoint to these number-theoretic tools that allows us to\ndecide certain modifications of the classical problems of LDS without any\ndimension restrictions. In this paper, we first introduce the Decomposition\nMethod, a framework that captures all applications of o-minimality to decision\nproblems of LDS that are currently known to us. We then use the Decomposition\nMethod to show decidability of the Robust Safety Problem (restricted to bounded\ninitial sets) in arbitrary dimension: given a matrix $M$, a bounded\nsemialgebraic set $S$ of initial points, and a semialgebraic set $T$ of unsafe\npoints, it is decidable whether there exists $\\varepsilon > 0$ such that all\norbits that begin in the $\\varepsilon$-ball around $S$ avoid $T$.",

In these devices, photocurrent generation is\nprimarily attributed to the photovoltaic (PV) effect, driven by electron hole\nseparations, and the photothermoelectric (PTE) effect, which results from\ntemperature gradients via the Seebeck effect. As devices shrink, the overlap of\nthese mechanisms-both dependent on the Fermi level and band\nstructure-complicates their separate evaluation at the nanoscale. This study\nintroduces a novel 3D photocurrent nano-imaging technique specifically designed\nto distinctly map these mechanisms in a Schottky barrier photodiode featuring a\nmolybdenum disulfide and gold (MoS2 Au) interface. We uncover a significant\nPTE-dominated region extending several hundred nanometers from the electrode\nedge, a characteristic facilitated by the weak electrostatic forces typical in\n2D materials. Unexpectedly, we find that incorporating hexagonal boron nitride\n(hBN), known for its high thermal conductivity, markedly enhances the PTE\nresponse. This counterintuitive enhancement stems from an optimal overlap\nbetween thermal and Seebeck profiles, presenting a new pathway to boost device\nperformance.

However, if the mean is near the\nboundary of the probability simplex, then a Dirichlet distribution becomes\nhighly concentrated either (i) at the mean or (ii) extremely close to the\nboundary. Consequently, centering at the mean provides poor control over the\nlocation and scale near the boundary. In this article, we introduce a method\nfor improved control over the location and scale of Beta and Dirichlet\ndistributions.

As a result, executing TL is often challenging for individual model\ndevelopers. Federated Learning (FL) addresses these issues by facilitating\ncollaborations among clients, expanding the dataset indirectly, distributing\ncomputational costs, and preserving privacy. However, key challenges remain\nunresolved. First, existing FL methods tend to optimize transferability only\nwithin local domains, neglecting the global learning domain. Second, most\napproaches rely on indirect transferability metrics, which do not accurately\nreflect the final target loss or true degree of transferability. To address\nthese gaps, we propose two enhancements to FL. First, we introduce a\nclient-server exchange protocol that leverages cross-client Jacobian (gradient)\nnorms to boost transferability. Second, we increase the average Jacobian norm\nacross clients at the server, using this as a local regularizer to reduce\ncross-client Jacobian variance. Our transferable federated algorithm, termed\nFedGTST (Federated Global Transferability via Statistics Tuning), demonstrates\nthat increasing the average Jacobian and reducing its variance allows for\ntighter control of the target loss. This leads to an upper bound on the target\nloss in terms of the source loss and source-target domain discrepancy.\nExtensive experiments on datasets such as MNIST to MNIST-M and CIFAR10 to SVHN\nshow that FedGTST outperforms relevant baselines, including FedSR. On the\nsecond dataset pair, FedGTST improves accuracy by 9.8% over FedSR and 7.6% over\nFedIIR when LeNet is used as the backbone.",

Current\nresearch on this disease using mouse models faces challenges since it involves\naccurately segmenting the developing cartilage in 3D micro-CT images of\nembryonic mice. Tackling this segmentation task with deep learning (DL) methods\nis laborious due to the big burden of manual image annotation, expensive due to\nthe high acquisition costs of 3D micro-CT images, and difficult due to\nembryonic cartilage's complex and rapidly changing shapes. While DL approaches\nhave been proposed to automate cartilage segmentation, most such models have\nlimited accuracy and generalizability, especially across data from different\nembryonic age groups.

However, the inherent complexity of fully coupled multi-physics models\noften necessitates simplifying assumptions, which may overlook key phenomena\nthat significantly affect heat loads, particularly radiative heating. Common\napproximations include neglecting the contribution of ablation products,\napplying simplified frozen wall boundary conditions, or treating radiative\ntransfer in a loosely coupled manner. This study introduces a high-fidelity,\ntightly coupled multi-solver framework designed to accurately capture the\nmulti-physics challenges of hypersonic flow around an ablative body. The\nproposed approach consistently accounts for the interactions between\nshock-heated gases, surface material response, and radiative transfer. Our\nresults demonstrate that including radiative heating in the surface energy\nbalance substantially influences the ablation rate. Ablation products are shown\nto absorb radiative heat flux in the vacuum-ultraviolet spectrum along the\nstagnation line, while strongly emitting in off-stagnation regions. These\nfindings emphasize the necessity of a tightly coupled multiphysics framework to\nfaithfully capture the complex, multidimensional interactions in hypersonic\nflow environments, which conventional, loosely coupled models fail to represent\naccurately.",

A paradigmatic example is the\nPomeau-Manneville (PM) map which, suitably lifted onto the whole real line, was\nshown to generate superdiffusion that can be reproduced by stochastic Levy\nwalks (LWs). Here we report that this matching only holds for parameter values\nof the PM map that are of Lebesgue measure zero in its two-dimensional\nparameter space. This is due to a bifurcation scenario that the map exhibits\nunder variation of one parameter. Constraining this parameter to specific\nsingular values at which the map generates superdiffusion by varying the second\none, as has been done in previous literature, we find quantitative deviations\nbetween deterministic diffusion and diffusion generated by stochastic LWs in a\nparticular range of parameter values, which cannot be cured by simple LW\nmodifcations. We also explore the effect of aging on superdiffusion in the PM\nmap and show that this yields a profound change of the diffusive properties\nunder variation of the aging time, which should be important for experiments.\nOur findings demonstrate that even in this simplest well-studied setting, a\nmatching of deterministic and stochastic diffusive properties is non-trivial.",

Traditional opinion summarization models\nface challenges in handling long inputs and large volumes of reviews, while\nnewer Large Language Model (LLM) approaches often fail to generate accurate and\nfaithful summaries. To address those challenges, this paper introduces (1) a\nnew dataset of long-form user reviews, each entity comprising over a thousand\nreviews, (2) two training-free LLM-based summarization approaches that scale to\nlong inputs, and (3) automatic evaluation metrics.

However, norms and values vary between\ncommunities and go beyond content-level attributes, making it challenging for\nplatforms and researchers to provide automated ways to identify desirable\nbehavior to be highlighted. Current automated approaches to detect desirability\nare limited to measures of prosocial behavior, but we do not know whether these\nmeasures fully capture the spectrum of what communities value. In this paper,\nwe use upvotes, which express community approval, as a proxy for desirability\nand examine 16,000 highly-upvoted comments across 80 popular sub-communities on\nReddit. Using a large language model, we extract values from these comments\nacross two years (2016 and 2022) and compile 64 and 72 $\\textit{macro}$,\n$\\textit{meso}$, and $\\textit{micro}$ values for 2016 and 2022 respectively,\nbased on their frequency across communities.

Finally, we show that our approach\ncan not only extract most of the qualitatively-identified values from prior\ntaxonomies, but also uncover new values that are actually encouraged in\npractice. Our findings highlight the need for nuanced models of desirability\nthat go beyond preexisting prosocial measures.

    "abstract": "A new frequency-stepped Doppler backscattering (DBS) system has been\nintegrated with a real-time steerable electron cyclotron heating launcher to\nprobe local background turbulence (f<10 MHz) and high-frequency (20-550 MHz)\ndensity fluctuations in the DIII-D tokamak. The launcher enables 2D steering\n(horizontal and vertical) over wide angular ranges to optimize probe location\nand wavenumber response, with vertical steering adjustable in real time during\ndischarges. The DBS system utilizes a programmable frequency synthesizer with\nadjustable dwell time, capable of stepping across the E-band frequency range\n(60-90 GHz) in real time, launching either O or X-mode polarized millimeter\nwaves. This setup facilitates diagnosis of the complex spatial structure of\nhigh-power (>200 kW) helicon waves (476 MHz) during current drive experiments.\nReal-time scans reveal broadband density fluctuations around the helicon\nfrequency, attributed to backscattering of the DBS millimeter wave probe from\nplasma turbulence modulated by the helicon wave. These fluctuations appear as\nhigh-frequency sidebands in the turbulence spectrum, effectively 'tagging' the\nbackground turbulence with the helicon wave's electric field. This method\nallows for monitoring local helicon wave amplitude by comparing high-frequency\nsignal amplitude to background turbulence. Coupled with real-time scanning of\nmeasurement location and wavenumber, this allows for rapid helicon wave power\ndistribution determination during steady-state plasma operation, potentially\nvalidating predictive models like GENRAY or AORSA for helicon current drive in\nDIII-D plasmas.",

However, existing approaches only operate on\nstatic structures, neglecting the fact that physical systems are always dynamic\nin nature. In this work, we propose geometric trajectory diffusion models\n(GeoTDM), the first diffusion model for modeling the temporal distribution of\n3D geometric trajectories. Modeling such distribution is challenging as it\nrequires capturing both the complex spatial interactions with physical\nsymmetries and temporal correspondence encapsulated in the dynamics. We\ntheoretically justify that diffusion models with equivariant temporal kernels\ncan lead to density with desired symmetry, and develop a novel transition\nkernel leveraging SE(3)-equivariant spatial convolution and temporal attention.\nFurthermore, to induce an expressive trajectory distribution for conditional\ngeneration, we introduce a generalized learnable geometric prior into the\nforward diffusion process to enhance temporal conditioning. We conduct\nextensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation in\nvarious scenarios, including physical simulation, molecular dynamics, and\npedestrian motion. Empirical results on a wide suite of metrics demonstrate\nthat GeoTDM can generate realistic geometric trajectories with significantly\nhigher quality.",

This setup is favorable when it is\ndifficult to obtain training data for the target task and when it can be\ndecomposed into multiple skills. First, we identify practically occurring\nuse-cases that can be studied under the realm of skill composition, e.g.\nsolving hard math-word problems with code, creating a bot to answer questions\non proprietary manuals or about domain-specialized corpora. Our main\ncontribution is to show that concatenation of LoRAs (CAT), which optimally\nweights LoRAs that were individually trained on different skills, outperforms\nexisting model- and data- merging techniques; for instance on math-word\nproblems, CAT beats these methods by an average of 43% and 12% respectively.\nThus, this paper advocates model merging as an efficient way to solve\ncompositional tasks and underscores CAT as a simple, compute-friendly and\neffective procedure.

    "abstract": "Approximating partial differential equations for extensive industrial and\nscientific applications requires leveraging the power of modern\nhigh-performance computing. In large-scale parallel computations, the\ngeometrical discretisation rapidly becomes a bottleneck in the simulation\npipeline. Unstructured mesh generation is hardly automatic, and meshing\nalgorithms cannot efficiently exploit distributed-memory computers. Adaptive\nCartesian meshes are far more advantageous, providing cheap and scalable mesh\ngeneration, partitioning, and balancing compared to unstructured meshes.\nHowever, Cartesian meshes are not suitable for complex geometries when using\nstandard discretisation techniques. Unfitted finite element methods are a\npromising solution to the abovementioned problems. Nevertheless, their\napplication is usually constrained to implicit (level set) geometrical\nrepresentations. The extension to general geometries, e.g., provided by an STL\nsurface mesh, requires advanced intersection algorithms. This work presents an\nefficient parallel implementation of all the geometric tools required, e.g.,\nfor unfitted finite element methods (in a broad sense), for explicit boundary\nrepresentations. Such geometries can readily be generated using standard\ncomputer-aided design tools. The proposed geometrical workflow utilise a\nmultilevel approach to overlapping computations, effectively eliminating\nbottlenecks in large-scale computations.

Together with perception, they constitute the two major\nthemes of artificial intelligence. While deep learning has pushed the limit of\nperception beyond human-level performance, the progress in reasoning domains is\nway behind. One fundamental reason is that reasoning problems usually have\nflexible structures for both knowledge and queries, and many existing models\nonly perform well on structures seen during training. Here we aim to push the\nboundary of reasoning models by devising algorithms that generalize across\nknowledge and query structures, as well as systems that accelerate development\non structured data. This thesis consists of three parts. In Part I, we study\nmodels that can inductively generalize to unseen knowledge graphs with new\nentity and relation vocabularies. For new entities, we propose a framework that\nlearns neural operators in a dynamic programming algorithm computing path\nrepresentations. For relations, we construct a relation graph to capture the\ninteractions between relations, thereby converting new relations into new\nentities. In Part II, we propose two solutions for generalizing across\nmulti-step queries on knowledge graphs and text respectively. For knowledge\ngraphs, we show that multi-step queries can be solved by multiple calls of\ngraph neural networks and fuzzy logic operations. For text, we devise an\nalgorithm to learn explicit knowledge as textual rules to improve large\nlanguage models on multi-step queries. In Part III, we propose two systems to\nfacilitate machine learning development on structured data. Our library treats\nstructured data as first-class citizens and removes the barrier for developing\nalgorithms on structured data.

We then validate with already\npublished data; in particular, the model confirmed the effect of impaired\nP2Y$_1$ receptor desensitization or reduced RASA3 expression on RAP1\nactivation. We then predict the effect of protein expression levels on integrin\nactivation and show that components of the P2Y$_{12}$ pathway are critical to\nthe regulation of integrin. This model aids in our understanding of\ninterindividual variability in platelet response to ADP and therapeutic\nP2Y$_{12}$ inhibition. It also provides a more detailed view of platelet\nactivation in the ongoing mathematical study of platelet aggregation.",

    "abstract": "We present novel reductions from sample compression schemes in multiclass\nclassification, regression, and adversarially robust learning settings to\nbinary sample compression schemes. Assuming we have a compression scheme for\nbinary classes of size $f(d_\\mathrm{VC})$, where $d_\\mathrm{VC}$ is the VC\ndimension, then we have the following results: (1) If the binary compression\nscheme is a majority-vote or a stable compression scheme, then there exists a\nmulticlass compression scheme of size $O(f(d_\\mathrm{G}))$, where\n$d_\\mathrm{G}$ is the graph dimension. Moreover, for general binary compression\nschemes, we obtain a compression of size $O(f(d_\\mathrm{G})\\log|Y|)$, where $Y$\nis the label space. (2) If the binary compression scheme is a majority-vote or\na stable compression scheme, then there exists an $\\epsilon$-approximate\ncompression scheme for regression over $[0,1]$-valued functions of size\n$O(f(d_\\mathrm{P}))$, where $d_\\mathrm{P}$ is the pseudo-dimension. For general\nbinary compression schemes, we obtain a compression of size\n$O(f(d_\\mathrm{P})\\log(1/\\epsilon))$. These results would have significant\nimplications if the sample compression conjecture, which posits that any binary\nconcept class with a finite VC dimension admits a binary compression scheme of\nsize $O(d_\\mathrm{VC})$, is resolved (Littlestone and Warmuth, 1986; Floyd and\nWarmuth, 1995; Warmuth, 2003). Our results would then extend the proof of the\nconjecture immediately to other settings. We establish similar results for\nadversarially robust learning and also provide an example of a concept class\nthat is robustly learnable but has no bounded-size compression scheme,\ndemonstrating that learnability is not equivalent to having a compression\nscheme independent of the sample size, unlike in binary classification, where\ncompression of size $2^{O(d_\\mathrm{VC})}$ is attainable (Moran and Yehudayoff,\n2016).",

The interaction between these hybrid wind-solar farms and\nthe atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is for the first time addressed in the\npresent study. Idealized large-eddy simulations (LES) are used to investigate\nthe flow through both isolated wind and solar farms, as well as combined\nwind-solar farms, in varying configurations and under different atmospheric\nconditions. When the FPV modules are arranged in long strips parallel to the\nflow direction, secondary motions arise due to the temperature difference\nbetween the warm FPV modules and colder sea surface, significantly affecting\nthe horizontal distribution of mean wind speed in the ABL. Associated\ndowndrafts between the strips increase entrainment of high-speed momentum from\nabove, thereby increasing the wind speed at these locations. LES of hybrid\nwind-solar farms reveals that this is beneficial for wind turbines when they\nare located between the FPV arrays, leading, for the cases that we considered,\nto a farm-averaged power increase of up to 30% compared to an isolated wind\nfarm. It is shown that the ratio between inertial and buoyancy forces,\nquantified by a heterogeneity Richardson number $Ri_h$, plays a crucial role in\nthe formation of secondary flows and the resulting wind-farm power enhancement.\nWe further show that no significant power gains, but also no losses emerge in\nsituations when the solar panels are aligned perpendicular to the flow.\nAlthough the present results suggest a large potential for wind-solar\nhybridization, future research should focus on a wider range of scenarios,\nobtained from a realistic distribution of wind directions and speeds to\nquantify the potential beneficial impact on real annual power production.",

A major\nfactor underlying these behaviors is how the models are finetuned and aligned,\nparticularly the nature and extent of the data used.In this work, we examine\nhow overgenerating finetuning data with advanced teacher models (e.g.,\nGPT-4o)-covering both general-purpose and toxic prompts-affects safety and\nusefulness in instruction-following language models.Additionally, we present\nPOROver, an alignment strategy designed for models that are highly safe but\nprone to overrefusal. POROver employs preference optimization algorithms and\nleverages completions from an advanced teacher model to reduce overrefusals\nwhile maintaining safety.Our results show that overgenerating completions for\ngeneral-purpose prompts significantly boosts safety with only a minimal impact\non usefulness. Specifically, the F1 score calculated between safety and\nusefulness increases from 74.4% to 91.8% because of a substantial rise in\nsafety.

A possible reason is that the\nconflation of time and other variables in time series data can cause the\ngenerated explanations to be incomprehensible to humans.

In our model, a population dynamically forms an\nopinion that reflects its willingness to engage in risky behavior (e.g., not\nwearing a mask in a crowded area) or reduce it (e.g., social distancing). We\nconsider SIS epidemic dynamics in which the contact rate within a population\nadapts as a function of its opinion. For the new coupled model, we prove the\nexistence of two distinct parameter regimes. One regime corresponds to a low\nbaseline infectiousness, and the equilibria of the epidemic spread are\nidentical to those of the standard SIS model. The other regime corresponds to a\nhigh baseline infectiousness, and there is a bistability between two new\nendemic equilibria that reflect an initial preference towards either risk\nseeking behavior or risk aversion. We prove that risk seeking behavior\nincreases the steady-state infection level in the population compared to the\nbaseline SIS model, whereas risk aversion decreases it. When a population is\nhighly reactive to extreme opinions, we show how risk aversion enables the\ncomplete eradication of infection in the population.

    "abstract": "Contemporary machine learning methods will try to approach the Bayes error,\nas it is the lowest possible error any model can achieve. This paper postulates\nthat any decision is composed of not one but two Bayesian decisions and that\ndecision-making is, therefore, a double-Bayesian process. The paper shows how\nthis duality implies intrinsic uncertainty in decisions and how it incorporates\nexplainability. The proposed approach understands that Bayesian learning is\ntantamount to finding a base for a logarithmic function measuring uncertainty,\nwith solutions being fixed points. Furthermore, following this approach, the\ngolden ratio describes possible solutions satisfying Bayes' theorem. The\ndouble-Bayesian framework suggests using a learning rate and momentum weight\nwith values similar to those used in the literature to train neural networks\nwith stochastic gradient descent.",

Prior work towards this objective has been largely\nrestricted to perturbation-based data augmentation where new data points are\ncreated by perturbing the original ones, which has been impressively effective\nfor tasks where the RL agent observes control states as images with\nperturbations including random cropping, shifting, etc. This work focuses on\nstate-based control, where the RL agent can directly observe raw kinematic and\ntask features, and considers an alternative data augmentation applied to these\nfeatures based on Euclidean symmetries under transformations like rotations. We\nshow that the default state features used in exiting benchmark tasks that are\nbased on joint configurations are not amenable to Euclidean transformations. We\ntherefore advocate using state features based on configurations of the limbs\n(i.e., the rigid bodies connected by the joints) that instead provide rich\naugmented data under Euclidean transformations.

Inspired by\nhis ideas, we show how non-Foster circuits can be stabilized with the\napplication of external \\textit{electrical vibration}, i.e., time modulations.\nNon-Foster circuits are highly appreciated in the engineering community since\ntheir bandwidth characteristics are not limited by passive-circuits bounds.\nUnfortunately, non-Foster circuits are usually unstable and they must be\nstabilized prior to operation.

    "abstract": "We present the results of Monte Carlo simulations aimed at exploring the\nevolution towards energy equipartition of first- (1G) and second-generation\n(2G) stars in multiple-population globular clusters and how this evolution is\naffected by the initial differences between the spatial distributions of the\ntwo populations. Our results show that these initial differences have\nfundamental implications for the evolution towards energy equipartition of the\ntwo populations. We find that 2G stars, which are assumed to be initially more\ncentrally concentrated than 1G stars, are generally characterized by a more\nrapid evolution towards energy equipartition. The evolution towards energy\nequipartition depends on the velocity dispersion component and is more rapid\nfor the tangential velocity dispersion. The extent of the present-day\ndifferences between the degree of energy equipartition of 2G and 1G stars\ndepends on the cluster's dynamical age and may be more significant in the\ntangential velocity dispersion and at intermediate distances from the cluster's\ncenter around the half-mass radius.",

In particular we will obtain Maxwell\nequations and Einstein equation in weak field approximation.\n  As is well known, Wigner define a particles as irreducible representation of\nPoincare group [2,3]. But, as Weinberg noted in [4] irreducible representations\nfor massless vector field with helicities $\\pm 1$ do not exist. In the present\narticle we will conform this statement for a wide class of massless fields.\nThey are not Lorentz invariant since their Lorentz transformations have\nadditional term in the form of gauge transformations. Such fields can appear in\nthe theory only in the form which do not depend on corresponding gauge\nparameters. These forms are our equations of motion and they are by definition\ngauge invariant. So, the massless case is significantly different from massive\none. In the end we will show that our approach can reproduce main contributions\nfrom well known articles with highest helicity.",

Objective: Knowing if a programming skill is a prerequisite\nto another would benefit teachers in properly planning the course and\nstructuring the order in which they present activities relating to new content.\nPrior attempts to establish a skill hierarchy have suffered from methodological\nissues. Method: In this study, we used the conviction measure from association\nrule mining to perform pair-wise comparisons of five skills: Write, Trace,\nReverse trace, Sequence, and Explain code. We used the data from four exams\nwith more than 600 participants where students solved programming assignments\nof different skills for several programming topics. Findings: Our findings\nmatched the previous finding that tracing is a prerequisite for students to\nlearn to write code. Contradicting the previous claims, our analysis showed\nthat using the mean threshold writing code is a prerequisite to explaining\ncode. However, there is no clear relationship when we change the threshold to\nthe median. Unlike prior work, we did not find a clear prerequisite\nrelationship between sequencing code and writing or explaining code.\nImplications: Our research can help instructors by systematically arranging the\nskills students exercise when encountering a new topic.

To solve this problem, we propose a SRRIIE dataset with an efficient\nconditional diffusion probabilistic models-based method. The proposed dataset\ncontains 4800 paired low-high quality images. To ensure that the dataset are\nable to model the real-world image degradation in low-illumination\nenvironments, we capture images using an ILDC camera and an optical zoom lens\nwith exposure levels ranging from -6 EV to 0 EV and ISO levels ranging from 50\nto 12800. We comprehensively evaluate with various reconstruction and\nperceptual metrics and demonstrate the practicabilities of the SRRIIE dataset\nfor deep learning-based methods. We show that most existing methods are less\neffective in preserving the structures and sharpness of restored images from\ncomplicated noises. To overcome this problem, we revise the condition for Raw\nsensor data and propose a novel time-melding condition for diffusion\nprobabilistic model. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experimental\nresults on the real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the feasibility and\neffectivenesses of the proposed conditional diffusion probabilistic model on\nRaw sensor data.

    "abstract": "Hydrodynamic modulation of short ocean surface waves by longer ambient waves\nsignificantly influences remote sensing, interpretation of in situ wave\nmeasurements, and numerical wave forecasting. This paper revisits the wave\ncrest and action conservation laws and derives steady, nonlinear, analytical\nsolutions for the change of short-wave wavenumber, action, and gravitational\nacceleration due to the presence of longer waves. We validate the analytical\nsolutions with numerical simulations of the full crest and action conservation\nequations. The nonlinear analytical solutions of short-wave wavenumber,\namplitude, and steepness modulation significantly deviate from the linear\nanalytical solutions of Longuet-Higgins & Stewart (1960), and are similar to\nthe nonlinear numerical solutions by Longuet-Higgins (1987) and Zhang &\nMelville (1990). The short-wave steepness modulation is attributed 5/8 to\nwavenumber, 1/4 due to wave action, and 1/8 due to effective gravity. Examining\nthe homogeneity and stationarity requirements for the conservation of wave\naction reveals that stationarity is a stronger requirement and is generally not\nsatisfied for very steep long waves. We examine the results of Peureux et al.\n(2021) who found through numerical simulations that the short-wave modulation\ngrows unsteadily with each long-wave passage. We show that this unsteady growth\nonly occurs for homogeneous initial conditions as a special case and not\ngenerally. The proposed steady solutions are a good approximation of the\nnonlinear crest-action conservation solutions in long-wave steepness $\\lesssim$\n0.2. Except for a subset of initial conditions, the solutions to the\nnon-linearised crest-action conservation equations are mostly steady in the\nreference frame of the long waves.",

While current research on function\ncalling by LLMs primarily focuses on single-turn interactions, this paper\naddresses the overlooked necessity for LLMs to engage in multi-turn function\ncalling--critical for handling compositional, real-world queries that require\nplanning with functions but not only use functions. To facilitate this, we\nintroduce an approach, BUTTON, which generates synthetic compositional\ninstruction tuning data via bottom-up instruction construction and top-down\ntrajectory generation. In the bottom-up phase, we generate simple atomic tasks\nbased on real-world scenarios and build compositional tasks using heuristic\nstrategies based on atomic tasks. Corresponding function definitions are then\nsynthesized for these compositional tasks. The top-down phase features a\nmulti-agent environment where interactions among simulated humans, assistants,\nand tools are utilized to gather multi-turn function calling trajectories. This\napproach ensures task compositionality and allows for effective function and\ntrajectory generation by examining atomic tasks within compositional tasks. We\nproduce a dataset BUTTONInstruct comprising 8k data points and demonstrate its\neffectiveness through extensive experiments across various LLMs.",

This builds on the\ngeneralized Weyl construction for scalar-vacuum, that admits two, fully\ndecoupled, independent harmonic functions: one for the gravitational sector and\nanother for the scalar sector. Harmonic solutions with growing multipoles lead\nto naked singularities (at spatial infinity), including for the scalar\ncounterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin; harmonic solutions with decaying\n(scalar) multipoles are asymptotically flat, but have a singular horizon, in\naccordance with no-scalar-hair theorems.

In\nour work, we analyze several prominent models such as Whisper, Seamless,\nWav2Vec, HuBERT, and Qwen2-Audio focusing on their learned representations in\nboth paralinguistic and non-paralinguistic tasks from the Dynamic-SUPERB\nbenchmark. Our study addresses three key questions: (1) What non-verbal cues\n(e.g., speaker intent, emotion, environmental context) are captured? (2) How\nare these cues represented across different layers of the models? and (3) To\nwhat extent can these representations be effectively adapted to downstream\ntasks? To answer these questions, we first evaluate the models in a zero-shot\nsetting, followed by fine-tuning on layer-wise features extracted from these\nmodels. Our results provide insights into the models' capacity for\ngeneralization, the characteristics of their layer-wise representations, and\nthe degree of transformation required for downstream task adaptation. Our\nfindings suggest that some of these models perform well on various tasks in\nzero-shot settings, despite not being explicitly trained for those tasks. We\nalso observe that zero-shot performance correlates with better-learned\nrepresentations. The analysis of layer-wise features demonstrates that some\nmodels exhibit a convex relationship between the separability of the learned\nrepresentations and model depth, with different layers capturing task-specific\nfeatures.",

Previous works\nhave applied various techniques, with recent studies focusing on applying\nspeech foundation models (SFMs) for improved performance. However, most prior\nefforts have centered on building individual models for each task separately,\ndespite the inherent similarities among these tasks. This isolated approach\nresults in higher computational resource requirements, increased costs, time\nconsumption, and maintenance challenges. In this study, we address these\nchallenges by employing a multi-task learning strategy. Firstly, we explore the\nvarious state-of-the-art (SOTA) SFMs by extracting their representations for\nlearning these SFTs and investigating their effectiveness at each task\nspecifically. Secondly, we analyze the performance of the extracted\nrepresentations on the SFTs in a multi-task learning framework. We observe a\ndecline in performance when SFTs are modeled together compared to individual\ntask-specific models, and as a remedy, we propose multi-view learning (MVL).\nViews are representations from different SFMs transformed into distinct\nabstract spaces by characteristics unique to each SFM. By leveraging MVL, we\nintegrate these diverse representations to capture complementary information\nacross tasks, enhancing the shared learning process. We introduce a new\nframework called TANGO (Task Alignment with iNter-view Gated Optimal transport)\nto implement this approach.

Experiments using weather stations\nacross the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range\nof data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. They also\nreveal that direct input of station data provides a phase shift in local\nweather forecasting accuracy, reducing the prediction error by up to 80%\ncompared to pure gridded data based models. This approach demonstrates how to\nbridge the gap between large-scale weather models and locally accurate\nforecasts to support high-stakes, location-sensitive decision-making.",

Contrary to previous\npresumptions that all stars above 8 M explode as core-collapse supernovae\n(CCSNe), recent evidence suggests a more complex scenario. Aims. We analyse\niron spread observations from 55 GCs to estimate the number of CCSNe explosions\nbefore SF termination, thereby determining the SF duration. This work for the\nfirst time takes the possibility of failed CCSNe into account, when estimating\nthe SF duration. Methods. Two scenarios are considered: one where all stars\nexplode as CCSNe and another where only stars below 20 M lead to CCSNe, as most\nCCSN models predict that no failed CCSNe happen below 20 M . Results. This\nestablishes a lower ($\\approx$ 3.5 Myr) and an upper ($\\approx$ 10.5 Myr) limit\nfor the duration of SF. Extending the findings of our previous paper, this\nstudy indicates a significant difference in SF duration based on CCSN outcomes,\nwith failed CCSNe extending SF by up to a factor of three. Additionally, a new\ncode is introduced to compute the SF duration for a given CCSN model.\nConclusions. The extended SF has important implications on GC formation,\nincluding enhanced pollution from stellar winds and increased binary star\nencounters. These results underscore the need for a refined understanding of\nCCSNe in estimating SF durations and the formation of multiple stellar\npopulations in GCs.",

We quantify this influence and compute the resulting\nmass underestimates and stellar mass function (MF). N-body simulations of\nrealistic SCs were used to investigate the evolution of the binary population\nin a SC and its tidal tails. Together with an empirically gauged stellar\nmass-luminosity relation, the results were then used to determine how the\npresence of binaries changes the photometric mass and MF of the SC and its\ntails as deduced from observations. Tail 1 (T1), which is the tidal tail caused\nby gas expulsion, contains a larger fraction of binaries than both the SC and\ntail 2 (T2), which forms after gas expulsion. Additionally, T1 has a larger\nvelocity dispersion. Using the luminosity of an unresolved binary, an observer\nwould underestimate its mass. This bias sensitively depends on the companion\nmasses due to the structure of the stellar mass-luminosity relation. Combining\nthe effect of all binaries in the simulation, the total photometric mass of the\nSC is underestimated by 15%. Dark objects (black holes/neutron stars) increase\nthe difference between the real and observed mass of the SC further. For both\nthe SC and the tails, the observed power-law index of the MF between a stellar\nmass of 0.3 and 0.7 $M_\\odot$ is smaller by up to 0.2 than the real one, the\nreal initial mass function (IMF) being steeper by this amount. This difference\nis larger for stars with a larger velocity dispersion or binary fraction. Since\nthe stars formed in SCs are the progenitors of the Galactic field stars, this\nwork suggests that the binary fractions of different populations of stars in\nthe Galactic disc will differ as a function of the velocity dispersion. The\ndirection of this correlation is currently unclear and a complete population\nsynthesis will be needed to investigate this effect.",

    "abstract": "In using observed data to make inferences about a population quantity, it is\ncommonly assumed that the sampling distribution from which the data were drawn\nbelongs to a given parametric family of distributions, or at least, a given\nfinite set of such families, i.e. the population space is assumed to be closed.\nHere, we address the problem of how to determine an appropriate post-data\ndistribution for a given population quantity when such an assumption about the\nunderlying sampling distribution is not made, i.e. when the population space is\nopen. The strategy used to address this problem is based on the fact that even\nthough, due to an open population space being non-measurable, we are not able\nto place a post-data distribution over all the sampling distributions contained\nin such a population space, it is possible to partition this type of space into\na finite, countable or uncountable number of subsets such that a distribution\ncan be placed over a variable that simply indicates which of these subsets\ncontains the true sampling distribution. Moreover, it is argued that, by using\nsampling distributions that belong to a number of parametric families, it is\npossible to adequately and elegantly represent the sampling distributions that\nbelong to each of the subsets of such a partition. Since a statistical model is\nconceived as being a model of a population space rather than a model of a\nsampling distribution, it is also argued that neither the type of models that\nare put forward nor the expression of pre-data knowledge via such models can be\ndirectly brought into question by the data. Finally, the case is made that, as\nwell as not being required in the modelling process that is proposed, the\nstandard practice of using P values to measure the absolute compatibility of an\nindividual or family of sampling distributions with observed data is neither\nmeaningful nor useful.",

However, owing to the direct combination of LoRA and FL, current\nmethods generally undergo two problems, i.e., aggregation deviation, and\ndifferential privacy (DP) noise amplification effect. To address these\nproblems, we propose a novel privacy-preserving federated finetuning framework\ncalled \\underline{D}eviation \\underline{E}liminating and Nois\\underline{e}\n\\underline{R}egulating (DEeR). Specifically, we firstly theoretically prove\nthat the necessary condition to eliminate aggregation deviation is guaranteing\nthe equivalence between LoRA parameters of clients. Based on the theoretical\ninsight, a deviation eliminator is designed to utilize alternating minimization\nalgorithm to iteratively optimize the zero-initialized and non-zero-initialized\nparameter matrices of LoRA, ensuring that aggregation deviation always be zeros\nduring training. Furthermore, we also conduct an in-depth analysis of the noise\namplification effect and find that this problem is mainly caused by the\n``linear relationship'' between DP noise and LoRA parameters. To suppress the\nnoise amplification effect, we propose a noise regulator that exploits two\nregulator factors to decouple relationship between DP and LoRA, thereby\nachieving robust privacy protection and excellent finetuning performance.\nAdditionally, we perform comprehensive ablated experiments to verify the\neffectiveness of the deviation eliminator and noise regulator.

    "abstract": "Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) is\nintegral to enhancing their reliability, interpretability, and inference\nprocesses. We present Constituent-Aware Pooling (CAP), a methodology designed\nto analyse how LLMs process compositional linguistic structures. Grounded in\nprinciples of compositionality, mechanistic interpretability, and information\ntheory, CAP systematically intervenes in model activations through\nconstituent-based pooling at various model levels. Our experiments on inverse\ndefinition modelling, hypernym and synonym prediction reveal critical insights\ninto transformers' limitations in handling compositional abstractions. No\nspecific layer integrates tokens into unified semantic representations based on\ntheir constituent parts. We observe fragmented information processing, which\nintensifies with model size, suggesting that larger models struggle more with\nthese interventions and exhibit greater information dispersion. This\nfragmentation likely stems from transformers' training objectives and\narchitectural design, preventing systematic and cohesive representations. Our\nfindings highlight fundamental limitations in current transformer architectures\nregarding compositional semantics processing and model interpretability,\nunderscoring the critical need for novel approaches in LLM design to address\nthese challenges.",

In an effort to achieve an\nimproved performance trade-off between multiuser communications and radar\nsensing, this paper considers a dynamically-partitioned antenna array\narchitecture for monostatic ISAC systems, in which each element of the array at\nthe base station can function as either a transmit or receive antenna. To fully\nexploit the available spatial degrees of freedom for both communication and\nsensing functions, we jointly design the partitioning of the array between\ntransmit and receive antennas together with the transmit beamforming in order\nto minimize the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation error, while satisfying\nconstraints on the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and\nthe transmit power budget. An alternating algorithm based on Dinkelbach's\ntransform, the alternative direction method of multipliers, and\nmajorization-minimization is developed to solve the resulting complicated\noptimization problem. To reduce the computational complexity, we also present a\nheuristic three-step strategy that optimizes the transmit beamforming after\ndetermining the antenna partitioning.

We present a\npossible approach to explain this behavior based on the thermal properties of a\nmagnetically arrested disk simulation. By post-processing the simulation to\ninclude radiative effects, we solve for all the thermal equilibrium solutions\nas the accretion rate, $\\dot{M}$, varies along the XRB outburst. For an assumed\nscaling of the disk scale height and accretion speed with temperature, we find\nthat there exists two solutions in the range of $\n10^{-3}\\lesssim\\dot{M}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm Eddington} \\lesssim 0.1$ at $r=8\\:r_g$ ($\n4\\times10^{-2}\\lesssim\\dot{M}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm Eddington} \\lesssim 0.5$ at\n$r=3\\:r_g$) : a cold, optically thick one and a hot, optically thin one. This\nopens the possibility of a natural thermal hysteresis in the right range of\nluminosities for XRBs. We stress that our scenario for the hysteresis does not\nrequire to invoke the strong-ADAF principle nor does it require for the\nmagnetization of the disk to change along the XRB outburst. In fact, our\nscenario requires a highly magnetized disk in the cold, soft state to reproduce\nthe soft-to-hard state transition at the right luminosities. Hence, a\nprediction of our scenario is that there should be a jet, although possibly\nvery weakly dissipative, in the soft state of XRBs. We also predict that if\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) have similar hysteresis cycles and are strongly\nmagnetized, they should undergo a soft-to-hard state transition at much lower\n$L/L_\\mathrm{Edd}$ than XRBs.",

Of particular\ninterest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$ (YBCO), where such\neffect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \\sim\n300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field\nwhich is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been\nobserved outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner\neffect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be\nexplained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a \\textit{local}\nsuperconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at\nequilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven\nsine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model\nexhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the\nbilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic\nmagnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We show how this\nscenario can fit most of the available data. To the extent that this model can\naccount for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important\nconsequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase.\nWhile the bulk of this paper addresses the experiment on YBCO, this work\nreveals a new instability in the sine-Gordon equation that is of fundamental\ninterest, with potential applications such as providing a mechanism for\namplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales in Josephson\ndevices.",

We present DivShare, a novel asynchronous DL\nalgorithm that achieves fast model convergence in the presence of communication\nstragglers. DivShare achieves this by having nodes fragment their models into\nparameter subsets and send, in parallel to computation, each subset to a random\nsample of other nodes instead of sequentially exchanging full models. The\ntransfer of smaller fragments allows more efficient usage of the collective\nbandwidth and enables nodes with slow network links to quickly contribute with\nat least some of their model parameters. By theoretically proving the\nconvergence of DivShare, we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nformal proof of convergence for a DL algorithm that accounts for the effects of\nasynchronous communication with delays. We experimentally evaluate DivShare\nagainst two state-of-the-art DL baselines, AD-PSGD and Swift, and with two\nstandard datasets, CIFAR-10 and MovieLens. We find that DivShare with\ncommunication stragglers lowers time-to-accuracy by up to 3.9x compared to\nAD-PSGD on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

    "abstract": "Theory and observations reveal that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the\ncosmic web at high redshifts are multiphase, with small clouds of cold gas\nembedded in a hot, diffuse medium. A proposed mechanism is `shattering' of\nlarge, thermally unstable clouds into tiny cloudlets of size\nlshatter~min(cs*tcool). We study these processes using idealized numerical\nsimulations of thermally unstable gas clouds. We expand upon previous works by\nexploring the effects of cloud geometry (spheres, streams, and sheets),\nmetallicity, and the inclusion of an ionizing UV background. We find that\n`shattering' is triggered by clouds losing sonic contact and rapidly imploding,\nleading to a reflected shock which causes the cloud to re-expand and induces\nRichtmyer-Meshkov instabilities at its interface. After fragmentation the\ncloudlets experience a drag force from the surrounding hot gas, leading to\nrecoagulation into larger clouds. We distinguish between `fast' and `slow'\ncoagulation regimes, showing that sheets are always in the `fast' coagulation\nregime while streams and spheres have a maximum overdensity for rapid\ncoagulation. The critical overdensity for spheres is smaller than for streams,\nsuch that the coagulation efficiency increases from spheres to streams to\nsheets. Surprisingly, lshatter does not appear to be a characteristic clump\nsize even if it is well resolved. Rather, fragmentation continues until the\ngrid scale with a mass distribution of N(>m)~m^{-1}. We apply our results to\nthe case of cold streams feeding massive (Mv>10^{12}Msun) high-z (z>2) galaxies\nfrom the cosmic web, finding that streams are likely to shatter upon entering\nthe CGM through the virial shock. This could explain the large clumping factors\nand covering fractions of cold gas in the CGM around such galaxies, and may be\nrelated to galaxy quenching by preventing cold streams from reaching the\ncentral galaxy.

Additionally, we incorporate leading renormalon resummation within the\nthreshold framework, demonstrating good perturbative convergence in the region\nwhere both spectator and active quark momenta are perturbative scales.",

    "abstract": "White dwarfs offer a compelling avenue for probing interactions of dark\nmatter particles, particularly in the challenging sub-GeV mass regime. The\nconstraints derived from these celestial objects strongly depend on the\nexistence of high dark matter densities in the corresponding regions of the\nUniverse, where white dwarfs are observed. This implies that excluding the\nparameter space using local white dwarfs would present a significant challenge,\nprimarily due to the low dark matter density in the solar neighbourhood. This\nlimitation prompts the exploration of alternative scenarios involving dark\nmatter particles with a diverse spectrum of kinetic energies. In this work, we\ninvestigate how these dark matter particles traverse the star, interact with\nstellar matter, and ultimately get captured. To accomplish this, we approximate\nthe dark matter flux as a delta function and inspired on the Three Portal\nModel, we assume that fermionic dark matter interacts with stellar matter\neither through a broken $U(1)$ gauge vector mediator or a scalar. In our\ncomputations, we consider how interactions might vary across different energy\nregimes, from high-energy deep inelastic scattering and inelastic scatterings\nvia the production of $N-$ and $\\Delta-$ resonances to lower-energy elastic\ninteractions with nucleons and nuclei. Our study models these inelastic\nresonant interactions with dark matter and vector or scalar mediators for the\nvery first time. We provide insights into the specific conditions required for\nsuccessfully boosted dark matter capture in white dwarfs. We found that, in\ngeneral, dark matter capture is most likely to occur at low energies, as\nexpected. However, in the high-energy regime, there remains a small window for\ncapture through resonant and deep inelastic scattering processes.",

We calculate the creation of virtual\npairs of massless scalar particles in spherically symmetric asymptotically flat\ncurved spacetimes.

    "abstract": "Does the People's Republic of China (PRC) interfere with European elections\nthrough ethnic Chinese diaspora media? This question forms the basis of an\nongoing research project exploring how PRC narratives about European elections\nare represented in Chinese diaspora media, and thus the objectives of PRC news\nmedia manipulation. In order to study diaspora media efficiently and at scale,\nit is necessary to use techniques derived from quantitative text analysis, such\nas topic modelling. In this paper, we present a pipeline for studying\ninformation dynamics in Chinese media. Firstly, we present KeyNMF, a new\napproach to static and dynamic topic modelling using transformer-based\ncontextual embedding models. We provide benchmark evaluations to demonstrate\nthat our approach is competitive on a number of Chinese datasets and metrics.\nSecondly, we integrate KeyNMF with existing methods for describing information\ndynamics in complex systems. We apply this pipeline to data from five news\nsites, focusing on the period of time leading up to the 2024 European\nparliamentary elections. Our methods and results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof KeyNMF for studying information dynamics in Chinese media and lay groundwork\nfor further work addressing the broader research questions.",

However, these methods\ntypically focus solely on adapting VLMs from a single modality and fail to\naccumulate task-specific knowledge as more samples are processed. To address\nthis, we introduce Dual Prototype Evolving (DPE), a novel test-time adaptation\napproach for VLMs that effectively accumulates task-specific knowledge from\nmulti-modalities. Specifically, we create and evolve two sets of\nprototypes--textual and visual--to progressively capture more accurate\nmulti-modal representations for target classes during test time. Moreover, to\npromote consistent multi-modal representations, we introduce and optimize\nlearnable residuals for each test sample to align the prototypes from both\nmodalities. Extensive experimental results on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our proposed DPE consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nmethods while also exhibiting competitive computational efficiency.

This paper proposes the Meta-Chunking framework, which specifically\nenhances chunking quality through a dual strategy that identifies optimal\nsegmentation points and preserves global information. Initially, breaking\nlimitations of similarity-based chunking, we design two adaptive chunking\ntechniques based on uncertainty, namely Perplexity Chunking and Margin Sampling\nChunking, by utilizing the logical perception capabilities of LLMs. Given the\ninherent complexity across different texts, we integrate meta-chunk with\ndynamic merging, striking a balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained\ntext chunking. Furthermore, we establish the global information compensation\nmechanism, encompassing a two-stage hierarchical summary generation process and\na three-stage text chunk rewriting procedure focused on missing reflection,\nrefinement, and completion. These components collectively strengthen the\nsemantic integrity and contextual coherence of chunks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Meta-Chunking effectively addresses challenges of the chunking\ntask within the RAG system, providing LLMs with more logically coherent text\nchunks. Additionally, our methodology validates the feasibility of implementing\nhigh-quality chunking tasks with smaller-scale models, thereby eliminating the\nreliance on robust instruction-following capabilities.",

For this work\nwe analysed the relation between the X-ray properties and other properties\ndescribing the physics and growth of both the accretion disc and the SMBH in\nQSOs at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The sample consists of 21 $z>6$ QSOs,\nwhich includes 16 sources from the rapidly grown QSOs from the HYPERION sample\nand five other luminous QSOs with available high-quality archival X-ray data.\nWe discovered a strong and statistically significant ($>3\\sigma$) relation\nbetween the X-ray continuum photon index ($\\Gamma$) and the $\\rm C\\,IV$ disc\nwind velocity ($v_{\\rm C\\,IV}$) in $z>6$ luminous QSOs, whereby the higher the\n$v_{\\rm C\\,IV}$, the steeper the $\\Gamma$. This relation suggests a link\nbetween the disc-corona configuration and the kinematics of disc winds.\nFurthermore, we find evidence at $>2-3\\sigma$ level that $\\Gamma$ and $v_{\\rm\nC\\,IV}$ are correlated to the growth rate history of the SMBH. Although\nadditional data are needed to confirm it, this result may suggest that, in\nluminous $z>6$ QSOs, the SMBH predominantly grows via fast accretion rather\nthan via initial high seed BH mass.",

Our findings highlight key vulnerabilities, including imbalances in\nmodality integration and biases from training data, underscoring the need for\nbalanced cross-modal learning and enhanced hallucination mitigation strategies.\nBased on our observations and findings, we suggest potential research\ndirections that could enhance the reliability of LMMs.",

In this work we demonstrate via\nthree-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations a regime where for oblique\nincidence the emission of a collimated $\\gamma$-photon beam is in the direction\nparallel to the target surface. The process is ascribed to the interference\npattern in the electromagnetic field formed by the incident and reflected laser\npulse. The electromagnetic field accelerates electrons to the GeV energy level,\nwhile temporarily directing their momentum along the target surface.\nConsequently, they emit a collimated $\\gamma$-photon beam in the same\ndirection. The dependencies of $\\gamma$-photon emission on the incident angle,\nlaser pulse polarization, power and duration and target thickness and preplasma\nare also addressed in the paper. The beam directionality is important for\ndesigning future experiments. In addition, this setup causes the generation of\nhigh-order harmonics propagating along the target surface.",

Using this metric, GAGA can uniformly sample\npoints on the manifold, generate points along geodesics, and interpolate\nbetween populations across the learned manifold using geodesic-guided flows.\nGAGA shows competitive performance in simulated and real-world datasets,\nincluding a 30% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in single-cell\npopulation-level trajectory inference.",

Its absolute magnitude precluded\nit from being a WN4+O4 binary. OGLE photometry show shallow primary and\nsecondary eclipses with a 2.2 day period. The spectral characteristics and\nshort period pointed to a possible origin due to binary stripping. Such\nstripped WR binaries should be common but have proven elusive to identify\nconclusively. In order to establish its nature, we obtained HST UV and Magellan\noptical spectra, along with imaging. Our work shows that the WR emission and He\nII absorption arise in one star, and the He I absorption in another. The He I\ncontributor is the primary of the 2.2-day system and exhibits ~300 km/sed\nradial velocity variations on that time scale. However, the WR star shows 30-40\nkm/sed radial velocity variations, with a likely 35-day period and a highly\neccentric orbit. Possibly LMCe055-1 is a physical triple, but that would\nrequire the 2.2-day pair to have been captured by the WR star. A more likely\nexplanation is that the WR star has an unseen companion in a 35-day orbit and\nthat the 2.2-day pair is in a longer period orbit about the two. Such examples\nof multiple systems are well known among massive stars, such as HD 5980.\nRegardless, we argue that it is highly unlikely that the WR component of the\nLMCe055-1 system resulted from stripping.",

Recent developments have seen a surge in interest in deep neural\nnetwork (DNN)-based AMC models, with Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a\npromising framework. Despite these advancements, the presence of various noises\nwithin the signal exerts significant challenges while optimizing models to\ncapture salient features. Furthermore, existing FL-based AMC models commonly\nrely on linear aggregation strategies, which face notable difficulties in\nintegrating locally fine-tuned parameters within practical non-IID (Independent\nand Identically Distributed) environments, thereby hindering optimal learning\nconvergence. To address these challenges, we propose FedVaccine, a novel FL\nmodel aimed at improving generalizability across signals with varying noise\nlevels by deliberately introducing a balanced level of noise. This is\naccomplished through our proposed harmonic noise resilience approach, which\nidentifies an optimal noise tolerance for DNN models, thereby regulating the\ntraining process and mitigating overfitting. Additionally, FedVaccine overcomes\nthe limitations of existing FL-based AMC models' linear aggregation by\nemploying a split-learning strategy using structural clustering topology and\nlocal queue data structure, enabling adaptive and cumulative updates to local\nmodels. Our experimental results, including IID and non-IID datasets as well as\nablation studies, confirm FedVaccine's robust performance and superiority over\nexisting FL-based AMC approaches across different noise levels.

To address these, we propose SAFREE, a novel, training-free\napproach for safe T2I and T2V, that does not alter the model's weights.\nSpecifically, we detect a subspace corresponding to a set of toxic concepts in\nthe text embedding space and steer prompt embeddings away from this subspace,\nthereby filtering out harmful content while preserving intended semantics. To\nbalance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving safe concepts,\nSAFREE incorporates a novel self-validating filtering mechanism that\ndynamically adjusts the denoising steps when applying the filtered embeddings.\nAdditionally, we incorporate adaptive re-attention mechanisms within the\ndiffusion latent space to selectively diminish the influence of features\nrelated to toxic concepts at the pixel level.

Among hash-based\nsolutions for the asynchronous setting with adaptive faults, the\nstate-of-the-art HMVBA protocol achieves optimal $O(n^2)$ message complexity,\n(near-)optimal $O(n\\ell+n^2 \\lambda\\log n)$ bit complexity, and optimal $O(1)$\ntime complexity. However, it only tolerates up to $t < \\frac15 n$ adaptive\nfailures. In contrast, the best known optimally resilient protocol, FIN-MVBA,\nexchanges $O(n^3)$ messages and $O(n^2\\ell + n^3\\lambda)$ bits. This highlights\na fundamental question: can a hash-based protocol be designed for the\nasynchronous setting with adaptive faults that simultaneously achieves both\noptimal complexity and optimal resilience?\n  In this paper, we take a significant step toward answering the question.\nNamely, we introduce Reducer, an MVBA protocol that retains HMVBA's complexity\nwhile improving its resilience to $t<\\frac14 n$. Like HMVBA and FIN-MVBA,\nReducer relies exclusively on collision-resistant hash functions. A key\ninnovation in Reducer's design is its internal use of strong multi-valued\nByzantine agreement (SMBA), a variant of strong consensus we introduce and\nconstruct, which ensures agreement on a correct process's proposal. To further\nadvance resilience toward the optimal one-third bound, we then propose\nReducer++, an MVBA protocol that tolerates up to $t < (\\frac13-\\epsilon)n$\nadaptive failures, for any fixed constant $\\epsilon > 0$. Unlike Reducer,\nReducer++ does not rely on SMBA. Instead, it employs a novel approach involving\nhash functions modeled as random oracles to ensure termination.

The deep learning methods have proven its superior performances in the\nautomated detection of plant diseases and nutrition deficiencies from visual\nsymptoms in leaves. This article proposes a new deep learning method for plant\nnutrition deficiencies and disease classification using a graph convolutional\nnetwork (GNN), added upon a base convolutional neural network (CNN). Sometimes,\na global feature descriptor might fail to capture the vital region of a\ndiseased leaf, which causes inaccurate classification of disease. To address\nthis issue, regional feature learning is crucial for a holistic feature\naggregation. In this work, region-based feature summarization at multi-scales\nis explored using spatial pyramidal pooling for discriminative feature\nrepresentation. A GCN is developed to capacitate learning of finer details for\nclassifying plant diseases and insufficiency of nutrients. The proposed method,\ncalled Plant Nutrition Deficiency and Disease Network (PND-Net), is evaluated\non two public datasets for nutrition deficiency, and two for disease\nclassification using four CNNs. The best classification performances are: (a)\n90.00% Banana and 90.54% Coffee nutrition deficiency; and (b) 96.18% Potato\ndiseases and 84.30% on PlantDoc datasets using Xception backbone.

Specifically, we examine the role of\ngravitational instantons, which are non-perturbative, finite-action solutions\nto the Euclidean Einstein equations. These instantons represent topologically\nnontrivial configurations of spacetime and are analogous to instantons in gauge\ntheory. The amount of symmetry breaking induced by gravitational instantons can\nbe computed in a controlled way within the framework of semi-classical gravity,\nusing 't Hooft operators, in full analogy to the computation of the axion\npotential arising from QCD small instanton effects. Contrary to previous\nresults in the literature, we find that the effects of gravitational instantons\nare extremely small and therefore do not give rise to a significant quality\nproblem for the axion solution to the strong CP problem, both within the\nStandard Model and in beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios that involve multiple\ncopies of the Standard Model. In conclusion, we argue that, assuming the\nultraviolet completion of gravity is weakly coupled, the axion solution to the\nstrong CP problem remains free from any quality issues due to gravity.

In contrast, we propose leveraging multiple\nexperiments to overcome these limitations. In industry, the use of sequential\nexperiments, often known as the ramp-up process, where traffic to the treatment\ngradually increases, is common due to operational needs like risk management\nand cost control. Our approach shifts the focus from operational aspects to the\nstatistical advantages of merging data from multiple experiments. By combining\ndata from sequentially conducted experiments, we aim to estimate the global\naverage treatment effect more effectively. In this paper, we begin by analyzing\nthe bias and variance of the linear regression estimator for GATE under general\nlinear network interference. We demonstrate that bias plays a dominant role in\nthe bias-variance tradeoff and highlight the intrinsic bias reduction achieved\nby merging data from experiments with strictly different treatment proportions.\nHerein the improvement introduced by merging two steps of experimental data is\nessential. In addition, we show that merging more steps of experimental data is\nunnecessary under general linear interference, while it can become beneficial\nwhen nonlinear interference occurs.

The data requirements for ASP problems\ngrow multiplicatively with the number of viewpoints and frequencies,\nsignificantly increasing the burden of data collection, even for simulation.\nImplicit Neural Representations (INRs) -- neural network-based models of 3D\nobjects and scenes -- offer compact and continuous representations with minimal\nradar data. They can interpolate to unseen viewpoints and potentially address\nthe sampling cost in ASP problems. In this work, we select Synthetic Aperture\nRadar (SAR) as a case from ASP and propose Radon Implicit Field Transform\n(RIFT). RIFT consists of two components: a classical forward model for radar\n(Generalized Radon Transform, GRT), and an INR based scene representation\nlearned from radar signals. This method can be extended to other ASP problems\nby replacing the GRT with appropriate algorithms corresponding to different\ndata modalities. In our experiments, we first synthesize radar data using the\nGRT. We then train the INR model on this synthetic data by minimizing the\nreconstruction error of the radar signal. After training, we render the scene\nusing the trained INR and evaluate our scene representation against the ground\ntruth scene. Due to the lack of existing benchmarks, we introduce two main new\nerror metrics: phase-Root Mean Square Error (p-RMSE) for radar signal\ninterpolation, and magnitude-Structural Similarity Index measure(m-SSIM) for\nscene reconstruction. These metrics adapt traditional error measures to account\nfor the complex nature of radar signals.

However, it is noteworthy that throughout this\nprocess, there is no guarantee of accuracy in the rewarding and ranking, which\nis critical for ensuring accurate rewards and high-quality preference data.\nEmpirical results from relatively small LLMs (e.g., 7B parameters) also\nindicate that improvements from self-rewarding may diminish after several\niterations in certain situations, which we hypothesize is due to accumulated\nbias in the reward system. This bias can lead to unreliable preference data for\ntraining the LLM. To address this issue, we first formulate and analyze the\ngeneralized iterative preference fine-tuning framework for self-rewarding\nlanguage model. We then introduce the regularization to this generalized\nframework to mitigate the overconfident preference labeling in the\nself-rewarding process. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a\nConsistency Regularized sElf-rewarding lAnguage Model (CREAM) that leverages\nthe consistency of rewards across different iterations to regularize the\nself-rewarding training, helping the model to learn from more reliable\npreference data. With this explicit regularization, our empirical results\ndemonstrate the superiority of CREAM in improving both reward consistency and\nalignment performance.

In the non-simple regime $\\kappa'\\in (4,8)$, it describes\nthe scaling limit of the critical Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolations. CLE\npercolations were introduced by Miller-Sheffield-Werner (2017). The\nCLE$_{\\kappa'}$ percolations describe the scaling limit of a natural variant of\nthe FK percolation called the fuzzy Potts model, which has an additional\npercolation parameter $r$. Based on CLE percolations and assuming that the\nconvergence of the FK percolation to CLE, K{\\\"o}hler-Schindler and Lehmkuehler\n(2022) derived all the arm exponents for the fuzzy Potts model except the bulk\none-arm exponent. In this paper, we exactly solve this exponent, which\nprescribes the dimension of the clusters in CLE$_{\\kappa'}$ percolations. As a\nspecial case, the bichromatic one-arm exponent for the critical 3-state Potts\nmodel should be $4/135$. To the best of our knowledge, this natural exponent\nwas not predicted in physics. Our derivation relies on the iterative\nconstruction of CLE percolations from the boundary conformal loop ensemble\n(BCLE), and the coupling between Liouville quantum gravity and SLE curves. The\nsource of the exact solvability comes from the structure constants of boundary\nLiouville conformal field theory. A key technical step is to prove a conformal\nwelding result for the target-invariant radial SLE curves. As intermediate\nsteps in our derivation, we obtain several exact results for BCLE in both the\nsimple and non-simple regimes, which extend results of Ang-Sun-Yu-Zhuang (2024)\non the touching probability of non-simple CLE.

Despite its substantial benefits,\nthe free-riding behavior raises a major challenge for the formation of FL,\nespecially in competitive markets. Our paper explores this under-explored issue\non how the free-riding behavior in a competitive market affects firms'\nincentives to form FL. Competing firms can improve technologies through forming\nFL to increase the performance of their products, which in turn, affects\nconsumers' product selection and market size. The key complication is whether\nthe free-riding behavior discourages information contribution by participating\nfirms and results in the decomposition of FL, and even free riding does not\ndiscourage information contribution, this does not necessarily mean that a firm\nwants to form FL in a competitive market because free riding may reshape the\ncompetition positions of each participating firm and thus forming FL may not be\nprofitable. We build a parsimonious game theoretical model that captures these\ninteractions and our analyses show several new findings. First, even in the\npresence of the free-riding behavior, competing firms under FL find it optimal\nto contribute all its available information.

This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via\ndiscrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect\non SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin\ndisorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is\nseen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that\nmaximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are\nimpervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state.\nFurther, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for\nphase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and\ndistorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin\ndisorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder,\nirrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE\ncan be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths\nat specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle\nentanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too.

    "abstract": "We study the interactive effects (IE) model as an extension of the\nconventional additive effects (AE) model. For the AE model, the fixed effects\nestimator can be obtained by applying least squares to a regression that adds a\nlinear projection of the fixed effect on the explanatory variables (Mundlak,\n1978; Chamberlain, 1984). In this paper, we develop a novel estimator -- the\nprojection-based IE (PIE) estimator -- for the IE model that is based on a\nsimilar approach. We show that, for the IE model, fixed effects estimators that\nhave appeared in the literature are not equivalent to our PIE estimator, though\nboth can be expressed as a generalized within estimator. Unlike the fixed\neffects estimators for the IE model, the PIE estimator is consistent for a\nfixed number of time periods with no restrictions on serial correlation or\nconditional heteroskedasticity in the errors. We also derive a statistic for\ntesting the consistency of the two-way fixed effects estimator in the possible\npresence of iterative effects. Moreover, although the PIE estimator is the\nsolution to a high-dimensional nonlinear least squares problem, we show that it\ncan be computed by iterating between two steps, both of which have simple\nanalytical solutions. The computational simplicity is an important advantage\nrelative to other strategies that have been proposed for estimating the IE\nmodel for short panels. Finally, we compare the finite sample performance of IE\nestimators through simulations.",

    "abstract": "To alleviate hardware scarcity in training large deep neural networks (DNNs),\nparticularly large language models (LLMs), we present FusionLLM, a\ndecentralized training system designed and implemented for training DNNs using\ngeo-distributed GPUs across different computing clusters or individual devices.\nDecentralized training faces significant challenges regarding system design and\nefficiency, including: 1) the need for remote automatic differentiation (RAD),\n2) support for flexible model definitions and heterogeneous software, 3)\nheterogeneous hardware leading to low resource utilization or the straggler\nproblem, and 4) slow network communication. To address these challenges, in the\nsystem design, we represent the model as a directed acyclic graph of operators\n(OP-DAG). Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the\nedge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1)\nusers are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator\nimplementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained\nsub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can\nimplement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions.\n  To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an\nOP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and\npartition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK\ncompressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the\nslowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our\nsystem and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world\ntestbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our system and method can achieve 1.45 - 9.39x speedup\ncompared to baseline methods while ensuring convergence.",

However, the growth rate of high-quality data is significantly\noutpaced by the expansion of training datasets, leading to a looming data\nexhaustion crisis. This underscores the urgent need to enhance data efficiency\nand explore new data sources. In this context, synthetic data has emerged as a\npromising solution. Currently, data generation primarily consists of two major\napproaches: data augmentation and synthesis. This paper comprehensively reviews\nand summarizes data generation techniques throughout the lifecycle of LLMs,\nincluding data preparation, pre-training, fine-tuning, instruction-tuning,\npreference alignment, and applications.

We give a polynomial-time quantum algorithm\nwhich can find the cut using $O(n/\\epsilon^2)$ many copies of the state, which\nis optimal up to logarithmic factors. Our algorithm also generalizes to learn\nthe entanglement structure of arbitrary product states. In the special case of\nHaar-random states, we further show that our algorithm requires circuits of\nonly constant depth. To develop our algorithm, we introduce a state\ngeneralization of the hidden subgroup problem (StateHSP) which might be of\nindependent interest, in which one is given a quantum state invariant under an\nunknown subgroup action, with the goal of learning the hidden symmetry\nsubgroup. We show how the hidden cut problem can be formulated as a StateHSP\nwith a carefully chosen Abelian group action. We then prove that Fourier\nsampling on the hidden cut state produces similar outcomes as a variant of the\nwell-known Simon's problem, allowing us to find the hidden cut efficiently.\nTherefore, our algorithm can be interpreted as an extension of Simon's\nalgorithm to entanglement testing.

Addressing this problem, we propose LiVO (Lightweight Value\nOptimization), a novel lightweight method for aligning T2I models with human\nvalues. LiVO only optimizes a plug-and-play value encoder to integrate a\nspecified value principle with the input prompt, allowing the control of\ngenerated images over both semantics and values. Specifically, we design a\ndiffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically\napproximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more\nflexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the\nvalue encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a\ntext-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image,\nvalue principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through\nadaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces\nharmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong\nbaselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.",

However, these methods often make insufficient use\nof semantic information, leading to less desirable results. In this paper, we\nproposed a novel mask-free point-based image editing method, AdaptiveDrag,\nwhich provides a more flexible editing approach and generates images that\nbetter align with user intent. Specifically, we design an auto mask generation\nmodule using super-pixel division for user-friendliness. Next, we leverage a\npre-trained diffusion model to optimize the latent, enabling the dragging of\nfeatures from handle points to target points. To ensure a comprehensive\nconnection between the input image and the drag process, we have developed a\nsemantic-driven optimization. We design adaptive steps that are supervised by\nthe positions of the points and the semantic regions derived from super-pixel\nsegmentation. This refined optimization process also leads to more realistic\nand accurate drag results. Furthermore, to address the limitations in the\ngenerative consistency of the diffusion model, we introduce an innovative\ncorresponding loss during the sampling process. Building on these effective\ndesigns, our method delivers superior generation results using only the single\ninput image and the handle-target point pairs. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms others in\nhandling various drag instructions (e.g., resize, movement, extension) across\ndifferent domains (e.g., animals, human face, land space, clothing).",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated\nremarkable promise in generating visually grounded responses. However, their\napplication in the medical domain is hindered by unique challenges. For\ninstance, most VLMs rely on a single method of visual grounding, whereas\ncomplex medical tasks demand more versatile approaches. Additionally, while\nmost VLMs process only 2D images, a large portion of medical images are 3D. The\nlack of medical data further compounds these obstacles. To address these\nchallenges, we present VividMed, a vision language model with versatile visual\ngrounding for medicine. Our model supports generating both semantic\nsegmentation masks and instance-level bounding boxes, and accommodates various\nimaging modalities, including both 2D and 3D data. We design a three-stage\ntraining procedure and an automatic data synthesis pipeline based on open\ndatasets and models. Besides visual grounding tasks, VividMed also excels in\nother common downstream tasks, including Visual Question Answering (VQA) and\nreport generation. Ablation studies empirically show that the integration of\nvisual grounding ability leads to improved performance on these tasks.

Recent works have shown\nhow to define LQG in this phase as a planar random geometry associated with a\nvariant of the Gaussian free field, which exhibits \"infinite spikes.\" In\ncontrast, a number of results from physics, dating back to the 1980s, suggest\nthat supercritical LQG surfaces should behave like \"branched polymers\": i.e.,\nthey should look like the continuum random tree. We prove a result which\nreconciles these two descriptions of supercritical LQG. More precisely, we show\nthat for a family of random planar maps with boundary in the universality class\nof supercritical LQG, if we condition on the (small probability) event that the\nplanar map is finite, then the scaling limit is the continuum random tree. We\nalso show that there does not exist any locally finite measure associated with\nsupercritical LQG which is locally determined by the field and satisfies the\nLQG coordinate change formula.

    "abstract": "A critical bottleneck for scientific progress is the costly nature of\ncomputer simulations for complex systems. Surrogate models provide an appealing\nsolution: such models are trained on simulator evaluations, then used to\nemulate and quantify uncertainty on the expensive simulator at unexplored\ninputs. In many applications, one often has available data on related systems.\nFor example, in designing a new jet turbine, there may be existing studies on\nturbines with similar configurations. A key question is how information from\nsuch ``source'' systems can be transferred for effective surrogate training on\nthe ``target'' system of interest. We thus propose a new LOcal transfer\nLearning Gaussian Process (LOL-GP) model, which leverages a carefully-designed\nGaussian process to transfer such information for surrogate modeling. The key\nnovelty of the LOL-GP is a latent regularization model, which identifies\nregions where transfer should be performed and regions where it should be\navoided. Such a ``local transfer'' property is present in many scientific\nsystems: at certain parameters, systems may behave similarly and thus transfer\nis beneficial; at other parameters, they may behave differently and thus\ntransfer is detrimental. By accounting for local transfer, the LOL-GP can\ntemper the risk of ``negative transfer'', i.e., the risk of worsening\npredictive performance from information transfer. We derive a Gibbs sampling\nalgorithm for efficient posterior predictive sampling on the LOL-GP, for both\nthe multi-source and multi-fidelity transfer settings. We then show, via a\nsuite of numerical experiments and an application for jet turbine design, the\nimproved surrogate performance of the LOL-GP over existing methods.",

    "abstract": "To many Chomsky's debates with Quine and Skinner are an updated version of\nthe Rationalist Empiricist debates of the 17th century. The consensus being\nthat Chomsky's Rationalism was victorious. This dispute has reemerged with the\nadvent of Large Language Models. With some arguing that LLMs vindicate\nrationalism because of the necessity of building in innate biases to make them\nwork. The necessity of building in innate biases is taken to prove that\nempiricism hasn't got the conceptual resources to explain linguistic\ncompetence. Such claims depend on the nature of the empiricism one is\nendorsing. Externalized Empiricism has no difficulties with innate apparatus\nonce they are determined empirically (Quine 1969). Thus, externalized\nempiricism is not refuted because of the need to build in innate biases in\nLLMs. Furthermore, the relevance of LLMs to the rationalist empiricist debate\nin relation to humans is dubious. For any claim about whether LLMs learn in an\nempiricist manner to be relevant to humans it needs to be shown that LLMs and\nhumans learn in the same way. Two key features distinguish humans and LLMs.\nHumans learn despite a poverty of stimulus and LLMs learn because of an\nincredibly rich stimulus. Human linguistic outputs are grounded in sensory\nexperience and LLMs are not. These differences in how the two learn indicates\nthat they both use different underlying competencies to produce their output.\nTherefore, any claims about whether LLMs learn in an empiricist manner are not\nrelevant to whether humans learn in an empiricist manner.",

This approach has proven\neffective in developing ghost-free scalar-tensor theories in the single-field\ncase. When multiple scalar fields are present, each field specifies a foliation\nof spacelike hypersurfaces, on which we can define the normal vector, induced\nmetric, extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures, as well as extrinsic (Lie) and\nintrinsic (spatial) derivatives, respectively. By employing these hypersurface\ngeometric quantities as foundational elements, we construct the Lagrangian for\ninteracting hypersurfaces that describes a multiple scalar-tensor theory. Given\nthat temporal (Lie) and spatial derivatives are separated, it becomes\nrelatively easier to control the order of time derivatives, thus helping to\navoid ghost-like or unwanted degrees of freedom. In this work, we use\nbi-scalar-field theory as an example, focusing on polynomial-type Lagrangians.\nWe construct monomials of hypersurface geometric quantities up to $d=3$, where\n$d$ denotes the number of derivatives in each monomial. Additionally, we\npresent the correspondence between expressions in terms of hypersurface\nquantities and those in covariant bi-scalar-tensor theory.

By\nintegrating tasks such as direct pose estimation, keypoint prediction, object\nlocalization, and segmentation into a single network, the study aims to\nevaluate the reciprocal influence between tasks by testing different multi-task\nconfigurations thanks to the modularity of the convolutional neural network\n(CNN) used in this work. The trends of mutual bias between the analyzed tasks\nare found by employing different weighting strategies to further test the\nrobustness of the findings. A synthetic dataset was developed to train and test\nthe MTL network. Results indicate that direct pose estimation and heatmap-based\npose estimation positively influence each other in general, while both the\nbounding box and segmentation tasks do not provide significant contributions\nand tend to degrade the overall estimation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Preference disaggregation methods in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)\noften encounter challenges related to inconsistency and cognitive biases when\nderiving a value function from experts' holistic preferences. This paper\nintroduces the Best-Worst Disaggregation (BWD) method, a novel approach that\nintegrates the principles of the Best-Worst Method (BWM) into the\ndisaggregation framework to enhance the consistency and reliability of derived\npreference models. BWD employs the \"consider-the-opposite\" strategy from BWM,\nallowing experts to provide two opposite pairwise comparison vectors of\nalternatives. This approach reduces cognitive load and mitigates anchoring\nbias, possibly leading to more reliable criteria weights and attribute value\nfunctions. An optimization model is formulated to determine the most suitable\nadditive value function to the preferences expressed by an expert. The method\nalso incorporates a consistency analysis to quantify and improve the\nreliability of the judgments. Additionally, BWD is extended to handle\ninterval-valued preferences, enhancing its applicability in situations with\nuncertainty or imprecise information. We also developed an approach to identify\na reference set, which is used for pairwise comparisons to elicit the value\nfunctions and weights. A case study in logistics performance evaluation\ndemonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of BWD, showing that it\nproduces reliable rankings aligned closely with experts' preferences.",

Previous works have studied\nthis issue under the current AT paradigm, but still face over 10% accuracy\nreduction without significant robustness improvement over simple baselines such\nas PGD-AT. This inherent trade-off raises a question: Whether the current AT\nparadigm, which assumes to learn corresponding benign and adversarial samples\nas the same class, inappropriately mixes clean and robust objectives that may\nbe essentially inconsistent. In fact, our empirical results show that up to 40%\nof CIFAR-10 adversarial samples always fail to satisfy such an assumption\nacross various AT methods and robust models, explicitly indicating the room for\nimprovement of the current AT paradigm. To relax from this overstrict\nassumption and the tension between clean and robust learning, in this work, we\npropose a new AT paradigm by introducing an additional dummy class for each\noriginal class, aiming to accommodate hard adversarial samples with shifted\ndistribution after perturbation. The robustness w.r.t. these adversarial\nsamples can be achieved by runtime recovery from the predicted dummy classes to\nthe corresponding original ones, without conflicting with the clean objective\non accuracy of benign samples.

However, we find that\nexisting vision-language alignment methods fail to transfer the existing safety\nmechanism for text in LLMs to vision, which leads to vulnerabilities in toxic\nimage. To explore the cause of this problem, we give the insightful explanation\nof where and how the safety mechanism of LVLMs operates and conduct comparative\nanalysis between text and vision. We find that the hidden states at the\nspecific transformer layers play a crucial role in the successful activation of\nsafety mechanism, while the vision-language alignment at hidden states level in\ncurrent methods is insufficient. This results in a semantic shift for input\nimages compared to text in hidden states, therefore misleads the safety\nmechanism. To address this, we propose a novel Text-Guided vision-language\nAlignment method (TGA) for LVLMs. TGA retrieves the texts related to input\nvision and uses them to guide the projection of vision into the hidden states\nspace in LLMs. Experiments show that TGA not only successfully transfers the\nsafety mechanism for text in basic LLMs to vision in vision-language alignment\nfor LVLMs without any safety fine-tuning on the visual modality but also\nmaintains the general performance on various vision tasks (Safe and Good).",

In\nself-supervised GRL, paired graph augmentations are generated from each graph.\nIts objective is to infer similar representations for augmentations of the same\ngraph, but maximally distinguishable representations for augmentations of\ndifferent graphs. Analogous to image and language domains, the desiderata of an\nideal augmentation method include both (1) semantics-preservation; and (2)\ndata-perturbation; i.e., an augmented graph should preserve the semantics of\nits original graph while carrying sufficient variance. However, most existing\n(un-)/self-supervised GRL methods focus on data perturbation but largely\nneglect semantics preservation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we\npropose a novel method, Explanation-Preserving Augmentation (EPA), that\nleverages graph explanation techniques for generating augmented graphs that can\nbridge the gap between semantics-preservation and data-perturbation. EPA first\nuses a small number of labels to train a graph explainer to infer the\nsub-structures (explanations) that are most relevant to a graph's semantics.\nThese explanations are then used to generate semantics-preserving augmentations\nfor self-supervised GRL, namely EPA-GRL. We demonstrate theoretically, using an\nanalytical example, and through extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark\ndatasets that EPA-GRL outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) GRL methods,\nwhich are built upon semantics-agnostic data augmentations.",

Finding these polytopes enables the\napplication of stronger motion-planning frameworks such as trajectory\noptimization with Graphs of Convex Sets [1] and is currently a major roadblock\nin the adoption of these approaches. In this paper, we build upon IRIS-NP\n(Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite & Nonlinear Programming) [2] to\nsignificantly improve tunability, runtimes, and scaling to complex\nenvironments. IRIS-NP uses nonlinear programming paired with uniform random\ninitialization to find configurations on the boundary of the free configuration\nspace. Our key insight is that finding near-by configuration-space obstacles\nusing sampling is inexpensive and greatly accelerates region generation. We\npropose two algorithms using such samples to either employ nonlinear\nprogramming more efficiently (IRIS-NP2 ) or circumvent it altogether using a\nmassively-parallel zero-order optimization strategy (IRIS-ZO). We also propose\na termination condition that controls the probability of exceeding a\nuser-specified permissible fraction-in-collision, eliminating a significant\nsource of tuning difficulty in IRIS-NP. We compare performance across eight\nrobot environments, showing that IRIS-ZO achieves an order-of-magnitude speed\nadvantage over IRIS-NP. IRISNP2, also significantly faster than IRIS-NP, builds\nlarger polytopes using fewer hyperplanes, enabling faster downstream\ncomputation. Website: https://sites.google.com/view/fastiris",

There are two theories - metal-rich\nformation hypothesis and naked core hypothesis - that explain how formation and\nevolution can alter the compositions and structures of rocky planets to diverge\nfrom their primordial building blocks. Here, we revisit the naked core\nhypothesis, which states that high-density planets are remnant cores of giant\nplanets that remain in a fossil-compressed state, even after envelope loss.\nUsing a planetary interior model and assuming energy-limited atmospheric\nescape, we show that a large fraction, if not all, of the iron-silicate core of\na giant planet is molten during the planet's early evolution. Upon envelope\nloss, molten part of the planets can rapidly rebound due to low viscosity,\nresulting in a decrease in radius by at most 0.06%, if they had hydrogen/helium\nenvelopes, or by at most 7%, if they had H$_2$O envelopes, compared to\nself-compressed counterparts with the same core mass fraction. Based on our\nfindings, we reject the hypothesis that all high-density exoplanets are naked\ncores with Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value $\\ll$ 0.05 for both envelope\ncompositions. We find that some high-density exoplanets can still possibly be\nnaked cores, but the probabilities are lower than $\\sim$1/2 and $\\sim$1/3 for\nthe ice giant and gas giant scenario, respectively, in 95% of the cases.

The origin and composition of this Comptonizing\nregion, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. In this paper we\ninvestigate the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole\nmagnetospheric current sheets for the pair enrichment and neutrino emission of\nAGN coronae. Our model has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma\nmagnetization $\\sigma_{\\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino\nspectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\\lambda_{\\rm X, Edd}$ (defined as the ratio\nbetween X-ray luminosity $L_{\\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\\rm Edd}$),\nwhich controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. For\nsources with $\\lambda_{\\rm X, Edd} \\gtrsim \\lambda_{\\rm Edd, crit}$ (where\n$\\lambda_{\\rm Edd, crit} \\sim 10^{-1}$ for $\\sigma_{\\rm p}=10^5$ or $\\sim\n10^{-2}$ for $\\sigma_{\\rm p}=10^7$), proton-photon interactions and $ \\gamma\n\\gamma$ annihilation produce enough secondary pairs to achieve Thomson optical\ndepths $\\tau_{\\rm T} \\sim 0.1-10$. In the opposite case of $\\lambda_{\\rm X,\nEdd} \\lesssim \\lambda_{\\rm Edd, crit}$, the coronal pairs cannot originate only\nfrom hadronic interactions. Additionally, we find that the neutrino luminosity\nscales as $L^2_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd}$ for $\\lambda_{\\rm X, Edd} \\lesssim\n\\lambda_{\\rm Edd, crit}$, while it is proportional to $L_{\\rm X}$ for higher\n$\\lambda_{\\rm X, Edd}$ values.

We investigate the production of lithium and trans-iron elements in AGB\nstars experiencing a PIE with $1<M_{\\rm ini}/M_{\\odot}< 3$ and $-3<\n\\mathrm{[Fe/H]} <0$. We find that lithium is produced in all PIE models with\nsurface abundances $3<$ A(Li) $<5$. The surface enrichment and overall AGB\nlithium yield increases with decreasing stellar mass. The lithium enrichment is\naccompanied by a production of $^{13}$C with $3<^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$<9$ at the\nsurface just after the PIE. AGB stars experiencing PIE may be related to J-type\ncarbon stars whose main features are excesses of lithium and $^{13}$C.

    "abstract": "The cost of writing, transferring, and storing large data from unsteady\nsimulations limits access to the entire solution, often leaving much of the\nflow under-sampled or unanalyzed. For example, modeling transient behavior of\nrare dynamic events requires 3D snapshots at high sampling rates over long\nperiods, generating significant amounts of data and creating challenges for\npractical CFD workflows, especially with limited memory resources and costly\nGPU writing penalties. In this work, multiple sparse flow reconstruction (SFR)\nmethods are developed to approximate a full unsteady solution using far fewer\nsparse measurements, thus reducing writing costs, data storage, and enabling\nhigher sampling rates. SFR is motivated by a large-eddy simulation of rare\ninlet distortion events, demonstrating that down-sampling full snapshots and\nsupplementing them with high-frequency sparse measurements can drastically cut\nwriting time for GPU solvers and nearly eliminate this cost for CPU solvers.\nThe simplest single-equation \"snapshot\" SFR method can be compressed further\nusing Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD-SFR) or a more efficient double\nPOD-SFR variant. A streaming SFR modification improves reconstruction\nefficiency when local memory is limited. A sensitivity study evaluates\ntrade-offs between sparse sampling rates and reconstruction accuracy, offering\nbest practices. To offset error of using random sparse measurements, SFR\nexactly preserves dynamics in key regions by prescribing sparse measurement\nlocations, used here to capture distortion events. Distortion events are\nevaluated using the conditional space-time proper orthogonal decomposition\n(CST-POD) to pursue physical insights that characterize the upstream causality\nat full resolution.

Recent studies have extended this phenomenon to\nsuperconductors, introducing the concept of the superconducting diode effect\n(SDE). The SDE is characterized by unequal critical supercurrents along\nopposite directions. Due to the requirement on broken inversion symmetry, the\nSDE is commonly accompanied by electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMCA) in\nthe resistive state. Achieving a magnetic field-free SDE with field tunability\nis pivotal for advancements in superconductor devices. Conventionally, the\nfield-free SDE has been achieved in Josephson junctions by intentionally\nintercalating an asymmetric barrier layer. Alternatively, internal magnetism\nwas employed. Both approaches pose challenges in the selection of\nsuperconductors and fabrication processes, thereby impeding the development of\nSDE. Here, we present a field-free SDE in FeTe0.7Se0.3 (FTS) junction with\neMCA, a phenomenon absent in FTS single nanosheets. The field-free property is\nassociated with the presence of a gradient oxide layer on the upper surface of\neach FTS nanosheet, while the eMCA is linked to spin-splitting arising from the\nabsence of inversion symmetry. Both the SDE and eMCA respond to magnetic fields\nwith distinct temperature dependencies. This work presents a versatile and\nstraightforward strategy for advancing superconducting electronics.",

    "abstract": "Given two nonincreasing $n$-tuples of real numbers $\\lambda_n$, $\\mu_n$, the\nHorn problem asks for a description of all nonincreasing $n$-tuples of real\nnumbers $\\nu_n$ such that there exist Hermitian matrices $X_n$, $Y_n$ and $Z_n$\nrespectively with these spectra such that $X_n + Y_n = Z_n$. There is also a\nrandomized version of this problem where $X_n$ and $Y_n$ are sampled uniformly\nat random from orbits of Hermitian matrices arising from the conjugacy action\nby elements of the unitary group. One then asks for a description of the\nprobability measure of the spectrum of the sum $Z_n$. Both the original Horn\nproblem and its randomized version have solutions using the hives introduced by\nKnutson and Tao. In an asymptotic sense, as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, large\ndeviations for the randomized Horn problem were given by Narayanan and\nSheffield in terms of the surface tension of hives. In this paper, we provide\nupper and lower bounds on this surface tension function. We also obtain a\nclosed-form expression for the total entropy of a surface tension minimizing\ncontinuum hive with boundary conditions arising from GUE eigenspectra. Finally,\nwe give several empirical results for random hives and lozenge tilings arising\nfrom an application of the octahedron recurrence for large $n$ and a numerical\napproximation of the surface tension function.",

The first two sets of TiN films were\ngrown at 600C and 700C under a high vacuum condition. The third set of TiN film\nwas grown in the presence of 5 mTorr of molecular oxygen at 700C. The results\nhave shown that TiN films deposited in a high vacuum are metallic, have large\noptical reflectance, and have high optical and electrical conductivity. The TiN\nfilms, grown in 5 mTorr O2, were partially oxidized and semiconducting with\nroom temperature resistivity nearly three times larger than those of the TiN\nfilms grown under high vacuum conditions. The optical conductivity of these\nfilms was analyzed using a Kramers-Kronig transformation of reflectance and a\nLorentz-Drude model; the optical conductivity determined by these two different\nmethods agreed very well. To corroborate our experimental spectral\nobservations, we have calculated the phonon dispersions and Raman active modes\nof TiNO using the virtual crystal approximation. A comparative analysis of the\nphonon dispersions between rutile TiO2 and rocksalt TiNO has shown that the\nincorporation of nitrogen atoms does not significantly alter the phonon\ndispersions of rutile TiO2. However, it results in the emergence of new phonon\nmodes at approximately 7.128 THz at the Gamma point, which corresponds to the\nexperimentally observed Multi-Photon Phase-MPP. From the collateral study of\nexperimental results and theoretical corroboration, a suitable multi-layer\noptical model was proposed for the TiN/TINO epitaxial thin films to extract the\nindividual complex dielectric function from which many other optical parameters\ncan be calculated.",

The analysis is focused on the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking (SSB) between components of triple solitons, and the formation and\nstability of vortex modes. In the self-focusing regime, we identify symmetric\nand asymmetric soliton states, whose structure and stability are determined by\nthe L\\'evy index of the fractional GVD, the inter-core coupling strength, and\nthe total energy, which determines the system's nonlinearity. Bifurcation\ndiagrams (of the supercritical type) reveal regions where SSB occurs,\nidentifying the respective symmetric and asymmetric ground-state soliton modes.\nIn agreement with the general principle of the SSB theory, the solitons with\nbroken inter-component symmetry prevail with the increase of the energy in the\nweakly-coupled system.

Recent breakthroughs in zero-shot inductive\nreasoning on knowledge graphs (KGs), offer us a new perspective on extending KG\nreasoning to general graph applications.

To demonstrate the effectiveness,\nwe evaluate the inductive reasoning capability of SCR using 38 diverse graph\ndatasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across\nmultiple domains.

Furthermore, topological nodal lines\nhave been predicted in trigonal-PtBi2, and their signature was measured in\nmagnetotransport as a dissipationless, i.e. odd under a magnetic field\nreversal, anomalous planar Hall effect. Understanding the topological\nsuperconducting surface state in trigonal-PtBi2 requires unravelling the\nintrinsic geometric properties of the normal state electronic wavefunctions and\nfurther studies of their hallmarks in charge transport characteristics are\nneeded. In this work, we reveal the presence of a strong dissipative, i.e. even\nunder a magnetic field reversal, planar Hall effect in PtBi2 at low magnetic\nfields and up to room temperature. This robust response can be attributed to\nthe presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. While this effect\ngenerally follows the theoretical prediction for a planar Hall effect in a Weyl\nsemimetal, we show that it deviates from theoretical expectations at both low\nfields and high temperatures. We also discuss the origin of the PHE in our\nmaterial, and the contributions of both the topological features in PtBi2 and\nits possible trivial origin.

The success of VLP largely benefits from the information\ncomplementation and enhancement between different modalities.

To mitigate this predicament, we\npropose CMAL, a Cross-Modal Associative Learning framework with anchor points\ndetection and cross-modal associative learning for VLP. Specifically, we first\nrespectively embed visual objects and textual tokens into separate hypersphere\nspaces to learn intra-modal hidden features, and then design a cross-modal\nassociative prompt layer to perform anchor point masking and swap feature\nfilling for constructing a hybrid cross-modal associative prompt. Afterwards,\nwe exploit a unified semantic encoder to learn their cross-modal interactive\nfeatures for context adaptation. Finally, we design an associative mapping\nclassification layer to learn potential associative mappings between modalities\nat anchor points, within which we develop a fresh self-supervised associative\nmapping classification task to boost CMAL's performance.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for predicting\nCOVID-19 from medical images. In this paper, we propose a novel continual\nlearning-based approach and present the design and implementation of a mobile\napplication for screening COVID-19. Our approach demonstrates the ability to\nadapt to evolving datasets, including data collected from different locations\nor hospitals, varying virus strains, and diverse clinical presentations,\nwithout retraining from scratch. We have evaluated state-of-the-art continual\nlearning methods for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays and selected the\nbest-performing model for our mobile app. We evaluated various deep learning\narchitectures to select the best-performing one as a foundation model for\ncontinual learning. Both regularization and memory-based methods for continual\nlearning were tested, using different memory sizes to develop the optimal\ncontinual learning model for our app. DenseNet161 emerged as the best\nfoundation model with 96.87\\% accuracy, and Learning without Forgetting (LwF)\nwas the top continual learning method with an overall performance of 71.99\\%.\nThe mobile app design considers both patient and doctor perspectives. It\nincorporates the continual learning DenseNet161 LwF model on a cloud server,\nenabling the model to learn from new instances of chest X-rays and their\nclassifications as they are submitted. The app is designed, implemented, and\nevaluated to ensure it provides an efficient tool for COVID-19 screening.

In this paper, we first\npresent a characterization study on a shared production cluster with over\n10,000 GPUs1. We find that fail-slows are caused by various CPU/GPU computation\nand cross-node networking issues, lasting from tens of seconds to nearly ten\nhours, and collectively delaying the average job completion time by 1.34%. The\ncurrent practice is to manually detect these fail-slows and simply treat them\nas fail-stops using a checkpoint-and-restart failover approach, which are\nlabor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose FALCON, a\nframework that rapidly identifies fail-slowed GPUs and/or communication links,\nand effectively tackles them with a novel multi-level mitigation mechanism, all\nwithout human intervention. We have applied FALCON to detect human-labeled\nfail-slows in a production cluster with over 99% accuracy. Cluster deployment\nfurther demonstrates that FALCON effectively handles manually injected\nfail-slows, mitigating the training slowdown by 60.1%.",

Here, the concept of quantum phase transition is\nemployed to enhance the critical current of a kagome superconductor\nCsV$_3$Sb$_5$, which exhibits a charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity\nthat are both affected by hydrostatic pressure. As the CDW phase is rapidly\nsuppressed under pressure, a large enhancement in the self-field critical\ncurrent ($I_{\\rm c,sf}$) is recorded. The observation of a peak-like\nenhancement of $I_{\\rm c,sf}$ at the zero-temperature limit ($I_{\\rm c,sf}(0)$)\ncentred at $p^*\\approx 20$~kbar, the same pressure where the CDW phase\ntransition vanishes, further provides strong evidence of a zero-temperature\nquantum anomaly in this class of pressure-tuned superconductor. Such a peak in\n$I_{\\rm c,sf}(0)$ resembles the findings in other well-established\nquantum-critical superconductors, hinting at the presence of enhanced quantum\nfluctuations associated with the CDW phase in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.",

In 2021, Re Fiorentin et al. discovered five\nsubstructures with disk kinematics including Icarus. To gain more insight into\nthe origin of Icarus as a remnant of a dwarf galaxy rather than a signature of\nsecular processes of disk formation, we complement astrometric Gaia DR3 data\nwith spectroscopy from APOGEE DR17 and GALAH DR3, and explore the\nchemo-dynamical distributions within 3 kpc of the Sun.

Initial research concentrated on the use of fMRI data, but fMRI was\ndeemed to be not suitable for real-world applications, and soon, research\nshifted towards using EEG data. In this paper, we try to improve the original\nperformance of a first attempt at generating text using EEG by focusing on the\nless explored area of optimising neural network performance. We test a set of\ndifferent activation functions and compare their performance. Our results show\nthat introducing a higher degree polynomial activation function can enhance\nmodel performance without changing the model architecture. We also show that\nthe learnable 3rd-degree activation function performs better on the 1-gram\nevaluation compared to a 3rd-degree non-learnable function.

This can\nlead to positive (negative) assortative matching in skill even with submodular\n(supermodular) production functions.

These tasks fail to fully demonstrate LVLMs'\npotential in complex application scenarios. To comprehensively assess the\nperformance of existing LVLMs, we propose a more challenging task called the\nFlow Text with Image Insertion task (FTII). This task requires LVLMs to\nsimultaneously possess outstanding abilities in image comprehension,\ninstruction understanding, and long-text interpretation. Specifically, given\nseveral text paragraphs and a set of candidate images, as the text paragraphs\naccumulate, the LVLMs are required to select the most suitable image from the\ncandidates to insert after the corresponding paragraph. Constructing a\nbenchmark for such a task is highly challenging, particularly in determining\nthe sequence of flowing text and images. To address this challenge, we turn to\nprofessional news reports, which naturally contain a gold standard for\nimage-text sequences. Based on this, we introduce the Flow Text with Image\nInsertion Benchmark (FTII-Bench), which includes 318 high-quality Chinese\nimage-text news articles and 307 high-quality English image-text news articles,\ncovering 10 different news domains. Using these 625 high-quality articles, we\nconstruct problems of two different types with multiple levels of difficulty.\nFurthermore, we establish two different evaluation pipelines based on the CLIP\nmodel and existing LVLMs. We evaluate 9 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs\nas well as 2 CLIP-based models.

Given a global task expressed\nas a conjunction of local tasks defined over the individual and relative states\nof agents in the system, we propose representing task dependencies among agents\nas edges of a suitably defined task graph. At the same time, range-limited\ncommunication naturally induces the definition of a communication graph that\ndefines which agents have access to each other's states. Within these settings,\ninconsistencies arise when a task dependency between a pair of agents is not\nsupported by a corresponding communication link due to the limited\ncommunication range. As a result, state feedback control laws previously\nderived to achieve the tasks' satisfaction can not be leveraged. We propose a\ntask decomposition mechanism to distribute tasks assigned to pairs of\nnon-communicating agents in the system as conjunctions of tasks defined over\nthe relative states of communicating agents, thus enforcing consistency between\ntask and communication graphs. Assuming the super-level sets of the predicate\nfunctions composing the STL tasks are bounded polytopes, our task decomposition\nmechanism can be cast as a parameter optimization problem and solved via\nstate-of-the-art decentralized convex optimization algorithms. To guarantee the\nsoundness of our approach, we present various conditions under which the tasks\ndefined in the applied STL fragment are unsatisfiable, and we show sufficient\nconditions such that our decomposition approach yields satisfiable global tasks\nafter decomposition.",

On the other hand, the acquisition of adequate SPM datasets\nis both time-intensive and laborious as well as skill-dependent. To address\nthese challenges, we propose an Adaptive Prompt Learning with SAM (APL-SAM)\nframework tailored for few-shot SPM image segmentation. Our approach\nincorporates two key innovations to enhance SAM: 1) An Adaptive Prompt Learning\nmodule leverages few-shot embeddings derived from limited support set to learn\nadaptively central representatives, serving as visual prompts. This innovation\neliminates the need for time-consuming online user interactions for providing\nprompts, such as exhaustively marking points and bounding boxes slice by slice;\n2) A multi-source, multi-level mask decoder specifically designed for few-shot\nSPM image segmentation is introduced, which can effectively capture the\ncorrespondence between the support and query images. To facilitate\ncomprehensive training and evaluation, we introduce a new dataset, SPM-Seg,\ncurated for SPM image segmentation. Extensive experiments on this dataset\nreveal that the proposed APL-SAM framework significantly outperforms the\noriginal SAM, achieving over a 30% improvement in terms of Dice Similarity\nCoefficient with only one-shot guidance.

    "abstract": "In the high-stakes domain of search-and-rescue missions, the deployment of\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become increasingly pivotal. These missions\nrequire seamless, real-time communication among diverse roles within response\nteams, particularly between Remote Operators (ROs) and On-Site Operators\n(OSOs). Traditionally, ROs and OSOs have relied on radio communication to\nexchange critical information, such as the geolocation of victims, hazardous\nareas, and points of interest. However, radio communication lacks information\nvisualization, suffers from noise, and requires mental effort to interpret\ninformation, leading to miscommunications and misunderstandings. To address\nthese challenges, this paper presents VizCom-AR, an Augmented Reality system\ndesigned to facilitate visual communication between ROs and OSOs and their\nsituational awareness during UAV-driven search-and-rescue missions. Our\nexperiments, focus group sessions with police officers, and field study showed\nthat VizCom-AR enhances spatial awareness of both ROs and OSOs, facilitate\ngeolocation information exchange, and effectively complement existing\ncommunication tools in UAV-driven emergency response missions. Overall,\nVizCom-AR offers a fundamental framework for designing Augmented Reality\nsystems for large scale UAV-driven rescue missions.",

Research on this equation\nbegan in the late 1990s, but there are no satisfactory results to date. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a symmetric finite difference method (SFDM)\nwhich embeds the symmetry properties of the solutions into a finite difference\nmethod (FDM). This SFDM is primarily used to obtain more accurate solutions and\nbifurcation diagrams for the 3D Bratu equation. Additionally, we propose\nmodifying the Bratu equation by incorporating a new constraint that facilitates\nthe construction of bifurcation diagrams and simplifies handling the turning\npoints. The proposed method, combined with the use of sparse matrix\nrepresentation, successfully solves the 3D Bratu equation on grids of up to\n$301^3$ points. The results demonstrate that SFDM outperforms all previously\nemployed methods for the 3D Bratu equation. Furthermore, we provide bifurcation\ndiagrams for the 1D, 2D, 4D, and 5D cases, and accurately identify the first\nturning points in all dimensions. All simulations indicate that the bifurcation\ndiagrams of the Bratu equation on the cube domains closely resemble the\nwell-established behavior on the ball domains described by Joseph and Lundgren\n[1]. Furthermore, when SFDM is applied to linear stability analysis, it yields\nthe same largest real eigenvalue as the standard FDM despite having fewer\nequations and variables in the nonlinear system.",

Peridynamics (PD) provides an effective computational method to\ndepict fracture mechanics. The explicit adaptive dynamic relaxation (ADR)\nmethod and the implicit methods are two mainstream PD approaches to simulate\nevolution of quasi-static fractures. However, no comprehensive and quantitative\nstudies have been reported to compare their accuracy and efficiency. In this\nwork, we first develop an implicit method for bond-based peridynamics (BBPD)\nbased on the full nonlinear equilibrium equation and the degenerate form of the\nbond failure function, where the Jacobian matrices are derived using the\nNewton-Raphson (NR) scheme. Subsequently, we analyze the solvability of the\nimplicit BBPD scheme. Second, a consistent and comprehensive comparison of\naccuracy and efficiency of the explicit ADR and implicit methods is conducted,\nwhich reveals computational efficiency of the implicit methods and their\nlimitations in accurately describing crack formation. Finally, by utilizing the\nunique advantage of both methods, we develop an adaptive explicit-implicit\nmethod and propose a switching criterion to deploy appropriate scheme\naccordingly. Four typical quasi-static problems are employed as the numerical\nexperiments, which show the acceleration ratios of the current method range\nfrom 6.4 to 141.7 when compared to the explicit ADR. Therefore, the\nexplicit-implicit adaptive method provides a powerful method to simulate\nquasi-static fracture formation and evolution.",

To address the challenge, we introduce a framework of quantum\nsubspace verification, employing the knowledge of quantum error correction code\nsubspaces to reduce the potential measurement budgets. Specifically, we give\nthe sample complexity to estimate the fidelity to the target subspace under\nsome confidence level. Building on the framework, verification operators are\ndeveloped, which can be implemented with experiment-friendly local measurements\nfor stabilizer codes and quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. Our\nconstructions require $O(n-k)$ local measurement settings for both, and the\nsample complexity of $O(n-k)$ for stabilizer codes and of $O((n-k)^2)$ for\ngeneric QLDPC codes, where $n$ and $k$ are the numbers of physical and logical\nqubits, respectively. Notably, for certain codes like the notable\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane codes and QLDPC stabilizer codes, the setting number and\nsample complexity can be significantly reduced and are even independent of $n$.\nIn addition, by combining the proposed subspace verification and direct\nfidelity estimation, we construct a protocol to verify the fidelity of general\nmagic logical states with exponentially smaller sample complexity than previous\nmethods.

Using analytical\nmethods, we show that the scenario of slow (of the order of several seconds)\nneutron-star stripping by the black hole is also possible, depending on the\nsystem parameters (the initial masses and intrinsic angular momenta of the\ncomponents, the equation of state for the neutron star). Reaching the lower\nmass limit (about one tenth of the solar mass), the neutron star explodes to\nproduce a comparatively powerful electromagnetic transient. Our population\ncalculations show that the stripping mechanism is possible in 50-90% of the\ncases among all coalescing neutron star-black hole pairs, depending on the\nmodel assumptions about the evolution of close binary systems (the\ncommon-envelope efficiency parameter, the supernova explosion mechanism) and\nthe initial metallicity of the stellar population. Because of the large mass of\nthe ejected material, the kilonova emission in this scenario has good prospects\nof detection.",

In particular, the emergence of the Multi-Data Source (MDS) oracle\nhas greatly improved the reliability of the oracle in the case of untrustworthy\ndata sources. However, the current MDS oracle scheme requires nodes to obtain\ndata redundantly from multiple data sources to guarantee data reliability,\nwhich greatly increases the resource overhead and response time of the system.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose a Secure and Efficient Multi-data Source\nOracle framework (SEMSO), which nodes only need to access one data source to\nensure the reliability of final data. First, we design a new off-chain data\naggregation protocol TBLS, to guarantee data source diversity and reliability\nat low cost. Second, according to the rational man assumption, the data source\nselection task of nodes is modeled and solved based on the Bayesian game under\nincomplete information to maximize the node's revenue while improving the\nsuccess rate of TBLS aggregation and system response speed. Security analysis\nverifies the reliability of the proposed scheme, and experiments show that\nunder the same environmental assumptions, SEMSO takes into account data\ndiversity while reducing the response time by 23.5\\%.",

In particular, we aim to explain the total\ncounterfactual effect of an agent's action on the outcome of a realized\nscenario through its influence on the environment dynamics and the agents'\nbehavior. To achieve this, we introduce a novel causal explanation formula that\ndecomposes the counterfactual effect by attributing to each agent and state\nvariable a score reflecting their respective contributions to the effect.\nFirst, we show that the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action can be\ndecomposed into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates\nthrough all subsequent agents' actions and another related to the effect that\npropagates through the state transitions. Building on recent advancements in\ncausal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as\nfollows. For the former, we consider agent-specific effects -- a causal concept\nthat quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates\nthrough a subset of agents. Based on this notion, we use Shapley value to\nattribute the effect to individual agents. For the latter, we consider the\nconcept of structure-preserving interventions and attribute the effect to state\nvariables based on their \"intrinsic\" contributions.

The findings reveal a paradox in mixed traffic flow:\nwhile AVs maintain larger safety margins, their conservative behavior can lead\nto unexpected situations for human drivers, potentially causing unsafe\nconditions. From a performance point of view, human drivers exhibit more\nconsistent behavior when interacting with AVs versus other HVs, suggesting AVs\nmay contribute to harmonizing traffic flow patterns. Moreover, notable\ndifferences were observed between Waymo and Lyft vehicles, which highlights the\nimportance of considering manufacturer-specific AV behaviors in traffic\nmodeling and management strategies for the safe integration of AVs.

For example, we find\nthat in these benchmarks, most queries (up to 98% for some query types) can be\nreduced to simpler problems, e.g., link prediction, where only one link needs\nto be predicted. The performance of state-of-the-art CQA models decreases\nsignificantly when such models are evaluated on queries that cannot be reduced\nto easier types.

Very high energy electrons (VHEEs) can effectively target\ntumors deep in the body and can be accelerated to achieve ultra-high dose rates\n(UHDR), making them a promising modality for delivering FLASH radiotherapy in\nthe clinic. However, apart from suitable VHEE sources, clinical translation\nrequires accurate dosimetry, which is challenging due to the limitation of\nstandard dosimeters under UHDR. Water-equivalent and real-time plastic\nscintillation dosimeters (PSDs) may offer a solution. In this study, a\n4-channel PSD, consisting of polystyrene-based BCF12 and Medscint proprietary\nscintillators, polyvinyltoluene (PVT)-based EJ-212 and a clear plastic fiber\nchannel for Cherenkov subtraction was exposed to the 200 MeV VHEE UHDR beam at\nthe CLEAR CERN facility. The Hyperscint RP200 platform was used to assess\nlinearity to dose pulses of up to 90 Gy and dose rates up to 4.6x10$^9$ Gy/s,\nand to investigate radiation damage and recovery after dose accumulation of\n37.2 kGy. While clear fiber response was linear across the entire dose range\nstudied, light output saturated above ~50 Gy/pulse for scintillators. Despite\nradiation damage, linearity was preserved, though it resulted in a decrease of\nscintillator and clear fiber light output of <1.85 %/kGy and a shift in spectra\ntowards longer wavelengths. Short-term recovery (<100h) of these changes was\nobserved and depended on rest duration and accumulated dose. After long-term\nrest (<172 days), light output recovery was partial, with 6-22% of residual\npermanent damage remaining, while spectral recovery was complete. We showed\nthat PSDs are sensitive to radiation damage, but maintain dose linearity even\nafter accumulated dose of 37.2 kGy, and exhibit significant response recovery.\nThis work highlights the potential of PSDs for dosimetry in UHDR conditions.",

Further, we construct a family of DWR schemes using a\ngiven number of auxiliary qubits with indications that the schemes we present\nare optimal in terms of spacetime resource overheads needed for a DWR. We\nhighlight three examples that achieve a constant time or a constant space\noverhead, respectively.

    "abstract": "Text-driven video editing utilizing generative diffusion models has garnered\nsignificant attention due to their potential applications. However, existing\napproaches are constrained by the limited word embeddings provided in\npre-training, which hinders nuanced editing targeting open concepts with\nspecific attributes. Directly altering the keywords in target prompts often\nresults in unintended disruptions to the attention mechanisms. To achieve more\nflexible editing easily, this work proposes an improved concept-augmented video\nediting approach that generates diverse and stable target videos flexibly by\ndevising abstract conceptual pairs. Specifically, the framework involves\nconcept-augmented textual inversion and a dual prior supervision mechanism. The\nformer enables plug-and-play guidance of stable diffusion for video editing,\neffectively capturing target attributes for more stylized results. The dual\nprior supervision mechanism significantly enhances video stability and\nfidelity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach generates\nmore stable and lifelike videos, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be\napplied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and\nthe latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or\nmore generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose\nFiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific\nrouters to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input\nsequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be\nskipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling\nfaster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be\neasily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input\nadaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a\ncrucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive\nexperiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming\nother layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive\nperformance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even\nimproves upon it.

    "abstract": "Research on the identification of the two-phase flow pattern of gas-liquid in\na vertical rising pipe is of great significance for improving the production\ncapacity and production efficiency of the petrochemical industry. In order to\naddress the problem of the accuracy of the identification of the two-phase flow\npattern of gas-liquid, this paper proposes a method for identifying the\ntwo-phase flow pattern of gas-liquid in a vertical rising pipe based on BP\nneural networks. In the study, the Fluent software was used to numerically\nsimulate different two-phase flow velocities. The pipes were all constructed as\nvertical rising pipes with an inner diameter of 20 mm and a length of 2000 mm.\nThree flow pattern cloud diagrams and their related data were obtained for\nbubble flow, elastic flow, and annular flow. The gas content of the three flow\ntypes was used to collect data to form a database. The BP neural network was\nused to classify and identify the three flow patterns, but the result was only\n90.73%. We again used the Adam algorithm to optimise the BP neural network and\nregularise it, and the flow pattern recognition result reached 96.68%, which\nwas a better recognition",

    "abstract": "The burgeoning field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) stands at a\ncritical juncture where the integration of fairness within its frameworks has\nbecome an imperative. This PhD thesis addresses the need for equity and\ntransparency in NLP systems, recognizing that fairness in NLP is not merely a\ntechnical challenge but a moral and ethical necessity, requiring a rigorous\nexamination of how these technologies interact with and impact diverse human\npopulations. Through this lens, this thesis undertakes a thorough investigation\ninto the development of equitable NLP methodologies and the evaluation of\nbiases that prevail in current systems.\n  First, it introduces an innovative algorithm to mitigate biases in\nmulti-class classifiers, tailored for high-risk NLP applications, surpassing\ntraditional methods in both bias mitigation and prediction accuracy. Then, an\nanalysis of the Bios dataset reveals the impact of dataset size on\ndiscriminatory biases and the limitations of standard fairness metrics. This\nawareness has led to explorations in the field of explainable AI, aiming for a\nmore complete understanding of biases where traditional metrics are limited.\nConsequently, the thesis presents COCKATIEL, a model-agnostic explainability\nmethod that identifies and ranks concepts in Transformer models, outperforming\nprevious approaches in sentiment analysis tasks. Finally, the thesis\ncontributes to bridging the gap between fairness and explainability by\nintroducing TaCo, a novel method to neutralize bias in Transformer model\nembeddings.\n  In conclusion, this thesis constitutes a significant interdisciplinary\nendeavor that intertwines explicability and fairness to challenge and reshape\ncurrent NLP paradigms. The methodologies and critiques presented contribute to\nthe ongoing discourse on fairness in machine learning, offering actionable\nsolutions for more equitable and responsible AI systems.",

We observe a single oscillating, coherent solitary wave emerging from\na variety of initial conditions. Using the direct scattering transform of the\n(integrable) cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation, we find that this structure\nis a bound state, comprising of a primary and secondary soliton whose\namplitudes oscillate out of phase. We interpret this as the solitons\nperiodically exchanging mass. We observe this bound state self-organising from\na state of incoherent turbulence, and from solitonic structures launched into\nthe system. When a single (primary) solitonic structure is launched, a\nresonance process between it and waves in the system generates the secondary\nsoliton, resulting in the bound state. Further, when two solitons are initially\nlaunched, we show that they can merge if their phases are synchronised when\nthey collide. When the system is launched from a turbulent state comprised of\nmany initial solitons, we propose that the bound state formation is preceded a\nsequence of binary collisions, in which the mass is transferred on average from\nthe weak soliton to the strong one, with occasional soliton mergers. Both\nprocesses lead to increasingly stronger and fewer dominant solitons. The final\nstate -- a solitary double-solitonic bound state surrounded by weakly nonlinear\nwaves -- is robust and ubiquitous. We propose that for nonlocal media, it is a\nmore typical statistical attractor than a single-soliton attractor suggested in\nprevious literature.",

To cope with these issues,\nwe propose DH-VTON, a deep text-driven virtual try-on model featuring a special\nhybrid attention learning strategy and deep garment semantic preservation\nmodule.

Based on this, to enhance the customized dressing\nabilities, we further introduce Garment-Feature ControlNet Plus (abbr.

The modelling of baryon feedback is crucial to ensure unbiased\ncosmological parameter constraints; the most efficient approach is to use\nanalytic models, but these are limited by how well they can capture the physics\nof baryon feedback. We investigate the fitting and residual errors of various\nbaryon feedback models to a suite of hydrodynamic simulations, and propagate\nthese to cosmological parameter constraints for cosmic shear. We present an\nalternative formalism to binary scale-cuts through the use of a theoretical\nerror covariance, which is a well-motivated alternative using errors in the\npower spectrum modelling itself. We depart from previous works by modelling\nbaryonic feedback errors directly in the matter power spectrum, which is the\nnatural basis to do so and thus preserves information in the lensing kernels.\nWhen including angular multipoles up to $\\ell_{\\mathrm{max}} = 5000$, and\nassuming Euclid-like survey properties, we find that even multi-parameter\nmodels of baryon feedback can introduce significant levels of bias. In\ncontrast, our theoretical error reduces the bias in $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and\n$S_{8}$ to acceptable levels, with only a modest increase in parameter\nvariances.

    "abstract": "The centerpiece of topological photonics is the bulk-boundary correspondence\nprinciple (BBCP), which relates discrete invariants of the Bloch bands to the\npossible presence of interface modes between two periodic heterostructures. In\naddition to the fundamental significance of BBCP, interface modes per se are of\ninterest in a variety of applications. In Maxwell's electrodynamics, the BBCP\nhas been rigorously proved for 1D problems, but the 2D case is qualitatively\ndifferent, as the boundary conditions involve nontrivial Dirichlet-to-Neumann\nmaps rather than scalar impedances as in 1D. The theoretical analysis and\nnumerical examples in the paper are consistent with the BBCP. Moreover, the\nBBCP is closely connected with the positivity of electromagnetic energy\ndensity, as has also been shown to be true in 1D cases.",

To address these challenges, we explore\nthe non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based grant-free random access (GFRA)\nschemes in the cellular uplink to support massive IoT devices with high\nspectrum efficiency and low access latency. In particular, we focus on\noptimizing the backoff strategy of each device when transmitting time-sensitive\ndata samples to a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-enabled base station\nsubject to energy constraints. To cope with the dynamic varied channel and the\nsevere uplink interference due to the uncoordinated grant-free access, we\nformulate the optimization problem as a multi-user non-cooperative dynamic\nstochastic game (MUN-DSG). To avoid dimensional disaster as the device number\ngrows large, the optimization problem is transformed into a mean field game\n(MFG), and its Nash equilibrium can be achieved by solving the corresponding\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations.\nThus, a Mean Field-based Dynamic Backoff (MFDB) scheme is proposed as the\noptimal GFRA solution for each device.

    "abstract": "Latent-based image generative models, such as Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)\nand Mask Image Models (MIMs), have achieved notable success in image generation\ntasks. These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN\nor VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data\ndistribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this\npractice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In\nresponse, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same\nlatent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in\nimage generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where\nthe autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address\nthis discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship\nbetween latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent\nspace in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but\neffective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image\ngenerative modeling by applying K-Means on the latent features of\nself-supervised learning models. Experimental results show that image\nautoregressive modeling with our tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image\nunderstanding and image generation with the next token prediction principle,\nwhich is inherently straightforward for GPT models but challenging for other\ngenerative models. Remarkably, for the first time, a GPT-style autoregressive\nmodel for images outperforms LDMs, which also exhibits substantial improvement\nakin to GPT when scaling up model size. Our findings underscore the potential\nof an optimized latent space and the integration of discrete tokenization in\nadvancing the capabilities of image generative models.

When\nconsidering low-cost gyroscopes, the calibration requires a turntable as the\ngyros are incapable of sensing the Earth turn rate. In this paper, we propose a\ndata-driven framework to estimate the scale factor and bias of a gyroscope. To\ntrain and validate our approach, a dataset of 56 minutes was recorded using a\nturntable. We demonstrated that our proposed approach outperforms the\nmodel-based approach, in terms of accuracy and convergence time.

The flexible\njob shop scheduling problem (FJSSP), which involves processing operations on\nvarious capable machines, accurately reflects the complexities of modern\nmanufacturing settings. This paper investigates the FJSSP involving\nreconfigurable machine tools with configuration dependent setup times, while\nintegrating human aspects like worker assignments, moving time, and rest\nperiods, as well as minimizing total energy consumption. A mixed-integer\nprogramming (MIP) model is developed to simultaneously optimize these\nobjectives. The model determines the assignment of operations to machines,\nworkers, and configurations while sequencing operations, scheduling worker\nmovements, and respecting rest periods, and minimizing overall energy\nconsumption. Given the NPhard nature of the FJSSP with worker assignments and\nreconfigurable tools, a memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed. This metaheuristic\nevolutionary algorithm features a three layer chromosome encoding method,\nspecialized crossover and mutation strategies, and neighborhood search\nmechanisms to enhance solution quality and diversity. Comparisons of MA with\nMIP and genetic algorithms (GA) on benchmark instances demonstrate the MA\nefficiency and effectiveness, particularly for larger problem instances where\nMIP becomes impractical.

    "abstract": "Supervaluational fixed-point theories of formal truth aim to amend an\nimportant shortcoming of fixed-point theories based on the Strong Kleene logic,\nnamely, accounting for the truth of classical validities. In a celebrated\npaper, Andrea Cantini proposed an axiomatization of one such supervaluational\ntheory of truth, which he called VF, and which proved to be incredibly strong\nproof-theoretically speaking. However, VF only axiomatizes one in a collection\nof several supervaluational schemes, namely the scheme which requires truth to\nbe consistent. In this paper, we provide axiomatic theories for the remaining\nsupervaluational schemes, labelling these systems VF$^-$ (for the theory which\ndrops the consistency requirement), and VFM (for the theory which requires not\nonly consistency but also completeness, i.e., maximal consistency). We then\ncarry out proof-theoretic analyses of both theories. Our results show that\nVF$^-$ is as strong as VF, but that VFM's strength decreases significantly,\nbeing only as strong as the well-known theory KF. Furthermore, we introduce and\nanalyse proof-theoretically two variants of these theories: the schematic\nextension, in the sense of Feferman, of VFM; and a theory in-between VFM and\nVF, that we call VFW, and which drops the assumption of maximal consistency.\nThe former is shown to match the strength of predicative analysis; for the\nlatter, we show its proof-theoretical equivalence with ramified analysis up to\nthe ordinal $\\varphi_20$, thus standing halfway between VFM and VF.",

Using particle-in-cell simulations, we reveal a novel multi-beam\ncollaborative mechanism of two-plasmon decay (TPD) and stimulated Raman\nscattering (SRS), and investigate the angular variations of hot electrons\ngenerated from this shared TPD-SRS (STS) instability driven collectively by\ndual laser beams with varying incident angles $\\theta_{in}$ ($24^\\circ$ to\n$55^\\circ$ at the incident plane) for typical ICF conditions. In the\nsimulations with $\\theta_{in}\\gtrsim44^\\circ$, STS emerges as the dominant\nmechanism responsible for hot electron generation, leading to a wide angular\ndistribution of hot electrons that exhibit both pronounced divergent and\ncollimated components. The common Langmuir wave associated with STS plays a\ncrucial role in accelerating both components.By properly modeling the STS\ncommon wave gains, we establish scaling relations between these gains and the\nenergies of collimated and divergent hot electrons. These relations reveal that\nthe divergent hot electrons are more sensitive to variations in gain compared\nto the collimated electrons. Additionally, the calculated gains qualitatively\npredict the asymmetry in hot electron angular distributions when the density\ngradients deviate from the bisector of the laser beams.

    "abstract": "Black-box optimization algorithms have been widely used in various machine\nlearning problems, including reinforcement learning and prompt fine-tuning.\nHowever, directly optimizing the training loss value, as commonly done in\nexisting black-box optimization methods, could lead to suboptimal model quality\nand generalization performance. To address those problems in black-box\noptimization, we propose a novel Sharpness-Aware Black-box Optimization (SABO)\nalgorithm, which applies a sharpness-aware minimization strategy to improve the\nmodel generalization. Specifically, the proposed SABO method first\nreparameterizes the objective function by its expectation over a Gaussian\ndistribution. Then it iteratively updates the parameterized distribution by\napproximated stochastic gradients of the maximum objective value within a small\nneighborhood around the current solution in the Gaussian distribution space.\nTheoretically, we prove the convergence rate and generalization bound of the\nproposed SABO algorithm. Empirically, extensive experiments on the black-box\nprompt fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SABO\nmethod in improving model generalization performance.",

This is in stark contrast to CATE where it\nis possible to obtain high-quality estimates which have less dependency upon\nthe smoothness of the nuisance parameters when the CATE itself is smooth.\nMoreover, relative smoothness of the CQTE lacks the interpretability of\nsmoothness of the CATE making it less clear whether it is a reasonable\nassumption to make. We combine the desirable properties of CATE and CQTE by\nconsidering a new estimand, the conditional quantile comparator (CQC). The CQC\nnot only retains information about the whole treatment distribution, similar to\nCQTE, but also having more natural examples of smoothness and is able to\nleverage simplicity in an auxiliary estimand. We provide finite sample bounds\non the error of our estimator, demonstrating its ability to exploit simplicity.\nWe validate our theory in numerical simulations which show that our method\nproduces more accurate estimates than baselines.

Existing debiasing methods often\nfail to capture the complex interactions caused by latent confounders in\ninteraction data, especially when dual latent confounders affect both the user\nand item sides. To address this, we propose a novel debiasing method that\njointly integrates the Instrumental Variables (IV) approach and identifiable\nVariational Auto-Encoder (iVAE) for Debiased representation learning in\nRecommendation systems, referred to as IViDR. Specifically, IViDR leverages the\nembeddings of user features as IVs to address confounding bias caused by latent\nconfounders between items and user feedback, and reconstructs the embedding of\nitems to obtain debiased interaction data. Moreover, IViDR employs an\nIdentifiable Variational Auto-Encoder (iVAE) to infer identifiable\nrepresentations of latent confounders between item exposure and user feedback\nfrom both the original and debiased interaction data. Additionally, we provide\ntheoretical analyses of the soundness of using IV and the identifiability of\nthe latent representations.

One such observable is the invariant mass $m_{b\\ell}$ of the\nb-jet and the charged lepton obtained from fully leptonic decay of\npair-produced $t \\bar{t}$ events. Such a strategy can be employed to extract\nhints for any Beyond Standard Model (BSM) scenario that allow for an exotic\nparticle with mass close to the mass of top-quark ($m_t$) and can yield the\nsame final state as fully leptonic decay of pair-produced top quarks.

The particle spectrum is such\nthat the mass differences between the particles involved in the signal are\nsmall enough to lie in a potential blindspot and may be not yet firmly excluded\nby current LHC searches. Such spectra can yield a deviation from the Standard\nModel prediction in the lower region of the $m_{b\\ell}$ distribution.

    "abstract": "We address the optimization problem in a data-driven variational\nreconstruction framework, where the regularizer is parameterized by an\ninput-convex neural network (ICNN). While gradient-based methods are commonly\nused to solve such problems, they struggle to effectively handle non-smoothness\nwhich often leads to slow convergence. Moreover, the nested structure of the\nneural network complicates the application of standard non-smooth optimization\ntechniques, such as proximal algorithms. To overcome these challenges, we\nreformulate the problem and eliminate the network's nested structure. By\nrelating this reformulation to epigraphical projections of the activation\nfunctions, we transform the problem into a convex optimization problem that can\nbe efficiently solved using a primal-dual algorithm. We also prove that this\nreformulation is equivalent to the original variational problem. Through\nexperiments on several imaging tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms subgradient methods in terms of both speed and stability.",

While traditional techniques like vibrational and mass\nspectroscopies are time-consuming and have limitations in analysing polymers\nwith pigment additives, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) shows promise due to\nits high sensitivity and rapid detection capabilities.However, existing SPR\nmethods rely on one output variable and fail to determine various microplastic\nparameters simultaneously. To address this uncertainty between size and polymer\ntype, we propose a prism design that enables SPR resonance in a refractive\nindex range of 1.402-1.56 RIU (Refractive Index Units) for polymer detection.\nExperimental verification of the prism's dynamic range using refractive index\noils presented an agreement of 98.47% with theoretical analysis. Furthermore,\nwe acquired SPR curves from ten different polymer types, including Nitrile,\nViton and Tyre rubber. These results demonstrate SPR's potential to identify\npolymers and its ability to detect even pigmented materials, often challenging\nfor other techniques. The imaging capabilities of the novel prism are\npresented, indicating its potential for future imaging of microplastics.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancements of various machine learning models, there is a\nsignificant demand for model-agnostic explanation techniques, which can explain\nthese models across different architectures. Mainstream model-agnostic\nexplanation techniques generate local explanations based on basic features\n(e.g., words for text models and (super-)pixels for image models). However,\nthese explanations often do not align with the decision-making processes of the\ntarget models and end-users, resulting in explanations that are unfaithful and\ndifficult for users to understand. On the other hand, concept-based techniques\nprovide explanations based on high-level features (e.g., topics for text models\nand objects for image models), but most are model-specific or require\nadditional pre-defined external concept knowledge. To address this limitation,\nwe propose \\toolname, a general framework to provide concept-based local\nexplanations for any machine learning models. Our key insight is that we can\nautomatically extract high-level concepts from large pre-trained models, and\nuniformly extend existing local model-agnostic techniques to provide unified\nconcept-based explanations. We have instantiated \\toolname on four different\ntypes of explanation techniques: LIME, Kernel SHAP, Anchor, and LORE, and\napplied these techniques to text and image models. Our evaluation results\ndemonstrate that 1) compared to the vanilla versions, \\toolname offers more\nfaithful explanations and makes them more understandable to users, and 2) by\noffering multiple forms of explanations, \\toolname outperforms state-of-the-art\nconcept-based explanation techniques specifically designed for text and image\nmodels, respectively.",

However, the existing methods usually\nrely on the joint probability models of power generation and loads provided by\nprobabilistic prediction to quantify the voltage risks, where inaccurate\nprediction results could lead to over or under estimated risks. This paper\nproposes an uncertain voltage component (UVC) prediction method for assessing\nand managing voltage risks. First, we define the UVC to evaluate voltage\nvariations caused by the uncertainties associated with power generation and\nloads. Second, we propose a Gaussian mixture model-based probabilistic UVC\nprediction method to depict the non-Gaussian distribution of voltage\nvariations. Then, we derive the voltage risk indices, including value-at-risk\n(VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), based on the probabilistic UVC\nprediction model. Third, we investigate the mechanism of UVC-based voltage risk\nmanagement and establish the voltage risk management problems, which are\nreformulated into linear programming or mixed-integer linear programming for\nconvenient solutions. The proposed method is tested on power distribution\nsystems with actual photovoltaic power and load data and compared with those\nconsidering probabilistic prediction of nodal power injections. Numerical\nresults show that the proposed method is computationally efficient in assessing\nvoltage risks and outperforms existing methods in managing voltage risks. The\ndeviation of voltage risks obtained by the proposed method is only 15% of that\nby the methods based on probabilistic prediction of nodal power injections.",

Recently, it has been\nproposed that nonlinear periodic modulations known as cnoidal waves, that\nnaturally emerge in Bose-Einstein condensates, provide a promising platform to\nfind and study supersolidity in nonequilibrium phases of matter. Nevertheless,\nso far the analysis has been limited to a one-dimensional zero-temperature\nsystem. By combining the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a finite\ntemperature holographic model, we show that the proposed cnoidal wave\nsupersolid phases of matter are always energetically and dynamically unstable\nat finite temperature. We ascribe this instability to the dynamics of the\n\"elastic\" Goldstone mode arising as a direct consequence of translational\norder. Finally, we study the dynamical instability of the supersolid state and\nconnect it to the production of topological defects during the relaxation\ntowards a final homogeneous equilibrium state with smaller superflow current,\nsimilar to the Landau instability dynamics in superfluids.

    "abstract": "MINFLUX is an emerging super-resolution technology that measures the position\nof single fluorophores with nanometer precision using fewer photons than any\nother fluorescence imaging or tracking technique. Here, we derive simple and\ninstructive analytical equations for MINFLUX localization precision with a\nspecial focus on background photons. A fluorescence background, either arising\nfrom an imperfect zero of the MINFLUX excitation point spread function (PSF) or\nfrom auto- or out-of-focus fluorescence, ultimately limits the resolution\nachievable with MINFLUX. Building on previous work, we try to improve our\nunderstanding of the influence of background, especially when it is unknown,\nthrough a new set of expressions for the localization precision, based on an\nexplicit background term instead of signal-to-background ratio. We use these\nequations to generate an intuitive understanding of how fluorescence background\naffects MINFLUX measurements and illustrate that:\n  - The precision of an emitter position estimate depends on the gradient of\nits excitation profile.\n  - Knowledge of the fluorescence background, obtained during post-processing\nof MINFLUX traces or through separate measurements, provides a better\nlocalization precision than in the case of unknown background.\n  - In diffraction-limited systems, localization with a PSF that features a\nnear-zero minimum outperforms localization with a maximum.\n  We also present an analytical expression for the localization precision in\norbital tracking, which we use for comparison to MINFLUX.",

    "abstract": "Frequency mixers are fundamental components in modern wireless communication\nand radar systems, responsible for up- and down-conversion of target\nradio-frequency (RF) signals. Recently, photonic-assisted RF mixers have shown\nunique advantages over traditional electronic counterparts, including broad\noperational bandwidth, flat frequency response, and immunity to electromagnetic\ninterference. However, current integrated photonic mixers face significant\nchallenges in achieving efficient conversion at high frequencies, especially in\nmillimeter-wave bands, due to the limitations of existing electro-optic (EO)\nmodulators. Additionally, high-frequency local oscillators in the\nmillimeter-wave range are often difficult to obtain and expensive, leading to\nunsatisfactory cost and restricted operational bandwidth in practice. In this\npaper, we harness the exceptional EO property and scalability of thin-film\nlithium niobate (TFLN) photonic platform to implement a high-performance\nharmonic reconfigurable millimeter-wave mixer. The TFLN photonic circuit\nintegrates a broadband EO modulator that allows for extensive frequency\ncoverage, and an EO frequency comb source that significantly reduces the\nrequired carrier frequency of the local oscillator. We experimentally\ndemonstrate fully reconfigurable frequency down-conversion across a broad\noperational bandwidth ranging from 20 GHz to 67 GHz, with a large intermediate\nfrequency of 20 GHz, as well as up-conversion to frequencies of up to 110 GHz.\nOur integrated photonic mixing system shows dramatically improved bandwidth\nperformance, along with competitive indicators of frequency conversion\nefficiency and spurious suppression ratio, positioning it as a promising\nsolution for future millimeter-wave transceivers in next-generation\ncommunication and sensing systems.",

Reasoning allows for\nthe generation of derived knowledge capturing complex business semantics and\nthe set up of effective business processes.

    "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges, yet\nmisconceptions persist regarding its causes and impact. This report addresses\ncommon myths surrounding climate change and presents scientific evidence to\nclarify its reality. Utilising data from NASA, NOAA, and the NSW government,\nthis study provides evidence of rising global temperatures, melting ice sheets,\nrising sea levels, and extreme weather patterns in regions like New South\nWales. The analysis demonstrates the human-driven nature of climate change,\nprimarily caused by increased carbon emissions. Engineering solutions,\nincluding renewable energy technologies, green buildings, and carbon capture\nmethods, are essential to mitigating the effects of climate change. Future\nresearch should focus on improving the scalability of these technologies and\naddressing the broader impact on ecosystems and human societies.",

Autonomous navigation under the canopy is challenging due to\nthe degradation in accuracy of RTK-GPS and the large variability in the visual\nappearance of the scene over time. In prior work, we developed a supervised\nlearning-based perception system with semantic keypoint representation and\ndeployed this in various field conditions. A large number of failures of this\nsystem can be attributed to the inability of the perception model to adapt to\nthe domain shift encountered during deployment. In this paper, we propose a\nself-supervised online adaptation method for adapting the semantic keypoint\nrepresentation using a visual foundational model, geometric prior, and pseudo\nlabeling. Our preliminary experiments show that with minimal data and\nfine-tuning of parameters, the keypoint prediction model trained with labels on\nthe source domain can be adapted in a self-supervised manner to various\nchallenging target domains onboard the robot computer using our method. This\ncan enable fully autonomous row-following capability in under-canopy robots\nacross fields and crops without requiring human intervention.",

Since in\nseveral applications, especially for planning a route from A to B with\nwaypoints, the input graph can be restricted to tree-like or path-like\nstructures, in this paper we consider orienteering on these graph classes.\n  While the Orienteering Problem with time windows is NP-hard even on\nundirected paths and cycles, and remains so even if all profits must be\ncollected, we show that for directed paths it can be solved efficiently, even\nif each profit can be collected in one of several time windows. The same case\nis shown to be NP-hard for directed cycles.\n  Particularly interesting is the Orienteering Problem on a directed cycle with\none time window per profit. We give an efficient algorithm for the case where\nall time windows are shorter than the length of the cycle, resulting in a\n2-approximation for the general setting. We further develop a polynomial-time\napproximation scheme for this problem and give a polynomial algorithm for the\ncase where all profits must be collected.\n  For the Orienteering Problem with time windows for the edges, we give a\nquadratic time algorithm for undirected paths and observe that the problem is\nNP-hard for trees.\n  In the variant without time windows, we show that on trees and thus on graphs\nwith bounded tree-width the Orienteering Problem remains NP-hard.

However,\nmost existing approaches oversimplify this task into query classification or\nclustering, which fails to fully capture the nuanced intent behind the query.\nIn this paper, we address the task of query intent generation: to automatically\ngenerate detailed and precise intent descriptions for search queries using\nrelevant and irrelevant documents given a query. These intent descriptions can\nhelp users understand why the search engine considered the top-ranked documents\nrelevant, and provide more transparency to the retrieval process. We propose a\ndual-space model that uses semantic relevance and irrelevance information in\nthe returned documents to explain the understanding of the query intent.\nSpecifically, in the encoding process, we project, separate, and distinguish\nrelevant and irrelevant documents in the representation space. Then, we\nintroduce a semantic decoupling model in the novel disentangling space, where\nthe semantics of irrelevant information are removed from the relevant space,\nensuring that only the essential and relevant intent is captured. This process\nrefines the understanding of the query and provides more accurate explanations\nfor the search results.

    "abstract": "Recently, neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) models trained with\nflow matching have achieved impressive performance on the zero-shot voice clone\ntask. Nevertheless, postulating standard Gaussian noise as the initial\ndistribution of ODE gives rise to numerous intersections within the fitted\ntargets of flow matching, which presents challenges to model training and\nenhances the curvature of the learned generated trajectories. These curved\ntrajectories restrict the capacity of ODE models for generating desirable\nsamples with a few steps. This paper proposes SF-Speech, a novel voice clone\nmodel based on ODE and in-context learning. Unlike the previous works,\nSF-Speech adopts a lightweight multi-stage module to generate a more\ndeterministic initial distribution for ODE. Without introducing any additional\nloss function, we effectively straighten the curved reverse trajectories of the\nODE model by jointly training it with the proposed module. Experiment results\non datasets of various scales show that SF-Speech outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot TTS methods and requires only a quarter of the\nsolver steps, resulting in a generation speed approximately 3.7 times that of\nVoicebox and E2 TTS.

Despite its\npotential, the effective integration of FBC in DRL-based AoI optimization\nremains underexplored, especially in addressing the challenge of simultaneously\nupper-bounding both delay and error-rate. To address these challenges, we\npropose a DRL-based framework for AoI-aware optimal resource allocation in\nmURLLC-driven multi-QoS schemes, leveraging AoI as a core metric within the\nfinite blocklength regime. First, we design a wireless communication\narchitecture and AoI-based modeling framework that incorporates FBC. Second, we\nproceed by deriving upper-bounded peak AoI and delay violation probabilities\nusing stochastic network calculus (SNC). Subsequently, we formulate an\noptimization problem aimed at minimizing the peak AoI violation probability\nthrough FBC. Third, we develop DRL algorithms to determine optimal resource\nallocation policies that meet statistical delay and error-rate requirements for\nmURLLC. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the developed schemes, we\nhave executed a series of simulations.",

Through\nmultiple training stages, the model first learns to align its reasoning with\naccurate decision paths by optimizing the log odds between preferred and\nnon-preferred responses. During this process, PRefLexOR builds a dynamic\nknowledge graph by generating questions from random text chunks and\nretrieval-augmentation to contextualize relevant details from the entire\ntraining corpus. In the second stage, preference optimization enhances model\nperformance by using rejection sampling to fine-tune reasoning quality by\ncontinually producing in-situ training data while masking the reasoning steps.\nRecursive optimization within a thinking token framework introduces iterative\nfeedback loops, where the model refines reasoning, achieving deeper coherence,\nconsistency, and adaptability.

It can also be used to predict the future state of the\nenvironment.\n  This project explores learning the top-down view of an RL environment based\non the artificial agent's first-person view observations with a generative\nadversarial network(GAN). The top-down view is useful as it provides a complete\noverview of the environment by building a map of the entire environment. It\nprovides information about the objects' dimensions and shapes along with their\nrelative positions with one another. Initially, when only a partial observation\nof the environment is visible to the agent, only a partial top-down view is\ngenerated. As the agent explores the environment through a set of actions, the\ngenerated top-down view becomes complete. This generated top-down view can\nassist the agent in deducing better policy decisions. The focus of the project\nis to learn the top-down view of an RL environment. It doesn't deal with any\nReinforcement Learning task.",

However, if the\nretrieved context is inaccurate, the answers generated using the large language\nmodel (LLM) may contain errors or hallucinations. Although pretrained embedding\nmodels have advanced, adapting them to new domains remains challenging.\nFine-tuning is a potential solution, but industry settings often lack the\nnecessary fine-tuning data. To address these challenges, we propose REFINE, a\nnovel technique that generates synthetic data from available documents and then\nuses a model fusion approach to fine-tune embeddings for improved retrieval\nperformance in new domains, while preserving out-of-domain capability. We\nconducted experiments on the two public datasets: SQUAD and RAG-12000 and a\nproprietary TOURISM dataset. Results demonstrate that even the standard\nfine-tuning with the proposed data augmentation technique outperforms the\nvanilla pretrained model. Furthermore, when combined with model fusion, the\nproposed approach achieves superior performance, with a 5.76% improvement in\nrecall on the TOURISM dataset, and 6.58 % and 0.32% enhancement on SQUAD and\nRAG-12000 respectively.",

However, existing methods typically\nfail to account for latent confounders between users and their feedback, as\nwell as those between items and user feedback simultaneously. To address the\nproblem of multi-cause latent confounders, we propose a multi-cause\ndeconfounding method for recommender systems with latent confounders (MCDCF).\nMCDCF leverages multi-cause causal effect estimation to learn substitutes for\nlatent confounders associated with both users and items, using user behaviour\ndata. Specifically, MCDCF treats the multiple items that users interact with\nand the multiple users that interact with items as treatment variables,\nenabling it to learn substitutes for the latent confounders that influence the\nestimation of causality between users and their feedback, as well as between\nitems and user feedback. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate the\nsoundness of our MCDCF method.

As the size of the model and data grows, the KV cache can\nquickly become a bottleneck within the system in both storage and memory\ntransfer. To address this, prior studies usually focus on the first three axes\nof the cache tensors for compression. This paper supplements them, focusing on\nthe feature dimension axis, by utilizing low-rank projection matrices to\ntransform the cache features into spaces with reduced dimensions. We begin by\ninvestigating the canonical orthogonal projection method for data compression\nthrough principal component analysis (PCA). We observe the issue with PCA\nprojection where significant performance degradation is observed at low\ncompression rates. To bridge the gap, we propose to directly tune the\northogonal projection matrices with a distillation objective using an elaborate\nMatryoshka training strategy. After training, we adaptively search for the\noptimal compression rates for various layers and heads given varying\ncompression budgets. Compared to previous works, our method can easily embrace\npre-trained LLMs and hold a smooth tradeoff between performance and compression\nrate. We empirically witness the high data efficiency of our training procedure\nand find that our method can sustain over 90% performance with an average KV\ncache compression rate of 60% (and up to 75% in certain extreme scenarios) for\npopular LLMs like LLaMA2-7B-base and Mistral-7B-v0.3-base.",

    "abstract": "The area of spectral analysis has a traditional dichotomy between continuous\nspectra (spectral densities) which correspond to purely nondeterministic\nprocesses, and line spectra (Dirac impulses) which represent sinusoids. While\nthe former case is important in the identification of discrete-time linear\nstochastic systems, the latter case is essential for the analysis and modeling\nof time series with notable applications in radar systems. In this paper, we\ndevelop a novel approach for line spectral estimation which combines ideas of\nGeorgiou's filter banks (G-filters) and atomic norm minimization (ANM), a\nmainstream method for line spectral analysis in the last decade following the\ntheory of compressed sensing. Such a combination is only possible because a\nCarath\\'{e}odory--Fej\\'{e}r-type decomposition is available for the covariance\nmatrix of the filter output. The ANM problem can be characterized via\nsemidefinite programming which can be solved efficiently. As a consequence, our\noptimization scheme can be seen as a substantial generalization of the standard\nANM for line spectral estimation. Moreover, our ANM approach with a G-filter\nhas significant advantages over subspace methods because it can work with just\none output vector and without \\emph{a priori} knowledge about the number of\nsinusoids in the input. Simulation results show that our approach performs\nfavorably against the standard ANM, the frequency-selective ANM, and standard\nsubspace methods MUSIC and ESPRIT under a variety of parameter configurations\nwhen the G-filter is suitably designed.",

    "abstract": "Using standard tight-binding methods, we investigate a novel backscattering\nmechanism taking place on quantum spin Hall N'SNSN' Josephson junctions in the\npresence of time-reversal symmetry. This extended geometry allows for the\ninterplay between two types of Andreev bound states (ABS): the usual\nphase-dependent ABS localized at the edges of the central SNS junction\n\\emph{and} phase-independent ABS localized at the edges of the N'S regions.\nCrucially, the latter arise at discrete energies $E_n$ and mediate a\nbackscattering process between opposite edges on the SNS junction, yielding gap\nopenings when both types of ABS are at resonance. In this scenario, a\n4$\\pi$-periodic ABS decouples from the rest of the spectrum, and thus, it can\nbe probed preventing the emission to the quasicontinuum. Interestingly, this\nbackscattering mechanism introduces a new length scale, determining the ratio\nbetween $4\\pi$- and $2\\pi$-periodic supercurrent contributions and distorts the\nsuperconducting quantum interference (SQI) pattern. Finally, to proof the\nparticipation of these ABS, we propose to use a magnetic flux to tune $E_n$ to\nzero, resulting in the selective lifting of the fractional Josephson effect.",

We\noutline the main economic forces specific to science, noting the limited\nattention given to grant funding in the economics literature. Using tools from\ninformation economics, we identify key incentive problems at various stages of\nthe grant funding process and offer guidance for effective grant design.\n  In the allocation stage, funders aim to select the highest-merit applications\nwhile minimizing evaluation costs. The selection rule, in turn, impacts\nresearchers' incentives to apply and invest in their proposals. In the grant\nmanagement stage, funders monitor researchers to ensure efficient use of funds.\nWe discuss the advantages and potential pitfalls of (partial) lotteries and\nemphasize the effectiveness of staged grant design in promoting a productive\nuse of grants.\n  Beyond these broadly applicable insights, our overview highlights the need\nfor further research on grantmaking.

Introducing builders to\ngenerate blocks based on public transactions, PBS aims to ensure that block\nprofits are distributed among all stakers. Through the auction among builders,\nonly one will win the block in each slot. Ideally, the equilibrium strategy of\nbuilders under public information would lead them to bid all block profits.\nHowever, builders are now capable of extracting profits from private order\nflows. In this paper, we explore the effect of PBS with private order flows.\nSpecifically, we propose the asymmetry auction model of MEV-Boost auction.\nMoreover, we conduct empirical study on Ethereum blocks from January 2023 to\nMay 2024. Our analysis indicates that private order flows contribute to 54.59%\nof the block value, indicating that different builders will build blocks with\ndifferent valuations. Interestingly, we find that builders with more private\norder flows (i.e., higher block valuations) are more likely to win the block,\nwhile retain larger proportion of profits. In return, such builders will\nfurther attract more private order flows, resulting in a monopolistic market\ngradually.

Data flow analysis is\nwidely used for vulnerability detection before deploying web applications\nbecause of its efficiency. However, the high complexity of the PHP language\nmakes it difficult to achieve precise data flow analysis. In this paper, we\npresent Yama, a context-sensitive and path-sensitive interprocedural data flow\nanalysis method for PHP, designed to detect taint-style vulnerabilities in PHP\napplications. We have found that the precise semantics and clear control flow\nof PHP opcodes enable data flow analysis to be more precise and efficient.\nLeveraging this observation, we established parsing rules for PHP opcodes and\nimplemented a precise understanding of PHP program semantics in Yama. We\nevaluated Yama from three dimensions: basic data flow analysis capabilities,\ncomplex semantic analysis capabilities, and the ability to discover\nvulnerabilities in real-world applications, demonstrating Yama's advancement in\nvulnerability detection. Specifically, Yama possesses context-sensitive and\npath-sensitive interprocedural analysis capabilities, achieving a 99.1% true\npositive rate in complex semantic analysis experiments related to type\ninference, dynamic features, and built-in functions. It discovered and reported\n38 zero-day vulnerabilities across 24 projects on GitHub with over 1,000 stars\neach, assigning 34 new CVE IDs.

Existing methods typically require centralized data collection,\nwhich poses significant privacy and communication challenges. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel Federated Temporal Graph Clustering (FTGC) framework that\nenables decentralized training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple\nclients, ensuring data privacy throughout the process. Our approach\nincorporates a temporal aggregation mechanism to effectively capture the\nevolution of graph structures over time and a federated optimization strategy\nto collaboratively learn high-quality clustering representations.

    "abstract": "Most knowledge distillation (KD) methodologies predominantly focus on\nteacher-student pairs with similar architectures, such as both being\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the potential and flexibility of\nKD can be greatly improved by expanding it to novel Cross-Architecture KD\n(CAKD), where the knowledge of homogeneous and heterogeneous teachers can be\ntransferred flexibly to a given student. The primary challenge in CAKD lies in\nthe substantial feature gaps between heterogeneous models, originating from the\ndistinction of their inherent inductive biases and module functions. To this\nend, we introduce an assistant model as a bridge to facilitate smooth feature\nknowledge transfer between heterogeneous teachers and students. More\nimportantly, within our proposed design principle, the assistant model combines\nthe advantages of cross-architecture inductive biases and module functions by\nmerging convolution and attention modules derived from both student and teacher\nmodule functions. Furthermore, we observe that heterogeneous features exhibit\ndiverse spatial distributions in CAKD, hindering the effectiveness of\nconventional pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss. Therefore, we leverage a\nspatial-agnostic InfoNCE loss to align features after spatial smoothing,\nthereby improving the feature alignments in CAKD. Our proposed method is\nevaluated across some homogeneous model pairs and arbitrary heterogeneous\ncombinations of CNNs, ViTs, and MLPs, achieving state-of-the-art performance\nfor distilled models with a maximum gain of 11.47% on CIFAR-100 and 3.67% on\nImageNet-1K.

    "abstract": "As synthetic content increasingly infiltrates the web, generative AI models\nmay be retrained on their own outputs: a process termed \"autophagy\". This leads\nto model collapse: a progressive loss of performance and diversity across\ngenerations. Recent studies have examined the emergence of model collapse\nacross various generative AI models and data types, and have proposed\nmitigation strategies that rely on incorporating human-authored content.\nHowever, current characterizations of model collapse remain limited, and\nexisting mitigation methods assume reliable knowledge of whether training data\nis human-authored or AI-generated. In this paper, we address these gaps by\nintroducing new measures that characterise collapse directly from a model's\nnext-token probability distributions, rather than from properties of\nAI-generated text. Using these measures, we show that the degree of collapse\ndepends on the complexity of the initial training set, as well as on the extent\nof autophagy. Our experiments prompt a new suggestion: that model collapse\noccurs when a model trains on data that does not \"surprise\" it. We express this\nhypothesis in terms of the well-known Free Energy Principle in cognitive\nscience. Building on this insight, we propose a practical mitigation strategy:\nfiltering training items by high surplexity, maximising the surprise of the\nmodel. Unlike existing methods, this approach does not require distinguishing\nbetween human- and AI-generated data. Experiments across datasets and models\ndemonstrate that our strategy is at least as effective as human-data baselines,\nand even more effective in reducing distributional skewedness. Our results\nprovide a richer understanding of model collapse and point toward more\nresilient approaches for training generative AI systems in environments\nincreasingly saturated with synthetic data.",

This paper presents a\ncomprehensive investigation into the role of LLM backbones in MLLM evaluation,\nfocusing on two critical aspects: the degree to which current benchmarks truly\nassess multimodal reasoning and the influence of LLM prior knowledge on\nperformance. Specifically, we introduce a modified evaluation protocol to\ndisentangle the contributions of the LLM backbone from multimodal integration,\nand an automatic knowledge identification technique for diagnosing whether LLMs\nequip the necessary knowledge for corresponding multimodal questions. Our study\nencompasses four diverse MLLM benchmarks and eight state-of-the-art MLLMs. Key\nfindings reveal that some benchmarks allow high performance even without visual\ninputs and up to 50\\% of error rates can be attributed to insufficient world\nknowledge in the LLM backbone, indicating a heavy reliance on language\ncapabilities. To address knowledge deficiencies, we propose a knowledge\naugmentation pipeline that achieves significant performance gains, with\nimprovements of up to 60\\% on certain datasets, resulting in a approximately 4x\nincrease in performance. Our work provides crucial insights into the role of\nthe LLM backbone in MLLMs, and highlights the need for more nuanced\nbenchmarking approaches.",

To further improve this capacity, in\nthis paper, we present a neuron-based approach for personality trait induction\nin LLMs, with three major technical contributions. First, we construct\nPersonalityBench, a large-scale dataset for identifying and evaluating\npersonality traits in LLMs. This dataset is grounded in the Big Five\npersonality traits from psychology and is designed to assess the generative\ncapabilities of LLMs towards specific personality traits. Second, by leveraging\nPersonalityBench, we propose an efficient method for identifying\npersonality-related neurons within LLMs by examining the opposite aspects of a\ngiven trait. Third, we develop a simple yet effective induction method that\nmanipulates the values of these identified personality-related neurons. This\nmethod enables fine-grained control over the traits exhibited by LLMs without\ntraining and modifying model parameters. Extensive experiments validate the\nefficacy of our neuron identification and trait induction methods. Notably, our\napproach achieves comparable performance as fine-tuned models, offering a more\nefficient and flexible solution for personality trait induction in LLMs. We\nprovide access to all the mentioned resources at\nhttps://github.com/RUCAIBox/NPTI.",

In this study,\nwe perform extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of applying LLMs\nto key time series tasks, including forecasting, classification, imputation,\nand anomaly detection. We compare the performance of LLMs against simpler\nbaseline models, such as single layer linear models and randomly initialized\nLLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs offer minimal advantages for these core time\nseries tasks and may even distort the temporal structure of the data. In\ncontrast, simpler models consistently outperform LLMs while requiring far fewer\nparameters. Furthermore, we analyze existing reprogramming techniques and show,\nthrough data manifold analysis, that these methods fail to effectively align\ntime series data with language and display \"pseudo-alignment\" behavior in\nembedding space.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across\ndistributed clients while preserving data privacy. Despite its widespread\nadoption, most FL approaches focusing solely on privacy protection fall short\nin scenarios where trustworthiness is crucial, necessitating advancements in\nsecure training, dependable decision-making mechanisms, robustness on\ncorruptions, and enhanced performance with Non-IID data. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce Trustworthy Personalized Federated Learning (TPFL) framework designed\nfor classification tasks via subjective logic in this paper. Specifically, TPFL\nadopts a unique approach by employing subjective logic to construct federated\nmodels, providing probabilistic decisions coupled with an assessment of\nuncertainty rather than mere probability assignments. By incorporating a\ntrainable heterogeneity prior to the local training phase, TPFL effectively\nmitigates the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. Model uncertainty and\ninstance uncertainty are further utilized to ensure the safety and reliability\nof the training and inference stages. Through extensive experiments on widely\nrecognized federated learning benchmarks, we demonstrate that TPFL not only\nachieves competitive performance compared with advanced methods but also\nexhibits resilience against prevalent malicious attacks, robustness on domain\nshifts, and reliability in high-stake scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity due to their impressive\ngenerative abilities. These models learn the implicit distribution given by the\ntraining dataset, and sample new data by transforming random noise through the\nreverse process, which can be thought of as gradual denoising. In this work, we\nexamine the generation process as a ``correlation machine'', where random noise\nis repeatedly enhanced in correlation with the implicit given distribution. To\nthis end, we explore the linear case, where the optimal denoiser in the MSE\nsense is known to be the PCA projection. This enables us to connect the theory\nof diffusion models to the spiked covariance model, where the dependence of the\ndenoiser on the noise level and the amount of training data can be expressed\nanalytically, in the rank-1 case. In a series of numerical experiments, we\nextend this result to general low rank data, and show that low frequencies\nemerge earlier in the generation process, where the denoising basis vectors are\nmore aligned to the true data with a rate depending on their eigenvalues. This\nmodel allows us to show that the linear diffusion model converges in mean to\nthe leading eigenvector of the underlying data, similarly to the prevalent\npower iteration method. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the applicability\nof our findings beyond the linear case, in the Jacobians of a deep, non-linear\ndenoiser, used in general image generation tasks.",

This allows for identity-preserved\npersonalization without additional fine-tuning in inference. Although there are\nimprovements in efficiency and fidelity, there is often a significant\nperformance decrease in test following ability, controllability, and diversity\nof generated faces compared to the base model. In this paper, we analyze that\nthe performance degradation is attributed to the failure to decouple identity\nfeatures from other attributes during extraction, as well as the failure to\ndecouple the portrait generation training from the overall generation task. To\naddress these issues, we propose the Face Adapter with deCoupled Training\n(FACT) framework, focusing on both model architecture and training strategy. To\ndecouple identity features from others, we leverage a transformer-based\nface-export encoder and harness fine-grained identity features. To decouple the\nportrait generation training, we propose Face Adapting Increment\nRegularization~(FAIR), which effectively constrains the effect of face adapters\non the facial region, preserving the generative ability of the base model.\nAdditionally, we incorporate a face condition drop and shuffle mechanism,\ncombined with curriculum learning, to enhance facial controllability and\ndiversity. As a result, FACT solely learns identity preservation from training\ndata, thereby minimizing the impact on the original text-to-image capabilities\nof the base model.

This may impact the\nquasinormal modes of the black hole. Since the Einstein's equations are\ngenerally covariant, the quasinormal modes of a supertranslated black hole can\nbe obtained by supertranslating the familiar results for a standard black hole.\nIt turns out that the supertranslated quasinormal modes can be obtained by\nsimply shifting the retarded time of the standard modes by an angle-dependent\nfunction parameterizing the supertranslation. Therefore, the supertranslated\nquasinormal modes oscillate at the same frequencies and decay at the same rates\nas the corresponding standard ones. The supertranslated metric is time\ntranslation invariant, but does not explicitly respect spherical symmetries,\nalthough it is implicitly rotationally symmetric. So the supertranslated\nperturbations can still be written as linear combinations of the eigenfunctions\nof the generalized angular momentum operators for the underlying rotational\nsymmetry. With a suitably defined asymptotic parity transformation, any\nperturbation can be decomposed into the even and odd parity parts. Then, one\nmay conclude that the isospectrality still holds. To detect such\nsupertranslated quasinormal modes, one has to place multiple gravitational wave\ninterferometers around the supertranslated black hole, and measure the\ndifferences in the time shifts between interferometers. Gravitational lensing\nmay also be helpful in the same spirit.",

This raises a key question:\nCan VLMs' performance drop in specific test cases be mitigated through\nefficient, training-free approaches? To explore the solution, we investigate\ntoken condensation (TC) techniques, originally designed to enhance vision\ntransformer efficiency by refining token usage during inference.

Rather\nthan passively discarding tokens, TCA condenses token representation by\nintroducing reservoir-based domain anchor tokens for information-preserving\ntoken reduction and logits correction.

To this aim a recent\nmethodology based on advanced tools from convex and variational analyses is\nused.

Accurate prediction of these changes is important for\nthe applications of coatings. This work presents a novel approach to modeling\naccelerated weathering of coating by combining concurrent physical and chemical\nprocesses. The model integrates key factors influencing coating degradation and\nemploys a multi-scale framework to capture macro-scale physical changes and\nmicro-level chemical transformations. The chemical component/model simulates\nphoto-degradation reactions using kinetic equations, while the physical\ncomponent uses Monte Carlo simulations where repeated random events develop\nsurface erosion. The surface topography and chemistry of coating is generated\nstatistically through the physical model. The variations in surface topography\nand chemistry of coating are correlated with the chemical changes from the\nchemical model, resulting in estimation of both physical and chemical changes\nin the coating during real accelerated weathering time. Results demonstrate\naccurate predictions of chemistry changes, surface degradation profiles,\nroughness, gloss loss, and relative fracture toughness, which are validated\nsuccessfully with the experimentally available data. This integrated approach\nprovides insight into coating failure mechanisms, enabling accurate service\nlife prediction, and serve as a tool for formulating durable coatings and\noptimizing testing protocols.",

We analyze the dissipation\ncoefficient defined as $\\Gamma(T, \\sigma) = C_n T^n \\sigma^p M^{1-n-p}$, where\n$C_n$ is a dimensionless constant, $M$ is a mass scale, and $n$ and $p$ are\nnumerical powers.

This dual requirement reflects the\ncomplex nature of student understanding, where misconceptions coexist with\ncorrect knowledge.

In this paper,\nwe present the novel, efficient and highly effective leitmotif discovery\nalgorithm LAMA for MDTS. LAMA rests on two core principals: (a) a leitmotif\nmanifests solely given a yet unknown number of sub-dimensions - neither too\nfew, nor too many, and (b) the set of sub-dimensions are not independent from\nthe best pattern found therein, necessitating both problems to be approached in\na joint manner.

    "abstract": "Weyl semimetal (WSM) states can be achieved by breaking spatial-inversion\nsymmetry or time reversal symmetry. However, the anisotropy of the energy\nreduction contributing to the emergence of WSM states has seldom been\ninvestigated by experiments. A van der Waals metal MoTe2 exhibits a type-II WSM\nphase below the monoclinic-to-orthorhombic-phase-transition temperature Tc ~\n250 K. Here, we report a combined linearly-polarized optical-spectroscopy and\nelectrical-transport study of MoTe2 at different temperatures. The Drude\ncomponents in the a-axis, b-axis and c-axis optical conductivity spectra,\ntogether with the metallic out-of-plane and in-plane electrical resistivities,\nindicate the coherent inter-layer and in-plane charge transports. Moreover, the\nDrude weight in {\\sigma}1a({\\omega}), rather than the Drude weights in\n{\\sigma}1b({\\omega}) and {\\sigma}1c({\\omega}), decreases dramatically below Tc,\nwhich exhibits a highly anisotropic decrease in its Drude weight and thus\nsuggests a strongly anisotropic reduction of the electronic kinetic energy in\nthe WSM phase. Furthermore, below Tc, due to the in-plane anisotropic\nspectral-weight transfer from Drude component to high-energy region, the\nin-plane inter-band-absorption anisotropy increases remarkably around 770 meV,\nand has the largest value (~ 0.68) of normalized linear dichroism among the\nreported type-II WSMs. Our work sheds light on seeking new WSMs and developing\nnovel photonic devices based on WSMs.",

The deposited energy by one x-ray pulse\ninduces temperature gradients and elastic waves in the crystal, where the\ndeformed crystal lattice impacts the Bragg performance for subsequent x-ray\npulses.

FC\ninvolves clipping feature values to a specified threshold, effectively\nincreasing entropy in high calibration error samples while maintaining the\ninformation in low calibration error samples. This process reduces the\noverconfidence in predictions, improving the overall calibration of the model.\nOur extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImageNet, and models including CNNs and transformers, demonstrate that FC\nconsistently enhances calibration performance. Additionally, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis that validates the effectiveness of our method.

    "abstract": "In order to make robots more useful in a variety of environments, they need\nto be highly portable so that they can be transported to wherever they are\nneeded, and highly storable so that they can be stored when not in use. We\npropose \"on-site robotics\", which uses parts procured at the location where the\nrobot will be active, and propose a new solution to the problem of portability\nand storability. In this paper, as a proof of concept for on-site robotics, we\ndescribe a method for estimating the kinematic model of a robot by using\ninertial measurement units (IMU) sensor module on rigid links, estimating the\nrelative orientation between modules from angular velocity, and estimating the\nrelative position from the measurement of centrifugal force. At the end of this\npaper, as an evaluation for this method, we present an experiment in which a\nrobot made up of wooden sticks reaches a target position. In this experiment,\neven if the combination of the links is changed, the robot is able to reach the\ntarget position again immediately after estimation, showing that it can operate\neven after being reassembled.

Geologic evidence from $^{60}\\rm\nFe$ points to recent nearby supernova activity within the past several Myr.\nHere, we model the transfer of energy and resulting orbital changes from these\nsupernova blasts to the Oort Cloud, the Kuiper belt, and Saturn's Phoebe ring.\nFor the Oort Cloud, an impulse approximation shows that a 50 pc supernova can\neject approximately half of all objects less than 1 cm while altering the\ntrajectories of larger ones, depending on their orbital parameters. For stars\nclosest to supernovae, objects up to $\\sim$100 m can be ejected. Turning to the\nexplored solar system, we find that supernovae closer than 50 pc may affect\nSaturn's Phoebe ring and can sweep away Kuiper belt dust. It is also possible\nthat the passage of the solar system through a dense interstellar cloud could\nhave a similar effect; a numerical trajectory simulation shows that the\nlocation of the dust grains and the direction of the wind (from a supernova or\ninterstellar cloud) has a significant impact on whether or not the grains will\nbecome unbound from their orbit in the Kuiper belt. Overall, nearby supernovae\nsweep micron-sized dust from the solar system, though whether the grains are\nultimately cast towards the Sun or altogether ejected depends on various\nfactors.

Examples include cytoskeletal\nfilaments in gliding assays, magnetically-driven colloidal helices, and\nmicroorganisms like the soil bacterium $\\it{M. xanthus}$. Here, we develop a\nmodel for spinning self-propelled rods on a substrate, and we coarse-grain it\nto derive the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. If the rods propel purely\nalong their axis, we obtain equations for a dry active nematic. However,\nspinning rods can also roll sideways as they move. We find that this transverse\nmotion turns the system into a chiral active nematic. Thus, we identify a\nmechanism whereby individual chirality can give rise to collective chiral\nflows. Finally, we analyze experiments on $\\it{M. xanthus}$ colonies to show\nthat they exhibit chiral flows around topological defects, with a chiral\nactivity about an order of magnitude weaker than the achiral one. Our work\nreveals the collective behavior of active screws, which is relevant to colonies\nof social bacteria and groups of unicellular parasites.",

In this paper, a novel multi-modal deep learning-based\nframework, namely TFDM, is introduced to leverage multiple properties of a drug\nto achieve DDI classification. The proposed framework fuses multimodal features\nof drugs, including graph-based, molecular structure, Target and Enzyme, for\nDDI identification. To tackle the challenge posed by the distribution skewness\nacross categories, a novel loss function called Tailed Focal Loss is\nintroduced, aimed at further enhancing the model performance and address\ngradient vanishing problem of focal loss in extremely long-tailed dataset.\nIntensive experiments over 4 challenging long-tailed dataset demonstrate that\nthe TFMD outperforms the most recent SOTA methods in long-tailed DDI\nclassification tasks.

Despite the advancements, evaluating these systems\nremains a crucial research area due to the following issues: (1) Limited data\ndiversity: The insufficient diversity of knowledge sources and query types\nconstrains the applicability of RAG systems; (2) Obscure problems location:\nExisting evaluation methods have difficulty in locating the stage of the RAG\npipeline where problems occur; (3) Unstable retrieval evaluation: These methods\noften fail to effectively assess retrieval performance, particularly when the\nchunking strategy changes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nComprehensive Full-chain Evaluation (CoFE-RAG) framework to facilitate thorough\nevaluation across the entire RAG pipeline, including chunking, retrieval,\nreranking, and generation. To effectively evaluate the first three phases, we\nintroduce multi-granularity keywords, including coarse-grained and fine-grained\nkeywords, to assess the retrieved context instead of relying on the annotation\nof golden chunks. Moreover, we release a holistic benchmark dataset tailored\nfor diverse data scenarios covering a wide range of document formats and query\ntypes.

However, the inference of these methods is still slow, as a large number\nof neural network queries on each ray are required to ensure the rendering\nquality. Moreover, occluded regions often suffer from artifacts, especially\nwhen the input views are sparse. To address these issues, we propose a\ngeneralizable human NeRF framework that achieves high-quality and real-time\nrendering with sparse input views by extensively leveraging human prior\nknowledge.

To improve rendering quality,\nespecially in occluded regions, we propose an occlusion-aware attention\nmechanism to extract occlusion information from the human priors, followed by\nan image space refinement network to improve rendering quality. Furthermore,\nfor volume rendering, we adopt a signed ray distance function (SRDF)\nformulation, which allows us to propose an SRDF loss at every sample position\nto improve the rendering quality further.

However, existing methods still face several\nlimitations. First, most KGs suffer from missing facts or limited scopes.\nSecond, existing methods convert textual information in KGs into IDs, resulting\nin the loss of natural semantic connections between different items. Third,\nexisting methods struggle to capture high-order connections in the global KG.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel method called CoLaKG, which\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to improve KG-based recommendations. The\nextensive knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities of LLMs enable our\nmethod to supplement missing facts in KGs, and their powerful text\nunderstanding abilities allow for better utilization of semantic information.\nSpecifically, CoLaKG extracts useful information from KGs at both local and\nglobal levels. By employing the item-centered subgraph extraction and prompt\nengineering, it can accurately understand the local information. In addition,\nthrough the semantic-based retrieval module, each item is enriched by related\nitems from the entire knowledge graph, effectively harnessing global\ninformation. Furthermore, the local and global information are effectively\nintegrated into the recommendation model through a representation fusion module\nand a retrieval-augmented representation learning module, respectively.\nExtensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority\nof our method.",

    "abstract": "Alternative dark energy models were proposed to address the limitation of the\nstandard concordance model. Though different phenomenological considerations of\nsuch models are widely studied, scenarios where they interact with each other\nremain unexplored. In this context, we study interacting dark energy scenarios\n(IDEs), incorporating alternative dark energy models. The three models that are\nconsidered in this study are time-varying \\Lambda, Generalized Chaplygin Gas\n(GCG), and K-essence. Each model includes an interaction rate \\Gamma to\nquantify energy density transfer between dark energy and matter. Among them,\nGCG coupled with an interaction term shows promising agreement with the\nobserved TT power spectrum, particularly for l < 70, when \\Gamma falls within a\nspecific range. The K-essence model (\\Gamma <= 0.1) is more sensitive to \\Gamma\ndue to its non-canonical kinetic term, while GCG (\\Gamma >= 1.02) and the\ntime-varying \\Lambda (\\Gamma <= 0.01) models are less sensitive, as they\ninvolve different parameterizations. We then derive a general condition when\nthe non-canonical scalar field {\\phi} (with a kinetic term Xn) interacts with\nGCG. This has not been investigated in general form before. We find that\ncurrent observational constraints on IDEs suggest a unified scalar field with a\nbalanced regime, where it mimics quintessence behavior at n < 1 and phantom\nbehavior at n > 1.

    "abstract": "We introduce OmnixR, an evaluation suite designed to benchmark SoTA\nOmni-modality Language Models, such as GPT-4o and Gemini. Evaluating OLMs,\nwhich integrate multiple modalities such as text, vision, and audio, presents\nunique challenges. Particularly, the user message might often consist of\nmultiple modalities, such that OLMs have to establish holistic understanding\nand reasoning across modalities to accomplish the task. Existing benchmarks are\nlimited to single modality or dual-modality tasks, overlooking comprehensive\nmulti-modal assessments of model reasoning. To address this, OmnixR offers two\nevaluation variants: (1)synthetic subset: a synthetic dataset generated\nautomatically by translating text into multiple modalities--audio, images,\nvideo, and hybrids (Omnify). (2)realistic subset: a real-world dataset,\nmanually curated and annotated by experts, for evaluating cross-modal reasoning\nin natural settings. OmnixR presents a unique evaluation towards assessing OLMs\nover a diverse mix of modalities, such as a question that involves video,\naudio, and text, providing a rigorous cross-modal reasoning testbed unlike any\nexisting benchmarks. Our experiments find that all state-of-the-art OLMs\nstruggle with OmnixR questions that require integrating information from\nmultiple modalities to answer. Further analysis highlights differences in\nreasoning behavior, underscoring the challenges of omni-modal AI alignment.",

We devise a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model for\nactive and inactive Rho-GTPase and F-actin in the cell cortex. The\nmass-conserved Rho-GTPase system promotes F-actin, which feeds back to\ninactivate the former. We study the model on a 1D periodic domain (edge of thin\nsheet-like cell) using bifurcation theory in the framework of spatial dynamics,\ncomplemented with numerical simulations. Among several discussed bifurcations,\nthe analysis centers on the study of the codimension-2 long wavelength and\nfinite wavenumber Hopf instability, in which we describe a rich structure of\nsteady wave-pinning states (a.k.a. mesas, obeying the Maxwell construction),\npropagating coherent solutions (fronts and excitable pulses), and travelling\nand standing waves, all distinguished by mass conservation regimes and\nclassified by domain sizes.

These results uncover and exemplify possible\nmechanisms of coexistence, robustness, and transitions between distinct\ncellular motility modes, including directed migration, turning, and ruffling.\nMore broadly, the results indicate that dissipative reaction-diffusion models\ncomprising mass conservation have distinct pattern formation mechanisms that\nmotivate further investigations, such as the unfolding of codimension-3\ninstabilities and T-points.",

In this work we instead study a more practical\nyet very challenging problem, time series anomaly prediction, aiming at\nproviding early warnings for abnormal events before their occurrence. To tackle\nthis problem, we introduce a novel principled approach, namely future context\nmodeling (FCM). Its key insight is that the future abnormal events in a target\nwindow can be accurately predicted if their preceding observation window\nexhibits any subtle difference to normal data. To effectively capture such\ndifferences, FCM first leverages long-term forecasting models to generate a\ndiscriminative future context based on the observation data, aiming to amplify\nthose subtle but unusual difference. It then models a normality correlation of\nthe observation data with the forecasting future context to complement the\nnormality modeling of the observation data in foreseeing possible abnormality\nin the target window. A joint variate-time attention learning is also\nintroduced in FCM to leverage both temporal signals and features of the time\nseries data for more discriminative normality modeling in the aforementioned\ntwo views. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that FCM\ngains good recall rate (70\\%+) on multiple datasets and significantly\noutperforms all baselines in F1 score.

However, questions have been raised\nregarding whether having a robotic companion benefits healthy older adults, how\nthey perceive the value of companion robots, and what their relationship with\ncompanion robots would be like. To understand healthy older adults'\nperceptions, attitudes, and relationships toward companion robots, we conducted\nmultiple focus groups with eighteen retirees. Our findings underscore the\nsocial context encountered by older adults in China and reveal the mismatch\nbetween the current value proposition of companion robots and healthy older\nadults' needs.

From the first principles, we analyze particle loss,\ntemperature evolution, and momentum distributions in single-component Fermi\ngases using the inelastic quantum Boltzmann equation. Our results prove that\nthe conventional two-body loss model is valid for trapped systems, though it\nfails to describe the dynamics in homogeneous systems accurately.\nInterestingly, we find that systems prepared near or above quantum degeneracy\ncan thermalize spontaneously, even in the absence of elastic collisions, while\nsystems initialized deep in degeneracy display non-equilibrium behavior. Our\ncalculations are in good agreement with recent experimental data from trapped\nsystems and could be further tested in atomic systems with induced two-body\nloss in box potentials.",

SAT is motivated by\nthe challenge of integrating uncertainty sets when only the initial sets and\ntheir control levels are available - for example, when merging confidence sets\nfrom distributed sites under communication constraints or combining conformal\nprediction sets generated by different algorithms or data splits. To address\nthis, SAT constructs and aggregates novel synthetic test statistics, and then\nderive merged sets through test inversion. Our method leverages the duality\nbetween set estimation and hypothesis testing, ensuring reliable coverage in\ndependent scenarios. A key theoretical contribution is a rigorous analysis of\nSAT's properties, including a proof of its admissibility in the context of\ndeterministic set merging.

However, among\nthe various deformation actuation modes, the design of deformable structures,\nthe material response characteristics, and the miniaturization of devices\nremain challenges. As materials and structures are scaled down to the\nmicroscale, their performance becomes strongly correlated with size, leading to\nsignificant changes in, or even the failure of, many physical mechanisms that\nare effective at the macroscale. Additionally, electrostatic forces, surface\ntension, and viscous forces dominate at the microscale, making it difficult for\nstructures to deform or causing them to fracture easily during deformation.\nMoreover, despite the prominence of acoustic actuation among various\ndeformation drive modes, it has received limited attention. Here, we introduce\nan acoustical shape-morphing micromachine (ASM) that provides shape variability\nthrough a pair of microbubbles and the micro-hinges connecting them.

Approach: We introduce AutoSimTTF, a fully automatic\npipeline for simulating and optimizing the EF distribution for TTFields. The\nmain steps of AutoSimTTF utilize open-source toolkits, enabling fully automated\nprocessing of individual MRI data for TTFields. Additionally, AutoSimTTF allows\nfor parameter optimization based on individual anatomical information, thereby\nachieving a more focused and higher EF distribution at the tumor site. Main\nresults: Compared to conventional EF calculation processes, deviations in\nAutoSimTTF are below 20%. The optimal treatment parameters generated by\nAutoSimTTF produces a higher EF intensity at the tumor site (111.9%) and better\nfocality (19.4%) compared to traditional TTFields settings.

To remedy this issue, we\nintroduce a simple Bayesian approximation-endowed \\textit{distribution\nregularization} to encourage learning a better joint probability approximation\nin a plug-and-play manner.

Over the\nnext 4 years, various multiband observations have led to re-imagine the various\nshort Gamma Ray Burts (sGRB) and interstellar medium interaction models. While\nthese models successfully explain the observed afterglow until ~900 days, a\nre-brightening or excess flux was observed in the 1keV X-Ray band after ~1000\ndays. In this study, we re-evaluate the jet parameters using the new\nobservations (until ~1234 days) with a boosted fireball jet model. We study the\nobservable effects of the counter-jet for GRB170817A, using our new afterglow\ncode, Firefly. Our results show that it is indeed possible for the observed\nexcess to coincide with the emissions from the counter-jet (~800 days). We also\ncomputed an empirical scaling law between the jet and counter-jet peak emission\ntimescales and the observer angle. The Firefly code can also track the\nsimulated object through the observers' sky and numerically model the apparent\nmotion. The calculated apparent motion (~2.6c) does not match the observed\napparent motion (7.5c to 5.2c). Hence we conclude, the excess flux of\nGRB170817A may not be associated with the counter jet; however, it is not\nenough to reject this hypothesis from the traditional counter jet visibility\ntime scales, which predicts > 5000 days. The apparent motion, combined with the\nmulti-band lightcurves, is needed to break degeneracy between geometrical\nparameters and the microphysical parameters of the afterglow.",

Traditional time series approaches\nfor prediction often focus on either autoregressive modeling, which relies\nsolely on past observations of the target ``endogenous variables'', or forward\nmodeling, which considers only current covariate drivers ``exogenous\nvariables''. However, effectively integrating past endogenous and past\nexogenous with current exogenous variables remains a significant challenge. In\nthis paper, we propose ExoTST, a novel transformer-based framework that\neffectively incorporates current exogenous variables alongside past context for\nimproved time series prediction. To integrate exogenous information\nefficiently, ExoTST leverages the strengths of attention mechanisms and\nintroduces a novel cross-temporal modality fusion module. This module enables\nthe model to jointly learn from both past and current exogenous series,\ntreating them as distinct modalities. By considering these series separately,\nExoTST provides robustness and flexibility in handling data uncertainties that\narise from the inherent distribution shift between historical and current\nexogenous variables. Extensive experiments on real-world carbon flux datasets\nand time series benchmarks demonstrate ExoTST's superior performance compared\nto state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 10\\% in prediction\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "The optimal transport (OT) problem has gained significant traction in modern\nmachine learning for its ability to: (1) provide versatile metrics, such as\nWasserstein distances and their variants, and (2) determine optimal couplings\nbetween probability measures. To reduce the computational complexity of OT\nsolvers, methods like entropic regularization and sliced optimal transport have\nbeen proposed. The sliced OT framework improves efficiency by comparing\none-dimensional projections (slices) of high-dimensional distributions.\nHowever, despite their computational efficiency, sliced-Wasserstein approaches\nlack a transportation plan between the input measures, limiting their use in\nscenarios requiring explicit coupling. In this paper, we address two key\nquestions: Can a transportation plan be constructed between two probability\nmeasures using the sliced transport framework? If so, can this plan be used to\ndefine a metric between the measures? We propose a \"lifting\" operation to\nextend one-dimensional optimal transport plans back to the original space of\nthe measures. By computing the expectation of these lifted plans, we derive a\nnew transportation plan, termed expected sliced transport (EST) plans. We prove\nthat using the EST plan to weight the sum of the individual Euclidean costs for\nmoving from one point to another results in a valid metric between the input\ndiscrete probability measures.

However, the existing geometrical prediction models of the micro\ncontinuum robots still follow the model frameworks designed for their larger\ncounterparts, which is inconsistent with the real geometrical transformation\nprinciple of micro fabricated continuum robots. In this paper, we present a\nuniversal geometrical prediction method for the geometry transformation of the\nmicro fabricated continuum robots based on their material properties and the\ndisplacement of the stress points. By discretizing of the micro fabricated\ncontinuum structure and applying force constraints between adjacent points to\nsimulate material properties, formulations and simulations are demonstrated to\nprove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Three micro\nfabricated continuum robots driven through different external field forces are\ninvestigated to show two superiorities: the geometrical deformation of a micro\nfabricated continuum robot under external disturbances can be predicted, and a\ntargeted geometry can be shaped by predicting the sequence and directions of\nexternal forces.

The introduction of digital twins\n(DTs), particularly local DTs (LDTs) at the edge, in smart mobility presents a\nnew embodiment of augmented intelligence, which could enhance information\nexchange and extract human driving expertise to improve onboard intelligence.\nThis paper presents a novel LDT-assisted hybrid autonomous driving system for\nimproving safety and efficiency in traffic intersections. By leveraging\nroadside units (RSUs) equipped with sensory and computing capabilities, the\nproposed system continuously monitors traffic, extracts human driving\nknowledge, and generates intersection-specific local driving agents through an\noffline reinforcement learning (RL) framework. When connected and automated\nvehicles (CAVs) pass through RSU-equipped intersections, RSUs can provide local\nagents to support safe and efficient driving in local areas. Meanwhile, they\nprovide real-time cooperative perception (CP) to broaden onboard sensory\nhorizons. The proposed LDT-assisted hybrid system is implemented with\nstate-of-the-art products, e.g., CAVs and RSUs, and technologies, e.g.,\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulations\nand proof-of-concept (PoC) tests validate system performance from two\nstandpoints: (i) The peak latency for CP and local agent downloading are 8.51\nms and 146 ms, respectively, aligning with 3GPP requirements for\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) and model transfer use cases. Moreover, (ii) local\ndriving agents can improve safety measures by 10% and reduce travel time by 15%\ncompared with conventional onboard systems.

In PET, measuring the time-of-flight\n(TOF) information for each pair of 511-keV annihilation photons improves\neffective sensitivity but requires high timing resolution. Hybrid materials\nthat emit both scintillation and Cherenkov photons, such as bismuth germanate\n(BGO), recently offer the potential for more precise timing information from\nCherenkov photons while maintaining adequate energy resolution from\nscintillation photons.

This study introduces an\ninnovative approach by segmenting silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels coupled\nto a single crystal, rather than using traditional SiPMs that are as large as\nor larger than the crystals they read. We demonstrated that multiple time\nstamps and photon counts obtained from the segmented SiPM can classify events\nby providing temporal photon density, effectively addressing this challenge.\nThe approach and findings would lead to new opportunities in applications that\nrequire precise timing and photon counting, spanning the fields of medical\nimaging, high-energy physics, and optical physics.",

However, their efficiency is compromised when\nthe estimated model is inaccurate. Previous works address this issue by using\nmodel ensembles or pretraining the estimated model with data collected from the\nreal environment, increasing computational and sample complexity.

Therefore, there remains a\nnoticeable gap in thoroughly exploring the effect of augmented dataset,\nespecially extensive historical data in training. In this research, two\ndatasets containing taxi and bike usage spanning over eight years in New York\nwere used to test such effects. Experiments were conducted to assess the\nprecision of models trained with data in the most recent 12, 24, 48, and 96\nmonths. It was found that the training set encompassing 96 months, at times,\nresulted in diminished accuracy, which might be owing to disparities between\nhistorical traffic patterns and present ones. An analysis was subsequently\nundertaken to discern potential sources of inconsistent patterns, which may\ninclude both covariate shift and concept shift. To address these shifts, we\nproposed an innovative approach that aligns covariate distributions using a\nweighting scheme to manage covariate shift, coupled with an environment aware\nlearning method to tackle the concept shift. Experiments based on real word\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which can significantly\ndecrease testing errors and ensure an improvement in accuracy when training\nwith large-scale historical data. As far as we know, this work is the first\nattempt to assess the impact of contiguously expanding training dataset on the\naccuracy of traffic prediction models. Besides, our training method is able to\nbe incorporated into most existing short-term traffic prediction models and\nmake them more suitable for long term historical training dataset.",

The Reynolds number is constrained\nto the range from 0 to 1, where the prolate spheroid tumbles around its minor\naxis, aligned with the vorticity axis, in an equilibrium state. Several key\nfindings have emerged: 1) Particle inertia significantly influences the\nuniformity of the spheroid's tumbling, affecting flow patterns around the\nspheroid and, consequently, the modes of scalar transport; 2) Both uniform and\nnon-uniform tumbling generate a scalar line in the fluid with elevated scalar\nconcentration, which sweeps through the wake region and merges with clusters of\npreviously formed scalar lines; 3) Fluid passing over the spheroid carries the\npassive scalar downstream along these scalar lines; 4) Variations in the\nuniformity of spheroid tumbling result in distinct flow patterns and scalar\ntransport modes, leading to different transport rates; 5) Within the studied\nparameter ranges, increased particle inertia enhances the scalar transport\nrate; 6) When both fluid and particle inertia are minimal, the dimensionless\nscalar transport rate for different aspect ratios converges to a common\ndependence on the Peclet number.

This\nproblem is an instance of root cause discovery. In particular, we aim to\nidentify the intervened variable in one interventional sample using a set of\nobservational samples as reference. We consider a linear structural equation\nmodel where the causal ordering is unknown. We begin by examining a simple\nmethod that uses squared z-scores and characterize the conditions under which\nthis method succeeds and fails, showing that it generally cannot identify the\nroot cause. We then prove, without additional assumptions, that the root cause\nis identifiable even if the causal ordering is not. Two key ingredients of this\nidentifiability result are the use of permutations and the Cholesky\ndecomposition, which allow us to exploit an invariant property across different\npermutations to discover the root cause. Furthermore, we characterize\npermutations that yield the correct root cause and, based on this, propose a\nvalid method for root cause discovery.

While questions of identity on the\ntextual Internet have been thoroughly explored, the Internet has progressed to\na multimedia form that not only centers the visual, but specifically the face.\nAt the same time, a wealth of scholarship has and continues to center the\ntopics of surveillance and control through facial recognition technologies\n(FRTs), which have extended the logics of the racist pseudoscience of\nphysiognomy. Much less work has been devoted to understanding how such\nface-based artificial intelligence technologies have influenced the formation\nand performance of identity. This literature review considers how such\ntechnologies interact with faciality, which entails the construction of what a\nface may represent or signify, along axes of identity such as race, gender, and\nsexuality. In grappling with recent advances in AI such as image generation and\ndeepfakes, I propose that we are now in an era of \"post-facial\" technologies\nthat build off our existing culture of facility while eschewing the analog\nface, complicating our relationship with identity vis-a-vis the face. Drawing\nfrom previous frameworks of identity play in the digital, as well as trans\npractices that have historically played with or transgressed the boundaries of\nidentity classification, we can develop concepts adequate for analyzing digital\nfaciality and identity given the current landscape of post-facial artificial\nintelligence technologies that allow users to interface with the digital in an\nentirely novel manner.

MSENet integrates multiple experts trained at\ndifferent perceptual scales, enabling the capture of scale discrepancies\nbetween RGB and thermal image pairs without the need for explicit alignment.\nSpecifically, to address the issue of unaligned scales, MSENet introduces a set\nof experts designed to perceive the correlation between RGBT image pairs across\nvarious scales. These experts are capable of identifying and quantifying the\nscale differences inherent in the image pairs. Subsequently, a dynamic routing\nmechanism is incorporated to assign adaptive weights to each expert, allowing\nthe network to dynamically select the most appropriate experts based on the\nspecific characteristics of the input data. Furthermore, to address the issue\nof weakly unaligned positions, we integrate deformable convolution into the\nnetwork. Deformable convolution is employed to learn position displacements\nbetween the RGB and thermal modalities, thereby mitigating the impact of\nspatial misalignment.

This transition is characterized by a change in\nthe steady state rheology of a suspension with increasing shear rate\n($\\dot{\\gamma}$), from a regime of constant viscosity at low shear rates to a\nregime where the viscosity varies linearly with the shear rate. Through our\nnumerical simulations, we show that the characteristic shear rate associated\nwith this transition depends sensitively on the volume fraction ($\\phi$) of the\nsuspension and that it goes to zero as we approach the jamming volume fraction\n($\\phi_m$) for the system. By attributing the criticality of this transition to\na diverging length scale of the microstructure as $\\phi \\rightarrow \\phi_m$, we\nuse a scaling framework to achieve a collapse of the rheological data\nassociated with the viscous to inertial transition. A series of tests conducted\non the system size dependence of the rheological results is used to show the\nexistence of this microstructural length-scale that diverges as the suspension\napproaches jamming and its role in triggering the viscous to inertial\ntransition.",

    "abstract": "In search and advertisement ranking, it is often required to simultaneously\nmaximize multiple objectives. For example, the objectives can correspond to\nmultiple intents of a search query, or in the context of advertising, they can\nbe relevance and revenue. It is important to efficiently find rankings which\nstrike a good balance between such objectives. Motivated by such applications,\nwe formulate a general class of problems where\n  - each result gets a different score corresponding to each objective,\n  - the results of a ranking are aggregated by taking, for each objective, a\nweighted sum of the scores in the order of the ranking, and\n  - an arbitrary concave function of the aggregates is maximized.\n  Combining the aggregates using a concave function will naturally lead to more\nbalanced outcomes. We give an approximation algorithm in a bicriteria/resource\naugmentation setting: the algorithm with a slight advantage does as well as the\noptimum. In particular, if the aggregation step is just the sum of the top k\nresults, then the algorithm outputs k + 1 results which do as well the as the\noptimal top k results. We show how this approach helps with balancing different\nobjectives via simulations on synthetic data as well as on real data from\nLinkedIn.",

To address the distributional ambiguity, we consider\na distributionally robust setting where the decision-maker only knows the mean\nand variance of the demand, and the goal is to make inventory and fulfillment\ndecisions to minimize the worst-case expected inventory and fulfillment cost.\nWe design a near-optimal policy for the problem with theoretical guarantees on\nits performance. Our policy generalizes the classical solution of Scarf (1957),\nmaintaining its simplicity and interpretability: it identifies a hierarchical\nset of clusters, assigns a ``virtual\" underage cost to each cluster, then makes\nsure that each cluster holds at least the inventory suggested by Scarf's\nsolution if the cluster behaved as a single point with ``virtual\" underage\ncost. As demand arrives sequentially, our policy fulfills orders from nearby\nclusters, minimizing fulfilment costs, while balancing inventory consumption\nacross the clusters to avoid depleting any single one.
