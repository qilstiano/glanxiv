    "abstract": "Despite advancements, current quantum hardware faces significant challenges,\nincluding limited qubit counts and high susceptibility to noise, which hinder\nthe execution of large, complex algorithms. To address these limitations,\nmulti-node quantum systems and quantum circuit cutting techniques partition\nlarge circuits into smaller subcircuits that can be executed on individual\nquantum machines and then reconstructed using classical resources. However,\nthese methods introduce new challenges, such as the large overhead from\nsubcircuit reconstruction and additional noise from entangled EPR pairs,\nespecially in multi-node quantum systems. In this paper, we propose the\nEfficient Circuit Cutting and Scheduling (EC2S) system, which integrates EPR\npairs with circuit cutting to address these issues. EC2S improves system\nperformance by transitioning from logical to physical EPR pairs and further\nreduces computational overhead by minimizing the number of subcircuits during\nthe reconstruction phase. \\sol~ is implemented using Qiskit and evaluated on\nboth real quantum hardware and various emulators. Compared to the\nstate-of-the-art Qiskit-Addon-Cut, EC2S achieves significant improvements in\nfidelity, up to 16.7\\%, and reduces system-wide expenditure by up to 99.5\\%.",

    "abstract": "Survival analysis (SA) models have been widely studied in mining electronic\nhealth records (EHRs), particularly in forecasting the risk of critical\nconditions for prioritizing high-risk patients. However, their vulnerability to\nadversarial attacks is much less explored in the literature. Developing\nblack-box perturbation algorithms and evaluating their impact on\nstate-of-the-art survival models brings two benefits to medical applications.\nFirst, it can effectively evaluate the robustness of models in pre-deployment\ntesting. Also, exploring how subtle perturbations would result in significantly\ndifferent outcomes can provide counterfactual insights into the clinical\ninterpretation of model prediction. In this work, we introduce SurvAttack, a\nnovel black-box adversarial attack framework leveraging subtle clinically\ncompatible, and semantically consistent perturbations on longitudinal EHRs to\ndegrade survival models' predictive performance. We specifically develop a\ngreedy algorithm to manipulate medical codes with various adversarial actions\nthroughout a patient's medical history. Then, these adversarial actions are\nprioritized using a composite scoring strategy based on multi-aspect\nperturbation quality, including saliency, perturbation stealthiness, and\nclinical meaningfulness. The proposed adversarial EHR perturbation algorithm is\nthen used in an efficient SA-specific strategy to attack a survival model when\nestimating the temporal ranking of survival urgency for patients. To\ndemonstrate the significance of our work, we conduct extensive experiments,\nincluding baseline comparisons, explainability analysis, and case studies. The\nexperimental results affirm our research's effectiveness in illustrating the\nvulnerabilities of patient survival models, model interpretation, and\nultimately contributing to healthcare quality.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is an emerging technology that offers exponential speedups\nfor certain problems. At the core of quantum-centric supercomputing is advanced\nmiddleware that manages the interaction between quantum hardware and classical\ncomputing infrastructure. Circuit knitting is a technique that leverages\nclassical computation to offload some of the computational burden from quantum\ncircuits, enabling them to exceed the capacity of current Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. This is done by partitioning large\ncircuits into smaller subcircuits, though at the cost of classical\nreconstruction and increased sampling overhead. Despite significant\nadvancements in reducing the theoretical costs of circuit knitting, efficiently\ndeploying these techniques across a broad range of quantum algorithms remains a\nchallenge. In this work, we propose CiFold, a novel graph-based system that, at\nthe individual qubit's level, identifies and leverages repeated structures\nwithin quantum circuits. By folding these repeated modules in parallel, CiFold\nconstructs a meta-graph that guides the partitioning process, optimizing the\ncutting strategy through the integration of advanced circuit knitting\ntechniques.

This interpretability is essential, as it\nallows for a clearer understanding of the underlying sources of error,\nenhancing both prediction confidence and decision-making processes.

First, we\ndemonstrate that it is easy to use a large language model (LLM) to generate\ndiverse attacker goals with per-goal prompts and rewards, including rule-based\nrewards (RBRs) to grade whether the attacks are successful for the particular\ngoal. Second, we demonstrate how training the attacker model with multi-step\nRL, where the model is rewarded for generating attacks that are different from\npast attempts further increases diversity while remaining effective. We use our\napproach to generate both prompt injection attacks and prompts that elicit\nunsafe responses. In both cases, we find that our approach is able to generate\nhighly-effective and considerably more diverse attacks than past general\nred-teaming approaches.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages are promising alternative antimicrobial agents due to their\nhigh specificity for host bacteria and minimal immunogenicity in humans.\nHowever, their therapeutic application is limited by their nature as biological\nentities, which can lead to unintended evolutionary consequences such as\nhorizontal gene transfer. In this study, we address these challenges by\nrepurposing only the structural components of bacteriophages as vesicles to\ndeliver antibiotics directly into the cytoplasm of bacterial hosts. This\napproach is based on two key hypotheses: first, antibiotics such as\nbeta-lactams remain effective against resistant bacteria if injected directly\ninto the cytoplasm, bypassing resistance mechanisms; second, phage structures\ncan be synthesized and self-assembled in vitro using modular genomes and\ncell-free protein expression systems to carry small molecules such as\nantibiotics as cargo. To test these hypotheses, we utilized T7 phages and\npenicillin-resistant Escherichia coli as a model system. First, we designed the\nT7 phage genome into a modular format containing only the genes encoding\nstructural components and synthesized the gene fragments via de novo gene\nsynthesis. These phage structures were then rebooted in vitro using a cell-free\nprotein expression system in the presence of penicillin G, allowing the\nantibiotics to be incorporated as cargo during the self-assembly process.\nFinally, we tested the antimicrobial activity of these antibiotic-loaded phage\nsyringes against penicillin-resistant E. coli. The results demonstrate that\nphage syringes effectively reduce the population of penicillin-resistant E.\ncoli compared to negative controls, including free penicillin and water. This\nstudy highlights the potential of using phage structures as antibiotic delivery\nvehicles, offering a novel strategy to overcome both antibiotic resistance and\nthe limitations of phage therapy.",

In this work, we study spectral and\ntemporal variability using X-ray and optical observations of the blazar\nperformed with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2020 to 2023. The large\nset of observational data reveals intensive flaring activity, accompanied by\nspectral changes in both spectral branches.\n  We conclude that the low-energy and high-energy ends of the particle\ndistribution function are characterised by similar variability scales.\nAdditionally, the hard X-ray observations of BL Lacertae performed with the\nNuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) confirm a concave spectral\ncurvature for some epochs of the blazar activity and reveal that it can be\nshifted up to energies of as high as 8 keV. The time-resolved spectral analysis\nallows us to disentangle X-ray spectral variability features of the synchrotron\nfrom inverse Compton components.\n  Despite significant variability of both spectral components, we find only\nsmall changes in the position of the spectral upturn. The different slopes and\nshapes of the X-ray spectrum of BL Lacertae demonstrate that the classification\nof this source is not constant, and BL Lacertae can exhibit features of either\nhigh-, intermediate-, or low-energy peaked blazar in different epochs of\nobservation.

Multiple heads intuitively\nenable different parallel processes over the same input. Yet, they also obscure\nthe attribution of each input patch to the output of a model. We propose a\nnovel 1-head Transformer Attention Bottleneck (TAB) layer, inserted after the\ntraditional MHSA architecture, to serve as an attention bottleneck for\ninterpretability and intervention. Unlike standard self-attention, TAB\nconstrains the total attention over all patches to $\\in [0, 1]$. That is, when\nthe total attention is 0, no visual information is propagated further into the\nnetwork, and the vision-language model (VLM) would default to a generic,\nimage-independent response. To demonstrate the advantages of TAB, we train VLMs\nwith TAB to perform image-difference captioning. Over three datasets, our\nmodels perform similarly to baseline VLMs in captioning but the bottleneck is\nsuperior in localizing changes and in identifying when no changes occur. TAB is\nthe first architecture to enable users to debug by editing attention, which\noften produces expected outputs by VLMs.",

Two three-dimensionally-shaped magnetic configurations with\nsuppressed trapped-electron-mode (TEM)-driven turbulence were generated through\noptimization that targeted quasihelical symmetry and the available energy of\ntrapped electrons. Initial equilibria have flux surface shapes with a helically\nrotating negative triangularity (NT) and positive triangularity (PT). In\ngyrokinetic simulations, TEMs are suppressed in the reduced-TEM NT and PT\nconfigurations, showing that negative triangularity does not have the same\nbeneficial turbulence properties over positive triangularity as seen in\ntokamaks. Heat fluxes from TEMs are also suppressed. Without temperature\ngradients and with a strong density gradient, the most unstable modes at low\n$k_y$ were consistent with toroidal universal instabilities (UIs) in the NT\ncase and slab UIs in the PT case. Nonlinear simulations show that UIs drive\nsubstantial heat flux in both the NT and PT configurations.

    "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that systems of tightly packed inner planets with\ngiant exterior companions tend to have less regular orbital spacings than those\nwithout such companions. We investigate whether this observed increase in the\ngap complexity of the inner systems can be explained solely as the result of\nsecular dynamics caused by the disturbing potential of the exterior companions.\nAmplification of mutual orbital inclinations in the inner system due to such\nsecular dynamics may lead to the inner system attaining non-mutually transiting\ngeometries, thereby creating artificial observed gaps that result in a higher\ncalculated gap complexity. Using second-order secular theory, we compute\ntime-averaged observed gap complexities along a favorable line of sight for a\nset of hypothetical systems, both with and without an outer giant. We find that\nthese secular interactions can significantly contribute to the observed gap\ncomplexity dichotomy in tightly packed multiple-planet systems.",

For the\nevaluation, 3D models of a single and double impeller configurations, placed in\ntwo different bioreactors were developed. Computational fluid dynamics was\nemployed to carry out the hydrodynamic simulation using k-epsilon standard\nmodel in the bioreactors.Computational variables such as the flow velocity,\nstreamlines, pressure and wall shear stress on the shaft and impellers, eddy\nviscosity, turbulence eddy dissipation and turbulence kinetic energy were\nobtained and compared in both bioreactors to evaluate the performances at\nspeeds of 50, 100, and 150 revolutions per minute.A comparison of the results\nwith traditional segment-segment and segment-Rushton impellers shows that our\ndouble impeller configuration performs more desirably at speeds ranging from\n100 to 150 RPM.

The generative completion model can make up for\nthe information missing due to occlusions; in extreme cases, it can hallucinate\nentirely invisible parts based on the input 3D asset.

The special case of human-machine\nteams carries unique challenges in this regard. For example, human teams often\nachieve synergy by communicating to discover their relative advantages, which\nis not an option if the team partner is an unexplainable deep neural network.\nBetween 2005-2008 a set of \"freestyle\" chess tournaments were held, in which\nhuman-machine teams known as \"centaurs\", outperformed the best humans and best\nmachines alone. Centaur players reported that they identified relative\nadvantages between themselves and their chess program, even though the program\nwas superhuman. Inspired by this and leveraging recent open-source models, we\nstudy human-machine like teams in chess. A human behavioral clone (\"Maia\") and\na pure self-play RL-trained chess engine (\"Leela\") were composed into a team\nusing a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. By directing our research\nquestion at the selection mechanism of the MoE, we could isolate the issue of\nextracting relative advantages without knowledge sharing. We show that in\nprinciple, there is high potential for synergy between human and machine in a\ncomplex sequential decision environment such as chess. Furthermore, we show\nthat an expert can identify only a small part of these relative advantages, and\nthat the contribution of its subject matter expertise in doing so saturates\nquickly. This is probably due to the \"curse of knowledge\" phenomenon. We also\ntrain a network to recognize relative advantages using reinforcement learning,\nwithout chess expertise, and it outdoes the expert. Our experiments are\nrepeated in asymmetric teams, in which identifying relative advantages is more\nchallenging. Our findings contribute to the study of collective intelligence\nand human-centric AI.",

Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has emerged as a\npowerful diagnostic tool for visualizing the GI tract, but it requires\ntime-consuming manual analysis by experienced gastroenterologists, which is\nprone to human error and inefficient given the increasing number of patients.To\naddress this challenge, we propose ClassifyViStA, an AI-based framework\ndesigned for the automated detection and classification of bleeding and\nnon-bleeding frames from WCE videos. The model consists of a standard\nclassification path, augmented by two specialized branches: an implicit\nattention branch and a segmentation branch.The attention branch focuses on the\nbleeding regions, while the segmentation branch generates accurate segmentation\nmasks, which are used for classification and interpretability. The model is\nbuilt upon an ensemble of ResNet18 and VGG16 architectures to enhance\nclassification performance. For the bleeding region detection, we implement a\nSoft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft NMS) approach with YOLOv8, which improves\nthe handling of overlapping bounding boxes, resulting in more accurate and\nnuanced detections.The system's interpretability is enhanced by using the\nsegmentation masks to explain the classification results, offering insights\ninto the decision-making process similar to the way a gastroenterologist\nidentifies bleeding regions. Our approach not only automates the detection of\nGI bleeding but also provides an interpretable solution that can ease the\nburden on healthcare professionals and improve diagnostic efficiency.

    "abstract": "Tumor synthesis can generate examples that AI often misses or over-detects,\nimproving AI performance by training on these challenging cases. However,\nexisting synthesis methods, which are typically unconditional -- generating\nimages from random variables -- or conditioned only by tumor shapes, lack\ncontrollability over specific tumor characteristics such as texture,\nheterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology type. As a result, the generated\ntumors may be overly similar or duplicates of existing training data, failing\nto effectively address AI's weaknesses. We propose a new text-driven tumor\nsynthesis approach, termed TextoMorph, that provides textual control over tumor\ncharacteristics. This is particularly beneficial for examples that confuse the\nAI the most, such as early tumor detection (increasing Sensitivity by +8.5%),\ntumor segmentation for precise radiotherapy (increasing DSC by +6.3%), and\nclassification between benign and malignant tumors (improving Sensitivity by\n+8.2%). By incorporating text mined from radiology reports into the synthesis\nprocess, we increase the variability and controllability of the synthetic\ntumors to target AI's failure cases more precisely. Moreover, TextoMorph uses\ncontrastive learning across different texts and CT scans, significantly\nreducing dependence on scarce image-report pairs (only 141 pairs used in this\nstudy) by leveraging a large corpus of 34,035 radiology reports. Finally, we\nhave developed rigorous tests to evaluate synthetic tumors, including\nText-Driven Visual Turing Test and Radiomics Pattern Analysis, showing that our\nsynthetic tumors is realistic and diverse in texture, heterogeneity,\nboundaries, and pathology.",

Aside\nfrom increasingly sophisticated reasoning and task planning, networks of\n(suitably designed) LLMs offer ease of upgrading capabilities and allow humans\nto directly observe the robot's thinking. Here we explore the advantages,\nlimitations, and particularities of using LLMs to control physical robots. The\nbasic system consists of four LLMs communicating via a human language data bus\nimplemented via web sockets and ROS2 message passing. Surprisingly, rich robot\nbehaviors and good performance across different tasks could be achieved despite\nthe robot's data fusion cycle running at only 1Hz and the central data bus\nrunning at the extremely limited rates of the human brain, of around 40 bits/s.\nThe use of natural language for inter-LLM communication allowed the robot's\nreasoning and decision making to be directly observed by humans and made it\ntrivial to bias the system's behavior with sets of rules written in plain\nEnglish. These rules were immutably written into Ethereum, a global, public,\nand censorship resistant Turing-complete computer.

    "abstract": "Lookup tables (LUTs) are frequently used to efficiently store arrays of\nprecomputed values for complex mathematical computations. When used in the\ncontext of neural networks, these functions exhibit a lack of recognizable\npatterns which presents an unusual challenge for conventional logic synthesis\ntechniques. Several approaches are known to break down a single large lookup\ntable into multiple smaller ones that can be recombined. Traditional methods,\nsuch as plain tabulation, piecewise linear approximation, and multipartite\ntable methods, often yield inefficient hardware solutions when applied to\nLUT-based NNs.\n  This paper introduces ReducedLUT, a novel method to reduce the footprint of\nthe LUTs by injecting don't cares into the compression process. This additional\nfreedom introduces more self-similarities which can be exploited using known\ndecomposition techniques. We then demonstrate a particular application to\nmachine learning; by replacing unobserved patterns within the training data of\nneural network models with don't cares, we enable greater compression with\nminimal model accuracy degradation. In practice, we achieve up to $1.63\\times$\nreduction in Physical LUT utilization, with a test accuracy drop of no more\nthan $0.01$ accuracy points.",

    "abstract": "Randomized benchmarking (RB) comprises a set of mature and widely used\ntechniques for assessing the quality of operations on a quantum\ninformation-processing system. Modern RB protocols for multiqubit systems\nextract physically relevant error rates by exploiting the structure of the\ngroup representation generated by the set of benchmarked operations. However,\nexisting techniques become prohibitively inefficient for representations that\nare highly reducible yet decompose into irreducible subspaces of high\ndimension. These situations prevail when benchmarking high-dimensional systems\nsuch as qudits or bosonic modes, where experimental control is limited to\nimplementing a small subset of all possible unitary operations. In this work,\nwe introduce a broad framework for enhancing the sample efficiency of RB that\nis sufficiently powerful to extend the practical reach of RB beyond the\nmultiqubit setting. Our strategy, which applies to any benchmarking group, uses\n\"synthetic\" quantum circuits with classical post-processing of both input and\noutput data to leverage the full structure of reducible superoperator\nrepresentations. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we develop a\ndetailed theory of RB for systems with rotational symmetry. Such systems carry\na natural action of the group $\\text{SU}(2)$, and they form the basis for\nseveral novel quantum error-correcting codes. We show that, for experimentally\naccessible high-spin systems, synthetic RB protocols can reduce the complexity\nof measuring rotationally invariant error rates by more than two orders of\nmagnitude relative to standard approaches such as character RB.",

While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine\nsimilarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the alignment of\na generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a\ntext-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings\nto quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models,\nwhich are responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts,\nwhich we refer to as prompt-aware diversity. To achieve this, we propose a\ndecomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into\ntext-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the\njoint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and\ndefine the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the Schur\nComplement ENtopy DIversity (Scendi) score, as a measure of the prompt-aware\ndiversity for prompt-guided generative models. Additionally, we discuss the\napplication of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the\ninfluence of a given prompt on the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus\nor defocus of the embedded vectors on specific objects. We present several\nnumerical results that apply our proposed Scendi score to evaluate\ntext-to-image and LLM (text-to-text) models.

This study aimed to leverage VHE\nobservations to refine constraints on synchrotron + SSC radiation from\nelectrons accelerated by forward shocks. By analyzing two external environments\n- the uniform interstellar medium and stratified stellar wind medium, we\nconducted spectral and variability fitting for five specific bursts\n(GRB~180720B, GRB~190114C, GRB~190829A, GRB~201216C, and GRB~221009A) to\nidentify the optimal parameters characterizing these events. A comparative\nanalysis of model parameter distributions with and without VHE radiation\nobservations reveals that the magnetic energy equipartition factor $\\epsilon_B$\nis more concentrated with VHE emissions. This suggests that VHE emissions may\noffer greater constraints on this microphysical parameter.

This raises a critical question: can a model's general-domain\ncoding ability reliably represent its ability in specialized domains? In this\npaper, we introduce DomainCodeBench, a multi-domain code generation benchmark\ndesigned to systematically evaluate LLMs across 12 software application domains\nand 15 programming languages. DomainCodeBench contains 2,400 manually verified\ntasks with ground truth, human-annotated docstrings, and fine-grained\ndependency information to ensure more coverage of domain-specific challenges.\nSpecifically, we first identify the most popular application domains by topic\nmining. Then, we curate coding tasks based on commonly used frameworks and\nplatforms in each domain. We obtain several findings through extensive\nexperiments on DomainCodeBench with ten mainstream LLMs. (1) Performance\ndecoupling: experiments reveal that top general-domain models do not\nconsistently excel in specific application domains; (2) Domain-specific\nweaknesses: LLMs often fail due to domain knowledge gaps and third-party\nlibrary misusage; (3) Contextual enhancement: we show that augmenting prompts\nwith domain-specific knowledge improves performance by around 38.17%, providing\nactionable insights for performance optimization.

We achieve this by using a pre-trained\nmultilingual speech encoder, a multilingual LLM, and a lightweight adaptation\nmodule that maps the audio representations to the token embedding space of the\nLLM. We perform several experiments both in ST and ASR to understand how to\nbest train the model and what data has the most impact on performance in\npreviously unseen languages. In ST, our best model is capable to achieve BLEU\nscores over 23 in CoVoST2 for two previously unseen languages, while in ASR, we\nachieve WERs of up to 28.2\\%.

However, data owned by each institution would be highly\nheterogeneous and the distribution is always non-independent and identical\ndistribution (non-IID), resulting in client drift and unsatisfactory\nperformance. Despite existing federated learning methods attempting to solve\nthe non-IID problems, they still show marginal advantages but rely on frequent\ncommunication which would incur high costs and privacy concerns. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel federated learning method: \\textbf{Fed}erated learning via\n\\textbf{V}aluable \\textbf{C}ondensed \\textbf{K}nowledge (FedVCK). We enhance\nthe quality of condensed knowledge and select the most necessary knowledge\nguided by models, to tackle the non-IID problem within limited communication\nbudgets effectively. Specifically, on the client side, we condense the\nknowledge of each client into a small dataset and further enhance the\ncondensation procedure with latent distribution constraints, facilitating the\neffective capture of high-quality knowledge. During each round, we specifically\ntarget and condense knowledge that has not been assimilated by the current\nmodel, thereby preventing unnecessary repetition of homogeneous knowledge and\nminimizing the frequency of communications required. On the server side, we\npropose relational supervised contrastive learning to provide more supervision\nsignals to aid the global model updating.

    "abstract": "Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) aims to extract and summarize user\nopinions from vast opinionated text. Recent studies demonstrate that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding\ncapabilities. However, directly deploying LLMs for FSA applications incurs high\ninference costs. Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of\nfine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models\n(SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews\nand then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we\ndevelop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive\nexperiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly\nenhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\\% improvement\nin $F_1$-score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only\n220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot\nsentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed\ntheir teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a\nhighly promising direction for FSA.

Using a generalized linear mixed model, we examined\ndeterminants of individuals' total social contacts and evaluated the potential\nimpact of work-from-home and distance learning on the transmissibility of\nrespiratory pathogens.

Recently, transformers have been widely used in deep learning-based\nregistration methods for their ability to capture long-range dependency via\nself-attention (SA). However, the high computation and memory loads of SA\n(growing quadratically with the spatial resolution) hinder transformers from\nprocessing subtle textural information in high-resolution image features, e.g.,\nat the full and half image resolutions. This limits deformable registration as\nthe high-resolution textural information is crucial for finding precise\npixel-wise correspondence between subtle anatomical structures.\nCross-covariance Attention (XCA), as a \"transposed\" version of SA that operates\nacross feature channels, has complexity growing linearly with the spatial\nresolution, providing the feasibility of capturing long-range dependency among\nhigh-resolution image features. However, existing XCA-based transformers merely\ncapture coarse global long-range dependency, which are unsuitable for\ndeformable image registration relying primarily on fine-grained local\ncorrespondence. In this study, we propose to improve existing deep\nlearning-based registration methods by embedding a new XCA mechanism. To this\nend, we design an XCA-based transformer block optimized for deformable medical\nimage registration, named Multi-Axis XCA (MAXCA). Our MAXCA serves as a general\nnetwork block that can be embedded into various registration network\narchitectures. It can capture both global and local long-range dependency among\nhigh-resolution image features by applying regional and dilated XCA in parallel\nvia a multi-axis design. Extensive experiments on two well-benchmarked\ninter-/intra-patient registration tasks with seven public medical datasets\ndemonstrate that our MAXCA block enables state-of-the-art registration\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet\nstruggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex\nknowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs. Previous studies\nhave attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale\nknowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of\nanswers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant\ndata, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge\naspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question\nand relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect\nRetrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge\nincluding entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of\nretrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key\nsub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among\nentities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing\nnoise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to\nlearn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to\ndetermine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even\nfiltered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on\ntwo common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\\% improvement in accuracy\nover its best competitor and a 6.6\\% improvement in logical form generation\nover a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. These\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of\nLLMs.",

Namely, the bulk evolution of the horizon is geometrically classified into\nan oscillatory (non-heating) behaviour, an exponentially growing (heating)\nbehaviour and a power-law growth with an angular rotation (the phase boundary),\nall as a function of the stroboscopic time. We also show that the explicit\nsymmetry breaking of the drive is manifest in a flowery structure of the event\nhorizon that displays a $U(1) \\to {\\mathbb Z}_q$ symmetry breaking. In the\n$q\\to \\infty$ limit, the $U(1)$ symmetry is effectively restored.

Each GCN layer performs a graph convolution, mathematically equivalent to\nmultiplying three matrices, computed through two separate matrix\nmultiplications. Existing Algorithm-based Fault Tolerance(ABFT) techniques can\ncheck the results of individual matrix multiplications. However, for a GCN\nlayer, this check should be performed twice. To avoid this overhead, this work\nintroduces GCN-ABFT that directly calculates a checksum for the entire\nthree-matrix product within a single GCN layer, providing a cost-effective\napproach for error detection in GCN accelerators. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that GCN-ABFT reduces the number of operations needed for checksum\ncomputation by over 21% on average for representative GCN applications.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has garnered attention for its potential to solve complex\ncomputational problems with considerable speedup. Despite notable advancements\nin the field, achieving meaningful scalability and noise control in quantum\nhardware remains challenging. Incoherent errors caused by decoherence restrict\nthe total computation time, making it very short. While hardware advancements\ncontinue to progress, quantum software specialists seek to minimize quantum\ncircuit latency to mitigate dissipation. However, at the pulse level, fast\nquantum gates often lead to leakage, leaving minimal room for further\noptimization. Recent advancements have shown the effectiveness of quantum\ncontrol techniques in generating quantum gates robust to coherent error\nsources. Nevertheless, these techniques come with a trade-off -- extended gate\ndurations. In this paper, we introduce an alternative pulse scheduling approach\nthat enables the use of both fast and robust quantum gates within the same\nquantum circuit. The time-optimization framework models the quantum circuit as\na dependency graph, implements the fastest quantum gates on the critical path,\nand uses idle periods outside the critical path to optimally implement longer,\nmore robust gates from the gate set, without increasing latency.

Upon\ncanonical quantization, the infinite number of possible operator orderings in\nthe quantum Hamiltonian leads to distinct Wheeler-DeWitt equations for the\nwavefunction $\\psi$ of the Universe. Similarly, ambiguity arises in the\npath-integral formulation of $\\psi$, due to the infinite choices of\npath-integral measures for the single degree of freedom of the model. For each\nchoice of path-integral measure, we determine the correct operator ordering of\nthe quantum Hamiltonian and derive the exact form of the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation, including all corrections in $\\hbar$. Additionally, we impose\nHermiticity of the Hamiltonian to deduce the Hilbert-space measure $\\mu$, which\nappears in the definition of the Hermitian inner product. Remarkably, all\nquantum predictions can be expressed through the combination $\\Psi=\\sqrt{\\mu}\\,\n\\psi$, which satisfies a universal Wheeler-DeWitt equation, independent of the\ninitial path-integral prescription.

However, the average pull request\nclosure duration increased from five hours 52 minutes to eight hours 20\nminutes, with varying trends across projects. Most practitioners reported a\nminor improvement in code quality due to automated reviews.\n  The LLM-based tool proved useful in software development, enhancing bug\ndetection, increasing awareness of code quality, and promoting best practices.\nHowever, it also led to longer pull request closure times and introduced\ndrawbacks like faulty reviews, unnecessary corrections, and irrelevant\ncomments.",

While their algorithm eventually generates\nunseen strings from the target language $K$, it sacrifices coverage or breadth,\ni.e., its ability to generate a rich set of strings. Recent work introduces\ndifferent notions of breadth and explores when generation with breadth is\npossible, leaving a full characterization of these notions open. Our first set\nof results settles this by characterizing generation for existing notions of\nbreadth and their natural extensions. Interestingly, our lower bounds are very\nflexible and hold for many performance metrics beyond breadth - for instance,\nshowing that, in general, it is impossible to train generators which achieve a\nhigher perplexity or lower hallucination rate for $K$ compared to other\nlanguages. Next, we study language generation with breadth and stable\ngenerators - algorithms that eventually stop changing after seeing an arbitrary\nbut finite number of strings - and prove unconditional lower bounds for such\ngenerators, strengthening the results of [KMV25] and demonstrating that\ngeneration with many existing notions of breadth becomes equally hard, when\nstability is required. This gives a separation for generation with approximate\nbreadth, between stable and unstable generators, highlighting the rich\ninterplay between breadth, stability, and consistency in language generation.",

    "abstract": "Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG or Graph RAG) architectures aim to\nenhance language understanding and generation by leveraging external knowledge.\nHowever, effectively capturing and integrating the rich semantic information\npresent in textual and structured data remains a challenge. To address this, a\nnovel GRAG framework, Dynamic Graph Retrieval-Agumented Generation (DynaGRAG),\nis proposed to focus on enhancing subgraph representation and diversity within\nthe knowledge graph. By improving graph density, capturing entity and relation\ninformation more effectively, and dynamically prioritizing relevant and diverse\nsubgraphs and information within them, the proposed approach enables a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the underlying semantic structure. This is\nachieved through a combination of de-duplication processes, two-step mean\npooling of embeddings, query-aware retrieval considering unique nodes, and a\nDynamic Similarity-Aware BFS (DSA-BFS) traversal algorithm. Integrating Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) through hard\nprompting further enhances the learning of rich node and edge representations\nwhile preserving the hierarchical subgraph structure.

However, it is difficult to explain the relative importance of data\nelements with respect to the rules in which they appear. This paper develops a\nmeasure of an element's contribution to a set of association rules based on\nShapley values, denoted SHARQ (ShApley Rules Quantification). As is the case\nwith many Shapely-based computations, the cost of a naive calculation of the\nscore is exponential in the number of elements. To that end, we present an\nefficient framework for computing the exact SharQ value of a single element\nwhose running time is practically linear in the number of rules. Going one step\nfurther, we develop an efficient multi-element SHARQ algorithm which amortizes\nthe cost of the single element SHARQ calculation over a set of elements. Based\non the definition of SHARQ for elements we describe two additional use cases\nfor association rules explainability: rule importance and attribute importance.\nExtensive experiments over a novel benchmark dataset containing 45 instances of\nmined rule sets show the effectiveness of our approach.",

However, DRL demands extensive computational resources\nto achieve a qualified policy in complex driving scenarios due to its low\nlearning efficiency. Moreover, leveraging expert guidance from human to enhance\nDRL performance incurs prohibitively high labor costs, which limits its\npractical application. In this study, we propose a novel large language model\n(LLM) guided deep reinforcement learning (LGDRL) framework for addressing the\ndecision-making problem of autonomous vehicles. Within this framework, an\nLLM-based driving expert is integrated into the DRL to provide intelligent\nguidance for the learning process of DRL.

We performed\nobservations towards 5 regions of massive star and stellar cluster formation\n(L1287, S187, S231, DR 21(OH), NGC 7538) with the IRAM-30m telescope. We\ncovered the 2 and 3$-$4 mm wavelength bands and analysed the lines of HCN, HNC,\nHCO$^+$, HC$_3$N, HNCO, OCS, CS, SiO, SO$_2$, and SO. Using astrodendro\nalgorithm on the 850 $\\mu$m dust emission data from the SCUBA Legacy catalogue,\nwe determined the masses, H$_2$ column densities, and sizes of the clumps.\nFurthermore, the kinetic temperatures, molecular abundances, and dynamical\nstate were obtained. The Red Midcourse Space Experiment Source survey (RMS) was\nused to determine the clump types. A total of 20 clumps were identified. Three\nclumps were found to be associated with the Hii regions, 10 with young stellar\nobjects (YSOs), and 7 with submillimetre emission. The clumps have typical\nsizes of about 0.2 pc and masses ranging from 1 to $10^{2}\\,M_\\odot$, kinetic\ntemperatures ranging from 20 to 40 K and line widths of $\\rm H^{13}CO^{+}\n(1-0)$ approximately 2 $\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$.

The virial\nanalysis indicated that three clumps are gravitationally bound. Furthermore, we\nsuggested that magnetic fields of about 1 mG provide additional support for\nclump stability.

One elegant and effective approach is to exploit\nthe eigendecomposition of a graph shift operator (GSO), such as the adjacency\nor Laplacian operator, to define a graph Fourier transform when projecting\ngraph signals on the corresponding basis. However, the extension of this scheme\nto directed graphs is challenging since the associated GSO is non-symmetric\nand, in general, not diagonalizable. Here, we build upon a recent framework\nthat adds a minimal number of edges to allow diagonalization of the GSO and\nthus provide a proper graph Fourier transform. Furthermore, we show that such\nminimal addition of edges creates a cycle cover and that it is essential for\nthe phase analysis of a signal throughout the graph. Concurrently, we propose a\ngeneralization of the Hilbert transform interpreted over the newfound cycle\ncover, which re-establishes intuitions from traditional Hilbert Transform,\nequivalent to the generalized Hilbert Transform on a single cycle. This\ngeneralization leads to a number of simple and elegant recipes to effectively\nexploit the phase information of graph signals provided by the graph Fourier\ntransform.

To meet communication and sensing requirements,\nmany works propose a static configuration where the wave's hyperparameters such\nas the number of symbols in a frame and the number of frames in a communication\nslot are already predefined. However, two facts oblige us to redefine the\nproblem, (1) the environment is often dynamic and uncertain, and (2) mmWave is\nseverely impacted by wireless environments. A striking example where this\nchallenge is very prominent is autonomous vehicle (AV). Such a system leverages\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC) using mmWave to manage data\ntransmission and the dynamism of the environment. In this work, we consider an\nautonomous vehicle network where an AV utilizes its queue state information\n(QSI) and channel state information (CSI) in conjunction with reinforcement\nlearning techniques to manage communication and sensing. This enables the AV to\nachieve two primary objectives: establishing a stable communication link with\nother AVs and accurately estimating the velocities of surrounding objects with\nhigh resolution. The communication performance is therefore evaluated based on\nthe queue state, the effective data rate, and the discarded packets rate. In\ncontrast, the effectiveness of the sensing is assessed using the velocity\nresolution. In addition, we exploit adaptive OFDM techniques for dynamic\nmodulation, and we suggest a reward function that leverages the age of updates\nto handle the communication buffer and improve sensing.

We find that all methods\nreliably produce natural, typical, and distinctive event descriptions, but that\nmanual generation continues to produce event descriptions that are more\nnatural, typical, and distinctive than the automated generation methods. We\nconclude that the automated methods we consider produce event descriptions of\nsufficient quality for use in downstream annotation and analysis insofar as the\nmethods used for this annotation and analysis are robust to a small amount of\ndegradation in the resulting event descriptions.",

In this study, we propose to implement the topological\nphases safeguarded by the unique projective space-time (PT) symmetry inherent\nto spinful models, using synthetic spinless alkaline-earth-like atoms.\nEmploying the separation of orbital and nuclear-spin degrees of freedom, the\nmodel is configured as a rectangular tube penetrated by a uniform magnetic flux\nthrough each plaquette, which simulates a spinless ladder endowed with\nprojective PT symmetry satisfying the algebraic properties of a spinful model.\nFor interacting topological phases with inter-orbital spin-exchange\ninteractions, which also adhere to PT symmetry, the four-fold degeneracy of\nedge modes is split into two pairs of edge modes with two-fold degeneracy.

In this work, attention is masked based on\nthe known block structure at the prefill phase, followed by the conventional\ntoken-by-token autoregressive process after that. For example, in a typical\nchat prompt, the system prompt is treated as one block, and the user prompt as\nthe next one.

While\nFerreira and Teles focused on email subject lines, this research analyzed\nentire email contents to identify principles of human persuasion in phishing\nemails. This study also examined the goals and targets of phishing emails,\nproviding a novel contribution to the field. Applying these findings to the\nontological model by Mouton et al.

The goals are\ntypically unauthorized access, followed by financial gain and service\ndisruption, with Distraction as the most commonly used compliance principle.\nThis research highlights the importance of understanding human persuasion in\ntechnology-mediated interactions to develop methods for detecting and\npreventing phishing emails before they reach users. Despite previous\nidentification of luring elements in phishing emails, empirical findings have\nbeen inconsistent. For example, Akbar (2014) found 'authority' and 'scarcity'\nmost common, while Ferreira et al. (2015) identified 'liking' and 'similarity.'\nIn this study, 'Distraction' was most frequently used, followed by 'Deception,'\n'Integrity,' and 'Authority.'

Future work will apply this methodology to other\nsocial engineering techniques beyond phishing emails, using the ontological\nmodel to further inform the research community.",

Here, we present a\nformulation that is efficient and accurate for calculating the elastic and\nbending rigidity tensors of crystalline solids, leveraging interatomic force\nconstants and long-wavelength perturbation theory. Crucially, in the\nlong-wavelength limit, lattice vibrations induce macroscopic electric fields\nwhich further couple with the propagation of elastic waves, and a separate\ntreatment on the long-range electrostatic interactions is thereby required to\nobtain elastic properties under the appropriate electrical boundary conditions.\nA cluster expansion of the charge density response and dielectric screening\nfunction in the long-wavelength limit has been developed to efficiently extract\nmultipole and dielectric tensors of arbitrarily high order. We implement the\nproposed method in a first-principles framework and perform extensive\nvalidations on silicon, NaCl, GaAs and rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ as well as\nmonolayer graphene, hexagonal BN, MoS$_2$ and InSe, obtaining good to excellent\nagreement with other theoretical approaches and experimental measurements.\nNotably, we establish that multipolar interactions up to at least octupoles are\nnecessary to obtain the accurate short-circuit elastic tensor of bulk\nmaterials, while higher orders beyond octupole interactions are required to\nconverge the bending rigidity tensor of 2D crystals. The present approach\ngreatly simplifies the calculations of bending rigidities and will enable the\nautomated characterization of the mechanical properties of novel functional\nmaterials.",

Here, we report the development\nof the symmetry-broken spin-orbit superlattice [Pt/Co/W]n that can be\nsputtered-deposited on commercial oxidized silicon substrates and have giant\nSOTs, strong uniaxial PMA of 9.2 Merg/cm3. The dampinglike and fieldlike SOTs\nof the [Pt/Co/W]n superlattices exhibit a linear increase with the repeat\nnumber n and reach the giant values of 225% and -33% (two orders of magnitude\ngreater than that in clean-limit Pt) at n = 12, respectively. The dampinglike\nSOT is also of the opposite sign and much greater in magnitude than the\nfieldlike SOT, regardless of the number of n. These results clarify that the\nspin current that generates SOTs in the [Pt/Co/W]n superlattices arises\npredominantly from the spin Hall effect rather than bulk Rashba-type spin\nsplitting, providing a unified understanding of the SOTs in the superlattices.\nWe also demonstrate deterministic switching in thicker-than-50-nm PMA\n[Pt/Co/W]12 superlattices at a low current density.

In\ncase of one-parameter optimization, we show that while the universality of the\nfirst linear term $\\eta_c/2$ is robust and holds consistently across all\nconditions, the universality of the quadratic term $\\eta_C^2/8$ depends on the\nconstraints imposed on the control parameters.

    "abstract": "Social segregation in cities, spanning racial, residential, and income\ndimensions, is becoming more diverse and severe. As urban spaces and social\nrelations grow more complex, residents in metropolitan areas experience varying\nlevels of social segregation. If left unaddressed, this could lead to increased\ncrime rates, heightened social tensions, and other serious issues. Effectively\nquantifying and analyzing the structures within urban spaces and resident\ninteractions is crucial for addressing segregation. Previous studies have\nmainly focused on surface-level indicators of urban segregation, lacking\ncomprehensive analyses of urban structure and mobility. This limitation fails\nto capture the full complexity of segregation. To address this gap, we propose\na framework named Motif-Enhanced Graph Prototype Learning (MotifGPL),which\nconsists of three key modules: prototype-based graph structure extraction,\nmotif distribution discovery, and urban graph structure reconstruction.\nSpecifically, we use graph structure prototype learning to extract key\nprototypes from both the urban spatial graph and the origin-destination graph,\nincorporating key urban attributes such as points of interest, street view\nimages, and flow indices. To enhance interpretability, the motif distribution\ndiscovery module matches each prototype with similar motifs, representing\nsimpler graph structures reflecting local patterns. Finally, we use the motif\ndistribution results to guide the reconstruction of the two graphs. This model\nenables a detailed exploration of urban spatial structures and resident\nmobility patterns, helping identify and analyze motif patterns that influence\nurban segregation, guiding the reconstruction of urban graph structures.\nExperimental results demonstrate that MotifGPL effectively reveals the key\nmotifs affecting urban social segregation and offer robust guidance for\nmitigating this issue.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm that enables\ncollaborative learning across clients without sharing local data, thereby\npreserving privacy. However, the increasing scale and complexity of modern deep\nmodels often exceed the computational or memory capabilities of edge devices.\nFurthermore, clients may be constrained to use heterogeneous model\narchitectures due to hardware variability (e.g., ASICs, FPGAs) or proprietary\nrequirements that prevent the disclosure or modification of local model\nstructures. These practical considerations motivate the need for\nmodel-heterogeneous FL, where clients participate using distinct model\narchitectures. In this work, we propose Generative Model-Aided Federated\nLearning (GeFL), a framework that enables cross-client knowledge sharing via a\ngenerative model trained in a federated manner. This generative model captures\nglobal data semantics and facilitates local training without requiring model\nhomogeneity across clients. While GeFL achieves strong performance, empirical\nanalysis reveals limitations in scalability and potential privacy leakage due\nto generative sample memorization. To address these concerns, we propose\nGeFL-F, which utilizes feature-level generative modeling. This approach\nenhances scalability to large client populations and mitigates privacy risks.\nExtensive experiments across image classification tasks demonstrate that both\nGeFL and GeFL-F offer competitive performance in heterogeneous settings.

In\nthis paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image\nrestoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely\ncombines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively\ncapture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we\nintroduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and\nspatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By\nleveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be\nperceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both\nunderwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and\nrobustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nunderwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our\nresults show that well-designed pure CNN architectures can effectively compete\nwith more complex models, offering a balance between performance and\ncomputational efficiency.

Focusing on the flux-induced chiral current along\nthe two legs, we show that, counter-intuitively, on-site interactions can\nreverse the direction of the chiral flow. For a Bose-Einstein condensate whose\ndynamical evolution is driven by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation under the\nmean-field approximation, this reversal can be understood as an\ninteraction-induced dynamic occupation inversion, under which single-particle\nband with opposing chirality becomes heavily populated in the dynamics. This\nchirality inversion also persists in the two-body dynamics with strong quantum\nfluctuations beyond the mean-field regime, as demonstrated through\ntime-dependent density-matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization\nanalyses. Herein, besides the band-occupation-inversion mechanism, we find that\nthe formation of two-body bound states with opposite chirality contributes\nsignificantly to the reversed chiral transport. Our discovery highlights the\nsignificance of correlation effects in quantum transport, and can be readily\ndemonstrated using cold atoms.",

    "abstract": "A 3D scene graph represents a compact scene model by capturing both the\nobjects present and the semantic relationships between them, making it a\npromising structure for robotic applications. To effectively interact with\nusers, an embodied intelligent agent should be able to answer a wide range of\nnatural language queries about the surrounding 3D environment. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their\nnatural language understanding and reasoning abilities. Recent methods for\nlearning scene representations have shown that adapting these representations\nto the 3D world can significantly improve the quality of LLM responses.\nHowever, existing methods typically rely only on geometric information, such as\nobject coordinates, and overlook the rich semantic relationships between\nobjects. In this work, we propose 3DGraphLLM, a method for constructing a\nlearnable representation of a 3D scene graph that explicitly incorporates\nsemantic relationships. This representation is used as input to LLMs for\nperforming 3D vision-language tasks. In our experiments on popular ScanRefer,\nMulti3DRefer, ScanQA, Sqa3D, and Scan2cap datasets, we demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms baselines that do not leverage semantic relationships\nbetween objects.

Traditional measurements have been conducted using\nquestionnaires, which exhibit inherent limitations due to their subjective\nnature and preventing real-time adjustments. Detecting vection in real time\nwould allow VR systems to adapt to users' needs, improving comfort and\nminimizing negative effects like motion sickness. This paper investigates the\npresence of vection markers in electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals using\nevoked potentials (brain responses to external stimulations).\n  We designed a VR experiment that induces vection using two conditions: (1)\nforward acceleration or (2) backward acceleration. We recorded both\nelectroencephalographic (EEG) signals and gathered subjective reports on thirty\n(30) participants. We found an evoked potential of vection characterized by a\npositive peak around 600 ms (P600) after stimulus onset in the parietal region\nand a simultaneous negative peak in the frontal region. Our results also found\nparticipant variability in sensitivity to vection and cybersickness and EEG\nmarkers of acceleration across subjects. This result is promising for potential\ndetection of vection using EEG and paves the way for future studies towards a\nbetter understanding of vection.

    "abstract": "The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and\ncomplete the missing relations or nodes in a KG. Common KGC tasks are mostly\nabout inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a\ntriple. In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic\nknowledge graph completion task. It aims to predict all elements of unknown\ntriples based on the information from known triples. In recent years, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language\ncomprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks. However, the\npotential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated. Thus in this\npaper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of\nLLM in the TSP task. Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule\nmining and LLM-based triple set prediction. The relation list of KG embedded\nwithin rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the\ngeneration of rules. This process is both efficient and independent of\nstatistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic\nrules. For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the\nrelevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the\nmissing triples. Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are\nconsolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG. Finally,\nthe method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset. The\nexperimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large\namount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant\nhallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance. To\nfurther explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a\ncomprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.",

In this\npaper, we introduce MixMAS, a novel framework for sampling-based mixer\narchitecture search tailored to multimodal learning. Our approach automatically\nselects the optimal MLP-based architecture for a given multimodal machine\nlearning (MML) task. Specifically, MixMAS utilizes a sampling-based\nmicro-benchmarking strategy to explore various combinations of\nmodality-specific encoders, fusion functions, and fusion networks,\nsystematically identifying the architecture that best meets the task's\nperformance metrics.",

This paper presents a novel diffusion model-based approach that\ngenerates fashion images with improved fashionability while maintaining control\nover key attributes. Key components of our method include: 1) fashionability\nenhancement, which ensures that the generated images are more fashionable than\nthe input; 2) preservation of body characteristics, encouraging the generated\nimages to maintain the original shape and proportions of the input; and 3)\nautomatic fashion optimization, which does not rely on manual input or external\nprompts. We also employ two methods to collect training data for guidance while\ngenerating and evaluating the images. In particular, we rate outfit images\nusing fashionability scores annotated by multiple fashion experts through\nOpenSkill-based and five critical aspect-based pairwise comparisons.

The joint observations by the planned\nspace-borne gravitational wave detectors, LISA and TAIJI, will offer a unique\nopportunity to observe such effects in the millihertz (mHz) band. This study\nevaluates the detectability of parity violation in the SGWB using two network\nconfigurations: LISA-TAIJIp and LISA-TAIJIm.

Our analysis demonstrates that the sensitivity of\nthe LISA-TAIJIm network to parity violation in the SGWB is approximately one\norder of magnitude greater than that of the LISA-TAIJIp network at lower\nfrequencies. To quantify the performance of the two networks, we evaluate the\nsignal-to-noise ratios for different spectral shapes, including power-law,\nsingle-peak, and broken power-law models, and estimate parameter determination\nusing the Fisher information matrix.

Efficient compression of remote sensing\nimagery is a critical solution to alleviate these burdens on satellites.\nHowever, existing compression methods are often too computationally expensive\nfor satellites. With the continued advancement of compressed sensing theory,\nsingle-pixel imaging emerges as a powerful tool that brings new possibilities\nfor on-orbit image compression.

S4GUI communicates with the\ninstrument subsystems and with some observatory facilities, needed during the\nobservations. Bench tests were performed for the determination of the overheads\nadded by SPARC4 control system in the acquisition of photometric and\npolarimetric series of images. In the photometric mode, SPARC4 allows the\nacquisition of a series of 1400 full-frame images, with a deadtime of 4.5 ms\nbetween images. Besides, several image series can be concatenated with a\ndeadtime of 450 ms plus the readout time of the last image.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically evaluated under the assumption that\neach image has a single correct label. However, many images in benchmarks like\nImageNet contain multiple valid labels, creating a mismatch between evaluation\nprotocols and the actual complexity of visual data. This mismatch can penalize\nDNNs for predicting correct but unannotated labels, which may partly explain\nreported accuracy drops, such as the widely cited 11 to 14 percent top-1\naccuracy decline on ImageNetV2, a replication test set for ImageNet. This\nraises the question: do such drops reflect genuine generalization failures or\nartifacts of restrictive evaluation metrics? We rigorously assess the impact of\nmulti-label characteristics on reported accuracy gaps. To evaluate the\nmulti-label prediction capability (MLPC) of single-label-trained models, we\nintroduce a variable top-$k$ evaluation, where $k$ matches the number of valid\nlabels per image. Applied to 315 ImageNet-trained models, our analyses\ndemonstrate that conventional top-1 accuracy disproportionately penalizes valid\nbut secondary predictions. We also propose Aggregate Subgroup Model Accuracy\n(ASMA) to better capture multi-label performance across model subgroups. Our\nresults reveal wide variability in MLPC, with some models consistently ranking\nmultiple correct labels higher. Under this evaluation, the perceived gap\nbetween ImageNet and ImageNetV2 narrows substantially. To further isolate\nmulti-label recognition performance from contextual cues, we introduce PatchML,\na synthetic dataset containing systematically combined object patches. PatchML\ndemonstrates that many models trained with single-label supervision nonetheless\nrecognize multiple objects. Altogether, these findings highlight limitations in\nsingle-label evaluation and reveal that modern DNNs have stronger multi-label\ncapabilities than standard metrics suggest.",

IR agents are typically implemented through Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL), because DRL is inherently compatible with the\ndynamic nature of IR. However, DRL is currently not perfect for IR. Due to the\nlarge action space and sample inefficiency problem, training DRL recommender\nagents is challenging. The key point is that useful features cannot be\nextracted as high-quality representations for the recommender agent to optimize\nits policy. To tackle this problem, we propose Contrastive Representation for\nInteractive Recommendation (CRIR). CRIR efficiently extracts latent, high-level\npreference ranking features from explicit interaction, and leverages the\nfeatures to enhance users' representation. Specifically, the CRIR provides\nrepresentation through one representation network, and refines it through our\nproposed Preference Ranking Contrastive Learning (PRCL). The key insight of\nPRCL is that it can perform contrastive learning without relying on\ncomputations involving high-level representations or large potential action\nsets. Furthermore, we also propose a data exploiting mechanism and an agent\ntraining mechanism to better adapt CRIR to the DRL backbone.

In each iteration, this\nmethod randomly selects a block and approximately solves a strongly convex\nregularized quadratic subproblem, utilizing second-order information from the\nsmooth component of the objective function. A backtracking line search is\nemployed to ensure the monotonicity of the objective value. We demonstrate that\nunder certain sampling assumption, the fundamental convergence results of our\nproposed stochastic method are in accordance with the corresponding results for\nthe inexact proximal Newton method. We study the convergence of the sequence of\nexpected objective values and the convergence of the sequence of expected\nresidual mapping norms under various sampling assumptions. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a method that employs the unit step size in conjunction with the\nLipschitz constant of the gradient of the smooth component to formulate the\nstrongly convex regularized quadratic subproblem. In addition to establishing\nthe global convergence rate, we also provide a local convergence analysis for\nthis method under certain sampling assumption and the higher-order metric\nsubregularity of the residual mapping. To the best knowledge of the authors,\nthis is the first stochastic second-order algorithm with a superlinear local\nconvergence rate for addressing nonconvex composite optimization problems.\nFinally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and\nconvergence of the proposed algorithm.",

To address the above\nproblem, we are the first to propose a practical SCA recommendation approach\nvia preference mining, which aims to select the most effective SCA for a given\nproject. Specifically, our approach performs the SCA effectiveness evaluation\nto obtain the correspondingly optimal SCAs on projects under test.\nSubsequently, our approach performs the SCA preference mining via the project\ncharacteristics, thereby analyzing the intrinsic relation between projects\nunder test and the correspondingly optimal SCAs. Finally, our approach\nconstructs the SCA recommendation model based on the evaluation data and the\nassociated analysis findings. We conduct the experimental evaluation on three\npopular SCAs as well as 213 open-source and large-scale projects.

This process typically involves three phases: Status updating, user\naccessing, and user requesting.

Therefore, this paper introduces a\nnovel metric, TPAoI, aimed at optimizing update decisions by measuring the\nfreshness of service status. The stochastic nature of edge environments,\ncharacterized by unpredictable communication delays in updating, requesting,\nand user access times, poses a significant challenge when modeling.

Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed TPAoI metric effectively minimizes\nAoI, ensuring timely and reliable service updates in dynamic edge environments.\nResults indicate that TPAoI reduces AoI by an average of 47\\% compared to QAoI\nmetrics and decreases update frequency by an average of 48\\% relative to\nconventional AoI metrics, showing significant improvement.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach\nfor high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous\nVAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods\nemployed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel\ngenerative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which\nenhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism,\nthereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively\nintroducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and\nencoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM\nfacilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process\niteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the\ninitial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning\nwith GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior\nperformance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few\ninference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure\nhigh-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of\nhigh-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization\nstrategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work\nwill contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal\ngeneration, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as\nimages, videos, and audio with text.

In this work, we\ncompare the performance of commonly used reference-based and reference-free\nimage quality metrics on a unique dataset with real motion artifacts. We\nfurther analyze the image quality metrics' robustness to typical pre-processing\ntechniques.\n  Methods: We compared five reference-based and five reference-free image\nquality metrics on data acquired with and without intentional motion (2D and 3D\nsequences). The metrics were recalculated seven times with varying\npre-processing steps. The anonymized images were rated by radiologists and\nradiographers on a 1-5 Likert scale. Spearman correlation coefficients were\ncomputed to assess the relationship between image quality metrics and observer\nscores.\n  Results: All reference-based image quality metrics showed strong correlation\nwith observer assessments, with minor performance variations across sequences.\nAmong reference-free metrics, Average Edge Strength offers the most promising\nresults, as it consistently displayed stronger correlations across all\nsequences compared to the other reference-free metrics. Overall, the strongest\ncorrelation was achieved with percentile normalization and restricting the\nmetric values to the skull-stripped brain region. In contrast, correlations\nwere weaker when not applying any brain mask and using min-max or no\nnormalization.\n  Conclusion: Reference-based metrics reliably correlate with radiological\nevaluation across different sequences and datasets. Pre-processing steps,\nparticularly normalization and brain masking, significantly influence the\ncorrelation values.

Specifically, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Sequential\nRecommendation framework, named RaSeRec, the main idea of which is to maintain\na dynamic memory bank to accommodate preference drifts and retrieve relevant\nmemories to augment user modeling explicitly. It consists of two stages: (i)\ncollaborative-based pre-training, which learns to recommend and retrieve; (ii)\nretrieval-augmented fine-tuning, which learns to leverage retrieved memories.\nExtensive experiments on three datasets fully demonstrate the superiority and\neffectiveness of RaSeRec.

The advantages of using crossover\nare hardly understood and rigorous runtime analyses with crossover are lagging\nfar behind its use in practice, specifically in the case of more than two\nobjectives. We present two many-objective problems $RR_{\\text{RO}}$ and\n$uRR_{\\text{RO}}$ together with a theoretical runtime analysis of the GSEMO and\nthe widely used NSGA-III algorithm to demonstrate that one point crossover on\n$RR_{\\text{RO}}$, as well as uniform crossover on $uRR_{\\text{RO}}$, can yield\nan exponential speedup in the runtime. In particular, when the number of\nobjectives is constant, this algorithms can find the Pareto set of both\nproblems in expected polynomial time when using crossover while without\ncrossover they require exponential time to even find a single Pareto-optimal\npoint. For both problems, we also demonstrate a significant performance gap in\ncertain superconstant parameter regimes for the number of objectives. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is one of the first rigorous runtime analysis in\nmany-objective optimization which demonstrates an exponential performance gap\nwhen using crossover for more than two objectives.

    "abstract": "Nanopositioning systems frequently encounter limitations in control bandwidth\ndue to their lightly damped resonance behavior. This paper presents a novel\nNon-Minimum-Phase Resonant Controller (NRC) aimed at active damping control\nwithin dual closed-loop architectures, specifically applied to piezo-actuated\nnanopositioning systems. The control strategy is structured around formulated\nobjectives for shaping sensitivity functions to meet predetermined system\nperformance criteria. Leveraging non-minimum-phase characteristics, the\nproposed NRC accomplishes complete damping and the bifurcation of double\nresonant poles at the primary resonance peak through a constant-gain design\naccompanied by tunable phase variation. The NRC demonstrates robustness against\nfrequency variations of the resonance arising from load changes and is also\ncapable of damping higher-order flexural modes simultaneously. Furthermore, by\nestablishing high gains at low frequencies within the inner closed-loop and\nintegrating it with a conventional PI tracking controller, the NRC achieves\nsubstantial dual closed-loop bandwidths that can exceed the first resonance\nfrequency. Moreover, the NRC significantly diminishes the effect of\nlow-frequency reference signals on real feedback errors while effectively\nrejecting disturbances proximate to the resonance frequency. All contributions\nare thoroughly formulated and exemplified mathematically, with the controller's\nperformance confirmed through an experimental setup utilizing an industrial\nnanopositioning system. The experimental results indicate dual closed-loop\nbandwidths of 895 Hz and 845 Hz, characterized by $\\pm$3 dB and $\\pm$1 dB\nbounds, respectively, that surpass the resonance frequency of 739 Hz.",

The spin-orbit duality\nis a holographic map that projects a massive theory in four-dimensional flat\nspacetime onto the three-dimensional $\\mathbb{S}^2\\times\\mathbb{R}$ null\ninfinity. This cylinder has radius $R\\sim1/m$ and, quantum-mechanically, its\nvacuum state is a fuzzy sphere. Progress shows that, first, this duality\nrealizes the Hopf map, a fact manifest on the superparticle. Secondly, the bulk\nPoincar\\`e group transforms into the conformal group on the cylinder. In fact,\nthe general version of the duality yields that the dual symmetries include the\nBMS group, as is appropriate at null infinity. As an example, the Landau levels\nin $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are shown to match those of a Dirac monopole on the dual\n$\\mathbb{S}^2$, in the thermodynamic limit. This dual system is actually\nidentified with a three-dimensional critical Ising model. The map is then\nrealized on $N_f$ massive fermions in flat space which, indeed, are the\nhologram of $2N_f$ massless fermions on the cylinder. However, the dual space\nis really the conformal class of $\\mathbb{S}^2\\times\\mathbb{R}$, naturally\nenclosing the universal cover of a conformally compactified AdS$_4$ spacetime.\nWe argue that, in the absence of interactions, the massless fermions on the\nconformal boundary are in turn dual to $N_f$ massive fermions in AdS$_4$. For\nfree fermions, all path integrals $-$the ones in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ and\n$\\mathbb{S}^2\\times\\mathbb{R}$ and AdS$_4-$ are shown to match. Hence, AdS/CFT\nduality emerges into a larger context, where one holography nests inside the\nother, suggesting a complete holographic bridge between fields in flat space\nand the AdS superstring.",

The highest precision is 51.14 for complete triples and\n69.32 for triple elements when tested on single utterances. However, scores for\nconversational triples that span multiple turns are much lower, showing that\nextracting knowledge from true conversational data is much more challenging.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear structural analyses in engineering often require extensive finite\nelement simulations, limiting their applicability in design optimization,\nuncertainty quantification, and real-time control. Conventional deep learning\nsurrogates, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), physics-informed\nneural networks (PINNs), and fourier neural operators (FNOs), face challenges\nwith complex non-parametric three-dimensional (3D) geometries, directionally\nvarying loads, and high-fidelity predictions on unstructured meshes. This work\npresents Point-DeepONet, an operator-learning-based surrogate that integrates\nPointNet into the DeepONet framework. By directly processing non-parametric\npoint clouds and incorporating signed distance functions (SDF) for geometric\ncontext, Point-DeepONet accurately predicts three-dimensional displacement and\nvon Mises stress fields without mesh parameterization or retraining. Trained\nusing only about 5,000 nodes (2.5% of the original 200,000-node mesh),\nPoint-DeepONet can still predict the entire mesh at high fidelity, achieving a\ncoefficient of determination reaching 0.987 for displacement and 0.923 for von\nMises stress under a horizontal load case. Compared to nonlinear finite element\nanalyses that require about 19.32 minutes per case, Point-DeepONet provides\npredictions in mere seconds-approximately 400 times faster-while maintaining\nexcellent scalability and accuracy with increasing dataset sizes.

However, a core challenge that\npersists over the long term pertains to refining the exchange-correlation (XC)\napproximation. This approximation significantly influences the triumphs and\nshortcomings observed in DFT applications. Nonetheless, a prevalent issue among\nXC approximations is the presence of systematic errors, stemming from\ndeviations from the mathematical properties of the exact XC functional. For\nexample, although both B3LYP and DM21 (DeepMind 21) exhibit improvements over\nprevious benchmarks, there is still potential for further refinement. In this\npaper, we propose a strategy for enhancing XC approximations by estimating the\nneural uncertainty of the XC functional, named Residual XC-Uncertain\nFunctional. Specifically, our approach involves training a neural network to\npredict both the mean and variance of the XC functional, treating it as a\nGaussian distribution. To ensure stability in each sampling point, we construct\nthe mean by combining traditional XC approximations with our neural\npredictions, mitigating the risk of divergence or vanishing values. It is\ncrucial to highlight that our methodology excels particularly in cases where\nsystematic errors are pronounced. Empirical outcomes from three benchmark tests\nsubstantiate the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art\nmethods.

Compared to\nother ambient-pressure superconductors, such as copper-oxide and\niron-oxypnictides, unraveling the mechanisms of the pressure-induced\nsuperconductivity poses significant and unique challenges. A critical factor in\nthis phenomenon seems to be related to the electronic configuration of 3d\norbitals, which may play a fundamental role in driving high-Tc\nsuperconductivity. However, the pressure effects on the mixed-valence states of\n3d-orbital cations and their influence on the emergence of high-Tc\nsuperconductivity remain poorly understood. Here, we use high-pressure (P) and\nlow-temperature synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the\ninfluence of pressure on the mean valence change of Ni ions in\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our results demonstrate that at a low-temperature of 20 K,\nthe mean valence remains relatively stable across the pressures range from 1\natm to 40 GPa. Based on analyzing the absorption data, we find that, at a\ncritical pressure, the ambient-pressure ordered phases disappear and both the\nstructural and the superconducting phase transition occur. The pressure-induced\nstructural phase transition revealed by our absorption results is consistent\nwith that determined by X-ray diffraction, offering new information for a\ncomprehensive understanding on the pressure-induced superconductivity in\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.",

Keeping this in mind,\nthe formulation and simulation of the predator prey scavenger model is\nintroduced in this paper. For the predation response, respective prey species\nare assumed to have Holling's functional response of type III.

After simulations, the American forest dataset\nis taken for parameter estimation which imitates the real-world case.

We predict a correction to the crystal\nstructure, which is formed by an H3S lattice and CH4 molecules, the phonon\nspectra, and the pressure-dependent superconducting critical temperatures,\nwhich have been estimated in previous calculations without considering ionic\nfluctuations on the crystal structure and assuming the harmonic approximation\nfor the lattice dynamics. Our results show that quantum ionic fluctuations have\nan impact on the distance between H atoms and S atoms in the H3S host lattice,\npushing it towards more symmetric bonds, while the methane molecules are barely\naffected. According to our anharmonic phonon spectra, this structure is\ndynamically stable above 150 GPa, which is 30 GPa lower than the pressure at\nwhich the harmonic approximation predicts the emergence of an instability. As a\nconsequence of the strong anharmonic enhancement of the phonon frequencies, the\nelectron-phonon coupling constant is suppressed by 46% at 200 GPa, and even\nmore at lower pressures. As a result, the superconducting critical temperature\nis overestimated by around 50 K at 200 GPa, such that it falls below 150 K in\nthe whole pressure range studied.

Utilizing the $d$-level manifold, however, requires high-speed gate\noperations because of the stronger decoherence at higher levels. While\nanalytical control methods have proven effective for qubits in achieving fast\ngates with minimal control errors, their extension to qudits is nontrivial due\nto the increased complexity of the energy level structure arising from\nadditional ancillary states. In this work, we present a universal pulse\nconstruction for generating rapid, high-fidelity unitary rotations between\nadjacent qudit levels, thereby providing a prescription for any gate in\n$SU(d)$. Control errors in these operations are effectively analyzed within a\nfour-level subspace, including two leakage levels with approximately opposite\ndetuning. By identifying the optimal degrees of freedom, we derive concise\nanalytical pulse schemes that suppress multiple control errors and outperform\nexisting methods. Remarkably, our approach achieves consistent coherent error\nscaling across all levels, approaching the quantum speed limit independently of\nparameter variations between levels. Validation on transmon circuits\ndemonstrates significant improvements in gate fidelity for various qudit sizes\naiming for $10^{-4}$ error.

Building\non the recently proposed \"extremum encoding\" compression-estimation scheme, we\naddress the critical extension to complex-valued signals, suitable for\nradio-frequency (RF) baseband processing. This extension introduces new\nchallenges, e.g., due to unknown phase of the signal of interest and random\nphase of the noise, rendering a na\\\"ive application of the original scheme\ninapplicable and irrelevant. In the face of these challenges, we propose a\njudiciously adapted, though natural, extension of the scheme, paving its way to\nRF applications. While our extension leads to a different statistical analysis,\nincluding extremes of non-Gaussian distributions, we show that, ultimately, its\nasymptotic behavior is akin to the original scheme. We derive an exponentially\ntight upper bound on its error probability, corroborate our results via\nsimulation experiments, and demonstrate the superior performance compared to\ntwo benchmark approaches.",

To this end, we propose Collective Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(CoMCTS), a new learning-to-reason method for MLLMs, which introduces the\nconcept of collective learning into ``tree search'' for effective and efficient\nreasoning-path searching and learning. The core idea of CoMCTS is to leverage\ncollective knowledge from multiple models to collaboratively conjecture, search\nand identify effective reasoning paths toward correct answers via four\niterative operations including Expansion, Simulation and Error Positioning,\nBackpropagation, and Selection. Using CoMCTS, we construct Mulberry-260k, a\nmultimodal dataset with a tree of rich, explicit and well-defined reasoning\nnodes for each question. With Mulberry-260k, we perform collective SFT to train\nour model, Mulberry, a series of MLLMs with o1-like step-by-step Reasoning and\nReflection capabilities.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised graph representation learning (SSGRL) is a representation\nlearning paradigm used to reduce or avoid manual labeling. An essential part of\nSSGRL is graph data augmentation. Existing methods usually rely on heuristics\ncommonly identified through trial and error and are effective only within some\napplication domains. Also, it is not clear why one heuristic is better than\nanother. Moreover, recent studies have argued against some techniques (e.g.,\ndropout: that can change the properties of molecular graphs or destroy relevant\nsignals for graph-based document classification tasks).\n  In this study, we propose a novel data-driven SSGRL approach that\nautomatically learns a suitable graph augmentation from the signal encoded in\nthe graph (i.e., the nodes' predictive feature and topological information). We\npropose two complementary approaches that produce learnable feature and\ntopological augmentations. The former learns multi-view augmentation of node\nfeatures, and the latter learns a high-order view of the topology. Moreover,\nthe augmentations are jointly learned with the representation. Our approach is\ngeneral that it can be applied to homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. We\nperform extensive experiments on node classification (using nine homogeneous\nand heterogeneous datasets) and graph property prediction (using another eight\ndatasets). The results show that the proposed method matches or outperforms the\nSOTA SSGRL baselines and performs similarly to semi-supervised methods.

Specifically, this closed-loop construction optimizes the\ninherited signal constellation from the media, achieving a significantly larger\nminimum pairwise Euclidean distance than the original configuration. The\ninitial signal constellation, derived from the media, is used to compute a set\nof complex weights for all activation patterns of the RF mirrors. These complex\nweights are then fed back to the transmitter to refine the transmit signal\nbefore it reaches the mirrors. This feedback mechanism ensures that the\nreceived, shaped signal constellation retains improved properties, enabling\nmore reliable transmission.

However, many\nhumanoid robots, such as Pepper, Nao, and Furhat, lack full-body tactile skin,\nlimiting their ability to engage in touch-based emotional and gesture\ninteractions. In addition, vision-based emotion recognition methods usually\nface strict GDPR compliance challenges due to the need to collect personal\nfacial data. To address these limitations and avoid privacy issues, this paper\nstudies the potential of using the sounds produced by touching during HRI to\nrecognise tactile gestures and classify emotions along the arousal and valence\ndimensions. Using a dataset of tactile gestures and emotional interactions from\n28 participants with the humanoid robot Pepper, we design an audio-only\nlightweight touch gesture and emotion recognition model with only 0.24M\nparameters, 0.94MB model size, and 0.7G FLOPs.

Conventional methods for actuating suspended membranes, however,\ncannot be applied to all 2D materials, or are limited in frequency. There is,\ntherefore, a need for a universal high-frequency, on-chip actuation technique\nthat can be applied to all types of membranes. Here, we demonstrate that\nsurface acoustic waves (SAWs) can be used to efficiently actuate suspended 2D\nmaterials by exciting suspended graphene membranes with high-frequency (375\nMHz) Rayleigh surface waves and mapping the resulting vibration field with\natomic force acoustic microscopy (AFAM). Acoustic waves travelling from\nsupported to suspended graphene experience a reduction in acoustic wavelength\nfrom 10 \\mu m to ~2 \\mu um due to the decrease in effective bending rigidity,\nleading to a decrease in wave velocity on suspended graphene. By varying the\nexcitation frequency, we observed a change in phase velocity from ~160 m/s to\n~700 m/s. This behavior is consistent with the nonlinear dispersion of acoustic\nwaves, as predicted by plate theory, in suspended graphene membranes. The\ngeometry and bending rigidity of the membrane thus play key roles in modulating\nthe acoustic wave pattern and wavelength. This combined SAW actuation and AFAM\nvisualization scheme can give new insights into the fundamentals of acoustic\ntransport at the nanoscale limit and provides a route towards the manipulation\nof localized wavefields for on-chip patterning and transport over 2D materials\nsurfaces.",

    "abstract": "The primary aim of these lecture notes is to introduce the modern approach to\ntwo-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT). The study of analytical\nmethods in two-dimensional conformal field theory has developed over several\ndecades, starting with BPZ. The development of analytical methods, particularly\nin rational conformal field theory (RCFT), has been remarkable, with complete\nclassifications achieved for certain model groups. One motivation for studying\nCFT comes from its ability to describe quantum critical systems. Given that\nrealistic quantum critical systems are fundamentally RCFTs, it is somewhat\nnatural that the analytical methods of RCFT have evolved significantly.\n  CFTs other than RCFTs are called irrational conformal field theories (ICFTs).\nCompared to RCFTs, the study of ICFTs has not progressed as much. Leaving aside\nwhether there is physical motivation or not, ICFTs inherently possess a\ndifficulty that makes them challenging to approach. However, with the\ndevelopment of quantum gravity, the advancement of analytical methods for ICFTs\nhas become essential. The reason lies in the AdS/CFT correspondence. AdS/CFT\nrefers to the relationship between $d+1$ dimensional quantum gravity and $d$\ndimensional CFT. Within this correspondence, the CFT appears as a\nnon-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity. Except in special cases, this\nCFT belongs to ICFT. Against this backdrop, the methods for ICFTs have\ndeveloped rapidly in recent years. Many of these ICFT methods are indispensable\nfor modern quantum gravity research. Unfortunately, these cannot be learned\nfrom textbooks on 2D CFTs, such as Yellow book. These lecture notes aim to fill\nthis gap. Specifically, we will cover techniques that have already been applied\nin many studies, such as HHLL block and monodromy method, and significant\nresults that have become proper nouns, such as Hellerman bound and HKS bound.",

In this work, we present an optimized\nexact multi-target search algorithm based on the modified Grover's algorithm by\ntransforming the canonical diffusion operator to a more efficient diffusion\noperator, which can solve the multi-target search problem with a 100% success\nrate while requiring fewer gate counts and shallower circuit depth. After that,\nthe optimized multi-target algorithm for four different items, including\n2-qubit with 2 targets, 5-qubit with 2 targets, 5-qubit with 4 targets, and\n6-qubit with 3 targets, are implemented on MindSpore framework. The\nexperimental results show that, compared with Grover's algorithm and the\nmodified Grover's algorithm, the proposed algorithm can reduce the quantum gate\ncount by at least 21.1% and the depth of the quantum circuit by at least 11.4%\nand maintain a 100% success probability.

The idea\nis illustrated in a model of a correlated spin glass for which magnetic\nanisotropies are present but they are completely frustrated by disorder. The\nlow-energy spectrum is dominated by soft modes corresponding to propagating\nHalperin-Saslow spin waves at short wavelengths, evolving into a relaxation and\na diffuson mode at the long wavelengths. The latter gives rise to an anomalous\ntemperature behavior of the specific heat at $T\\ll T_{*}$: $C\\sim T$ in $d=3$\nsolids, $C\\sim T\\ln(1/T)$ in $d=2$. The temperature scale $T_{*}$ has a\nnon-trivial dependence on the damping coefficient describing magnetic friction,\nwhich can be related to fluctuations of the spin-torque operator via a\nGreen-Kubo formula. Halperin-Saslow modes can also become diffusive due to\ndisclination motion (plastic flow).

    "abstract": "Understanding how humans cooperatively utilize semantic knowledge to explore\nunfamiliar environments and decide on navigation directions is critical for\nhouse service multi-robot systems. Previous methods primarily focused on\nsingle-robot centralized planning strategies, which severely limited\nexploration efficiency. Recent research has considered decentralized planning\nstrategies for multiple robots, assigning separate planning models to each\nrobot, but these approaches often overlook communication costs. In this work,\nwe propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Co-Navigation (MCoCoNav), a modular\napproach that utilizes multimodal Chain-of-Thought to plan collaborative\nsemantic navigation for multiple robots. MCoCoNav combines visual perception\nwith Vision Language Models (VLMs) to evaluate exploration value through\nprobabilistic scoring, thus reducing time costs and achieving stable outputs.\nAdditionally, a global semantic map is used as a communication bridge,\nminimizing communication overhead while integrating observational results.\nGuided by scores that reflect exploration trends, robots utilize this map to\nassess whether to explore new frontier points or revisit history nodes.\nExperiments on HM3D_v0.2 and MP3D demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach.

Traditional\nevaluation methods for these comments, primarily based on text similarity, face\ntwo major challenges: inconsistent reliability of human-authored comments in\nopen-source projects and the weak correlation of text similarity with\nobjectives like enhancing code quality and detecting defects.\n  This study empirically analyzes benchmark comments using a novel set of\ncriteria informed by prior research and developer interviews. We then similarly\nrevisit the evaluation of existing methodologies. Our evaluation framework,\nDeepCRCEval, integrates human evaluators and Large Language Models (LLMs) for a\ncomprehensive reassessment of current techniques based on the criteria set.\nBesides, we also introduce an innovative and efficient baseline, LLM-Reviewer,\nleveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for a target-oriented\ncomparison.\n  Our research highlights the limitations of text similarity metrics, finding\nthat less than 10% of benchmark comments are high quality for automation. In\ncontrast, DeepCRCEval effectively distinguishes between high and low-quality\ncomments, proving to be a more reliable evaluation mechanism. Incorporating LLM\nevaluators into DeepCRCEval significantly boosts efficiency, reducing time and\ncost by 88.78% and 90.32%, respectively.

Here, we investigate a\nminimal model of a driven-dissipative quantum reservoir described by two\ncoupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, an experimentally realizable platform that\nfeatures controllable coupling, intrinsic nonlinearity, and tunable photon\nloss. Using Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we examine how different\ndynamical regimes encode input drive signals in terms of redundancy\n(information shared by each oscillator) and synergy (information accessible\nonly through their joint observation). Our key results show that, near a\ncritical point marking a dynamical bifurcation, the system transitions from\npredominantly redundant to synergistic encoding. We further demonstrate that\nsynergy amplifies short-term responsiveness, thereby enhancing immediate memory\nretention, whereas strong dissipation leads to more redundant encoding that\nsupports long-term memory retention. These findings elucidate how the interplay\nof instability and dissipation shapes information processing in small quantum\nsystems, providing a fine-grained, information-theoretic perspective for\nanalyzing and designing QRC platforms.",

These features\ndistinguish chiral crystals from their non-chiral counterparts, leading to the\nemergence of net angular momentum, as predicted analytically. This angular\nmomentum, driven by the torque generated by the chiral active force, exhibits a\nnon-monotonic dependence on the degree of chirality. Additionally, it\ncontributes to the entropy production rate, as revealed through a path-integral\nanalysis. We investigate the dynamic properties of the crystal in both Fourier\nand real space.

    "abstract": "Attention mechanism has been extensively integrated within mainstream neural\nnetwork architectures, such as Transformers and graph attention networks. Yet,\nits underlying working principles remain somewhat elusive. What is its essence?\nAre there any connections between it and traditional machine learning\nalgorithms? In this study, we inspect the process of computing similarity using\nclassic metrics and vector space properties in manifold learning, clustering,\nand supervised learning. We identify the key characteristics of similarity\ncomputation and information propagation in these methods and demonstrate that\nthe self-attention mechanism in deep learning adheres to the same principles\nbut operates more flexibly and adaptively. We decompose the self-attention\nmechanism into a learnable pseudo-metric function and an information\npropagation process based on similarity computation. We prove that the\nself-attention mechanism converges to a drift-diffusion process through\ncontinuous modeling provided the pseudo-metric is a transformation of a metric\nand certain reasonable assumptions hold. This equation could be transformed\ninto a heat equation under a new metric. In addition, we give a first-order\nanalysis of attention mechanism with a general pseudo-metric function. This\nstudy aids in understanding the effects and principle of attention mechanism\nthrough physical intuition. Finally, we propose a modified attention mechanism\ncalled metric-attention by leveraging the concept of metric learning to\nfacilitate the ability to learn desired metrics more effectively. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that it outperforms self-attention regarding training\nefficiency, accuracy, and robustness.",

The skip-connections\ntransmit fine-grained information from the encoder to the decoder. It is\nnecessary to maintain the feature maps used by the skip-connections in memory\nbefore the decoding stage. Therefore, they are not friendly to devices with\nlimited resource.

To this end, we design a simple but effective\nMulti-Scale Information Aggregation Module (MSIAM) in the encoder and an\nInformation Enhancement Module (IEM) in the decoder. The MSIAM aggregates\nmulti-scale feature maps into single-scale with less memory. After that, the\naggregated feature maps can be expanded and enhanced to multi-scale feature\nmaps by the IEM. By applying the proposed method on NAFNet, a SOTA model in the\nfield of image restoration, we design a memory-efficient and feature-enhanced\nnetwork architecture, UNet--. The memory demand by the skip-connections in the\nUNet-- is reduced by 93.3%, while the performance is improved compared to\nNAFNet.

Learning to\nengineer protein flexibility is problematic because the available data are\nscarce, heterogeneous, and costly to obtain using computational as well as\nexperimental methods.

We overcome the data scarcity issue by leveraging a pre-trained\nprotein language model.

A recent study leverages the idea that VLMs implicitly learn\ncompositional structures of semantic concepts within the image. Instead of\nusing an individual region embedding, it utilizes a bag of region embeddings as\na new representation to incorporate compositional structures into the OVD task.\nHowever, this approach often fails to capture the contextual concepts of each\nregion, leading to noisy compositional structures. This results in only\nmarginal performance improvements and reduced efficiency. To address this, we\npropose a novel concept-based alignment method that samples a more powerful and\nefficient compositional structure.

The ground states of 1,389\neven-even nuclei are generated. To quantify the nonuniformity of these density\ndistributions, a ``generalized bubble parameter\" is introduced.\n  Results: We find that the bubble structure appears around the magic numbers,\nwhich correspond to the regions where the s orbit appears near the Fermi\nsurface. The nuclear deformation and pairing correlations strongly affect the\noccupation probability, but the robust bubble structure of a medium mass\nnucleus, $^{100}$Sn, is found. We confirm that the Coulomb force enhances the\nbubble degree in the superheavy region. The nuclear non-uniformity is further\ngeneralized by the ``multi-layered\" bubble structure, which exhibits some\ndensity depression in the internal regions of the density distributions.\n  Conclusion: The non-uniformity of the internal density distribution occurs\ndue to the deficiency of the specific single-particle orbits: the nodal $s$,\n$p$, and $d$ orbits. This is certainly reflected in the density distribution\nnear the nuclear surface, which can be deduced from proton-elastic scattering.",

For homogeneous graphs, the\nlatest works use original node features to synthesize a similarity graph that\ncan correct the structure of the noised graph. This idea is based on the\nhomogeneity assumption, which states that similar nodes in the homogeneous\ngraph tend to have direct links in the original graph. However, similar nodes\nin heterogeneous graphs usually do not have direct links, which can not be used\nto correct the original noise graph. This causes a significant challenge in\nnoised heterogeneous graph learning. To this end, this paper proposes a novel\nsynthesized similarity-based graph neural network compatible with noised\nheterogeneous graph learning. First, we calculate the original feature\nsimilarities of all nodes to synthesize a similarity-based high-order graph.\nSecond, we propose a similarity-aware encoder to embed original and synthesized\ngraphs with shared parameters. Then, instead of graph-to-graph supervising, we\nsynchronously supervise the original and synthesized graph embeddings to\npredict the same labels.

Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on\ntensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT\ndecomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for\nhigh-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) has recently\nachieved an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space\ncomplexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtain decomposition matrices\nfor ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by\nconstructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via\nperforming chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the\nparentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices\nis an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product\nspace and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete\northogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set\n(Pearce-Crump, 2023b), through this path matrices technique. Our method avoids\nthe RREF algorithm and maintains a fully analytical derivation of each ICT\ndecomposition matrix, thereby significantly improving the algorithm's speed to\nobtain arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal\nequivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product\nand direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while\nkeeping symmetry.

However, a major performance bottleneck remains,\nbecause of the very large number of features that ML models may possess, in\nparticular for deep neural networks. This paper proposes novel algorithms to\ncompute the so-called contrastive explanations for ML models with a large\nnumber of features, by leveraging on adversarial robustness. Furthermore, the\npaper also proposes novel algorithms for listing explanations and finding\nsmallest contrastive explanations. The experimental results demonstrate the\nperformance gains achieved by the novel algorithms proposed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "We consider a mathematical model of cancer cell invasion of the extracellular\nmatrix (ECM), comprising a strongly degenerate parabolic partial differential\nequation for the cell volume fraction, coupled with an ordinary differential\nequation for the ECM volume fraction. The model captures the intricate link\nbetween the dynamics of invading cancer cells and the surrounding ECM. First,\nmigrating cells undergo haptotaxis, i.e., movement up ECM density gradients.\nSecondly, cancer cells degrade the ECM fibers by means of membrane-bound\nproteases. Finally, their migration speed is modulated by the ECM pore sizes,\nresulting in the saturation or even interruption of cell motility both at high\nand low ECM densities. The inclusion of the physical limits of cell migration\nresults in two regimes of degeneracy of the nonlinear diffusion and haptotaxis\nterms. We devise specific estimates that are compatible with the strong\ndegeneracy of the equation, focusing on the vacuum present at low ECM\ndensities.

To guide the optimization, we develop two objective functions\nbased on measurement outcomes in the computational basis. The first objective\nfunction utilizes global computational basis probabilities, with the optimized\nvalue directly yielding the purity of the input state.

Beyond crystalline solids, they can\nbe created as optically induced or technologically fabricated structures in\nphotonic and phononic systems, as potentials for cold atoms and Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs). On a parwith the unusual structural properties of\nquasicrystals, nowadays the problem of wave propagation in such two-dimensional\nstructures attracts considerable attention, already in earlier studies it was\npredicted that the lowest electronic states in five-fold quasicrystals are\nlocalized. Later on localization of BECs in an eight-fold rotational symmetric\nquasicrystal optical lattices was observed. Direct observation of localization\nin purely linear photonic quasicrystals, therefore, remains elusive. Here,\nusing sets of interfering plane waves, we create photonic two-dimensional\nquasicrystals with different rotational symmetries, not allowed in periodic\ncrystallographic structures. We demonstrate experimentally that linear\nlocalization of light does occur even in clean linear quasicrystals for probe\nbeams propagating both in the center and off-center regions of the\nquasicrystals. We found that light localization occurs above a critical depth\nof optically induced potential and that this critical depth rapidly decreases\nwith the increase of the order of the discrete rotational symmetry of the\nquasicrystal. Our results clarify a long-standing problem of wave localization\nin linear quasicrystals and elucidate the conditions under which this\nphenomenon occurs.

The form of the PDF is chosen to capture observations regarding the\nmicrostructure in sheared suspensions of rough particles, as reported in the\nliterature. Specifically, a hydrodynamic roughness value is used to represent\nthe width of the anisotropic region, and within this region the concentration\nof particles is higher in the compression zone than expansion zone. By\nnumerically evaluating the hydrodynamic particle interactions and calculating\nthe various shear and normal viscosities, the stress closure is incorporated\ninto Harvie's volume-averaged MF framework, referred to as the MF-roughness\nmodel. Using multi-dimensional simulations the roughness and compression zone\nPDF concentration are then globally optimised to reproduce benchmark solid and\nvelocity distributions reported in the literature for a variety of semi-dilute\nmonodisperse suspension flows occurring within rectangular channels. For\ncomparison, two different versions of the phenomenological stress closure by\nMorris and Boulay (1999) are additionally proposed as fully tensorial\nframe-invariant alternatives to the MF-roughness model.

However, most existing\nGNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures\nand learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance\nof the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually\nrely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or\ntoo labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs)\nto automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world\nknowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally\nsuffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking\ncontextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we\nintroduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs\nfor recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user\npreference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we\nemploy vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic\nvectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the\nuser/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We\nfurther design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the\nsemantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and\ncompatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph\ncompared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei\nadvertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31%\nimprovement on eCPM in the online A/B test.

The core concept revolves around\nusing the evolution operator for the Ising model as the quantum oracle within\nGrover's search. This operator induces phase shifts for the eigenstates of the\nIsing Hamiltonian, with the most pronounced shifts occurring for the lowest and\nhighest energy states. Determining these states for a disordered Ising\nHamiltonian using classical methods presents an exponentially complex challenge\nwith respect to the number of spins (or qubits) involved.

In practice, MLL datasets are often class-imbalanced, making it\ninherently challenging, a problem that is even more acute in CL. Due to its\nsensitivity to imbalance, Macro-AUC is an appropriate and widely used measure\nin MLL. However, there is no research to optimize Macro-AUC in MLCL\nspecifically. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a new memory\nreplay-based method to tackle the imbalance issue for Macro-AUC-oriented MLCL.\nSpecifically, inspired by recent theory work, we propose a new Reweighted\nLabel-Distribution-Aware Margin (RLDAM) loss. Furthermore, to be compatible\nwith the RLDAM loss, a new memory-updating strategy named Weight Retain\nUpdating (WRU) is proposed to maintain the numbers of positive and negative\ninstances of the original dataset in memory. Theoretically, we provide superior\ngeneralization analyses of the RLDAM-based algorithm in terms of Macro-AUC,\nseparately in batch MLL and MLCL settings.

We simulate the companion interaction using the Athena++ hydrodynamics\nsolver to determine the ejecta structure for a double-degenerate type Ia\nsupernova. Ejecta in the wake is of lower density and higher velocity than the\nunperturbed ejecta. We then evolve the ejecta for several thousand years using\nthe expanding-grid code Sprout. The forward shock within the wake is initially\nindented, but becomes spherical after roughly a thousand years due to\ntransverse motion of shocked ejecta that fills the wake. The reverse shock\ntravels quickly within the wake, leading to an off-center convergence of the\nreverse shock and leaving the remnant with an asymmetrical core. This also\ndraws material from the interstellar medium deep into the remnant, eventually\nreaching the center. Large Rayleigh-Taylor plumes are found around the edge of\nthe wake, creating a toroidal structure composed primarily of ejecta. Estimates\nof the thermal X-ray emission show that such remnants exhibit observable\nasymmetries for thousands of years.",

Compared to the spin Hall magnetoresistance\ninduced by a conventional relativistic spin current, the SSMR is characterized\nby unusual angular dependence with a phase-shift feature underpinned by the\nNeel-vector orientation and pronounced temperature dependence caused by its\nsusceptibility to electron scattering. Through systematical investigations on\nthe magnetoresistance of (101)-RuO2/Co bilayers, we disentangle a sizable SSMR\nand hence unveil a Neel vector along [001] direction. Our work not only\ndemonstrates a simple electric avenue to probing the Neel vector of\naltermagnets, but also indicates long-range magnetic order in thin films of\nRuO2.",

Since the most studies provide theoretical analysis\nfor clusters of spherical shape, the electron density inhomogeneities caused by\nshell effects are spherically symmetric and do not provide long range\nelectrostatic fields. However, similar shell structure should exist in a\nhemispherical cluster which conserves the closed periodic orbits of electrons,\nbut not the spherical symmetry of electron distribution. As a result, we\ndemonstrate that a strong electrostatic field ($E \\sim 10^8$~V/m) exists in the\nvicinity of the flat surface of an isolated, uncharged metal nanocluster of\nhemispherical shape using modern approaches for electronic structure\nevaluation. This physical phenomenon is a consequence of the large-scale\nspatial inhomogeneity in distribution of electrons related to quantum shell\neffects in submicron metal clusters, which may find numerous applications in\nvarious fields of science and technology.",

In this context, the robustness that AT achieves has\noften been assessed against unrealistic or weak adversarial attacks, which\nnegatively affect performance on clean data and are arguably no longer threats.\nPrevious work seems to suggest robustness is a task-dependent property of AT.\nWe instead argue it is a more complex problem that requires exploring AT and\nthe intertwined roles played by certain factors within data, feature\nrepresentations, classifiers, and robust optimization settings, as well as\nproper evaluation factors, such as the realism of evasion attacks, to gain a\ntrue sense of AT's effectiveness. In our paper, we address this gap by\nsystematically exploring the role such factors have in hardening malware\nclassifiers through AT. Contrary to recent prior work, a key observation of our\nresearch and extensive experiments confirm the hypotheses that all such factors\ninfluence the actual effectiveness of AT, as demonstrated by the varying\ndegrees of success from our empirical analysis.

Our goal is to develop an optimal scheduling method\nfor a large patient system to maximize expected net revenue. Methods for\nderiving optimal appointment schedules for large-scale systems often run into\ncomputational bottlenecks due to mixed-integer programming or robust\noptimization formulations and computationally complex search methods. In this\nwork, we model the system as a single-server queueing system, where patients\narrive unpunctually and follow the FIFO service discipline to see the doctor\n(i.e., get into service). Using the heavy traffic fluid approximation, we\ndevelop a deterministic control problem, referred to as the fluid control\nproblem (FCP), which serves as an asymptotic upper bound for the original\nqueueing control problem (QCP). Using the optimal solution of the FCP, we\nestablish an asymptotically optimal scheduling policy on a fluid scale. We\nfurther investigate the convergence rate of the QCP under the proposed policy.\nThe FCP, due to the incorporation of unpunctuality, is difficult to solve\nanalytically. We thus propose a time-discretized numerical scheme to\napproximately solve the FCP. The discretized FCP takes the form of a quadratic\nprogram with linear constraints. We examine the behavior of these schedules\nunder different unpunctuality assumptions and test the performance of the\nschedules on real data in a simulation study.

Current AIGC models primarily focus on\ncontent quality within a centralized framework, resulting in a high service\ndelay and negative user experiences.

    "abstract": "Coincidence time resolution (CTR) in time-of-flight positron emission\ntomography (TOF-PET) has significantly improved with advancements in\nscintillators, photodetectors, and readout electronics. Achieving a CTR of 100\nps remains challenging due to the need for sufficiently thick\nscintillators-typically 20 mm-to ensure adequate sensitivity because the photon\ntransit time spread within these thick scintillators impedes achieving 100 ps\nCTR. Therefore, thinner scintillators are preferable for CTR better than 100\nps. To address the trade-off between TOF capability and sensitivity, we propose\na readout scheme of PET detectors. The proposed scheme utilizes two\northogonally stacked one-dimensional PET detectors, enabling the thickness of\nthe scintillators to be reduced to approximately 13 mm without compromising\nsensitivity. This is achieved by stacking the detectors along the\ndepth-of-interaction (DOI) axis of a PET scanner. We refer to this design as\nthe cross-stacked detector, or xDetector. Furthermore, the xDetector inherently\nprovides DOI information using the same readout scheme. Experimental\nevaluations demonstrated that the xDetector achieved a CTR of 175 ps FWHM and\nan energy resolution of 11% FWHM at 511 keV with 3 x 3 x 12.8 mm3 lutetium\noxyorthosilicate crystals, each coupled one-to-one with silicon\nphotomultipliers. In terms of xy-spatial resolution, the xDetector exhibited an\nasymmetric resolution due to its readout scheme: one resolution was defined by\nthe 3.2 mm readout pitch, while the other was calculated using the\ncenter-of-gravity method. The xDetector effectively resolves the trade-off\nbetween TOF capability and sensitivity while offering scalability and DOI\ncapability. By integrating state-of-the-art scintillators, photodetectors, and\nreadout electronics with the xDetector scheme, achieving a CTR of 100 ps FWHM\nalongside high DOI resolution becomes a practical possibility.",

    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to integrate complementary information from\nmultiple views to enhance clustering performance. Late Fusion Multi-View\nClustering (LFMVC) has shown promise by synthesizing diverse clustering results\ninto a unified consensus. However, current LFMVC methods struggle with noisy\nand redundant partitions and often fail to capture high-order correlations\nacross views. To address these limitations, we present a novel theoretical\nframework for analyzing the generalization error bounds of multiple kernel\n$k$-means, leveraging local Rademacher complexity and principal eigenvalue\nproportions. Our analysis establishes a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/n)$,\nsignificantly improving upon the existing rate in the order of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k/n})$. Building on this insight, we propose a low-pass\ngraph filtering strategy within a multiple linear $k$-means framework to\nmitigate noise and redundancy, further refining the principal eigenvalue\nproportion and enhancing clustering accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark\ndatasets confirm that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nclustering performance and robustness.

The accumulation of magnetic\nhelicity is correlated with the non-potential magnetic field energy, which is\nreleased in the solar eruptions. Moreover, the relative magnetic helicity\nfluxes can be estimated only relying on the line-of-sight magnetic field (e.g.,\nDemoulin and Berger Sol. Phys. 215, 203, 2003). The payload Full-disk\nMagnetoGraph (FMG) on the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S)\ncurrently has been supplying the continuous evolution of line-of-sight\nmagnetograms for the solar active regions, which can be used to estimate the\nmagnetic helicity flux. In this study, we useeight hours line-of-sight\nmagnetograms of NOAA 13273, when at which the Sun-Earth direction speed of the\nsatellite is zero to avoid the oscillation of the magnetic field caused by the\nDoppler effect on polarization measurements. We obtain the helicity flux by\napplying Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and local correlation tracking (LCT)\nmethods to obtain the horizontal vector potential field and the motions of the\nine-sf-sight polarities. We also compare the helicity flux derived using data\nfrom the Heliosesmic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO) and the same method. It is found that the flux has the same\nsign and the correlation between measurements is 0.98. The difference of the\nabsolute magnetic helicity normalized to themagnetic flux is less than 4%.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) systems have evolved significantly over the\npast decade, transitioning from traditional collaborative filtering to deep\nlearning approaches and, more recently, to large language models (LLMs). While\nthe adoption of LLMs has driven substantial advancements, these models\ninherently lack collaborative filtering information, relying primarily on\ntextual content data neglecting other modalities and thus failing to achieve\noptimal recommendation performance. To address this limitation, we propose\nMolar, a Multimodal large language sequential recommendation framework that\nintegrates multiple content modalities with ID information to capture\ncollaborative signals effectively. Molar employs an MLLM to generate unified\nitem representations from both textual and non-textual data, facilitating\ncomprehensive multimodal modeling and enriching item embeddings. Additionally,\nit incorporates collaborative filtering signals through a post-alignment\nmechanism, which aligns user representations from content-based and ID-based\nmodels, ensuring precise personalization and robust performance. By seamlessly\ncombining multimodal content with collaborative filtering insights, Molar\ncaptures both user interests and contextual semantics, leading to superior\nrecommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that Molar\nsignificantly outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines, highlighting its\nstrength in utilizing multimodal data and collaborative signals for sequential\nrecommendation tasks.

To infer the thundercloud\npotential required acceleration of muons in atmospheric electric field to be\nincorporated in the Monte Carlo simulation software CORSIKA. The G3MT records\nover 4 billion muons daily that are grouped into 169 directions covering 2.3 sr\nsky.

    "abstract": "High-impact climate damages are often driven by compounding climate\nconditions. For example, elevated heat stress conditions can arise from a\ncombination of high humidity and temperature. To explore future changes in\ncompounding hazards under a range of climate scenarios and with large\nensembles, climate emulators can provide light-weight, data-driven complements\nto Earth System Models. Yet, only a few existing emulators can jointly emulate\nmultiple climate variables. In this study, we present the Multi-resolution\nEmulatoR for CompoUnd climate Risk analYsis: MERCURY. MERCURY extends\nmulti-resolution analysis to a spatio-temporal framework for versatile\nemulation of multiple variables. MERCURY leverages data-driven, image\ncompression techniques to generate emulations in a memory-efficient manner.\nMERCURY consists of a regional component that represents the monthly, regional\nresponse of a given variable to yearly Global Mean Temperature (GMT) using a\nprobabilistic regression based additive model, resolving regional\ncross-correlations. It then adapts a reverse lifting-scheme operator to jointly\nspatially disaggregate regional, monthly values to grid-cell level. We\ndemonstrate MERCURY's capabilities on representing the humid-heat metric, Wet\nBulb Globe Temperature, as derived from temperature and relative humidity\nemulations. The emulated WBGT spatial correlations correspond well to those of\nESMs and the 95% and 97.5% quantiles of WBGT distributions are well captured,\nwith an average of 5% deviation. MERCURY's setup allows for region-specific\nemulations from which one can efficiently \"zoom\" into the grid-cell level\nacross multiple variables by means of the reverse lifting-scheme operator. This\ncircumvents the traditional problem of having to emulate complete,\nglobal-fields of climate data and resulting storage requirements.",

However, fine-tuning these massive models for specific\ndownstream tasks, constraints, and human preferences remains a critical\nchallenge. While recent advances have leveraged reinforcement learning\nalgorithms to tackle this problem, much of the progress has been empirical,\nwith limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a\nstochastic control framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. Building on\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic models as the pre-trained reference dynamics,\nour approach integrates linear dynamics control with Kullback-Leibler\nregularization.

We show that PI-FT achieves global convergence at a linear\nrate.

While many works have proposed\noptimization methods to design beamformers for cell-free systems, the\nunderlying algorithms are computationally complex and potentially increase\nfronthaul link loads. To address this concern, we propose an unsupervised\nlearning algorithm to jointly design the communication and sensing beamformers\nfor cell-free ISAC system.

The proposed scheme is\ndecentralized, which can reduce the load on the central processing unit (CPU)\nand the required fronthaul links. To avoid the tradeoff problem between sensing\nand communication counterparts of the cell-free system, we first train two\nidentical models (teacher models) each biased towards one of the two tasks. A\nthird identical model (a student model) is trained based on the maximum sensing\nand communication performance information obtained by the teacher models.

By designing an adapter,\nthe framework can flexibly decompose quality factors (such as brightness,\nstructure, contrast, etc.) that best align with human visual perception and\nquantify them into discrete visual words. These visual words respond to the\nconstructed dictionary basis vector, and by obtaining the corresponding\ncoordinate vectors, we can measure visual similarity. Our method offers two key\ncontributions. First, an adaptive mechanism that extracts and decomposes\nquality factors according to human visual perception principles enhances their\nrepresentation ability through reconstruction constraints. Second, the\nconstruction of a comprehensive and discriminative dictionary space and basis\nvector allows quality factors to respond effectively to the dictionary basis\nvector and capture non-uniform distortion patterns in images, significantly\nimproving the accuracy of visual similarity measurement. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches in handling various types of distorted images.

    "abstract": "Robotic telescope networks play an important role in capturing early and\nbright optical afterglows, providing critical insights into the energetics and\nemission mechanisms of GRBs. In this study, we analyze GRB 230204B, an\nexceptionally energetic and multi-pulsed long GRB, detected by the Fermi GBM\nand MAXI detectors, with an isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energy exceeding\n10$^{54}$ erg. Time-resolved spectral analysis reveals a transition in the\nprompt emission from hard (sub-photospheric dominated) spectra during early\npulses to softer (synchrotron radiation dominated) spectra in later pulses,\nindicative of a hybrid jet composition. We report the discovery and\ncharacterization of the optical afterglow using the MASTER and BOOTES robotic\ntelescope networks, alongside long-term radio observations extending to 335\ndays post-burst with the ATCA. At ~1.3 ks post-burst, the optical luminosity\nwas exceptionally high, surpassing even other bright GRBs, such as GRB 221009A\n(the ``BOAT\"). Multi-wavelength modeling, incorporating data from MASTER,\nBOOTES, DOT, Swift/XRT, and radio observations, was conducted using an external\nISM forward-shock top-hat jet model with afterglowpy. The results reveal a\nnarrow and highly collimated jet with a circumburst density of n$_{0}$ ~ 28.12\ncm$^{-3}$, kinetic energy E$_{K}$ ~ 4.18 x 10$^{55}$ erg, and a relatively low\nvalue of $\\epsilon_{B}$ = 2.14 x 10$^{-6}$, indicating shock-compression of the\nmagnetic field in the surrounding interstellar medium. We constrained a low\nradiative efficiency of ~ 4.3 %. This study highlights the indispensable\ncontribution of robotic networks to early afterglow observations and advances\nour understanding of GRB 230204B unique characteristics and underlying jet\nphysics.",

In the\nconstruction process, we employ various strategies such as balanced prompt\nsampling and data re-annotation to ensure the diversity and reliability of our\nbenchmark. This allows us to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of\nimage-text alignment metrics for T2I models.

However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications\nfor public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating\nnarratives. Despite its importance, it remains unclear how prevalent AIGTs are\non social media. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify and monitor\nthe AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D)\nwith around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and\nReddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate\nAIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT\ndatasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark\nfor evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the\nbest-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track\nAIGTs across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024, using\nthe AI Attribution Rate (AAR) as the metric. Specifically, Medium and Quora\nexhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to\n38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR\nincreasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis\nindicates that AIGTs on social media differ from human-written texts across\nseveral dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions,\nengagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our\nanalysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future\nresearch in this domain.",

In this work, we explore\nthe evolution of line profiles in variable AGNs based on the BLR model of\nCzerny \\& Hryniewicz, where the BLR is driven by the radiation pressure acting\non dust at the surface layers of the accretion disk. The line profiles in the\nlow-Eddington-ratio regime show a double-peak profile, which will become a\nsingle peak at high Eddington ratios.

This is a fundamental\nquestion towards understanding the value of data as well as further pricing of\ndata. This paper develops an approach for capturing the instrumental value of\ndata production processes, which takes two key factors into account: (a) the\ncontext of the agent's decision-making problem; (b) prior data or information\nthe agent already possesses. We ''micro-found'' our valuation concepts by\nshowing how they connect to classic notions of information design and signals\nin information economics. When instantiated in the domain of Bayesian linear\nregression, our value naturally corresponds to information gain. Based on our\ndesigned data value, we then study a basic monopoly pricing setting with a\nbuyer looking to purchase from a seller some labeled data of a certain feature\ndirection in order to improve a Bayesian regression model. We show that when\nthe seller has the ability to fully customize any data request, she can extract\nthe first-best revenue (i.e., full surplus) from any population of buyers,\ni.e., achieving first-degree price discrimination. If the seller can only sell\ndata that are derived from an existing data pool, this limits her ability to\ncustomize, and achieving first-best revenue becomes generally impossible.\nHowever, we design a mechanism that achieves seller revenue at most $\\log\n(\\kappa)$ less than the first-best revenue, where $\\kappa$ is the condition\nnumber associated with the data matrix. A corollary of this result is that the\nseller can extract the first-best revenue in the multi-armed bandits special\ncase.",

To address these consistency requirements, we\nintroduce a novel two-stage framework named HCIIT (High-Consistency In-Image\nTranslation) which involves text-image translation using a multimodal\nmultilingual large language model in the first stage and image backfilling with\na diffusion model in the second stage. Chain of thought learning is utilized in\nthe first stage to enhance the model's ability to leverage image information\nduring translation. Subsequently, a diffusion model trained for\nstyle-consistent text-image generation ensures uniformity in text style within\nimages and preserves background details. A dataset comprising 400,000\nstyle-consistent pseudo text-image pairs is curated for model training.

A recent body of work has\nfocused on conceptualizing one particular construct from this doctrine: the\nless discriminatory alternative, an alternative policy that reduces disparities\nwhile meeting the same business needs of a status quo or baseline policy.\nHowever, attempts to operationalize this construct in the algorithmic setting\nmust grapple with some thorny challenges and ambiguities. In this paper, we\nattempt to raise and resolve important questions about less discriminatory\nalgorithms (LDAs). How should we formally define LDAs, and how does this\ninteract with different societal goals they might serve? And how feasible is it\nfor firms or plaintiffs to computationally search for candidate LDAs? We find\nthat formal LDA definitions face fundamental challenges when they attempt to\nevaluate and compare predictive models in the absence of held-out data. As a\nresult, we argue that LDA definitions cannot be purely quantitative, and must\nrely on standards of \"reasonableness.\" We then identify both mathematical and\ncomputational constraints on firms' ability to efficiently conduct a proactive\nsearch for LDAs, but we provide evidence that these limits are \"weak\" in a\nformal sense. By defining LDAs formally, we put forward a framework in which\nboth firms and plaintiffs can search for alternative models that comport with\nsocietal goals.",

Many recent studies have proposed the use of graph convolution methods\nover the numerous subgraphs of each graph, a concept known as subgraph graph\nneural networks (subgraph GNNs), to enhance GNNs' ability to distinguish\nnon-isomorphic graphs. To maximize the expressiveness, subgraph GNNs often\nrequire each subgraph to have equal size to the original graph. Despite their\nimpressive performance, subgraph GNNs face challenges due to the vast number\nand large size of subgraphs which lead to a surge in training data, resulting\nin both storage and computational inefficiencies. In response to this problem,\nthis paper introduces Ego-Nets-Fit-All (ENFA), a model that uniformly takes the\nsmaller ego nets as subgraphs, thereby providing greater storage and\ncomputational efficiency, while at the same time guarantees identical outputs\nto the original subgraph GNNs even taking the whole graph as subgraphs. The key\nis to identify and eliminate the redundant computation among subgraphs. For\nexample, a node $v_i$ may appear in multiple subgraphs but is far away from all\nof their centers (the unsymmetric part between subgraphs). Therefore, its first\nfew rounds of message passing within each subgraph can be computed once in the\noriginal graph instead of being computed multiple times within each subgraph.\nSuch strategy enables our ENFA to accelerate subgraph GNNs in an exact way,\nunlike previous sampling approaches that often lose the performance. Extensive\nexperiments across various datasets reveal that compared with the conventional\nsubgraph GNNs, ENFA can reduce storage space by 29.0% to 84.5% and improve\ntraining efficiency by up to 1.66x.",

    "abstract": "Array structures based on the fourth-order difference co-array (FODCA)\nprovide more degrees of freedom (DOF). However, since the growth of DOF is\nlimited by a single case of fourth-order cumulant in FODCA, this paper aims to\ndesign a sparse linear array (SLA) with higher DOF via exploring different\ncases of fourth-order cumulants. This paper presents a mathematical framework\nbased on fourth-order cumulant to devise a fourth-order extend co-array\n(FOECA), which is equivalent to FODCA. A novel SLA, namely fourth-order\ngeneralized nested array (FOGNA), is proposed based on FOECA to provide\nclosed-form expressions for the sensor locations and enhance DOF to resolve\nmore signal sources in direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. FOGNA is\nconsisted of three subarrays, where the first is a concatenated nested array\nand the other two subarrays are SLA with big inter-spacing between sensors.\nWhen the total physical sensors of FOGNA are given, the number of sensors in\neach subarray is determined by the designed method, which can obtain the\nmaximum DOF under the proposed array structure and derive closed-form\nexpressions for the sensor locations of FOGNA. The proposed array structure not\nonly achieves higher DOF than those of existing FODCAs but also reduces mutual\ncoupling effects. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority\nof FOGNA on DOA estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing\nFODCAs.",

The\nobjective is to design a sampling policy that minimizes the expected\ntime-average AoI, even when the channel statistics (e.g., delay distributions)\nare unknown.

While modeling these\npopulations is tractable in loop-free networks, neural circuitry inherently\ncontains feedback loops of connectivity. Here, for a class of networks with\nloops, we present an exact solution to the maximum entropy problem that scales\nto very large systems. This solution provides direct access to\ninformation-theoretic measures like the entropy of the model and the\ninformation contained in correlations, which are usually inaccessible at large\nscales. In turn, this allows us to search for the optimal network of\ncorrelations that contains the maximum information about population activity.\nApplying these methods to 45 recordings of approximately 10,000 neurons in the\nmouse visual system, we demonstrate that our framework captures more\ninformation -- providing a better description of the population -- than\nexisting methods without loops. For a given population, our models perform even\nbetter during visual stimulation than spontaneous activity; however, the\ninferred interactions overlap significantly, suggesting an underlying neural\ncircuitry that remains consistent across stimuli.

    "abstract": "Lyric-to-melody generation aims to automatically create melodies based on\ngiven lyrics, requiring the capture of complex and subtle correlations between\nthem. However, previous works usually suffer from two main challenges: 1)\nlyric-melody alignment modeling, which is often simplified to\none-syllable/word-to-one-note alignment, while others have the problem of low\nalignment accuracy; 2) lyric-melody harmony modeling, which usually relies\nheavily on intermediates or strict rules, limiting model's capabilities and\ngenerative diversity. In this paper, we propose SongGLM, a lyric-to-melody\ngeneration system that leverages 2D alignment encoding and multi-task\npre-training based on the General Language Model (GLM) to guarantee the\nalignment and harmony between lyrics and melodies. Specifically, 1) we\nintroduce a unified symbolic song representation for lyrics and melodies with\nword-level and phrase-level (2D) alignment encoding to capture the lyric-melody\nalignment; 2) we design a multi-task pre-training framework with hierarchical\nblank infilling objectives (n-gram, phrase, and long span), and incorporate\nlyric-melody relationships into the extraction of harmonized n-grams to ensure\nthe lyric-melody harmony. We also construct a large-scale lyric-melody paired\ndataset comprising over 200,000 English song pieces for pre-training and\nfine-tuning. The objective and subjective results indicate that SongGLM can\ngenerate melodies from lyrics with significant improvements in both alignment\nand harmony, outperforming all the previous baseline methods.",

However, dynamic and\nunpredictable input-output lengths of LLM, compounded by these optimizations,\nexacerbate the issues of workload variability, making it difficult to maintain\nhigh efficiency on AI accelerators, especially DSAs with tile-based programming\nmodels. To address this challenge, we introduce XY-Serve, a versatile, Ascend\nnative, end-to-end production LLM-serving system. The core idea is an\nabstraction mechanism that smooths out the workload variability by decomposing\ncomputations into unified, hardware-friendly, fine-grained meta primitives. For\nattention, we propose a meta-kernel that computes the basic pattern of\nmatmul-softmax-matmul with architectural-aware tile sizes. For GEMM, we\nintroduce a virtual padding scheme that adapts to dynamic shape changes while\nusing highly efficient GEMM primitives with assorted fixed tile sizes. XY-Serve\nsits harmoniously with vLLM. Experimental results show up to 89% end-to-end\nthroughput improvement compared with current publicly available baselines on\nAscend NPUs. Additionally, our approach outperforms existing GEMM (average\n14.6% faster) and attention (average 21.5% faster) kernels relative to existing\nlibraries.

While various software\ndefenses and physical protections are used to prevent sensor manipulation, this\npaper introduces a new threat vector, PowerRadio, that bypasses existing\nprotections and changes sensor readings from a distance. PowerRadio leverages\ninterconnected ground (GND) wires, a standard practice for electrical safety at\nhome, to inject malicious signals. The injected signal is coupled by the\nsensor's analog measurement wire and eventually survives the noise filters,\ninducing incorrect measurement. We present three methods to manipulate sensors\nby inducing static bias, periodical signals, or pulses. For instance, we show\nadding stripes into the captured images of a surveillance camera or injecting\ninaudible voice commands into conference microphones. We study the underlying\nprinciples of PowerRadio and identify its root causes: (1) the lack of\nshielding between ground and data signal wires and (2) the asymmetry of circuit\nimpedance that enables interference to bypass filtering. We validate PowerRadio\nagainst a surveillance system, broadcast systems, and various sensors. We\nbelieve that PowerRadio represents an emerging threat, exhibiting the\nadvantages of both radiated and conducted EMI, e.g., expanding the effective\nattack distance of radiated EMI yet eliminating the requirement of\nline-of-sight or approaching physically.

Such models digest signal data received at a given\nstation and predict earth-quake parameters, such as the p-phase arrival time,\nintensity, and magnitude at that location. Various methods have demonstrated\nadequate performance. However, most of these methods present the challenges of\nthe difficulty of speeding up the alarm time, providing early warning for\ndistant areas, and considering global information to enhance performance.\nRecently, deep learning has significantly impacted many fields, including\nseismology. Thus, this paper proposes a deep learning-based framework, called\nSENSE, for the intensity prediction task of earthquake early warning systems.\nTo explicitly consider global information from a regional or national\nperspective, the input to SENSE comprises statistics from a set of stations in\na given region or country. The SENSE model is designed to learn the\nrelationships among the set of input stations and the locality-specific\ncharacteristics of each station. Thus, SENSE is not only expected to provide\nmore reliable forecasts by considering multistation data but also has the\nability to provide early warnings to distant areas that have not yet received\nsignals.

    "abstract": "We investigate the bar formation process using $N$-body simulations across\nthe Toomre's parameter $Q_{min}$ and central mass concentration (CMC), focusing\nprincipally on the formation timescale. Of importance is that, as suggested by\ncosmological simulations, disk galaxies have limited time of $\\sim 8$ Gyr in\nthe Universe timeline to evolve secularly, starting when they became physically\nand kinematically steady to prompt the bar instability. By incorporating this\ntime limit, bar-unstable disks are further sub-divided into those that\nestablish a bar before and after that time, namely the normal and the slowly\nbar-forming disks. Simulations demonstrate that evolutions of bar strengths and\nconfigurations of the slowly bar-forming and the bar-stable cases are nearly\nindistinguishable prior to $8$ Gyr, albeit dynamically distinct, while\ndifferences can be noticed afterwards. Differentiating them before $8$ Gyr is\npossible by identifying the proto-bar, a signature of bar development visible\nin kinematical maps such as the Fourier spectrogram and the angular velocity\nfield, which emerges in the former group $1-2$ Gyr before the fully developed\nbar, whereas it is absent in the latter group until $8$ Gyr and such bar-stable\ndisk remains unbarred until at least $10$ Gyr. In addition, we find complicated\ninterplays between $Q_{min}$ and CMC in regulating the bar formation. Firstly,\ndisk stabilization requires both high $Q_{min}$ and CMC. Either high $Q_{min}$\nor high CMC only results in slow bar formation. Secondly, some hot disks can\nform a bar more rapidly than the colder ones in a specific range of $Q_{min}$\nand CMC.",

However, GOFSs\nprocesses are computationally expensive and prone to cumulative errors.\nRecently, large artificial intelligence (AI)-based models significantly boosted\nforecasting speed and accuracy.

The air-sea coupled\nmodule effectively simulates air-sea interactions. The ocean self-attention\nmodule improves network stability and accelerates convergence during training,\nand the adaptive thermocline loss function improves the accuracy of thermocline\nforecasting.

Updates were made\nafter the initial silent deployment to amend one protocol.\n  In 240 real-world clinical iterations, PEACH achieved a first-generation\naccuracy of 97.5% (78/80) and an overall accuracy of 96.7% (232/240) across\nthree iterations. The updated PEACH demonstrated improved accuracy of 97.9%\n(235/240), with a statistically significant difference from the null hypothesis\nof 95% accuracy (p = 0.018, 95% CI: 0.952-0.991).

Existing\nauto-pruning methods face challenges due to the diversity of DNN models,\nvarious operators (e.g., filters), and the difficulty in balancing pruning\ngranularity with model accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce\nAutoSculpt, a pattern-based automated pruning framework designed to enhance\nefficiency and accuracy by leveraging graph learning and deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL). AutoSculpt automatically identifies and prunes regular patterns\nwithin DNN architectures that can be recognized by existing inference engines,\nenabling runtime acceleration.

Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of AutoSculpt across various architectures,\nincluding ResNet, MobileNet, VGG, and Vision Transformer, achieving pruning\nrates of up to 90% and nearly 18% improvement in FLOPs reduction, outperforming\nall baselines.

Failing to account for such scenarios poses a\nsignificant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing.\nAn intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and\nexecuting a simulator (e.g., CARLA). However, this approach incurs substantial\nhuman costs. Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating\ndiverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners. First,\nwe represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator\nto generate traffic scenarios.

In this paper, we focus on the third type and show\nthat its light rings feature both stable and unstable branches, and that the\nblack hole shadow size grows with the quantum parameter-unlike in the first two\ntypes. However, when we account for both the shadow and the lensing ring, the\noverall behavior closely resembles that of the second type, in which an\nincreasing quantum parameter leads to a larger portion of the lensing ring\nbeing occupied by the shadow. This feature can serve as a hallmark of black\nholes in EQG, offering a potential way to distinguish them from their GR\ncounterparts. Remarkably, the parameter ranges under which the solution remains\na black hole are highly consistent with the current observational constraints\non black hole shadows, lending strong support to the classification of the\nthird type of compact object in EQG as a black hole endowed with an event\nhorizon.",

Prompt learning, a powerful technique used in natural language\nprocessing (NLP) to address zero- or few-shot problems, has been adapted for\nrecommender systems to tackle similar challenges. However, existing methods\ntypically rely on content-based properties or text descriptions for prompting,\nwhich we argue may be suboptimal for cold-start recommendations due to 1)\nsemantic gaps with recommender tasks, 2) model bias caused by warm-up items\ncontribute most of the positive feedback to the model, which is the core of the\ncold-start problem that hinders the recommender quality on cold-start items. We\npropose to leverage high-value positive feedback, termed pinnacle feedback as\nprompt information, to simultaneously resolve the above two problems. We\nexperimentally prove that compared to the content description proposed in\nexisting works, the positive feedback is more suitable to serve as prompt\ninformation by bridging the semantic gaps. Besides, we propose item-wise\npersonalized prompt networks to encode pinnaclce feedback to relieve the model\nbias by the positive feedback dominance problem. Extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over\nstate-of-the-art methods.

However, ULM performance relies heavily on microbubble\n(MB) signal sparsity, the number of detected MBs, and signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR), all of which vary in clinical scenarios involving bolus MB injections.\nThese sources of variations underscore the need to optimize MB dosage, data\nacquisition timing, and imaging settings in order to standardize and optimize\nULM of microvasculature. This pilot study investigated temporal changes in MB\nsignals during bolus injections in both pig and human models to optimize data\nacquisition for clinical ULM. Quantitative indices were developed to evaluate\nMB signal quality, guiding selection of acquisition timing that balances the MB\nlocalization quality and adequate MB counts. The effects of transmitted voltage\nand dosage were also explored. In the pig model, a relatively short window\n(approximately 10 seconds) for optimal acquisition was identified during the\nrapid wash-out phase, highlighting the need for real-time MB signal monitoring\nduring data acquisition. The slower wash-out phase in humans allowed for a more\nflexible imaging window of 1-2 minutes, while trade-offs were observed between\nlocalization quality and MB density (or acquisition length) at different\nwash-out phase timings. Guided by these findings, robust ULM imaging was\nachieved in both pig and human kidneys using a short period of data\nacquisition, demonstrating its feasibility in clinical practice.

    "abstract": "Single-modal object detection tasks often experience performance degradation\nwhen encountering diverse scenarios. In contrast, multimodal object detection\ntasks can offer more comprehensive information about object features by\nintegrating data from various modalities. Current multimodal object detection\nmethods generally use various fusion techniques, including conventional neural\nnetworks and transformer-based models, to implement feature fusion strategies\nand achieve complementary information. However, since multimodal images are\ncaptured by different sensors, there are often misalignments between them,\nmaking direct matching challenging. This misalignment hinders the ability to\nestablish strong correlations for the same object across different modalities.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach called the CrOss-Mamba interaction\nand Offset-guided fusion (COMO) framework for multimodal object detection\ntasks. The COMO framework employs the cross-mamba technique to formulate\nfeature interaction equations, enabling multimodal serialized state\ncomputation. This results in interactive fusion outputs while reducing\ncomputational overhead and improving efficiency. Additionally, COMO leverages\nhigh-level features, which are less affected by misalignment, to facilitate\ninteraction and transfer complementary information between modalities,\naddressing the positional offset challenges caused by variations in camera\nangles and capture times. Furthermore, COMO incorporates a global and local\nscanning mechanism in the cross-mamba module to capture features with local\ncorrelation, particularly in remote sensing images. To preserve low-level\nfeatures, the offset-guided fusion mechanism ensures effective multiscale\nfeature utilization, allowing the construction of a multiscale fusion data cube\nthat enhances detection performance.",

We identified three limitations in\ntraditional MoE approaches to multimodal FAS: (1) Coarse-grained experts'\ninability to capture nuanced spoofing indicators; (2) Gated networks'\nsusceptibility to input noise affecting decision-making; (3) MoE's sensitivity\nto prompt tokens leading to overfitting with conventional learning methods. To\nmitigate these, we propose the Bypass Isolated Gating MoE (BIG-MoE) framework,\nfeaturing: (1) Fine-grained experts for enhanced detection of subtle spoofing\ncues; (2) An isolation gating mechanism to counteract input noise; (3) A novel\ndifferential convolutional prompt bypass enriching the gating network with\ncritical local features, thereby improving perceptual capabilities.

LMRPA allows the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nimprove the accuracy and readability of extracted text, overcoming the\nchallenges posed by ambiguous characters and complex text structures.Extensive\nbenchmarks were conducted comparing LMRPA to leading RPA platforms, including\nUiPath and Automation Anywhere, using OCR engines like Tesseract and DocTR. The\nresults are that LMRPA achieves superior performance, cutting the processing\ntimes by up to 52\\%. For instance, in Batch 2 of the Tesseract OCR task, LMRPA\ncompleted the process in 9.8 seconds, where UiPath finished in 18.1 seconds and\nAutomation Anywhere finished in 18.7 seconds. Similar improvements were\nobserved with DocTR, where LMRPA outperformed other automation tools conducting\nthe same process by completing tasks in 12.7 seconds, while competitors took\nover 20 seconds to do the same.

    "abstract": "We introduce Gradient Agreement Filtering (GAF) to improve on gradient\naveraging in distributed deep learning optimization. Traditional distributed\ndata-parallel stochastic gradient descent involves averaging gradients of\nmicrobatches to calculate a macrobatch gradient that is then used to update\nmodel parameters. We find that gradients across microbatches are often\northogonal or negatively correlated, especially in late stages of training,\nwhich leads to memorization of the training set, reducing generalization. In\nthis paper, we introduce a simple, computationally effective way to reduce\ngradient variance by computing the cosine distance between micro-gradients\nduring training and filtering out conflicting updates prior to averaging. We\nimprove validation accuracy with significantly smaller microbatch sizes. We\nalso show this reduces memorizing noisy labels. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this technique on standard image classification benchmarks\nincluding CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-100N-Fine. We show this technique consistently\noutperforms validation accuracy, in some cases by up to 18.2\\% compared to\ntraditional training approaches while reducing the computation required nearly\nan order of magnitude because we can now rely on smaller microbatch sizes\nwithout destabilizing training.",
