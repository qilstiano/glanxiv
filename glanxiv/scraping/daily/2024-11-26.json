    "abstract": "We investigate structural parameterizations of two identification problems:\nLOCATING-DOMINATING SET and TEST COVER. In the first problem, an input is a\ngraph $G$ on $n$ vertices and an integer $k$, and one asks if there is a subset\n$S$ of $k$ vertices such that any two distinct vertices not in $S$ are\ndominated by distinct subsets of $S$. In the second problem, an input is a set\nof items $U$, a set of subsets $\\mathcal{F}$ of $U$ called $tests$ and an\ninteger $k$, and one asks if there is a set $S$ of at most $k$ tests such that\nany two items belong to distinct subsets of tests of $S$. These two problems\nare \"identification\" analogues of DOMINATING SET and SET COVER, respectively.\nChakraborty et al. [ISAAC 2024] proved that both the problems admit conditional\ndouble-exponential lower bounds and matching algorithms when parameterized by\ntreewidth of the input graph. We continue this line of investigation and\nconsider parameters larger than treewidth, like vertex cover number and\nfeedback edge set number. We design a nontrivial dynamic programming scheme to\nsolve TEST COVER in \"slightly super-exponential\" time $2^{O(|U|\\log\n|U|)}(|U|+|\\mathcal{F}|)^{O(1)}$ in the number $|U|$ of items and\nLOCATING-DOMINATING SET in time $2^{O(\\textsf{vc} \\log \\textsf{vc})} \\cdot\nn^{O(1)}$, where $\\textsf{vc}$ is the vertex cover number and $n$ is the order\nof the graph. This shows that the lower bound results with respect to treewidth\nfrom Chakraborty et al. [ISAAC 2024] cannot be extended to vertex cover number.\nWe also show that, parameterized by feedback edge set number,\nLOCATING-DOMINATING SET admits a linear kernel thereby answering an open\nquestion in [Cappelle et al., LAGOS 2021]. Finally, we show that neither\nLOCATING-DOMINATING SET nor TEST COVER is likely to admit a compression\nalgorithm returning an input with a subquadratic number of bits, unless\n$\\textsf{NP} \\subseteq \\textsf{coNP}/poly$.",

Additionally, we develop MARVEL-FX3D,\na two-stage text-to-3D pipeline. We fine-tune Stable Diffusion with our\nannotations and use a pretrained image-to-3D network to generate 3D textured\nmeshes within 15s.

On a fundamental level,\nthey can be a basis of describing non-equilibrium and active states of matter,\nwith applications ranging from physics to social sciences. However, often the\nfirst step to understanding complex nonlinear models is to linearize about the\nsteady states. It is thus useful to develop a careful understanding of linear\nnon-reciprocal systems, similar to our understanding of Gaussian systems in\nequilibrium statistical mechanics. In this work we explore simplest linear\nnon-reciprocal models with noise and spatial extent. We describe their regions\nof stability and show how non-reciprocity can enhance the stability of a\nsystem. We demonstrate the appearance of exceptional and critical exceptional\npoints with the respective enhancement of fluctuations for the latter.

    "abstract": "Optimal camera placement plays a crucial role in applications such as\nsurveillance, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. Even\nhighly abstracted versions of this problem are NP-hard due to the\nhigh-dimensional continuous domain of camera configurations (i.e., positions\nand orientations) and difficulties in efficiently and accurately calculating\ncamera coverage. In this paper, we present a novel framework for optimal camera\nplacement that uses integer programming and adaptive sampling strategies to\nmaximize coverage, given a limited camera budget. We develop a modified maximum\nk-coverage formulation and two adaptive sampling strategies, Explore and\nExploit (E&E) and Target Uncovered Spaces (TUS), that iteratively add new\ncamera configurations to the candidate set in order to improve the solution.\nE&E focuses on local search around camera configurations chosen in previous\niterations, whereas TUS focuses specifically on covering regions that were\npreviously uncovered. We first conduct theoretical analysis to provide bounds\non the probability of finding an optimal solution and expected sampling needs,\nwhile ensuring monotonic improvements in coverage. Then, we conduct a detailed\nnumerical analysis over different environments. Results show that E&E achieves\ncoverage improvements of 3.3-16.0% over all baseline random sampling\napproaches, while maintaining manageable computational times. Meanwhile, TUS\nperforms well in open environments and with tight camera budgets, achieving\ngains of 6.9-9.1% in such conditions. Compared to the baseline, our approach\nachieves similar coverage using only 30-70% of the sampling budget,\ndemonstrating its computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "The pervasiveness of mobile apps in everyday life necessitates robust testing\nstrategies to ensure quality and efficiency, especially through end-to-end\nusage-based tests for mobile apps' user interfaces (UIs). However, manually\ncreating and maintaining such tests can be costly for developers. Since many\napps share similar functionalities beneath diverse UIs, previous works have\nshown the possibility of transferring UI tests across different apps within the\nsame domain, thereby eliminating the need for writing the tests manually.\nHowever, these methods have struggled to accommodate real-world variations,\noften facing limitations in scenarios where source and target apps are not very\nsimilar or fail to accurately transfer test oracles. This paper introduces an\ninnovative technique, LLMigrate, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto efficiently transfer usage-based UI tests across mobile apps. Our\nexperimental evaluation shows LLMigrate can achieve a 97.5% success rate in\nautomated test transfer, reducing the manual effort required to write tests\nfrom scratch by 91.1%. This represents an improvement of 9.1% in success rate\nand 38.2% in effort reduction compared to the best-performing prior technique,\nsetting a new benchmark for automated test transfer.",

Despite\ntheir widespread application, recent research has demonstrated that GNNs are\nvulnerable to backdoor attacks, implemented by injecting triggers into the\ntraining datasets. Trained on the poisoned data, GNNs will predict target\nlabels when attaching trigger patterns to inputs. This vulnerability poses\nsignificant security risks for applications of GNNs in sensitive domains, such\nas drug discovery. While there has been extensive research into backdoor\ndefenses for images, strategies to safeguard GNNs against such attacks remain\nunderdeveloped. Furthermore, we point out that conventional backdoor defense\nmethods designed for images cannot work well when directly implemented on graph\ndata. In this paper, we first analyze the key difference between image backdoor\nand graph backdoor attacks. Then we tackle the graph defense problem by\npresenting a novel approach called MADE, which devises an adversarial mask\ngeneration mechanism that selectively preserves clean sub-graphs and further\nleverages masks on edge weights to eliminate the influence of triggers\neffectively. Extensive experiments across various graph classification tasks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of MADE in significantly reducing the attack\nsuccess rate (ASR) while maintaining a high classification accuracy.",

Understanding these emergent capabilities is essential for\nadvancing LLM development and improving their interpretability across diverse\ntasks. However, whether LLMs exhibit true emergence in the context of Software\nEngineering remains an unexplored topic, as most research has focused on NLP\ntasks. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of capabilities in the\ncontext of SE. We propose a model-agnostic pipeline for evaluating this\nphenomenon across three SE tasks: bug fixing, code translation, and commit\nmessage generation. More precisely, for each task, we present a case study\ninstantiating our pipeline to analyze the emergence of capabilities in\nCodeGen1-multi across four scales ranging from 350M to 16.1B parameters.

The technical advantages of\nformal verification over manual testing are increasingly recognised in the\ncybersecurity community. However, for practitioners, formal modelling and\nverification are often too complex and unfamiliar to be used routinely.

For the evaluation, we identify the six most prominent limiting\nfactors for formal method adoption, based on relevant literature in this field,\nand we consider the IDE's effectiveness against those criteria.

One of the main differences between SQT and FQT is the following.\nIn SQT, elementary objects are described by irreducible representations (IRs)\nof a symmetry algebra in which energies are either only positive or only\nnegative and there are no IRs where there are states with different signs of\nenergy. In the first case, objects are called particles, and in the second -\nantiparticles. As a consequence, in SQT it is possible to introduce conserved\nquantum numbers (electric charge, baryon number, etc.) so that particles and\nantiparticles differ in the signs of these numbers. However, in FQT, all IRs\nnecessarily contain states with both signs of energy. The symmetry in FQT is\nhigher than the symmetry in SQT because one IR in FQT splits into two IRs in\nSQT with positive and negative energies at $p\\to\\infty$. Consequently, most\nfundamental quantum theory will not contain the concepts of\nparticle-antiparticle and additive quantum numbers. These concepts are only\ngood approximations at present since at this stage of the universe the value\n$p$ is very large but it was not so large at earlier stages. The above\nproperties of IRs in SQT and FQT have been discussed in our publications with\ndetailed technical proofs.

We ran a retrieval for all four molecules\nand obtained a water abundance of $\\log_{10}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) =\n-2.24^{+0.57}_{-0.48}$. We obtained an upper limit on the C/O ratio of C/O $<$\n0.95. These findings are consistent with previous observations from the Hubble\nSpace Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope.",

To that end, we revisit pulsar\ndistance estimates extracted from the dispersion measure of pulsar radio waves\nscattering on electrons. In particular, we create a new electron density map\nfor the local kiloparsec by fitting to parallax measurements of the nearest\npulsars, which complements existing maps that are fit on the Galactic scale.\nThis ``near-Earth'' electron density map implies that pulsars previously\nestimated to be 100-200 pc away may be as close as tens of parsecs away, which\nmotivates a parallax-based measurement campaign to follow-up on these very-near\ncandidate pulsars. Such nearby neutron stars would be valuable laboratories for\ntesting fundamental physics phenomena, including several late-stage neutron\nstar heating mechanisms, using current and forthcoming telescopes. We\nillustrate this by estimating the sensitivities of the upcoming Extremely Large\nTelescope and Thirty Meter Telescope to neutron stars heated by dark matter\ncapture.",

In this regard, initiatives range from\ngovernment and private sector monitoring programs to solutions based on citizen\nscience campaigns, for example. Particularly in the context of citizen science\ncampaigns, the segmentation of remote sensing images to identify deforested\nareas and subsequently submit them to analysis by non-specialized volunteers is\nnecessary.

This\nconvergence is known as \"classical limit\", and is difficult to explain within\nquantum formalism. In this short paper, the simplified Mermin-Peres form (two\nqubits) of the KS argument is extended to an arbitrary number of qubits. It is\nshown that quantum and classical predictions converge as the number of qubits\nis increases to the macroscopic scale. This way to explain the classical limit\nconcurs with, and improves, a result previously reported for GHZ states.

Unlike existing\ncontinual learning approaches that attempt to develop a unified model capable\nof generalizing across diverse scenarios, DECODE uniquely balances\nspecialization with generalization, dynamically adjusting to real-time demands.\nThe proposed framework leverages a hypernetwork to generate model parameters,\nsignificantly reducing storage requirements, and incorporates a normalizing\nflow mechanism for real-time model selection based on likelihood estimation.\nFurthermore, DECODE merges outputs from the most relevant specialized and\ngeneralized models using deep Bayesian uncertainty estimation techniques.

The number of scenarios needed for accurate approximation - and\nhence the size of the optimization problem when using prior methods - increases\nwith variance in the data, and the search space of the optimization problem\nincreases exponentially with the number of tuples in the relation.

The sequential\nsubsetting aspect of the second prior encourages the simultaneous selection of\nrelevant mediators and their corresponding indirect effects from the two model\nparts, providing a more coherent and efficient variable selection framework,\nspecific to mediation analysis. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate\nthat the proposed method provides superior power in detecting active mediating\npathways.

We\ninvestigate how off-resonant excitations can be optimally absorbed and\ntransmitted through the network. Three strategies are considered: optimising\nnetwork energies, adjusting the couplings between the radiation field, the\nantenna, and the network, or introducing and optimising driving fields at the\nstart and end of the network. These strategies are tested on three different\ntypes of network with increasing complexity: nearest-neighbour and star\nconfigurations, and one associated with the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. The\nresults show that, among the various strategies, the introduction of driving\nfields is the most effective, leading to a significant increase in the\nprobability of reaching the sink in a given time. This result remains stable\nacross networks of varying dimensionalities and types, and the driving process\nrequires only a few parameters to be effective.",

The mathematical model consists of a coupled system of\nnonlinear equations, where flow within fractures is represented using a\nlower-dimensional representation. For the numerical solution of the coupled\ntransport problem, we construct an unstructured mesh that resolves lower\ndimensional fractures on the grid level and use the finite element\napproximation to build a discrete system. To construct an efficient scheme for\nthe resulting nonlinear problem, we use an explicit-implicit method for time\nintegration, where we carefully choose an additive partition of the nonlinear\noperators to separate the stiff linear component and integrate it implicitly to\nensure the stability of the time integration. Next, we invert the linear\npartition of the operator by constructing an efficient two-grid preconditioner\nfor shale gas transport in fractured porous media.

Consequently, offline RL, which\nleverages historical market data without additional exploration, becomes\nessential. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle to capture the\ncomplex temporal dependencies inherent in financial time series and may overfit\nto historical patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a Decision\nTransformer (DT) initialized with pre-trained GPT-2 weights and fine-tuned\nusing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

This setting applies to many modern problems such\nas in-context learning, hypernetworks, and learning-to-learn. A common method\nfor evaluating the performance of supervised learning algorithms is through\ntheir learning curve, which depicts the expected error as a function of the\nnumber of training examples. In meta-learning, the learning curve becomes a\ntwo-dimensional learning surface, which evaluates the expected error on unseen\ndomains for varying values of $n$ (number of tasks) and $m$ (number of training\nexamples).\n  Our findings characterize the distribution-free learning surfaces of\nmeta-Empirical Risk Minimizers when either $m$ or $n$ tend to infinity: we show\nthat the number of tasks must increase inversely with the desired error. In\ncontrast, we show that the number of examples exhibits very different behavior:\nit satisfies a dichotomy where every meta-class conforms to one of the\nfollowing conditions: (i) either $m$ must grow inversely with the error, or\n(ii) a \\emph{finite} number of examples per task suffices for the error to\nvanish as $n$ goes to infinity. This finding illustrates and characterizes\ncases in which a small number of examples per task is sufficient for successful\nlearning. We further refine this for positive values of $\\varepsilon$ and\nidentify for each $\\varepsilon$ how many examples per task are needed to\nachieve an error of $\\varepsilon$ in the limit as the number of tasks $n$ goes\nto infinity.

    "abstract": "Technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the\ndevelopment of large vision language models (LVLMs) that are trained on\nmillions of paired image and text samples. Subsequent research efforts have\ndemonstrated great potential of LVLMs to achieve high performance in medical\nimaging use cases (e.g., radiology report generation), but there remain\nbarriers that hinder the ability to deploy these solutions broadly. These\ninclude the cost of extensive computational requirements for developing large\nscale models, expertise in the development of sophisticated AI models, and the\ndifficulty in accessing substantially large, high-quality datasets that\nadequately represent the population in which the LVLM solution is to be\ndeployed. The HOPPR Medical-Grade Platform addresses these barriers by\nproviding powerful computational infrastructure, a suite of foundation models\non top of which developers can fine-tune for their specific use cases, and a\nrobust quality management system that sets a standard for evaluating fine-tuned\nmodels for deployment in clinical settings. The HOPPR Platform has access to\nmillions of imaging studies and text reports sourced from hundreds of imaging\ncenters from diverse populations to pretrain foundation models and enable use\ncase-specific cohorts for fine-tuning. All data are deidentified and securely\nstored for HIPAA compliance. Additionally, developers can securely host models\non the HOPPR platform and access them via an API to make inferences using these\nmodels within established clinical workflows. With the Medical-Grade Platform,\nHOPPR's mission is to expedite the deployment of LVLM solutions for medical\nimaging and ultimately optimize radiologist's workflows and meet the growing\ndemands of the field.",

We find purely\nMONDian effects dominate the lensing and generate non-trivial correlations\nbetween the lens parameters and the lensing cross section. Moreover, we show\nthat the standard realisation of MOND predicts a substantial increase in the\nnumber count of disc galaxy lenses compared to the dark matter-driven\npredictions, making it distinguishable from the latter in upcoming surveys.\nFinally, we argue that disc galaxy gravitational lensing, coupled to additional\nastronomical observations, can be used to constrain the interpolating function\nof MOND.",

As an application, we systematically study several disk\nmodels and compute their total flux density, average radii, and optical depth.\nThe model parameters are chosen around fiducial values calibrated to general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and observations of M87*.\nFor the parameter space studied, we characterize the transition between\noptically thin and thick regimes and the frequency at which the first photon\nring is observable. Our results highlight the need for careful definitions of\nphoton ring radius in the image domain, as in certain models, the highly lensed\nphoton ring is dimmer than the direct emission at certain angles. We find that\nat low frequencies, the ring radii are set by the electron temperature, while\nat higher frequencies, the magnetic field strength plays a more significant\nrole, demonstrating how multi-frequency analysis can also be used to infer\nplasma parameters.

Our proposed method allows for a broad class of base\noptimizers for local steps, and uses sign momentum in the global step, where\nmomentum is generated from differences accumulated during local steps.

Our results demonstrate that the choice of IMF sampling method\ncritically affects stellar feedback dynamics, particularly supernova (SN)\nfeedback, thus impacting the star formation and metallicity characteristics of\nUFD analogs. We find that simulations with stochastic IMF sampling yield UFD\nanalogs with 40\\% to 70\\% higher stellar masses than those using the burst\nmodel, due to a less immediate suppression of star formation by SNe. The\nindividual IMF method results in even greater stellar masses, 8\\% to 58\\% more\nthan stochastic runs, as stars form individually and continuously. Star\nformation is most continuous with individual sampling, followed by stochastic,\nand least with the burst model, which shows the longest quenching periods.\nFurthermore, the individual sampling approach achieves higher metallicity\nstars, aligning well with observed values, unlike the lower metallicities\n(about 1 dex less) found in the burst and stochastic methods. This difference\nis attributed to the continuous star formation in individual sampling, where\ngas metallicity shaped by previous SN events is immediately reflected in\nstellar metallicity.

The hybrid architecture leverages offline data\nthroughout training while maintaining PPO's theoretical guarantees. Building on\nthe monotonic improvement framework of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO),\nwe prove that our approach ensures improvement over both the offline policy and\nprevious iterations, with a bounded performance gap of\n$(2\\varsigma\\gamma\\alpha^2)/(1-\\gamma)^2$, where $\\alpha$ is the mixing\nparameter, $\\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $\\varsigma$ bounds the expected\nadvantage. Additionally, we prove that our TWTL-based reward shaping preserves\nthe optimal policy of the original problem. TWTL enables formal translation of\ntemporal objectives into immediate feedback signals that guide learning. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on\nan inverted pendulum and a lunar lander environments, showing improvements in\nboth learning speed and final performance compared to standard PPO and\noffline-only approaches.",

Such models integrate\nmultiple data sources to produce estimates and forecasts with uncertainty based\non model assumptions. Model assumptions can be divided into assumptions that\ndescribe latent trends in the indicator of interest versus assumptions on the\ndata generating process of the observed data, conditional on the latent process\nvalue. Focusing on the latter, we introduce a class of data models that can be\nused to combine data from multiple sources with various reporting issues. The\nproposed data model accounts for sampling errors and differences in\nobservational uncertainty based on survey characteristics. In addition, the\ndata model employs horseshoe priors to produce estimates that are robust to\noutlying observations. We refer to the data model class as the\nnormal-with-optional-shrinkage (NOS) set up.

However, manual landmark annotation is time-consuming and requires\nsignificant expertise. Existing deep learning (DL) methods often require large\namounts of well-annotated data, which are costly to acquire. In this paper, we\nintroduce CABLD, a novel self-supervised DL framework for 3D brain landmark\ndetection in unlabeled scans with varying contrasts by using only a single\nreference example. To achieve this, we employed an inter-subject landmark\nconsistency loss with an image registration loss while introducing a 3D\nconvolution-based contrast augmentation strategy to promote model\ngeneralization to new contrasts. Additionally, we utilize an adaptive mixed\nloss function to schedule the contributions of different sub-tasks for optimal\noutcomes. We demonstrate the proposed method with the intricate task of\nMRI-based 3D brain landmark detection. With comprehensive experiments on four\ndiverse clinical and public datasets, including both T1w and T2w MRI scans at\ndifferent MRI field strengths, we demonstrate that CABLD outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of mean radial errors (MREs) and success\ndetection rates (SDRs).

Our primary motivation for this study is to understand the\ninterplay of these two parameters on the geodesics of spacetime, including\nphoton spheres and time-like orbits. In this study, we found that this\nintegration, in its initial form, can limit the value of the Gauss-Bonnet\nparameter ($\\alpha$), creating a critical threshold beyond which changes in the\nnon-commutative parameter ($\\Xi$) become ineffective, and the structure can\nonly manifest as a naked singularity. Furthermore, we found that using a more\ncomplex model, which includes additional factors such as a cloud of strings and\nlinear charge, as a sample for studying spacetime geodesics, yield different\nand varied results. In this scenario, negative $\\alpha$ values can also play a\nrole, notably preserving the black hole form even with a super-extremal charge\n($q > m$). For $\\alpha> 0.1$, the black hole mass parameter becomes\nsignificantly influential, with a critical mass below which the impact of other\nparameter changes is nullified. Interestingly, considering a more massive black\nhole, this high-mass state also maintains its black hole form within the\nsuper-extremal charge range. The existence of these two models led us to our\nmain goal. By examining the temperature for these two cases, we find that both\nsituations are suitable for studying the WGC. Finally, based on the behavior of\nthese two models, we will explain how the WGC acts as a logical solution and a\nprotector for the WCCC.",

    "abstract": "Recently, text-guided scalable vector graphics (SVG) synthesis has\ndemonstrated significant potential in domains such as iconography and\nsketching. However, SVGs generated from existing Text-to-SVG methods often lack\neditability and exhibit deficiencies in visual quality and diversity. In this\npaper, we propose a novel text-guided vector graphics synthesis method to\naddress these limitations. To enhance the editability of output SVGs, we\nintroduce a Hierarchical Image VEctorization (HIVE) framework that operates at\nthe semantic object level and supervises the optimization of components within\nthe vector object. This approach facilitates the decoupling of vector graphics\ninto distinct objects and component levels. Our proposed HIVE algorithm,\ninformed by image segmentation priors, not only ensures a more precise\nrepresentation of vector graphics but also enables fine-grained editing\ncapabilities within vector objects. To improve the diversity of output SVGs, we\npresent a Vectorized Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach. VPSD\naddresses over-saturation issues in existing methods and enhances sample\ndiversity. A pre-trained reward model is incorporated to re-weight vector\nparticles, improving aesthetic appeal and enabling faster convergence.\nAdditionally, we design a novel adaptive vector primitives control strategy,\nwhich allows for the dynamic adjustment of the number of primitives, thereby\nenhancing the presentation of graphic details. Extensive experiments validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over\nbaseline methods in terms of editability, visual quality, and diversity. We\nalso show that our new method supports up to six distinct vector styles,\ncapable of generating high-quality vector assets suitable for stylized vector\ndesign and poster design.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the physical layer security of a Reconfigurable\nIntelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless network in the presence of full-duplex\nactive eavesdropping. In this scenario, the RIS cooperates with the Base\nStation (BS) to transfer information to the intended user while an active\nattacker attempts to intercept the information through a wiretap channel. In\naddition, the attacker sends jamming signals to interfere with the legitimate\nuser's reception of the signal and increase the eavesdropping rate. Our\nobjective is to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the active and\npassive beamformers at the BS and RIS, respectively. To solve the resulting\nnon-convex optimization problem, we propose a solution that decomposes it into\ntwo disjoint beamforming design sub-problems solved iteratively using\nAlternating Optimization (AO) techniques. Numerical analysis is conducted to\nevaluate the impacts of varying the number of active attacking antennas and\nelements of the RIS on the secrecy performance of the considered systems under\nthe presence of jamming signals sent by the attacker. The results demonstrate\nthe importance of considering the impact of jamming signals on physical layer\nsecurity in RIS-aided wireless networks.

    "abstract": "Navigating dynamic urban environments presents significant challenges for\nembodied agents, requiring advanced spatial reasoning and adherence to\ncommon-sense norms. Despite progress, existing visual navigation methods\nstruggle in map-free or off-street settings, limiting the deployment of\nautonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots. To overcome these obstacles,\nwe propose a scalable, data-driven approach for human-like urban navigation by\ntraining agents on thousands of hours of in-the-wild city walking and driving\nvideos sourced from the web. We introduce a simple and scalable data processing\npipeline that extracts action supervision from these videos, enabling\nlarge-scale imitation learning without costly annotations. Our model learns\nsophisticated navigation policies to handle diverse challenges and critical\nscenarios. Experimental results show that training on large-scale, diverse\ndatasets significantly enhances navigation performance, surpassing current\nmethods. This work shows the potential of using abundant online video data to\ndevelop robust navigation policies for embodied agents in dynamic urban\nsettings.

Despite their importance, the detection of such systems, especially\ncompact ones, remains challenging due to the complexity of their orbital\ndynamics and the limitations of traditional observational methods. This study\naims to identify new CHT star systems among Gaia astrometric binaries and\naccelerated solutions by analysing the radial velocity (RV) amplitude of these\nsystems, thereby improving our understanding of stellar hierarchies. We\nselected a sample of bright astrometric binaries and accelerated solutions from\nthe Gaia DR3 Non-Single Stars catalogue. The RV peak-to-peak amplitude was used\nas an estimator, and we applied a new method to detect potential triple systems\nby comparing the RV-based semi-amplitude with the astrometric semi-amplitude.\nWe used available binary and triple star catalogues to identify and validate\ncandidates, with a subset confirmed through further examination of the RV and\nastrometric data. Our analysis resulted in the discovery of 956 CHT candidates\namong the orbital sources as well as another 3,115 probable close binary\nsources in stars with accelerated solutions. Exploring the inclination, orbital\nperiod, and eccentricity of the outer companion in these CHT systems provides\nstrong evidence of mutual orbit alignment, as well as a preference towards\nmoderate outer eccentricities. Our novel approach has proven effective in\nidentifying potential triple systems thereby increasing their number in the\ncatalogues.

    "abstract": "Estimating quantum partition functions is a critical task in a variety of\nfields. However, the problem is classically intractable in general due to the\nexponential scaling of the Hamiltonian dimension $N$ in the number of\nparticles. This paper introduces a quantum algorithm for estimating the\npartition function $Z_\\beta$ of a generic Hamiltonian $H$ up to multiplicative\nerror based on a quantum coin toss. The coin is defined by the probability of\napplying the quantum imaginary-time evolution propagator $f_\\beta[H]=e^{-\\beta\nH/{2}}$ at inverse temperature $\\beta$ to the maximally mixed state, realized\nby a block-encoding of $f_\\beta[H]$ into a unitary quantum circuit followed by\na post-selection measurement. Our algorithm does not use costly subroutines\nsuch as quantum phase estimation or amplitude amplification; and the binary\nnature of the coin allows us to invoke tools from Bernoulli-process analysis to\nprove a runtime scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(N/{Z_\\beta})$, quadratically better\nthan previous general-purpose algorithms using similar quantum resources.\nMoreover, since the coin is defined by a single observable, the method lends\nitself well to quantum error mitigation. We test this in practice with a\nproof-of-concept 9-qubit experiment, where we successfully mitigate errors\nthrough a simple noise-extrapolation procedure.

We explore the\nconsequences of strong magnetic interactions in a lattice model of\nstrongly-interacting d-electrons separated by weakly-interacting p-electrons.\nIn contrast with conventional t-J models where magnetic exchange emerges in the\nstrong-coupling expansion of Hubbard-type models, in this framework Coulomb\nblockade emerges in the strong-coupling limit of spin-spin interactions. This\nresults in an insulator at fractional filling without Hubbard interactions.\nDoping this correlated insulator creates localized Cooper pairs that live on\nthe edges of a square lattice, with a d-wave form-factor. They realize the\nflat-band eigenfunction of the checkerboard lattice Hamiltonian, and have zero\nkinetic energy. We present a mean-field theory of superconductivity\ninterpolating between this interaction-localized strong-pairing limit with\nd-wave Bose-Einstein condensation and a weak-pairing limit with a nodal Fermi\nsurface gap, where the superfluid stiffness scale is controlled by the electron\nhopping integrals and the density, as usual. The pair wavefunction connects\nd-wave and s-wave molecular orbitals, so that the intra-band gap on the Fermi\nsurface is parametrically smaller than the off-shell inter-band gap.

    "abstract": "All-weather image restoration (AWIR) is crucial for reliable autonomous\nnavigation under adverse weather conditions. AWIR models are trained to address\na specific set of weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow. But this\ncauses them to often struggle with out-of-distribution (OoD) samples or unseen\ndegradations which limits their effectiveness for real-world autonomous\nnavigation. To overcome this issue, existing models must either be retrained or\nfine-tuned, both of which are inefficient and impractical, with retraining\nneeding access to large datasets, and fine-tuning involving many parameters. In\nthis paper, we propose using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt a\npre-trained all-weather model to novel weather restoration tasks. Furthermore,\nwe observe that LoRA lowers the performance of the adapted model on the\npre-trained restoration tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a LoRA-based\nfine-tuning method called LoRA-Align (LoRA-A) which seeks to align the singular\nvectors of the fine-tuned and pre-trained weight matrices using Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD). This alignment helps preserve the model's knowledge of its\noriginal tasks while adapting it to unseen tasks. We show that images restored\nwith LoRA and LoRA-A can be effectively used for computer vision tasks in\nautonomous navigation, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.",

Their influence is particularly relevant in\nenvironments with high CR rates, such as starburst galaxies with supernova\nremnants or jets and outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGN). CRs transfer\nenergy to the ionized phase of the ISM far from the ionization source,\npreventing gas cooling and driving large-scale winds. In this work, we use\nCLOUDY to explore the effect of CRs on nebular gas, a relatively underexplored\narea, mainly focused on cold molecular gas. Our models cover a broad range of\ndensity ($1 - 10^4\\,\\rm{cm^{-3}}$), ionization parameter ($-3.5 \\leq \\log U\n\\leq -1.5$), and CR ionization rate ($10^{-16}\\, \\rm{s^{-1}} - 10^{-12}\\,\n\\rm{s^{-1}}$).

Unlike pure photoionization models, AGN simulations\nwith high CR ionization rates reproduce the Seyfert loci in BPT diagrams\nwithout requiring super-solar metallicities for the narrow-line region.\nAdditionally, star formation simulations with high CR ionization rates can\nexplain line ratios in the LINER domain.

Such multi-scale, hierarchical aperture arrays\nrequire a combination of data processing architectures -- pre-correlation\nbeamformer, generic version of FFT-based direct imager, post-correlation\nbeamformer, and post-correlation FFT imager -- operating on different ranges of\nspatial scales to obtain optimal performance in imaging the entire field of\nview. Adopting a computational cost metric based on the number of floating\npoint operations, its distribution over the dimensions of discovery space,\nnamely, field of view, angular resolution, polarisation, frequency, and time is\nexamined to determine the most efficient hybrid architectures over the\nparameter space of hierarchical aperture array layouts.

Given a silent video and a text\nprompt, MultiFoley allows users to create clean sounds (e.g., skateboard wheels\nspinning without wind noise) or more whimsical sounds (e.g., making a lion's\nroar sound like a cat's meow). MultiFoley also allows users to choose reference\naudio from sound effects (SFX) libraries or partial videos for conditioning. A\nkey novelty of our model lies in its joint training on both internet video\ndatasets with low-quality audio and professional SFX recordings, enabling\nhigh-quality, full-bandwidth (48kHz) audio generation. Through automated\nevaluations and human studies, we demonstrate that MultiFoley successfully\ngenerates synchronized high-quality sounds across varied conditional inputs and\noutperforms existing methods.

Building upon a video diffusion model,\nStableAnimator contains carefully designed modules for both training and\ninference striving for identity consistency. In particular, StableAnimator\nbegins by computing image and face embeddings with off-the-shelf extractors,\nrespectively and face embeddings are further refined by interacting with image\nembeddings using a global content-aware Face Encoder.

After the black hole has absorbed the diary, Bob\ntries to recover the information that Alice thought should be destroyed by the\nblack hole. In this protocol, we found that a $U(1)$ symmetry of the radiation\nemerges before a certain transition time (the time when the vanishing\nentanglement asymmetry begins to grow). This emergent symmetry is exact in the\nthermodynamic limit and can be characterized by the vanishing entanglement\nasymmetry of the radiation. The transition time depends on the initial entropy\nand the size of the diary.

A well-calibrated forecast system that simultaneously\nsatisfies climatological and ensemble variance reliability criteria will not\nexhibit an SNP if sample statistics can be evaluated using a sufficiently large\nensemble size ($N$) over a sufficiently large number of independent cases\n($M$). However, when $M$ is finite, an apparent SNP will sometimes occur as a\nnatural consequence of sampling uncertainty, even in a perfectly reliable\nensemble with many members. In this study, we evaluate the forecast skill,\nreliability characteristics, and signal-to-noise properties of three\nlarge-scale atmospheric circulation indices in 100-member subseasonal\nreforecasts with the ECMWF IFS. Daily mean NAO forecasts generally satisfy\nunbiased reliability criteria within the tolerance of our estimated sampling\nuncertainties. Nevertheless, NAO forecasts in this dataset exhibit symptoms of\nthe SNP at subseasonal lead times. However, we do not find robust evidence for\nan underestimation of the magnitude of predictable signals and do not exclude\nthe possibility that the apparent paradox in this dataset is a consequence of\nobservational sampling uncertainties that are insensitive to ensemble size and\ncommon to all comparisons for this set of forecast start dates and lead times.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that this apparent SNP can be eliminated with an\nunbiased reliability calibration.

In this paper, we\nfirst introduce Visatronic, a unified multimodal decoder-only transformer model\nthat adopts an LLM-style architecture to embed visual, textual, and speech\ninputs into a shared subspace, treating all modalities as temporally aligned\ntoken streams. Next, we carefully explore different token mixing strategies to\nunderstand the best way to propagate information from the steps where video and\ntext conditioning is input to the steps where the audio is generated. We\nextensively evaluate Visatronic on the challenging VoxCeleb2 dataset and\ndemonstrate zero-shot generalization to LRS3, where Visatronic, trained on\nVoxCeleb2, achieves a 4.5% WER, outperforming prior SOTA methods trained only\non LRS3, which report a 21.4% WER. Additionally, we propose a new objective\nmetric, TimeSync, specifically designed to measure phoneme-level temporal\nalignment between generated and reference speech, further ensuring\nsynchronization quality.

We observed the GJ~486 system\nwith the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) from 550 to 750 MHz\nin nine different epochs, between October 2021 and February 2022, covering\nalmost all orbital phases of GJ~486 b from different orbital cycles. We\nobtained radio images and dynamic spectra of the total and circularly polarized\nintensity for each individual epoch We do not detect any quiescent radio\nemission in any epoch above 3$\\sigma$. Similarly, we do not detect any bursty\nemission in our dynamic spectra.\n  While we cannot completely rule out that the absence of a radio detection is\ndue to time variability of the radio emission, or to the maximum\nelectron-cyclotron maser emission being below our observing range, this seems\nunlikely. We discuss two possible scenarios: an intrinsic dim radio signal, or\nalternatively, that the anisotropic beamed emission pointed away from the\nobserver. If the non-detection of radio emission from star-planet interaction\nin GJ~486 is due to an intrinsically dim signal, this implies that,\nindependently of whether the planet is magnetized or not, the mass-loss rate is\nsmall (\\dot{M}_\\star $\\lesssim$ 0.3 \\dot{M}_\\sun) and that, concomitantly, the\nefficiency of the conversion of Poynting flux into radio emission must be low\n($\\beta \\lesssim 10^{-3}$). Free-free absorption effects are negligible, given\nthe high value of the coronal temperature. Finally, if the anisotropic beaming\npointed away from us, this would imply that GJ~486 has very low values of its\nmagnetic obliquity and inclination.",

However, most existing research focuses on straight-line\nswimming leaving the study of dolphins' corning strategies an open area.\nChallenges for directly analyzing dolphins' turning behavior include\ndifficulties in motion tracking underwater and the inability to directly\nmeasure the propulsive forces. This paper provides methodology and analyses of\ndolphins' swimming performance during lap swimming tasks. External camera\ndetection and internal kinematics measured from wearable bio-tags are involved\nin this study to support accurate localization of the animals. A particle\nfilter, which fuses the external and internal measurements, is implemented to\nprovide accurate estimations of the trajectories, even when they swim deep\nbelow the water's surface. Thereafter, a hydrodynamic model is constructed to\ncalculate the thrust power and energy cost of the animals. The energetic cost\nduring lap swimming is calculated for the comparison between different corning\nbehaviors. The results show that the implemented particle filter can provide\nprecise and complete trajectories of the tested dolphins, providing fundamental\nfor statistical study of the corning behavior. From the kinematic analysis,\nTT01 is the fastest lap swimmer, with the highest swimming speed for the whole\nlap while performing a sharp turn with small deceleration. TT02 performs\ngreater energetic efficiency than TT01 by transferring more weight at high\nspeed. TT03 shows the highest energetic efficiency by maintaining a slow\nunderwater motion.",

However, their practical\napplicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training\ndistribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in\ndegradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in\ninadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing\nlarge-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light,\nand raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we\nleverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize\nhigh-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we\nintroduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model\ncapable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using\nGenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze,\nrain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are\nintegrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over\n750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on\nthe GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution\nperformance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets.

However, cosmological\nanalyses of FRBs require knowledge of the contribution to the observed DM\ncoming from the FRB host. The size and distribution of this contribution is\nstill uncertain, thus significantly limiting current cosmological FRB analyses.\nIn this study, we extend the baryonification (BCM) approach to derive a\nphysically-motivated, analytic model for predicting the host contribution to\nFRB DMs. By focusing on the statistical properties of FRB host DMs, we find\nthat our simple model is able to reproduce the probability distribution\nfunction (PDF) of host halo DMs measured from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic\nsimulations, as well as their mass- and redshift dependence. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that our model allows for self-consistent predictions of the host\nDM PDF and the matter power spectrum suppression due to baryonic effects, as\nobserved in these simulations, making it promising for modelling\nhost-DM-related systematics in FRB analyses. In general, we find that the shape\nof the host DM PDF is determined by the interplay between the FRB and gas\ndistributions in halos. Our findings indicate that more compact FRB profiles\nrequire shallower gas profiles (and vice versa) in order to match the observed\nDM distributions in hydrodynamic simulations. Furthermore, the analytic model\npresented here shows that the shape of the host DM PDF is highly sensitive to\nthe parameters of the BCM. This suggests that this observable could be used as\nan interesting test bed for baryonic processes, complementing other probes due\nto its sensitivity to feedback on galactic scales.

In addition, we show, for the first time, that the duration of magma\nocean solidification has a major effect on Earth's tungsten isotope anomaly. We\nre-evaluate the six Grand Tack N-body simulations of Rubie et al. (2015). Only\none reproduces epsilon182W=1.9+/-0.1 of Earth's mantle, otherwise accretion is\neither too fast or too slow.

Most active flow control DBD applications are only practical\nat lower Reynolds numbers, and increasing the momentum injection can extend the\npractical uses of the technology. Here, we experimentally demonstrate\nimprovement in the performance of a planar DBD actuator by utilizing an\nAC-augmented electrical field in a three-electrode geometry. Time-resolved\nelectrical and optical measurements, velocity profiles, and direct thrust\nmeasurements were used to characterize the EHD augmentation. Varying phase\nshift and E-field strength between the two air-exposed DBD electrodes can\naccelerate EHD flow and increase EHD forcing by up to ~ 40%. At the most\nfavorable conditions, the maximum thrust was 54 mN/m when the air-exposed\nelectrodes were out of phase. In-phase operation of the exposed electrodes at\nhigh E-field conditions can induce adverse effects and sliding discharge.\nMechanistically, the performance improvements in the AC-augmented DBD actuator\nprimarily come from the additional charge pull action by the third electrode.\nThe insight into the AC-augmented DBD mechanism allows for developing\nmulti-stage arrays capable of further increasing EHD forces.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks stand as the predominant technique for graph\nrepresentation learning owing to their strong expressive power, yet the\nperformance highly depends on the availability of high-quality labels in an\nend-to-end manner. Thus the pretraining and fine-tuning paradigm has been\nproposed to mitigate the label cost issue. Subsequently, the gap between the\npretext tasks and downstream tasks has spurred the development of graph prompt\nlearning which inserts a set of graph prompts into the original graph data with\nminimal parameters while preserving competitive performance. However, the\ncurrent exploratory works are still limited since they all concentrate on\nlearning fixed task-specific prompts which may not generalize well across the\ndiverse instances that the task comprises. To tackle this challenge, we\nintroduce Instance-Aware Graph Prompt Learning (IA-GPL) in this paper, aiming\nto generate distinct prompts tailored to different input instances. The process\ninvolves generating intermediate prompts for each instance using a lightweight\narchitecture, quantizing these prompts through trainable codebook vectors, and\nemploying the exponential moving average technique to ensure stable training.\nExtensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and settings showcase the\nsuperior performance of IA-GPL compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

We aim to utilize both the\npower of LLMs and the supplementary features from the multimedia modalities. In\nthis paper, we present a framework, Lantern, that can improve the performance\nof a certain vanilla model by prompting large language models with\nreceptive-field-aware attention weighting. This framework trained a multi-task\nvanilla model to produce probabilities of emotion classes and dimension scores.\nThese predictions are fed into the LLMs as references to adjust the predicted\nprobabilities of each emotion class with its external knowledge and contextual\nunderstanding. We slice the dialogue into different receptive fields, and each\nsample is included in exactly t receptive fields. Finally, the predictions of\nLLMs are merged with a receptive-field-aware attention-driven weighting module.\nIn the experiments, vanilla models CORECT and SDT are deployed in Lantern with\nGPT-4 or Llama-3.1-405B.

However, with its\nexponential interest comes a growing concern for data privacy and scarcity due\nto the sensitivity of such a topic. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data to improve the\nperformance of depression prediction models. Starting from unstructured,\nnaturalistic text data from recorded transcripts of clinical interviews, we\nutilize an open-source LLM to generate synthetic data through chain-of-thought\nprompting. This pipeline involves two key steps: the first step is the\ngeneration of the synopsis and sentiment analysis based on the original\ntranscript and depression score, while the second is the generation of the\nsynthetic synopsis/sentiment analysis based on the summaries generated in the\nfirst step and a new depression score. Not only was the synthetic data\nsatisfactory in terms of fidelity and privacy-preserving metrics, it also\nbalanced the distribution of severity in the training dataset, thereby\nsignificantly enhancing the model's capability in predicting the intensity of\nthe patient's depression. By leveraging LLMs to generate synthetic data that\ncan be augmented to limited and imbalanced real-world datasets, we demonstrate\na novel approach to addressing data scarcity and privacy concerns commonly\nfaced in automatic depression detection, all while maintaining the statistical\nintegrity of the original dataset.

WordPiece offers a balanced compromise between these characteristics.\nHowever, all tokenizers show limitations in maintaining protein domain\nintegrity, particularly as vocabulary size increases. Analysis of linguistic\nlaw adherence shows partial compliance with Zipf's and Brevity laws but notable\ndeviations from Menzerath's law, suggesting that protein sequences may follow\ndistinct organizational principles from natural languages.

    "abstract": "Vision-based pose estimation of articulated robots with unknown joint angles\nhas applications in collaborative robotics and human-robot interaction tasks.\nCurrent frameworks use neural network encoders to extract image features and\ndownstream layers to predict joint angles and robot pose. While images of\nrobots inherently contain rich information about the robot's physical\nstructures, existing methods often fail to leverage it fully; therefore,\nlimiting performance under occlusions and truncations. To address this, we\nintroduce RoboPEPP, a method that fuses information about the robot's physical\nmodel into the encoder using a masking-based self-supervised\nembedding-predictive architecture. Specifically, we mask the robot's joints and\npre-train an encoder-predictor model to infer the joints' embeddings from\nsurrounding unmasked regions, enhancing the encoder's understanding of the\nrobot's physical model. The pre-trained encoder-predictor pair, along with\njoint angle and keypoint prediction networks, is then fine-tuned for pose and\njoint angle estimation. Random masking of input during fine-tuning and keypoint\nfiltering during evaluation further improves robustness. Our method, evaluated\non several datasets, achieves the best results in robot pose and joint angle\nestimation while being the least sensitive to occlusions and requiring the\nlowest execution time.",

Between the observed ordered cluster and void phases,\nthe studied 2DDP exhibits a more uniform arrangement of particles.

Over the\npast six years, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has\ndiscovered thousands of potential planets by this method, mostly with short\norbital periods, although some have longer reported values over one hundred\ndays. These long orbital periods, however, are note easy to confirm due to\nfrequent lengthy data gaps. Here we show that while the majority of these long\nperiod candidates likely have periods much shorter than reported, there are a\nsizable number of TESS candidates with true long periods. These candidates\ngenerally only have two reported transits, but the periods of duo-transits like\nthis, and even candidates with three or more transits, can be confirmed if the\ndata rules out all possible shorter period aliases. Using TESS data, we confirm\nlong orbital periods for nine candidate planets, and present five others that\nare likely long period. Due to their long periods, these planets will have\nrelatively cool equilibrium temperatures, and may be more likely to host\nexomoons or rings. We present these TOIs, along with a variety of small\ncorrections to other TESS orbital periods and three planet candidates with\npossible transit timing variations, with the goal of refining the TESS data set\nand enabling future research with respect to cool transiting planets.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable planning abilities\nacross various domains, including robotics manipulation and navigation. While\nrecent efforts in robotics have leveraged LLMs both for high-level and\nlow-level planning, these approaches often face significant challenges, such as\nhallucinations in long-horizon tasks and limited adaptability due to the\ngeneration of plans in a single pass without real-time feedback. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a novel multi-agent LLM framework, Multi-Agent\nLarge Language Model for Manipulation (MALMM) that distributes high-level\nplanning and low-level control code generation across specialized LLM agents,\nsupervised by an additional agent that dynamically manages transitions. By\nincorporating observations from the environment after each step, our framework\neffectively handles intermediate failures and enables adaptive re-planning.\nUnlike existing methods, our approach does not rely on pre-trained skill\npolicies or in-context learning examples and generalizes to a variety of new\ntasks. We evaluate our approach on nine RLBench tasks, including long-horizon\ntasks, and demonstrate its ability to solve robotics manipulation in a\nzero-shot setting, thereby overcoming key limitations of existing LLM-based\nmanipulation methods.",

    "abstract": "Air quality is a prevalent concern due to its imposing health risks. The\nstate of Utah, USA, has, at times over the last 20 years, experienced some of\nthe worst air quality in the nation. The propensity for Utah to experience\nelevated concentrations of particulate matter ($\\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$) and ozone\n($\\mathrm{O_3}$) can, in part, be attributed to its unique geography, which\nfeatures dry, mountainous terrain. Valleys in Utah create ideal environments\nfor extended cold-pool events. In this review, we summarize air quality\nresearch conducted in Utah over the past 20 years (2002-2022) by dividing the\nstate into six regions: Utah Valley, Summit County, Southern Utah (regions\nsouth of Utah Valley), Cache Valley, Uinta Basin, and Salt Lake Valley. We\nreview the published literature chronologically and provide a summary for each\nregion, identifying areas where additional research is warranted. We found that\nresearch efforts are heavily weighted toward the Uinta Basin and Salt Lake\nValley, with the remaining regions collectively accounting for only 20% of\nstudies. We identified the need for more source apportionment studies,\nspeciated volatile organic compound (VOC) analyses, and ozone isopleths. Where\nozone isopleths cannot be created, measurements of glyoxal ($\\mathrm{CHOCHO}$)\nand formaldehyde ($\\mathrm{HCHO}$) concentrations could serve as cost-effective\nsurrogates to inform ozone mitigation policies.",

However, the composition of\njets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whether they are baryon dominated or\nPoynting flux dominated, is largely unknown. In the latter case, no comic rays\nand neutrinos are expected from the AGN jets. In this work, we study whether\nthe neutrino emission from TXS 0506+056 could be powered by the accretion flow\nof the supermassive black hole. Protons could be accelerated by magnetic\nreconnection or turbulence in the inner accretion flow. To explain the neutrino\nflare of TXS 0506+056 in the year of 2014-2015, a super-Eddington accretion is\nneeded. During the steady state, a sub-Eddington accretion flow could power a\nsteady neutrino emission that may explain the long-term steady neutrino flux\nfrom TXS 0506+056. We consider the neutrino production in both magnetically\narrested accretion (MAD) flow and the standard and normal evolution (SANE)\nregime of accretion.

A growing number of\nalignment-based fine-tuning algorithms and benchmarks emerged recently, fueling\nthe efforts on effective alignments of pre-trained LLMs to ensure helpful,\nharmless, and honest answers from both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This\npaper tackles this problem by developing an alignment fusion approach, coined\nas $H^3$Fusion, with three unique characteristics. First, $H^3$Fusion ensembles\nmultiple individually aligned LLMs to create a final fine-tuned alignment model\nwith enhanced capabilities beyond those of individual models, delivering robust\nalignment through promoting helpful, harmless, honest fusion. Second,\n$H^3$Fusion leverages the mixture-of-experts (MoE) methodology in two steps. We\nfirst freeze the multi-head attention weights of each individual model while\ntuning the FFN layer during alignment fusion. Then we merge the aligned model\nweights with an expert router according to the type of input instruction and\ndynamically select a subset of experts that are best suited for producing the\noutput response. Finally, we boost the performance of the resulting\n$H^3$3Fusion model by introducing gating loss and regularization terms. The\nformer penalizes the selection errors of the expert-router, and the latter\nmediates the expert weights drifting during fine-tuning and dynamically adjusts\nthe fusion behavior of the resulting model by canalizing the activations on the\nexperts. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets show that\n$H^3$3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest from two aspects:\nit outperforms each individually aligned model by $11.37\\%$, and it provides\nstronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by\n$13.77\\%$.

    "abstract": "The rapid increase in the deployment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites,\ncatering to diverse applications such as communication, Earth observation,\nenvironmental monitoring, and scientific research, has significantly amplified\nthe complexity of trajectory management. The current work focuses on\ncalculating and analyzing perturbation effects on a satellite's anticipated\ntrajectory in LEO, considering Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP) as the main\nperturbing force. The acceleration due to SRP and it's effects on the satellite\nwas calculated using a custom-built Python module mainly based on the\nhypothesis of the cannonball model. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of\nthe proposed model through comprehensive simulations and comparisons with\nexisting analytical and numerical methods. Here, the primary Keplerian orbital\ncharacteristics were employed to analyze a simulated low-earth orbit LEO\nsatellite, initially visualizing the satellite's trajectory and ground tracks\nat a designated altitude. The study also focuses on a comparative analysis of\nground stations, primarily considering the main regions of the subcontinent,\nwith revisit time as the key parameter for comparison. In the end, we combine\nanalytical techniques with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict changes\nin the position vectors of the satellite. Using ML techniques, the model can\nadaptively learn and refine predictions based on historical data and real-time\ninput, thus improving accuracy over time. In addition, the incorporation of\nanalytical methods allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying physics\ngoverning satellite motion, enabling more precise adjustments and corrections.",

This new measurement takes\nadvantage of the enormous statistical power at large scales of DESI DR1 data,\nsurpassing the latest data release (DR16) of the extended Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (eBOSS). For the first time in this kind of analysis, we\nuse a blinding procedure to mitigate the risk of confirmation bias in our\nresults. We improve the model of the radial integral constraint proposing an\ninnovative correction of the window function. We also carefully test the\nmitigation of the dependence of the target selection on the photometry\nqualities by incorporating an angular integral constraint contribution to the\nwindow function, and validate our methodology with the blinded data. Finally,\ncombining the two samples, we measure $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc} =\n{-3.6}_{-9.1}^{+9.0}$ at $68\\%$ confidence, where we assume the universality\nrelation for the LRG sample and a recent merger model for the QSO sample about\nthe response of bias to primordial non-Gaussianity. Adopting the universality\nrelation for the PNG bias in the QSO analysis leads to $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc} =\n3.5_{-7.4}^{+10.7}$ at $68\\%$ confidence. This measurement is the most precise\ndetermination of primordial non-Gaussianity using large-scale structure to\ndate, surpassing the latest result from eBOSS by a factor of $2.3$.",

Inspired by\nthese notions, we define Ext and Tor curvature of pairs of modules. The aim of\nthis article is to study (Ext and Tor) complexity and curvature of pairs of\ncertain CM (Cohen-Macaulay) modules, and establish lower bounds of complexity\nand curvature of pairs of modules in terms of that of a single module.

As a final upshot, these allow us to\ncharacterize complete intersection local rings (including hypersurfaces and\nregular rings) in terms of complexity and curvature of pairs of certain CM\nmodules.

These vulnerabilities arise from programming faults, design flaws,\nincorrect setups, and a lack of security protective measures. To mitigate these\nvulnerabilities, regular software upgrades, code reviews, safe development\ntechniques, and the use of security tools to find and fix problems have been\nimportant. Several ways have been delivered in recent studies to address\ndifficulties related to software vulnerabilities. However, previous approaches\nhave significant limitations, notably in feature embedding and precisely\nrecognizing specific vulnerabilities. To overcome these drawbacks, we present\nCodeGraphNet, an experimental method that combines GraphCodeBERT and Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN) approaches, where, CodeGraphNet reveals data in a\nhigh-dimensional vector space, with comparable or related properties grouped\ncloser together. This method captures intricate relationships between features,\nproviding for more exact identification and separation of vulnerabilities.\nUsing this feature embedding approach, we employed four machine learning\nmodels, applying both independent testing and 10-fold cross-validation. The\nDeepTree model, which is a hybrid of a Decision Tree and a Neural Network,\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches. In additional validation, we evaluated\nour model using feature embeddings from LSA, GloVe, FastText, CodeBERT and\nGraphCodeBERT, and found that the CodeGraphNet method presented improved\nvulnerability identification with 98% of accuracy.

Traditional approaches for developing\nSpeechLMs are constrained by the limited availability of unsupervised speech\ndata and parallel speech-text data, which are significantly less abundant than\ntext pre-training data, thereby limiting their scalability as LLMs. We propose\na novel approach to scaling speech-text pre-training by leveraging large-scale\nsynthetic interleaved data derived from text corpora, eliminating the need for\nparallel speech-text datasets. Our method efficiently constructs speech-text\ninterleaved data by sampling text spans from existing text corpora and\nsynthesizing corresponding speech spans using a text-to-token model, bypassing\nthe need to generate actual speech. We also employ a supervised speech\ntokenizer derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by\nincorporating a vector-quantized bottleneck into the encoder. This supervised\ntraining approach results in discrete speech tokens with strong semantic\npreservation even at lower frame rates (e.g. 12.5Hz), while still maintaining\nspeech reconstruction quality. Starting from a pre-trained language model and\nscaling our pre-training to 1 trillion tokens (with 600B synthetic interleaved\nspeech-text data), we achieve state-of-the-art performance in speech language\nmodeling and spoken question answering, improving performance on spoken\nquestions tasks from the previous SOTA of 13% (Moshi) to 31%.

    "abstract": "The integration of new literature into the English curriculum remains a\nchallenge since educators often lack scalable tools to rapidly evaluate\nreadability and adapt texts for diverse classroom needs. This study proposes to\naddress this gap through a multimodal approach that combines transformer-based\ntext classification with linguistic feature analysis to align texts with UK Key\nStages. Eight state-of-the-art Transformers were fine-tuned on segmented text\ndata, with BERT achieving the highest unimodal F1 score of 0.75. In parallel,\n500 deep neural network topologies were searched for the classification of\nlinguistic characteristics, achieving an F1 score of 0.392. The fusion of these\nmodalities shows a significant improvement, with every multimodal approach\noutperforming all unimodal models. In particular, the ELECTRA Transformer fused\nwith the neural network achieved an F1 score of 0.996. Unimodal and multimodal\napproaches are shown to have statistically significant differences in all\nvalidation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) except for inference\ntime. The proposed approach is finally encapsulated in a stakeholder-facing web\napplication, providing non-technical stakeholder access to real-time insights\non text complexity, reading difficulty, curriculum alignment, and\nrecommendations for learning age range. The application empowers data-driven\ndecision making and reduces manual workload by integrating AI-based\nrecommendations into lesson planning for English literature.",

Consequently, current video editing methods\nprimarily rely on T2I models, which inherently lack temporal-coherence\ngenerative ability, often resulting in inferior editing results. In this paper,\nwe attribute the failure of the typical editing paradigm to: 1) Tightly\nSpatial-temporal Coupling. The vanilla pivotal-based inversion strategy\nstruggles to disentangle spatial-temporal information in the video diffusion\nmodel; 2) Complicated Spatial-temporal Layout. The vanilla cross-attention\ncontrol is deficient in preserving the unedited content. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled guidance (STDG) and\nmulti-frame null-text optimization strategy to provide pivotal temporal cues\nfor more precise pivotal inversion. Furthermore, we introduce a self-attention\ncontrol strategy to maintain higher fidelity for precise partial content\nediting.

The aim of this\nstudy was to investigate user awareness of privacy risks in chatbot\ninteractions, the privacy-preserving behaviours users practice, and how these\nbehaviours relate to their awareness of privacy threats, even when no immediate\nthreat is perceived. Methods: We developed a novel \"privacy-safe\" setup to\nanalyse user behaviour under the guarantees of anonymization and non-sharing.\nWe employed a mixed-methods approach, starting with the quantification of\nbroader trends by coding responses, followed by conducting a qualitative\ncontent analysis to gain deeper insights. Results: Overall, there was a\nsubstantial lack of understanding among users about how chatbot providers\nhandle data (27% of the participants) and the basics of privacy risks (76% of\nthe participants). Older users, in particular, expressed fears that chatbot\nproviders might sell their data. Moreover, even users with privacy knowledge do\nnot consistently exhibit privacy-preserving behaviours when assured of\ntransparent data processing by chatbots. Notably, under-protective behaviours\nwere observed among more expert users.

The solutions for some\nproblems are straightforward. For others, we hope to start a broader\nconversation about refining this influential dataset to better serve future\nresearch.",

Using tools from Algebraic Topology and Persistent Homology (PH),\nwe demonstrate that current benchmark object point clouds lack rich topological\nfeatures that are integral part of point clouds captured in realistic\nenvironments. To facilitate research in this direction, we contribute the first\nreal-world industrial dataset for point cloud completion, RealPC - a diverse,\nrich and varied set of point clouds. It consists of ~ 40,000 pairs across 21\ncategories of industrial structures in railway establishments. Benchmark\nresults on several strong baselines reveal that existing methods fail in\nreal-world scenarios. We discover a striking observation - unlike current\ndatasets, RealPC consists of multiple 0- and 1-dimensional PH-based topological\nfeatures. We prove that integrating these topological priors into existing\nworks helps improve completion. We present how 0-dimensional PH priors extract\nthe global topology of a complete shape in the form of a 3D skeleton and assist\na model in generating topologically consistent complete shapes. Since computing\nHomology is expensive, we present a simple, yet effective Homology Sampler\nguided network, BOSHNet that bypasses the Homology computation by sampling\nproxy backbones akin to 0-dim PH.

However, the efficient treatment\ndelivery of ARC is challenging due to the required frequent energy changes\nduring the continuous gantry rotation. This work proposes a novel method that\ndelivers a multiple IMPT (multi-IMPT) plan that is equivalent to ARC in terms\nof biologically effective dose (BED).\n  Approach: The proposed multi-IMPT method utilizes a different subset of\nlimited number of beam angles in each fraction for dose delivery. Due to the\ndifferent dose delivered to organs at risk (OAR) in each fraction, we optimize\nbiologically effective dose (BED) for OAR and the physical dose delivered for\ntarget in each fraction. The BED-based multi-IMPT inverse optimization problem\nis solved via the iterative convex relaxation method and the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-IMPT\nmethod is evaluated in terms of dose objectives in comparison with ARC.\n  Main results: Multi-IMPT provided similar plan quality with ARC. For example,\nmulti-IMPT provided better OAR sparing and slightly better target dose coverage\nfor the prostate case; similar dose distribution for the lung case; slightly\nworse dose coverage for the brain case; better dose coverage but slightly\nhigher BED in OAR for the head-and-neck case.\n  Significance: We have proposed a multi-IMPT approach to deliver\nARC-equivalent plan quality.\n  Keywords: biologically effective dose (BED), proton arc therapy",

However, WMH are challenging to segment due to their high\nvariability in shape, location, size, poorly defined borders, and similar\nintensity profile to other pathologies (e.g stroke lesions) and artefacts (e.g\nhead motion). In this work, we assess the utility and semantic properties of\nthe most effective techniques for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in\nsegmentation for the WMH segmentation task across multiple test-time data\ndistributions. We find UQ techniques reduce 'silent failure' by identifying in\nUQ maps small WMH clusters in the deep white matter that are unsegmented by the\nmodel. A combination of Stochastic Segmentation Networks with Deep Ensembles\nalso yields the highest Dice and lowest Absolute Volume Difference % (AVD)\nscore and can highlight areas where there is ambiguity between WMH and stroke\nlesions. We further demonstrate the downstream utility of UQ, proposing a novel\nmethod for classification of the clinical Fazekas score using spatial features\nextracted from voxelwise WMH probability and UQ maps. We show that\nincorporating WMH uncertainty information improves Fazekas classification\nperformance and calibration.

However, the increased reliance on such automation\nintroduces critical security risks. Notably, given that LLMs have to be trained\non vast datasets of codes that are typically sourced from publicly available\nrepositories (often without thorough validation), LLMs are susceptible to\nso-called data poisoning or backdoor attacks.

    "abstract": "Estimating the true background in an astronomical image is fundamental to\ndetecting faint sources. In a typical low-photon count astronomical image, such\nas in the far and near-ultraviolet wavelength range, conventional methods\nrelying on the 3-sigma clipping and median or mode estimation often fail to\ncapture the true background level accurately. As a consequence, differentiating\ntrue sources from noise peaks remains a challenging task. Additionally, in such\nimages, effectively identifying and excluding faint sources during the\nbackground estimation process remains crucial, as undetected faint sources\ncould contaminate the background. This results in overestimating the true\nbackground and obscuring the detection of very faint sources. To tackle this\nproblem, we introduce a geometric approach based on the method of steepest\ndescent to identify local minima in an astronomical image. The proposed\nalgorithm based on the minima statistics effectively reduces the confusion\nbetween sources and background in the image; thereby ensuring a better\nbackground estimation and enhancing the reliability of faint source detection.\nOur algorithm performs well compared to conventional methods in estimating the\nbackground even in crowded field images. In low-photon count, less crowded\nimages, our algorithm recovers the background within 10\\%, while traditional\nmethods drastically underestimate it by a few orders of magnitude. In crowded\nfields, the conventional methods overestimates the background by $\\sim 200\\%$\nwhereas our algorithm recovers the true background within $\\sim 14\\%$. We\nprovide a simple prescription to create a background map using our algorithm\nand discuss its application in large astronomical surveys.",

It is therefore important to build stellar models that are\nchemically self-consistent in terms of their structure, atmosphere, and\nopacity. In this work we present the first chemically self-consistent stellar\nmodels of the Milky Way globular cluster NGC 2808 using MARCS model\natmospheres, OPLIB high-temperature radiative opacities, and AESOPUS\nlow-temperature radiative opacities. These stellar models were fit to the NGC\n2808 photometry using Fidanka , a new software tool that was developed to\noptimally fit cluster photometry to isochrones and for population synthesis.\nFidanka can determine, in a relatively unbiased way, the ideal number of\ndistinct populations that exist within a dataset and then fit isochrones to\neach population. We achieve this outcome through a combination of Bayesian\nGaussian Mixture Modeling and a novel number density estimation algorithm.\nUsing Fidanka and F275W-F814W photometry from the Hubble UV Globular Cluster\nSurvey we find that the helium abundance of the second generation of stars in\nNGC 2808 is higher than the first generation by $15\\pm3\\%$. This is in\nagreement with previous studies of NGC 2808. This work, along with previous\nwork by Dotter et al.

One process\ntransports material outward in a strong shock, similar to what occurs in 1D\nsimulations of radially pulsating AGB stars. Another mechanism is triggered by\na large convective upflow structure, in combination with exceptionally strong\nradial pulsations. This induces Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, causing plumes\nof material to be sent outward into the atmosphere. The third and rarest\nscenario involves large-amplitude convective fluctuations, leading to enhanced\nflows in deep downdrafts, which rebound and send material outward. In all\ncases, the dense gas above the stellar surface cools and darkens rapidly in\nvisible light. AGB stars show localized dark patches regularly during\nintermediate phases of their large-amplitude pulsations, while more massive\nstars will only intermittently form such patches during luminosity minima.\n  The episodic levitation of dense gas clumps above the stellar surface,\nfollowed by the formation of complex molecules in the cooling gas and possibly\ndust grains at a later stage, can account for the dark patches and strong\ndimming events of supergiant stars such as Betelgeuse.",

Our approach frames\nidentifiability as an existence and uniqueness problem in a closely related\nelliptic equation and draws, for homogeneous equations, on the well-known\nFredholm alternative to establish unconditional identifiability, and cases\nwhere specific choices of initial and boundary conditions lead to\nnon-identifiability. While in some sense pathological, we demonstrate that this\nloss of structural identifiability has ramifications for practical\nidentifiability; important particularly for spatial problems, where the initial\ncondition is often limited by experimental constraints. For cases with\nnonlinear reaction terms, uniqueness of solutions to the auxiliary elliptic\nequation corresponds to identifiability, often leading to unconditional global\nidentifiability under mild assumptions. We present analysis for a suite of\nsimple scalar models with various boundary conditions that include linear\n(exponential) and nonlinear (logistic) source terms, and a special case of a\ntwo-species cell motility model. We conclude by discussing how this new\nperspective enables well-developed analysis tools to advance the developing\ntheory underlying structural identifiability of partial differential equations.",

An input-constrained CBF is proposed to dynamically regulate the\npursuer's control, ensuring effective target pursuit even when the target\nperforms evasive maneuvers. To further ensure safety, two sets of CBF\nconstraints are designed to regulate the pursuer's position, enabling it to\nkeep the target within the sensing range while avoiding collision in complex\nenvironments with external disturbances. These three CBFs collectively form our\nsafety filter, which filters unsafe outputs from RL by solving a Quadratic\nProgram (QP). Finally, the safety filter, combined with a switch strategy that\nenhances the feasibility of solving its QP, constitutes the Control Barrier\nFunction (CBF)-Safe Reinforcement Learning (CSRL) algorithm, whose solutions\nare proven to satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for all safety\nconstraints. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the CSRL\nalgorithm, demonstrating its ability to handle complex pursuit scenarios while\nmaintaining safety and improving control performance.",

A performance model analytically describes the\nrelationship between the performance of a system and its runtime activities.\nThis process typically examines various aspects of a system's runtime behavior,\nsuch as the execution frequency of functions or methods, to forecast\nperformance metrics like program execution time. By using performance models,\ndevelopers can predict expected performance and thereby effectively identify\nand address unexpected performance regressions when actual performance deviates\nfrom the model's predictions. One common and precise method for capturing\nperformance behavior is software tracing, which involves instrumenting the\nexecution of a program, either at the kernel level (e.g., system calls) or\napplication level (e.g., function calls). However, due to the nature of\ntracing, it can be highly resource-intensive, making it impractical for\nproduction environments where resources are limited. In this work, we propose\nstatistical approaches to reduce tracing overhead by identifying and excluding\nperformance-insensitive code regions, particularly application-level functions,\nfrom tracing while still building accurate performance models that can capture\nperformance degradations. By selecting an optimal set of functions to be\ntraced, we can construct optimized performance models that achieve an R-2 score\nof up to 99% and, sometimes, outperform full tracing models (models using\nnon-optimized tracing data), while significantly reducing the tracing overhead\nby more than 80% in most cases. Our optimized performance models can also\ncapture performance regressions in our studied programs effectively,\ndemonstrating their usefulness in real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Mediation analysis for survival outcomes is challenging. Most existing\nmethods quantify the treatment effect using the hazard ratio (HR) and attempt\nto decompose the HR into the direct effect of treatment plus an indirect, or\nmediated, effect. However, the HR is not expressible as an expectation, which\ncomplicates this decomposition, both in terms of estimation and interpretation.\nHere, we present an alternative approach which leverages pseudo-values to\nsimplify estimation and inference. Pseudo-values take censoring into account\nduring their construction, and once derived, can be modeled in the same way as\nany continuous outcome. Thus, pseudo-values enable mediation analysis for a\nsurvival outcome to fit seamlessly into standard mediation software (e.g.\nCMAverse in R). Pseudo-values are easy to calculate via a\nleave-one-observation-out procedure (i.e. jackknifing) and the calculation can\nbe accelerated when the influence function of the estimator is known. Mediation\nanalysis for causal effects defined by survival probabilities, restricted mean\nsurvival time, and cumulative incidence functions - in the presence of\ncompeting risks - can all be performed within this framework. Extensive\nsimulation studies demonstrate that the method is unbiased across 324\nscenarios/estimands and controls the type-I error at the nominal level under\nthe null of no mediation. We illustrate the approach using data from the\nPARADIGMS clinical trial for the treatment of pediatric multiple sclerosis\nusing fingolimod. In particular, we evaluate whether an imaging biomarker lies\non the causal path between treatment and time-to-relapse, which aids in\njustifying this biomarker as a surrogate outcome. Our approach greatly\nsimplifies mediation analysis for survival data and provides a decomposition of\nthe total effect that is both intuitive and interpretable.",

Additionally, there is a semantic\ndiscrepancy between text and motion, leading to inconsistency between the\ngenerated motions and the text descriptions. In this work, we propose a novel\ndiffusion-based FTMoMamba framework equipped with a Frequency State Space Model\n(FreqSSM) and a Text State Space Model (TextSSM). Specifically, to learn\nfine-grained representation, FreqSSM decomposes sequences into low-frequency\nand high-frequency components, guiding the generation of static pose (e.g.,\nsits, lay) and fine-grained motions (e.g., transition, stumble), respectively.\nTo ensure the consistency between text and motion, TextSSM encodes text\nfeatures at the sentence level, aligning textual semantics with sequential\nfeatures. Extensive experiments show that FTMoMamba achieves superior\nperformance on the text-to-motion generation task, especially gaining the\nlowest FID of 0.181 (rather lower than 0.421 of MLD) on the HumanML3D dataset.",

Granular materials, driven out of equilibrium by\nenergy dissipation during collisions, serve as an ideal platform to investigate\nthese systems, offering insights into the parallels and distinctions between\nequilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior. For example, the coexisting\ndense phase is typically colder than the dilute phase, a result usually\nattributed to greater dissipation in denser regions.

This counterintuitive phenomenon arises because the collision\nfrequency can be lower in the solid phase than in the liquid phase, consistent\nwith equilibrium results for hard-disk systems.

They generally assume stationary data, i.e.,\nfixed transition probabilities between observations/states. However, live,\nreal-world processes, like in the context of activity tracking, biological time\nseries, or industrial monitoring, often switch behavior over time. Such\nbehavior switches can be modeled as transitions between higher-level\n\\emph{modes} (e.g., running, walking, etc.). Yet all modes are usually not\npreviously known, often exhibit vastly differing transition probabilities, and\ncan switch unpredictably. Thus, to track behavior changes of live, real-world\nprocesses, this study proposes an online and efficient method to construct\nEvolving Markov chains (EMCs). EMCs adaptively track transition probabilities,\nautomatically discover modes, and detect mode switches in an online manner. In\ncontrast to previous work, EMCs are of arbitrary order, the proposed update\nscheme does not rely on tracking windows, only updates the relevant region of\nthe probability tensor, and enjoys geometric convergence of the expected\nestimates. Our evaluation of synthetic data and real-world applications on\nhuman activity recognition, electric motor condition monitoring, and eye-state\nrecognition from electroencephalography (EEG) measurements illustrates the\nversatility of the approach and points to the potential of EMCs to efficiently\ntrack, model, and understand live, real-world processes.",

At low temperatures (4.2 K), individual\nNiCp$_2$ molecules adsorb on the herringbone elbows and step edges, forming\nordered patterns as molecular coverage increases. However, at 77 K, the\nmolecules dissociate, yielding two main fragments: NiCp fragments that are Ni\natoms capped by cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings, which preferentially adsorb at FCC\nhollow sites, and Cp radical fragments exhibiting strong substrate\ninteractions. NiCp fragments self-assemble into one-dimensional (1-D) chains\nalong the $\\langle 1 1 \\bar{2} \\rangle$ directions, displaying higher\nprotrusion in STM images. The strain and steric hindrance from the Cp protons\ninduce chiral patterns within the chains, which are well-reproduced by our DFT\nsimulations.

While recent advances have shed light on turbulence and its role\nin particle clustering, a comprehensive theoretical framework linking\nturbulence characteristics to particle cluster properties and planetesimal mass\nfunction remains incomplete. Recently, a kinetic field theory for ensembles of\npoint-like classical particles in or out of equilibrium has been applied to\ncosmic structure formation. This theory encodes the dynamics of a classical\nparticle ensemble by a generating functional specified by the initial\nprobability distribution of particles in phase space and their equations of\nmotion.

A model\nfor the initial probability distribution of dust particles in phase space is\nobtained from a quasi-initial state for a three-dimensional\nstreaming-instability simulation that is a particle distribution with\nvelocities for gas and particles from the Nakagawa relations. The equations of\nmotion are chosen for the simplest case of freely streaming particles. We\ncalculate the non-linearly evolved density power spectrum of dust particles and\nfind that it develops a universal $k^{-3}$ tail at small scales, suggesting\nscale-invariant structure formation below a characteristic and time-dependent\nlength scale.

    "abstract": "The Covering Tour Location Routing Problem (CTLRP) unites the well-known\nlocation routing problem with the possibility of covering customers through\nintermediary facilities. The objective is to select a subset of greenfield or\nbrownfield depots and a subset of facilities, assign customers to suitable\nfacilities, and design routes for a fleet of vehicles such that each customer's\ndemand of a homogenous good can be satisfied and a given objective function is\nminimized. We focus particularly on the case when customers can not be directly\nvisited, i.e. they have to pick up their orders from intermediary facilities,\nand the objective function consists of the strategic and operational costs,\ni.e. total routing costs plus costs for establishing or operating the selected\ndepots and facilities. We introduce a mixed-integer programming model derived\nfrom a 2-commodity flow formulation, which can be seen as a baseline model for\nvarious applications. As such models are often impractical to solve for\nrealistically-sized scenarios, a local search-based matheuristic to solve the\nproblem at hand is developed. Furthermore, we construct benchmark instances for\nthe CTLRP by expanding existing LRP instances to include information on\nfacilities and customers. Extensive computational experiments on said instances\nwith the aim of analyzing different heuristic configurations show that the\nproposed heuristic, if designed carefully, is able to produce very good results\nwithin a short period of time, while exact solving methods using the proposed\nMIP formulation frequently return highly suboptimal solutions and exhibit slow\nconvergence speeds.",

When\nthe verifier is imperfect, as it almost always is in domains such as reasoning\nor coding (for example, unit tests have imperfect coverage), there is a nonzero\nprobability of false positives: incorrect solutions that pass the verifier.\nResampling cannot decrease this probability, so it imposes an upper bound to\nthe accuracy of resampling-based inference scaling even with an infinite\ncompute budget. We find that there is a very strong correlation between the\nmodel's single-sample accuracy (i.e. accuracy without unit tests) and its false\npositive rate on coding benchmarks HumanEval and MBPP, whose unit tests have\nlimited coverage. Therefore, no amount of inference scaling of weaker models\ncan enable them to match the single-sample accuracy of a sufficiently strong\nmodel (Fig. 1a). When we consider that false positives have a negative utility\ncompared to abstaining from producing a solution, it bends the inference\nscaling curve further downward. Empirically, we find that the optimal number of\nsamples can be less than 10 under realistic assumptions (Fig. 1b).

After carefully accounting for the effects of atmospheric seeing\nthat had smeared the emission from known compact nuclear outflows across the\nMUSE field of view, we find that the large-scale kinematics in F13451+1232 are\nconsistent with gravitational motions that are expected in a galaxy merger.\nTherefore, the fast ($\\mathrm{W_{80}}>500$ km s$^{-1}$) warm-ionised AGN-driven\noutflows in this object are limited to the central $\\sim$100 pc of the galaxy,\nalthough we cannot rule out larger-scale, lower-velocity outflows. Moreover, we\ndirectly demonstrate that failure to account for the beam-smearing effects of\natmospheric seeing would have led to the mass outflow rates and kinetic powers\nof spatially-extended emission being overestimated by orders of magnitude. We\nalso show that beam-smeared compact-outflow emission can be significant beyond\nradial distances of 3.5 arcseconds (more than eight times the radius of the\nseeing disk), and support the argument that some previous claims of large-scale\noutflows in active galaxies were likely the result of this effect rather than\ngenuine galaxy-wide ($r>5$ kpc) outflows.

In the two molecules Tb(III) magnetic ion has\nan isotructural coordination sphere, but in the former the Tb(III) is\ncoordinated by an organic paramagnetic ligand (SQ), while the latter is\ncoordinated by a diamagnetic one (Trp). Thus Tb-SQ presents an exchange\ninteraction between the Tb(III) ion and a radical while Tb-Trp does not. Both\nthe samples exhibit a muon spin-lattice relaxation rate $\\lambda_1(T, B_L)$\npeak in the temperature range 10-25 K at all applied longitudinal magnetic\nfields $B_L = 50, 150, 300$ mT. In Tb-SQ, $\\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ displays a\nBPP-like behavior led by three different correlations times: the first,\ndominating for $T\\geq15K$, follows a thermally activated law $\\tau_c =\\tau_0\n\\exp(\\sigma_A / k_B T)$ with energy barrier $\\sigma_A/k_B$, while the second\nand third ones, dominating respectively for $8<T<15$ K and $T<8$ K, follow a\npower-law-like behavior $\\tau_c = c_0 T^{-\\alpha}$ with two different values of\n$c_0$ and $\\alpha$. On the other hand, the temperature and field behavior of\n$\\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ in Tb-Trp strongly deviates from a BPP law, displaying a\nstrongly anomalous character. Our results indicate that, in the absence of an\nexchange interaction and maintaining all the other relevant interactions\nconstants, the local spin dynamics of single ion magnets strongly differ from\nthe one observed in the presence of such interaction. The combination of\n$\\mu$SR and AC susceptibility allows us to disentangle the different Orbach,\nRaman and direct mechanisms which are the key ingredients that control the spin\ndynamics in Tb-SQ, and evidence the potentiality of $\\mu$SR in elucidating\ncomplex spin dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from\nsparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views\nand identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images\nand the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable\nartifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of\nnovel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as\ninpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has\nestablished a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image\nquality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures\n(arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric,\nPuzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our\napproach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a\nscene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed\nregions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate\ncross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a\nnovel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen\nreconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating\nwith human assessment, even without aligned references.

Here, we revisit the\nassociative memory problem in light of recent advances in understanding\nspike-based computation. Using a recently-established geometric framework, we\nshow that the spiking activity for a large class of all-inhibitory networks is\nsituated on a low-dimensional, convex, and piecewise-linear manifold, with\ndynamics that move along the manifold. We then map the associative memory\nproblem onto these dynamics, and demonstrate how the vertices of a hypercubic\nmanifold can be used to store stable, overlapping activity patterns with a\ndirect correspondence to the original Hopfield model. We propose several\nlearning rules, and demonstrate a linear scaling of the storage capacity with\nthe number of neurons, as well as robust pattern completion abilities. Overall,\nthis work serves as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a\ngeometrical perspective to design dynamics on neural manifolds, with\nimplications for neuroscience and machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Similarity search is a fundamental operation for analyzing data series (DS),\nwhich are ordered sequences of real values. To enhance efficiency,\nsummarization techniques are employed that reduce the dimensionality of DS.\nSAX-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for exact similarity queries, but\ntheir performance degrades for high-frequency signals, such as noisy data, or\nfor high-frequency DS. In this work, we present the SymbOlic Fourier\nApproximation index (SOFA), which implements fast, exact similarity queries.\nSOFA is based on two building blocks: a tree index (inspired by MESSI) and the\nSFA symbolic summarization. It makes use of a learned summarization method\ncalled Symbolic Fourier Approximation (SFA), which is based on the Fourier\ntransform and utilizes a data-adaptive quantization of the frequency domain. To\nbetter capture relevant information in high-frequency signals, SFA selects the\nFourier coefficients by highest variance, resulting in a larger value range,\nthus larger quantization bins. The tree index solution employed by SOFA makes\nuse of the GEMINI-approach to answer exact similarity search queries using\nlower bounding distance measures, and an efficient SIMD implementation. We\nfurther propose a novel benchmark comprising $17$ diverse datasets,\nencompassing 1 billion DS. Our experimental results demonstrate that SOFA\noutperforms existing methods on exact similarity queries: it is up to 10 times\nfaster than a parallel sequential scan, 3-4 times faster than FAISS, and 2\ntimes faster on average than MESSI. For high-frequency datasets, we observe a\nremarkable 38-fold performance improvement.",

This is impractical in real-world applications, as constructing temporal\nlabels requires significant labor costs, and the correspondence is often\nunknown. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-task Mutual Reinforcing\nEmbedded Joint Video Paragraph Retrieval and Grounding method (DMR-JRG). In\nthis method, retrieval and grounding tasks are mutually reinforced rather than\nbeing treated as separate issues. DMR-JRG mainly consists of two branches: a\nretrieval branch and a grounding branch. The retrieval branch uses inter-video\ncontrastive learning to roughly align the global features of paragraphs and\nvideos, reducing modality differences and constructing a coarse-grained feature\nspace to break free from the need for correspondence between paragraphs and\nvideos. Additionally, this coarse-grained feature space further facilitates the\ngrounding branch in extracting fine-grained contextual representations. In the\ngrounding branch, we achieve precise cross-modal matching and grounding by\nexploring the consistency between local, global, and temporal dimensions of\nvideo segments and textual paragraphs. By synergizing these dimensions, we\nconstruct a fine-grained feature space for video and textual features, greatly\nreducing the need for large-scale annotated temporal labels.",

    "abstract": "Energy storage scheduling problems, where a storage is operated to maximize\nits profit in response to a price signal, are essentially infinite-horizon\noptimization problems as storage systems operate continuously, without a\nforeseen end to their operation. Such problems can be solved to optimality with\na rolling-horizon approach, provided that the planning horizon over which the\nproblem is solved is long enough. Such a horizon is termed a forecast horizon.\nHowever, the length of the planning horizon is usually chosen arbitrarily for\nsuch applications. We introduce an easy-to-check condition that confirms\nwhether a planning horizon is a forecast horizon, and which can be used to\nderive a bound on suboptimality when it is not the case. By way of an example,\nwe demonstrate that the existence of forecast horizons is not guaranteed for\nthis problem. We also derive a lower bound on the length of the minimum\nforecast horizon. We show how the condition introduced can be used as part of\nan algorithm to determine the minimum forecast horizon of the problem, which\nensures the determination of optimal solutions at the lowest computational and\nforecasting costs. Finally, we provide insights into the implications of\ndifferent planning horizons for a range of storage system characteristics.",

The drastic changes\nin these systems around their EPs have led to unique entanglement dynamics,\nwhich remained elusive until quite recently. In this work, we theoretically\ninvestigate the robustness of tripartite entanglement induced by EPs of the\npassive PT-symmetric non-Hermitian superconducting qubits, both in stand-alone\nconfigurations and hybrid setups with Hermitian qubits. In particular, we\nconsider the qubits with both all-to-all and nearest-neighbour couplings under\nuniform and non-uniform coupling strengths. Our results reveal that\nnon-Hermitian qubits with all-to-all coupling generate GHZ states, while those\nwith nearest-neighbour interactions produce W states. These entangled states\nare resilient to non-uniform couplings and off-resonant driving fields.\nMoreover, the hybrid configurations combining Hermitian and non-Hermitian\nqubits suggest the importance of EPs for generating and maintaining genuine\ntripartite entanglement in our system. Additionally, driving the PT-symmetric\nqubits with a strong Rabi frequency can help sustain tripartite entanglement\nover time by countering losses, while strong inter-qubit coupling can benefit\nthese entangled states in the low dissipation regime. These findings suggest\nthat exploiting non-Hermitian systems and their associated EPs can create\nrobust entangled states which are useful for both fundamental studies and\nquantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "A counterattack in soccer is a high speed, high intensity direct attack that\ncan occur when a team transitions from a defensive state to an attacking state\nafter regaining possession of the ball. The aim is to create a goal-scoring\nopportunity by convering a lot of ground with minimal passes before the\nopposing team can recover their defensive shape. The purpose of this research\nis to build gender-specific Graph Neural Networks to model the likelihood of a\ncounterattack being successful and uncover what factors make them successful in\nprofessional soccer. These models are trained on a total of 20863 frames of\nsynchronized on-ball event and spatiotemporal (broadcast) tracking data. This\ndataset is derived from 632 games of MLS (2022), NWSL (2022) and international\nsoccer (2020-2022). With this data we demonstrate that gender-specific Graph\nNeural Networks outperform architecturally identical gender-ambiguous models in\npredicting the successful outcome of counterattacks. We show, using Permutation\nFeature Importance, that byline to byline speed, angle to the goal, angle to\nthe ball and sideline to sideline speed are the node features with the highest\nimpact on model performance. Additionally, we offer some illustrative examples\non how to navigate the infinite solution search space to aid in identifying\nimprovements for player decision making.\n  This research is accompanied by an open-source repository containing all data\nand code, and it is also accompanied by an open-source Python package which\nsimplifies converting spatiotemporal data into graphs. This package also\nfacilitates testing, validation, training and prediction with this data. This\nshould allow the reader to replicate and improve upon our research more easily.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel efficient method for spatial monitoring of the\ndistribution of correlated field signals, such as temperature, humidity, etc.\nusing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The spatial signal is compressed to its\niso-contour lines at a number of known levels that are introduced by data\nfusion center (DFC). The UAV traces a contour line of the field signal at a\ntime, and reports the coordinates of its own traces to the DFC for spatial\nmodeling. The DFC iteratively improves the spatial model of the field signal\nand assigns a new contour level to each UAV to trace and report its coordinates\nfor spatial model improvement. The selected batch of levels and the start point\nof the search are introduced by the DFC. In order to reduce the required data\nfor spatial modeling, and accordingly improve the algorithm data efficiency,\ndual stochastic gradient routines are used at the DFC to find a next proper\nnumber of contour levels in the batch, and to eliminate the redundant contour\nlevels, in each iteration. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm\nbased on computer simulations demonstrates significantly faster convergence,\nbetter signal estimation, and a higher data efficiency against when the\nstochastic gradient is not used.",

More\nspecifically, we consider the time evolution of solutions to the cubic\n(defocusing) wave equation on a four-dimensional static, spherically symmetric,\nand asymptotically flat (horizonless) spacetime admitting a stable photon\nsphere.\n  Our study shows fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear scalar\ndynamics. The local energy, as well as all local higher-order energies, of\nsolutions to the linear wave equation on our model spacetime can be rigorously\nproven to remain uniformly bounded and to decay uniformly in time. However, due\nto the presence of stable trapping, the uniform decay rate is slow. To help\nelucidate how the slow linear decay affects solutions to the nonlinear wave\nequation considered, we examine numerical solutions of the latter, restricting\nto axisymmetric initial data in this work. In contrast to the linear dynamics,\nwe exhibit a family of nonlinear solutions with turbulent behaviour: Within the\nregion of stable trapping, the slow linear decay allows local higher-order\nenergies of the nonlinear solution to grow over the time interval that we\nnumerically evolve, with the growth being induced by a direct energy cascade.\n  As a complement to the numerical analysis, we provide a heuristic argument\nsuggesting that, if a similar behaviour occurs for gravitational wave\nperturbations of the motivating spacetimes in general relativity, it would\nlikely not generically lead to black hole or singularity formation.",

It is an important task in\nvideo generation but remains an open problem for generative models. This paper\npushes the technical frontier of IPT2V in two directions that have not been\nresolved in literature: (1) A tuning-free pipeline without tedious case-by-case\nfinetuning, and (2) A frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based\ncontrol scheme. We propose ConsisID, a tuning-free DiT-based controllable IPT2V\nmodel to keep human identity consistent in the generated video. Inspired by\nprior findings in frequency analysis of diffusion transformers, it employs\nidentity-control signals in the frequency domain, where facial features can be\ndecomposed into low-frequency global features and high-frequency intrinsic\nfeatures. First, from a low-frequency perspective, we introduce a global facial\nextractor, which encodes reference images and facial key points into a latent\nspace, generating features enriched with low-frequency information. These\nfeatures are then integrated into shallow layers of the network to alleviate\ntraining challenges associated with DiT. Second, from a high-frequency\nperspective, we design a local facial extractor to capture high-frequency\ndetails and inject them into transformer blocks, enhancing the model's ability\nto preserve fine-grained features. We propose a hierarchical training strategy\nto leverage frequency information for identity preservation, transforming a\nvanilla pre-trained video generation model into an IPT2V model. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our frequency-aware heuristic scheme provides an\noptimal control solution for DiT-based models.

A\nkey question in designing such agents is how best to instantiate the\nrepresentational space that will interface between these two levels -- ideally\nwithout requiring supervision in the form of expensive data annotations. These\nobjectives can be efficiently achieved by representing the world in terms of\nobjects (grounded in perception and action). In this work, we present a novel,\nbrain-inspired, deep-learning architecture that learns from pixels to\ninterpret, control, and reason about its environment, using object-centric\nrepresentations. We show the utility of our approach through tasks in synthetic\nenvironments that require a combination of (high-level) logical reasoning and\n(low-level) continuous control. Results show that the agent can learn emergent\nconditional behavioural reasoning, such as $(A \\to B) \\land (\\neg A \\to C)$, as\nwell as logical composition $(A \\to B) \\land (A \\to C) \\vdash A \\to (B \\land\nC)$ and XOR operations, and successfully controls its environment to satisfy\nobjectives deduced from these logical rules. The agent can adapt online to\nunexpected changes in its environment and is robust to mild violations of its\nworld model, thanks to dynamic internal desired goal generation. While the\npresent results are limited to synthetic settings (2D and 3D activated versions\nof dSprites), which fall short of real-world levels of complexity, the proposed\narchitecture shows how to manipulate grounded object representations, as a key\ninductive bias for unsupervised learning, to enable behavioral reasoning.",

    "abstract": "This article introduces a novel methodology that integrates singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) with a shallow linear neural network for forecasting high\nresolution fluid mechanics data. The method, termed LC-SVD-DLinear, combines a\nlow-cost variant of singular value decomposition (LC-SVD) with the DLinear\narchitecture, which decomposes the input features-specifically, the temporal\ncoefficients-into trend and seasonality components, enabling a shallow neural\nnetwork to capture the non-linear dynamics of the temporal data. This\nmethodology uses under-resolved data, which can either be input directly into\nthe hybrid model or downsampled from high resolution using two distinct\ntechniques provided by the methodology. Working with under-resolved cases helps\nreduce the overall computational cost. Additionally, we present a variant of\nthe method, LC-HOSVD-DLinear, which combines a low-cost version of the\nhigh-order singular value decomposition (LC-HOSVD) algorithm with the DLinear\nnetwork, designed for high-order data. These approaches have been validated\nusing two datasets: first, a numerical simulation of three-dimensional flow\npast a circular cylinder at $Re = 220$; and second, an experimental dataset of\nturbulent flow passing a circular cylinder at $Re = 2600$. The combination of\nthese datasets demonstrates the robustness of the method.

    "abstract": "Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising technique for the\nnext-generation communication systems, in which the generation at the receiver\nside is allowed with semantic features' recovery. However, the majority of\nexisting research predominantly utilizes a singular type of semantic\ninformation, such as text, images, or speech, to supervise and choose the\ngenerated source signals, which may not sufficiently encapsulate the\ncomprehensive and accurate semantic information, and thus creating a\nperformance bottleneck. In order to bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose\nand investigate a SemCom framework using multimodal information to supervise\nthe generated image. To be specific, in this framework, we first extract\nsemantic features at both the image and text levels utilizing the Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) architecture and the Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-Training (CLIP) model before transmission. Then, we employ a generative\ndiffusion model at the receiver to generate multiple images. In order to ensure\nthe accurate extraction and facilitate high-fidelity image reconstruction, we\nselect the \"best\" image with the minimum reconstruction errors by taking both\nthe aided image and text semantic features into account. We further extend\nmultimodal semantic communication (MMSemCom) system to the multiuser scenario\nfor orthogonal transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nframework can not only achieve the enhanced fidelity and robustness in image\ntransmission compared with existing communication systems but also sustain a\nhigh performance in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.",

Multiscale in nature, the method based on image analysis\nassociates a scale distribution with a family of ligaments, this distribution\nbeing sensitive to the number, size and shape of these ligaments. The quality\nof scale distributions measured by image analysis depends on the spatial\nresolution and the precision of area measurements of surfaces with curved\nboundaries but described by square pixels. Part of the work consisted of\nimproving the method for measuring scale distributions by using a subpixel\nimage analysis technique and refining the surface area measurement method.\nAnother part directed the multiscale analysis towards the estimation of the\ndiameter distributions of the blobs that characterize the large-scale\ndeformation of the ligaments. The analysis describes the atomization process at\na level of detail never reached. For instance, assuming that the blobs are\ndrops in formation, the estimated diameter distribution (bimodal in the case\nexamined here) as well as the number of these drops are evaluated as a function\nof the distance from the injector. This information indicates where the process\nis most intense and where it stops.

To address this problem,\nwe propose a method that can efficiently utilize structural magnetic resonance\nimaging (sMRI) image information to generate high-quality PET images. Our\ngeneration model efficiently utilizes pyramid convolution combined with channel\nattention mechanism to extract multi-scale local features in sMRI, and injects\nglobal correlation information into these features using self-attention\nmechanism to ensure the restoration of the generated PET image on local texture\nand global structure. Additionally, we introduce additional loss functions to\nguide the generation model in producing higher-quality PET images. Through\nexperiments conducted on publicly available ADNI databases, the generated\nimages outperform previous research methods in various performance indicators\n(average absolute error: 0.0194, peak signal-to-noise ratio: 29.65, structural\nsimilarity: 0.9486) and are close to real images. In promoting AD diagnosis,\nthe generated images combined with their corresponding sMRI also showed\nexcellent performance in AD diagnosis tasks (classification accuracy: 94.21 %),\nand outperformed previous research methods of the same type.

    "abstract": "The integration of DNA methylation data with a Whole Slide Image (WSI) offers\nsignificant potential for enhancing the diagnostic precision of central nervous\nsystem (CNS) tumor classification in neuropathology. While existing approaches\ntypically integrate encoded omic data with histology at either an early or late\nfusion stage, the potential of reintroducing omic data through dual fusion\nremains unexplored. In this paper, we propose the use of omic embeddings during\nearly and late fusion to capture complementary information from local\n(patch-level) to global (slide-level) interactions, boosting performance\nthrough multimodal integration. In the early fusion stage, omic embeddings are\nprojected onto WSI patches in latent-space, which generates embeddings that\nencapsulate per-patch molecular and morphological insights. This effectively\nincorporates omic information into the spatial representation of the WSI. These\nembeddings are then refined with a Multiple Instance Learning gated attention\nmechanism which attends to diagnostic patches. In the late fusion stage, we\nreintroduce the omic data by fusing it with slide-level omic-WSI embeddings\nusing a Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB), which richly intermingles\nfeatures from both modalities, capturing their correlations and\ncomplementarity. We demonstrate accurate CNS tumor subtyping across 20\nfine-grained subtypes and validate our approach on benchmark datasets,\nachieving improved survival prediction on TCGA-BLCA and competitive performance\non TCGA-BRCA compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This change in phase can influence\nour understanding of the delivery of volatile species to the atmospheres of\ngiant planets.

However, these approaches face\nsignificant limitations in undefined domains, where the label space is\nvocabulary-unknown and composite. We thus introduce Generative Semantic Labels\n(GSLs), a novel task that aims to predict a comprehensive set of semantic\nlabels for an image without being constrained by a predefined labels set.\nUnlike traditional zero-shot classification, GSLs generates multiple\nsemantic-level labels, encompassing objects, scenes, attributes, and\nrelationships, thereby providing a richer and more accurate representation of\nimage content. In this paper, we propose Chain-of-Action (CoA), an innovative\nmethod designed to tackle the GSLs task. CoA is motivated by the observation\nthat enriched contextual information significantly improves generative\nperformance during inference. Specifically, CoA decomposes the GSLs task into a\nsequence of detailed actions. Each action extracts and merges key information\nfrom the previous step, passing enriched context to the next, ultimately\nguiding the VLM to generate comprehensive and accurate semantic labels. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of CoA through extensive experiments on widely-used\nbenchmark datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements across key\nperformance metrics, validating the capability of CoA to generate accurate and\ncontextually rich semantic labels.

Our method leverages the\nadvantages of both approaches: (i) it ensures the existence of numerical\nsolutions for any time step size with a sufficiently large weight coefficient;\n(ii) by using a weight coefficient smaller than one, it achieves a discrete\nenergy closer to the original, potentially ensuring stability under mild\nconditions; and (iii) it maintains consistency in computational cost by\nutilizing the same time/spatial discretization formulas. We present several\ntheorems and numerical experiments to validate the accuracy, energy stability\nand superiority of our proposed method.",

Meanwhile, LLMs\nhave also demonstrated excellent multilingual capabilities, which can express\nthe learned knowledge in multiple languages. However, the knowledge storage\nmechanism in LLMs still remains mysterious. Some researchers attempt to\ndemystify the factual knowledge in LLMs from the perspective of knowledge\nneurons, and subsequently discover language-agnostic knowledge neurons that\nstore factual knowledge in a form that transcends language barriers. However,\nthe preliminary finding suffers from two limitations: 1) High Uncertainty in\nLocalization Results. Existing study only uses a prompt-based probe to localize\nknowledge neurons for each fact, while LLMs cannot provide consistent answers\nfor semantically equivalent queries. Thus, it leads to inaccurate localization\nresults with high uncertainty. 2) Lack of Analysis in More Languages. The study\nonly analyzes language-agnostic knowledge neurons on English and Chinese data,\nwithout exploring more language families and languages. Naturally, it limits\nthe generalizability of the findings. To address aforementioned problems, we\nfirst construct a new benchmark called Rephrased Multilingual LAMA (RML-LAMA),\nwhich contains high-quality cloze-style multilingual parallel queries for each\nfact. Then, we propose a novel method named Multilingual Integrated Gradients\nwith Uncertainty Estimation (MATRICE), which quantifies the uncertainty across\nqueries and languages during knowledge localization.

    "abstract": "In recent decades, statisticians have been increasingly encountering spatial\ndata that exhibit non-Gaussian behaviors such as asymmetry and\nheavy-tailedness. As a result, the assumptions of symmetry and fixed tail\nweight in Gaussian processes have become restrictive and may fail to capture\nthe intrinsic properties of the data. To address the limitations of the\nGaussian models, a variety of skewed models has been proposed, of which the\npopularity has grown rapidly. These skewed models introduce parameters that\ngovern skewness and tail weight. Among various proposals in the literature,\nunified skewed distributions, such as the Unified Skew-Normal (SUN), have\nreceived considerable attention. In this work, we revisit a more concise and\nintepretable re-parameterization of the SUN distribution and apply the\ndistribution to random fields by constructing a generalized unified skew-normal\n(GSUN) spatial process. We demonstrate that the GSUN is a valid spatial process\nby showing its vanishing correlation in large distances and provide the\ncorresponding spatial interpolation method. In addition, we develop an\ninference mechanism for the GSUN process using the concept of neural Bayes\nestimators with deep graphical attention networks (GATs) and encoder\ntransformer. We show the superiority of our proposed estimator over the\nconventional CNN-based architectures regarding stability and accuracy by means\nof a simulation study and application to Pb-contaminated soil data.\nFurthermore, we show that the GSUN process is different from the conventional\nGaussian processes and Tukey g-and-h processes, through the probability\nintegral transform (PIT).",

However, existing methods face problems such as insufficient\ninterpretability and transparency as well as limited performance when dealing\nwith high-dimensional and nonlinear data. To address these issues, this paper\nintroduces a method based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). KANs is a new\ntype of neural network architecture with learnable activation functions and no\nlinear weights, which has potential advantages in handling complex\nmulti-dimensional data. Specifically, this paper applies KANs to the field of\nindividual credit risk prediction for the first time and constructs the\nKolmogorov-Arnold Credit Default Predict (KACDP) model. Experiments show that\nthe KACDP model outperforms mainstream credit default prediction models in\nperformance metrics (ROC_AUC and F1 values).

    "abstract": "Real-to-complex spectral transitions and the associated spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of eigenstates are central to non-Hermitian physics, yet a\ncomprehensive and universal theory that precisely describes the underlying\nphysical mechanisms for each individual state remains elusive. Here, we resolve\nthe mystery by employing the complex path integral formalism and developing a\ngeneralized Gutzwiller trace formula. These methodologies enable us to\nestablish a universal quantum-classical correspondence that precisely links the\nreal or complex nature of individual energy levels to the symmetry properties\nof their corresponding semiclassical orbits. Specifically, in systems with a\ngeneral $\\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, real energy levels are quantized\nalong periodic orbits that preserve the corresponding classical $S_\\eta$\nsymmetry. In contrast, complex conjugate energy levels arise from semiclassical\norbits that individually break the $S_\\eta$ symmetry but together form\n$S_\\eta$-symmetric pairs. This framework provides a unified explanation for the\nspectral behaviors in various continuous non-Hermitian models and for the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$ transition in two-level systems. Besides, we demonstrate that\nthe exceptional point is inherently a quantum phenomenon, as it cannot be\ndescribed by a single classical orbit.

A classic Poisson-gamma (PG) recruitment model assumes time-homogeneous\nrecruitment rates. However, there can be potential time-trends in the\nrecruitment driven by various factors, e.g. seasonal changes, exhaustion of\npatients on particular treatments in some centres, etc. Recently a few authors\nconsidered some extensions of the PG model to time-dependent rates under some\nparticular assumptions. In this paper, a natural generalization of the original\nPG model to a PG model with non-homogeneous time-dependent rates is introduced.\nIt is also proposed a new analytic methodology for modelling/forecasting\npatient recruitment using a Poisson-gamma approximation of recruitment\nprocesses in different countries and globally. The properties of some tests on\nhomogeneity of the rates (non-parametric one using a Poisson model and two\nparametric tests using Poisson and PG model) are investigated. The techniques\nfor modeling and simulation of the recruitment using time-dependent model are\ndiscussed.

Converting natural language sentences\ninto structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) remains a critical challenge. We\nidentified three limitations with respect to existing KG construction methods:\n(1) There could be a large amount of noise in real-world documents, which could\nresult in extracting messy information. (2) Naive LLMs usually extract\ninaccurate knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3) Hallucination\nphenomenon cannot be overlooked when directly using LLMs to construct KGs. In\nthis paper, we propose \\textbf{GraphJudge}, a KG construction framework to\naddress the aforementioned challenges. In this framework, we designed an\nentity-centric strategy to eliminate the noise information in the documents.\nAnd we fine-tuned a LLM as a graph judge to finally enhance the quality of\ngenerated KGs.

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential approach for optimizing black-box\nobjective functions using zeroth-order noisy observations. In BO, Gaussian\nprocesses (GPs) are employed as probabilistic surrogate models to estimate the\nobjective function based on past observations, guiding the selection of future\nqueries to maximize utility. However, the performance of BO heavily relies on\nthe quality of these probabilistic estimates, which can deteriorate\nsignificantly under model misspecification. To address this issue, we introduce\nlocalized online conformal prediction-based Bayesian optimization (LOCBO), a BO\nalgorithm that calibrates the GP model through localized online conformal\nprediction (CP). LOCBO corrects the GP likelihood based on predictive sets\nproduced by LOCBO, and the corrected GP likelihood is then denoised to obtain a\ncalibrated posterior distribution on the objective function. The likelihood\ncalibration step leverages an input-dependent calibration threshold to tailor\ncoverage guarantees to different regions of the input space. Under minimal\nnoise assumptions, we provide theoretical performance guarantees for LOCBO's\niterates that hold for the unobserved objective function. These theoretical\nfindings are validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world\noptimization tasks, demonstrating that LOCBO consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art BO algorithms in the presence of model misspecification.",

This is due to significant imaging modality-specific variations\nin artifacts, vascular patterns and scales, signal-to-noise ratios, and\nbackground tissues. These variations, along with domain gaps arising from\nvarying imaging protocols, limit the generalization of existing supervised\nlearning-based methods, requiring tedious voxel-level annotations for each\ndataset separately. While foundation models promise to alleviate this\nlimitation, they typically fail to generalize to the task of blood vessel\nsegmentation, posing a unique, complex problem. In this work, we present\nvesselFM, a foundation model designed specifically for the broad task of 3D\nblood vessel segmentation. Unlike previous models, vesselFM can effortlessly\ngeneralize to unseen domains. To achieve zero-shot generalization, we train\nvesselFM on three heterogeneous data sources: a large, curated annotated\ndataset, data generated by a domain randomization scheme, and data sampled from\na flow matching-based generative model. Extensive evaluations show that\nvesselFM outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation foundation\nmodels across four (pre-)clinically relevant imaging modalities in zero-, one-,\nand few-shot scenarios, therefore providing a universal solution for 3D blood\nvessel segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Decarbonising the industrial sector is vital to reach net zero targets. The\ndeployment of industrial decarbonisation technologies is expected to increase\nindustrial electricity demand in many countries and this may require upgrades\nto the existing electricity network or new network investment. While the\ninfrastructure requirements to support the introduction of new fuels and\ntechnologies in industry, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and\nstorage are often discussed, the need for investment to increase the capacity\nof the electricity network to meet increasing industrial electricity demands is\noften overlooked in the literature. This paper addresses this gap by\nquantifying the requirements for additional electricity network capacity to\nsupport the decarbonisation of industrial sectors across Great Britain (GB).\nThe Net Zero Industrial Pathways model is used to predict the future\nelectricity demand from industrial sites to 2050 which is then compared\nspatially to the available headroom across the distribution network in GB. The\nresults show that network headroom is sufficient to meet extra capacity demands\nfrom industrial sites over the period to 2030 in nearly all GB regions and\nnetwork scenarios. However, as electricity demand rises due to increased\nelectrification across all sectors and industrial decarbonisation accelerates\ntowards 2050, the network will need significant new capacity (71 GW + by 2050)\nparticularly in the central, south, and north-west regions of England, and\nWales. Without solving these network constraints, around 65% of industrial\nsites that are large point sources of emissions would be constrained in terms\nof electric capacity by 2040. These sites are responsible for 69% of industrial\npoint source emissions.",

    "abstract": "Among various spatio-temporal prediction tasks, epidemic forecasting plays a\ncritical role in public health management. Recent studies have demonstrated the\nstrong potential of spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) in\nextracting heterogeneous spatio-temporal patterns for epidemic forecasting.\nHowever, most of these methods bear an over-simplified assumption that two\nlocations (e.g., cities) with similar observed features in previous time steps\nwill develop similar infection numbers in the future. In fact, for any epidemic\ndisease, there exists strong heterogeneity of its intrinsic evolution\nmechanisms across geolocation and time, which can eventually lead to diverged\ninfection numbers in two ``similar'' locations. However, such mechanistic\nheterogeneity is non-trivial to be captured due to the existence of numerous\ninfluencing factors like medical resource accessibility, virus mutations,\nmobility patterns, etc., most of which are spatio-temporal yet unreachable or\neven unobservable. To address this challenge, we propose a Heterogeneous\nEpidemic-Aware Transmission Graph Neural Network (HeatGNN), a novel epidemic\nforecasting framework. By binding the epidemiology mechanistic model into a\nGNN, HeatGNN learns epidemiology-informed location embeddings of different\nlocations that reflect their own transmission mechanisms over time. With the\ntime-varying mechanistic affinity graphs computed with the\nepidemiology-informed location embeddings, a heterogeneous transmission graph\nnetwork is designed to encode the mechanistic heterogeneity among locations,\nproviding additional predictive signals to facilitate accurate forecasting.\nExperiments on three benchmark datasets have revealed that HeatGNN outperforms\nvarious strong baselines. Moreover, our efficiency analysis verifies the\nreal-world practicality of HeatGNN on datasets of different sizes.",

However, deploying transformer models on AIMC remains\nchallenging due to their inherent need for flexibility and adaptability across\ndiverse tasks. For the benefits of AIMC to be fully realized, weights of static\nvector-matrix multiplications must be mapped and programmed to analog devices\nin a weight-stationary manner. This poses two challenges for adapting a base\nnetwork to hardware and downstream tasks: (i) conventional analog\nhardware-aware (AHWA) training requires retraining the entire model, and (ii)\nreprogramming analog devices is both time- and energy-intensive. To address\nthese issues, we propose Analog Hardware-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation (AHWA-LoRA)\ntraining, a novel approach for efficiently adapting transformers to AIMC\nhardware. AHWA-LoRA training keeps the analog weights fixed as meta-weights and\nintroduces lightweight external LoRA modules for both hardware and task\nadaptation. We validate AHWA-LoRA training on SQuAD v1.1 and the GLUE\nbenchmark, demonstrate its scalability to larger models, and show its\neffectiveness in instruction tuning and reinforcement learning. We further\nevaluate a practical deployment scenario that balances AIMC tile latency with\ndigital LoRA processing using optimized pipeline strategies, with RISC-V-based\nprogrammable multi-core accelerators.

To\naddress this issue, we propose leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM),\npre-trained on over 1 billion masks, thus circumventing the need for extensive\ndomain-specific annotated data. In light of this, we developed SAM-MPA, an\ninnovative SAM-based framework for few-shot medical image segmentation using\nMask Propagation-based Auto-prompting. Initially, we employ k-centroid\nclustering to select the most representative examples for labelling to\nconstruct the support set. These annotated examples are registered to other\nimages yielding deformation fields that facilitate the propagation of the mask\nknowledge to obtain coarse masks across the dataset. Subsequently, we\nautomatically generate visual prompts based on the region and boundary\nexpansion of the coarse mask, including points, box and a coarse mask. Finally,\nwe can obtain the segmentation predictions by inputting these prompts into SAM\nand refine the results by post refinement module. We validate the performance\nof the proposed framework through extensive experiments conducted on two\nmedical image datasets with different modalities. Our method achieves Dices of\n74.53%, 94.36% on Breast US, Chest X-ray, respectively.

Given this\nimpracticability, we instead propose to model {\\it joint identifiability} that\nestablishes unique correspondence of user representations across domains,\nensuring consistent preference modeling even when user behaviors exhibit shifts\nin different domains. To achieve this, we introduce a hierarchical user\npreference modeling framework that organizes user representations by the neural\nnetwork encoder's depth, allowing separate treatment of shallow and deeper\nsubspaces. In the shallow subspace, our framework models the interest centroids\nfor each user within each domain, probabilistically determining the users'\ninterest belongings and selectively aligning these centroids across domains to\nensure fine-grained consistency in domain-irrelevant features. For deeper\nsubspace representations, we enforce joint identifiability by decomposing it\ninto a shared cross-domain stable component and domain-variant components,\nlinked by a bijective transformation for unique correspondence. Empirical\nstudies on real-world CDR tasks with varying domain correlations demonstrate\nthat our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art, even with weakly\ncorrelated tasks, highlighting the importance of joint identifiability in\nachieving robust CDR.",

The monomers interact via the combination of\nthe Lennard-Jones potential and the harmonic potential. We have introduced a\nshort-range interaction in our model making it more physical. Such a classical\nsystem can be used as a model for stochastic resonance (SR) based energy\nharvesters where the interplay between the noise, coupling and a periodic\nperturbation leads to a rich class of dynamical behaviours. A key distinction\nbetween observing SR in single and coupled particle studies is that a\ntransition between the two wells is only considered successful if both the\nparticles cross a certain threshold position. Although we observe qualitatively\na similar peaking behaviour in different quantifiers of SR (like input energy\n($W_p$) and hysteresis loop area (HLA)), the effects of the above-mentioned\ncondition on the dynamics of the system remain unaddressed to the best of our\nknowledge. We study SR using different measures like the input energy per\nperiod of the external forcing, the hysteresis loop area as well as quantities\nlike phase lag between the response and the external forcing and the maximum\naverage amplitude of the response. Additionally, we have defined a new quantity\ncalled the successful transition ratio. This ratio helps us understand the\neffects of the dimer's coupling on the number of successful transitions out of\nthe total attempted transitions. The successful transition ratio is almost\nunity for strongly coupled dimer suggesting most of the transition attempts end\nup successfully however few they are in numbers. On the other hand, the ratio\nshows a peaking behaviour with respect to noise for weak and intermediate\ncouplings. We show that only for the weakly coupled dimer, the ratio is maximum\naround the temperature where SR takes place.",

However, most existing MVCC methods create cross-views by\ncombining any two views, leading to a high volume of unreliable pairs.\nFurthermore, these approaches often overlook discrepancies in multi-view\nrepresentations, resulting in representation degeneration. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a novel model called Dual-Weighted Contrastive\nLearning (DWCL) for Multi-View Clustering. Specifically, to reduce the impact\nof unreliable cross-views, we introduce an innovative Best-Other (B-O)\ncontrastive mechanism that enhances the representation of individual views at a\nlow computational cost. Furthermore, we develop a dual weighting strategy that\ncombines a view quality weight, reflecting the quality of each view, with a\nview discrepancy weight. This approach effectively mitigates representation\ndegeneration by downplaying cross-views that are both low in quality and high\nin discrepancy. We theoretically validate the efficiency of the B-O contrastive\nmechanism and the effectiveness of the dual weighting strategy. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that DWCL outperforms previous methods across eight\nmulti-view datasets, showcasing superior performance and robustness in MVCC.\nSpecifically, our method achieves absolute accuracy improvements of 5.4\\% and\n5.6\\% compared to state-of-the-art methods on the Caltech6V7 and MSRCv1\ndatasets, respectively.",

Our\ntheory is based on the microscopic expression of the second-order\nmagneto-optical conductivity developed from the density matrix formalism,\ntaking into account hexagonal warping effects on the surface states' band\nstructure. Using numerically exact Landau level energies and wavefunctions\nincluding hexagonal warping, we calculate the spectrum of SHG conductivities\nunder normal incidence for different values of magnetic field and chemical\npotential. The imaginary parts of the SHG conductivities show prominent\nresonant peaks corresponding to one-photon and two-photon inter-Landau level\ntransitions. Treating the hexagonal warping term perturbatively, these\ntransitions are clarified analytically within a perturbation theory from which\napproximate selection rules for the allowable optical transitions for SHG are\ndetermined. Our results show extremely high SHG susceptibility that is easily\ntunable by magnetic field and doping level for topological surface states in\nthe far-infrared regime, exceeding that of many conventional nonlinear\nmaterials. This work highlights the key role of hexagonal warping effects in\ngenerating second-order optical responses and provides new insights on the\nnonlinear magneto-optical properties of the topological insulators.",

    "abstract": "Every year, thousands of people suffer from skull damage and require\npersonalized implants to fill the cranial cavity. Unfortunately, the waiting\ntime for reconstruction surgery can extend to several weeks or even months,\nespecially in less developed countries. One factor contributing to the extended\nwaiting period is the intricate process of personalized implant modeling.\nCurrently, the preparation of these implants by experienced biomechanical\nexperts is both costly and time-consuming. Recent advances in artificial\nintelligence, especially in deep learning, offer promising potential for\nautomating the process. However, deep learning-based cranial reconstruction\nfaces several challenges: (i) the limited size of training datasets, (ii) the\nhigh resolution of the volumetric data, and (iii) significant data\nheterogeneity. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address these\nchallenges by enhancing the reconstruction through learnable symmetry\nenforcement. We demonstrate that it is possible to train a neural network\ndedicated to calculating skull symmetry, which can be utilized either as an\nadditional objective function during training or as a post-reconstruction\nobjective during the refinement step. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed\nmethod using open SkullBreak and SkullFix datasets, and qualitatively using\nreal clinical cases. The results indicate that the symmetry-preserving\nreconstruction network achieves considerably better outcomes compared to the\nbaseline (0.94/0.94/1.31 vs 0.84/0.76/2.43 in terms of DSC, bDSC, and HD95).\nMoreover, the results are comparable to the best-performing methods while\nrequiring significantly fewer computational resources (< 500 vs > 100,000 GPU\nhours). The proposed method is a considerable contribution to the field of\napplied artificial intelligence in medicine and is a step toward automatic\ncranial defect reconstruction in clinical practice.",

However,\nexisting GNAS methods begin searching for architectures from a zero-knowledge\nstate, ignoring the prior knowledge that may improve the search efficiency. The\navailable knowledge base (e.g. NAS-Bench-Graph) contains many rich\narchitectures and their multiple performance metrics, such as the accuracy\n(#Acc) and number of parameters (#Params). This study proposes exploiting such\nprior knowledge to accelerate the multi-objective evolutionary search on a new\ngraph dataset, named knowledge-aware evolutionary GNAS (KEGNAS). KEGNAS employs\nthe knowledge base to train a knowledge model and a deep multi-output Gaussian\nprocess (DMOGP) in one go, which generates and evaluates transfer architectures\nin only a few GPU seconds. The knowledge model first establishes a\ndataset-to-architecture mapping, which can quickly generate candidate transfer\narchitectures for a new dataset. Subsequently, the DMOGP with architecture and\ndataset encodings is designed to predict multiple performance metrics for\ncandidate transfer architectures on the new dataset. According to the predicted\nmetrics, non-dominated candidate transfer architectures are selected to\nwarm-start the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for optimizing the #Acc\nand #Params on a new dataset. Empirical studies on NAS-Bench-Graph and five\nreal-world datasets show that KEGNAS swiftly generates top-performance\narchitectures, achieving 4.27% higher accuracy than advanced evolutionary\nbaselines and 11.54% higher accuracy than advanced differentiable baselines.

Some studies define an unbiased state as\nequal treatment across diverse demographic groups, aiming for balanced outputs\nfrom LLMs. However, differing perspectives on equality and the importance of\npluralism make it challenging to establish a universal standard. Alternatively,\nother approaches propose using fact-based criteria for more consistent and\nobjective evaluations, though these methods have not yet been fully applied to\nLLM bias assessments. Thus, there is a need for a metric with objective\ncriteria that offers a distinct perspective from equality-based approaches.\nMotivated by this need, we introduce a novel metric to assess bias using\nfact-based criteria and real-world statistics.

In response to this critical\nchallenge, we propose a discrete-time dynamic vehicle model that effectively\nmitigates the low-speed singularity issue, ensuring numerical stability and\nmaintaining the explicit form-highly favored by model-based control algorithms.\nTo validate the numerical stability of our model, we conduct a rigorous\ntheoretical analysis, establishing sufficient conditions for stability, and\nconduct extensive empirical validation tests across a wide spectrum of speeds.\nSubsequent to the validation process, we conduct comprehensive simulations\ncomparing our proposed model with both kinematic models and existing dynamic\nmodels discretized through the forward Euler method. The results demonstrate\nthat our proposed model shows better comprehensive performance in terms of both\nthe accuracy and numerical stability.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) have led to significant\nreductions in transcription errors on standard benchmarks under the i.i.d.\nassumption, thus focusing on minimizing in-distribution (ID) errors. However,\nthis assumption does not hold in real-world applications, which has motivated\nHTR research to explore Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation techniques. In\nthis work, we investigate the unaddressed limitations of HTR models in\ngeneralizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We adopt the challenging\nsetting of Domain Generalization, where models are expected to generalize to\nOOD data without any prior access. To this end, we analyze 336 OOD cases from\neight state-of-the-art HTR models across seven widely used datasets, spanning\nfive languages. Additionally, we study how HTR models leverage synthetic data\nto generalize. We reveal that the most significant factor for generalization\nlies in the textual divergence between domains, followed by visual divergence.\nWe demonstrate that the error of HTR models in OOD scenarios can be reliably\nestimated, with discrepancies falling below 10 points in 70\\% of cases. We\nidentify the underlying limitations of HTR models, laying the foundation for\nfuture research to address this challenge.",

    "abstract": "Planktonic organisms, despite their passive drift in the ocean, exhibit\ncomplex responses to fluid flow, including escape behaviors and larval\nsettlement detection. But what flow signals can they perceive? This paper\naddresses this question by considering an organism covered with sensitive cilia\nand immersed in a background flow. The organism is modeled as a spherical\nparticle in Stokes flow, with cilia assumed to measure the local shear at the\nparticle surface. This study reveals that, while these organisms can always\nmeasure certain components of the flow strain, bottom-heaviness is necessary to\nmeasure the horizontal component of vorticity. These findings shed light on\nflow sensing by plankton, contributing to a better understanding of their\nbehavior.",

Three XMM-Newton observations\ncovered the field of IGR J17503-2636, in 2020 and twice in 2023. The analysis\nof the two XMM-Newton observations performed in September 2023, six days apart,\ndid not detect IGR J17503-2636, allowing us to pose the most stringent 3sigma\nupper limit on the source flux to date (~9.5x10^-14 erg/cm2/s, 2-10 keV, flux\ncorrected for absorption). This value implies that the amplitude of the X-ray\nflux variability exceeds a factor of ~2100, compared with the discovery\noutburst in 2018. A candidate X-ray periodicity at 0.335397(3) seconds has been\nbarely detected (significance of about 3.8sigma) from IGR J17503-2636 with\nXMM-Newton (pulsed fraction of (10+/-1) per cent). The new data, put into the\ncontext of previous literature, allow us to propose a new classification of IGR\nJ17503-2636 as a symbiotic X-ray binary, rather than a candidate supergiant\nfast X-ray transient. IGR J17507-2647 was formerly reported below 10 keV only\nduring Chandra observations performed in 2009. We report here on two XMM-Newton\nobservations that serendipitously covered the source field in 2020 and in 2023,\nfinding a stable X-ray emission, both in X-ray flux and spectral shape. The\nlong-term, persistent X-ray emission has also been probed by several Swift/XRT\nshort observations and by INTEGRAL data spanning several years. We have\ndetected an iron line in the emission (with centroid energy in the range of\n6.3-6.6 keV), never reported before in the IGR J17507-2647 spectrum.

These measurements are based on radial\nprofiles inferred from near-IR \\textit{HST} photometry, along with\nmulti-resolution emission-line kinematic modelling using integral field\nspectroscopy (IFS) data from KMOS, SINFONI, and OSIRIS. We identified 24 disks\n(disk fraction of $58.6\\pm 7.7\\%$) and used them to parametrize the $j_\\star$\n\\textit{vs} stellar mass $M_\\star$ relation (Fall relation) as $j_\\star\\propto\nM_\\star^{\\beta}$.

Reward gradient-based strategies are promising in this context, yet\nexisting methods are limited to single-reward tasks, restricting their\napplicability in real-world scenarios that demand adapting to multiple\nobjectives introduced incrementally over time. In this paper, we first define\nthis more realistic and unexplored problem, termed Reward Incremental Learning\n(RIL), where models are desired to adapt to multiple downstream objectives\nincrementally. Additionally, while the models adapt to the ever-emerging new\nobjectives, we observe a unique form of catastrophic forgetting in diffusion\nmodel fine-tuning, affecting both metric-wise and visual structure-wise image\nquality. To address this catastrophic forgetting challenge, we propose Reward\nIncremental Distillation (RID), a method that mitigates forgetting with minimal\ncomputational overhead, enabling stable performance across sequential reward\ntasks. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of RID in achieving\nconsistent, high-quality generation in RIL scenarios. The source code of our\nwork will be publicly available upon acceptance.",

We think that the\nNebra people used the Auriga line to determine the day (which we call beta day)\non which the Pleiades are vertically below beta Aur at dusk in February. We\nfound a second representation of the Auriga line on the Disc where the distance\nratios between the stars are very precisely equal to the distance ratios in the\nsky, and where the Pleiades are vertically below beta Aur. This proves that the\nNebra people must have measured the distances, and that our hypothesis is\ncorrect.\n  The beta day could have been used to harmonize a lunisolar calendar with the\nsolar year.

Specifically, we find that\ndifferences of the internal energy per baryon for various phases are typically\nless than the thermal energy per a freedom degree at temperature about\n$10^8$--$10^9$ K, which sets the energetic scale for thermal fluctuations of\nstate of Fermi liquid from the ground state. The nuclear energy contributions\nare described using the same parametrization Sk$\\chi$450 for the bulk, plain\nsurface and curvature terms. We find that the introduction of the curvature\ncorrection changes the ground state in a relevant way. This may be understood\nas a consequence of the corresponding change in size of the nucleus, which\nsignificantly modifies the phase transition densities. Using the calculated\nstructural parameters from liquid drop model, we explore the physical\nconsequences of the expected Cooper pairing of protons in lasagna phase. In\nthis case, we find a crossover between the discreet layered and the\nthree-dimensional anisotropic regimes of superconductivity. Additionally, we\nstudy the magnetic stress in lasagna accounting for a rotational lag between\nsuperfluid neutrons and the crystal lattice, which is believed to develop\nnaturally in pulsars and magnetars. Our results offer a preliminary insight\ninto rich magnetic properties of the inner crust of neutron stars.",

Such\nmagnetic fields are known to be frozen into hot plasma and exist on at least a\nhundred of picoseconds time-scale, allowing their use for control of charged\nparticle beams. The high values of the magnetic field along with the compact\nsize perfectly match conditions for an all-in-one optical setup, where first,\nthe laser beam accelerates protons, by, e.g. Target Normal Sheath Acceleration\n(TNSA) mechanism, and second, the closely positioned snail target is driven to\nguide the proton beam.

The packaged PD module demonstrates high saturation power\nand flat frequency responses with minimal power roll-off of only 2 dB over\n110-170 GHz. By incorporating the PD module into a fiber-THz integrated\ncommunication system, high data rates of up to 160 Gbps with 16 quadrature\namplitude modulation (QAM) and a maximum symbol transmission rate of 60 Gbaud\nwith QPSK modulation are successfully secured.

    "abstract": "Majority subspace clustering (SC) algorithms depend on one or more\nhyperparameters that need to be carefully tuned for the SC algorithms to\nachieve high clustering performance. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is often\nperformed using grid-search, assuming that some labeled data is available. In\nsome domains, such as medicine, this assumption does not hold true in many\ncases. One avenue of research focuses on developing SC algorithms that are\ninherently free of hyperparameters. For hyperparameters-dependent SC\nalgorithms, one approach to label-independent HPO tuning is based on internal\nclustering quality metrics (if available), whose performance should ideally\nmatch that of external (label-dependent) clustering quality metrics. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach to label-independent HPO that uses\nclustering quality metrics, such as accuracy (ACC) or normalized mutual\ninformation (NMI), that are computed based on pseudo-labels obtained from the\nSC algorithm across a predefined grid of hyperparameters. Assuming that ACC (or\nNMI) is a smooth function of hyperparameter values it is possible to select\nsubintervals of hyperparameters. These subintervals are then iteratively\nfurther split into halves or thirds until a relative error criterion is\nsatisfied. In principle, the hyperparameters of any SC algorithm can be tuned\nusing the proposed method. We demonstrate this approach on several single- and\nmulti-view SC algorithms, comparing the achieved performance with their oracle\nversions across six datasets representing digits, faces and objects. The\nproposed method typically achieves clustering performance that is 5% to 7%\nlower than that of the oracle versions. We also make our proposed method\ninterpretable by visualizing subspace bases, which are estimated from the\ncomputed clustering partitions. This aids in the initial selection of the\nhyperparameter search space.",

In particular, we show that when incorporating these\nnetworks, the system model reduces to the same structure as if no mutual\ncoupling is present. Hence, all algorithms and theoretical discussions\nneglecting mutual coupling can be directly applied when mutual coupling is\npresent by utilizing our proposed decoupling networks. For example, by\nincluding decoupling networks, the channel gain maximization in RIS-aided\nsingle-input single-output (SISO) systems does not require an iterative\nalgorithm but is given in closed form as opposed to using no decoupling\nnetwork. In addition, this closed-form solution allows to analytically analyze\nscenarios under mutual coupling resulting in novel connections to the\nconventional transmit array gain. In particular, we show that super-quadratic\n(up to quartic) channel gains w.r.t. the number of RIS elements are possible\nand, therefore, the system with mutual coupling performs significantly better\nthan the conventional uncoupled system in which only squared gains are\npossible. We consider diagonal as well as beyond diagonal (BD)-RISs and give\nvarious analytical and numerical results, including the inevitable losses at\nthe RIS array. In addition, simulation results validate the superior\nperformance of decoupling networks w.r.t. the channel gain compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

To address the load balancing problem, this paper proposes a\ndynamic optimization framework for mobile communication networks inspired by\nthe average consensus in multi-agent systems. In this framework, all antennas\ncooperatively optimize their CPICH (Common Pilot Channel) transmit power in\nreal-time to balance their busy-degrees. Then, the coverage area of each\nantenna would change accordingly, and we call this framework a ``breathing''\nmobile communication network. To solve this optimization problem, two\nalgorithms named BDBA (Busy-degree Dynamic Balancing Algorithm) and BFDBA\n(Busy-degree Fast Dynamic Balancing Algorithm) are proposed. Moreover, a fast\nnetwork coverage calculation method is introduced, by which each antenna's\nminimum CPICH transmit power is determined under the premise of meeting the\nnetwork coverage requirements. Besides, we present the theoretical analysis of\nthe two proposed algorithms' performance, which prove that all antennas'\nbusy-degrees will reach consensus under certain assumptions. Furthermore,\nsimulations carried out on three large datasets demonstrate that our\ncooperative optimization can significantly reduce the unbalance among antennas\nas well as the proportion of over-busy antennas.",

    "abstract": "The newly introduced Visual State Space Model (VMamba), which employs\n\\textit{State Space Mechanisms} (SSM) to interpret images as sequences of\npatches, has shown exceptional performance compared to Vision Transformers\n(ViT) across various computer vision tasks. However, recent studies have\nhighlighted that deep models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. One common\napproach is to embed a trigger in the training data to retrain the model,\ncausing it to misclassify data samples into a target class, a phenomenon known\nas a backdoor attack. In this paper, we first evaluate the robustness of the\nVMamba model against existing backdoor attacks. Based on this evaluation, we\nintroduce a novel architectural backdoor attack, termed BadScan, designed to\ndeceive the VMamba model. This attack utilizes bit plane slicing to create\nvisually imperceptible backdoored images. During testing, if a trigger is\ndetected by performing XOR operations between the $k^{th}$ bit planes of the\nmodified triggered patches, the traditional 2D selective scan (SS2D) mechanism\nin the visual state space (VSS) block of VMamba is replaced with our newly\ndesigned BadScan block, which incorporates four newly developed scanning\npatterns. We demonstrate that the BadScan backdoor attack represents a\nsignificant threat to visual state space models and remains effective even\nafter complete retraining from scratch. Experimental results on two widely used\nimage classification datasets, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-1K, reveal that while\nvisual state space models generally exhibit robustness against current backdoor\nattacks, the BadScan attack is particularly effective, achieving a higher\nTriggered Accuracy Ratio (TAR) in misleading the VMamba model and its variants.",

(3) Some rows of the left orthonormal\ntransformation of the product of $L$ linear classifiers collapse to zeros and\nothers are orthogonal, which relies on the singular values of $\\hat\nY=(I_K-1/N\\mathbf{n}1^\\top_K)D$, where $K$ is class size, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the\nvector of sample size for each class, $D$ is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal\nentries are given by $\\sqrt{\\mathbf{n}}$. Similar results are for the columns\nof the right orthonormal transformation of the product of class-mean matrix and\n$D$. (4) The $i$-th row of the left orthonormal transformation of the product\nof $L$ linear classifiers aligns with the $i$-th column of the right\northonormal transformation of the product of class-mean matrix and $D$. (5) We\nprovide the estimation of singular values about $\\hat Y$. Our numerical\nexperiments support these theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Input delays affect systems such as teleoperation and wirelessly autonomous\nconnected vehicles, and may lead to safety violations. One promising way to\nensure safety in the presence of delay is to employ control barrier functions\n(CBFs), and extensions thereof that account for uncertainty: delay adaptive\nCBFs (DaCBFs). This paper proposes an online adaptive safety control framework\nfor reducing the conservatism of DaCBFs. The main idea is to reduce the maximum\ndelay estimation error bound so that the state prediction error bound is\nmonotonically non-increasing. To this end, we first leverage the estimation\nerror bound of a disturbance observer to bound the state prediction error.\nSecond, we design two nonlinear programs to update the maximum delay estimation\nerror bound satisfying the prediction error bound, and subsequently update the\nmaximum state prediction error bound used in DaCBFs. The proposed method\nensures the maximum state prediction error bound is monotonically\nnon-increasing, yielding less conservatism in DaCBFs. We verify the proposed\nmethod in an automated connected truck application, showing that the proposed\nmethod reduces the conservatism of DaCBFs.",

In\nthis work, we tailor the work function of a complex TM-oxide by tuning the\nrelative content of its constituent TM-atoms.

Vulnerability datasets, often derived from the National\nVulnerability Database (NVD) or directly from GitHub, are essential for\ntraining machine learning models to detect these security flaws. However, these\ndatasets frequently suffer from significant noise, typically 40% to 75%, due\nprimarily to the automatic and indiscriminate labeling of all changes in\nvulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) as vulnerability-related. This\nmisclassification occurs because not all changes in a commit aimed at fixing\nvulnerabilities pertain to security threats; many are routine updates like bug\nfixes or test improvements.\n  This paper introduces the first methodology that uses the Large Language\nModel (LLM) with a heuristic enhancement to automatically identify\nvulnerability-fixing changes from VFCs, achieving an F1-score of 0.82.\nVulSifter was applied to a large-scale study, where we conducted a crawl of\n127,063 repositories on GitHub, resulting in the acquisition of 5,352,105\ncommits.

We then developed CleanVul, a high-quality dataset comprising 8,198\nfunctions using our LLM heuristic enhancement approach, demonstrating\nCorrectness (90.6%) comparable to established datasets such as SVEN and\nPrimeVul.\n  To evaluate the CleanVul dataset, we conducted experiments focusing on\nfine-tuning various LLMs on CleanVul and other high-quality datasets.\nEvaluation results reveal that LLMs fine-tuned on CleanVul not only exhibit\nenhanced accuracy but also superior generalization capabilities compared to\nthose trained on uncleaned datasets.

These models suffer from a circularity problem and account for\nonly a small portion of dust, specifically submicron-sized grains. They\noverlook larger dust particles and other macroscopic bodies, despite\nobservational evidence supporting their existence. This evidence includes the\nobserved (sub)millimeter excess in dust emission spectra and the power-law size\ndistribution with an index {\\gamma} ~ 3.5-4.0, which has been measured for\nlarge particles and compact bodies across diverse environments. Examples of\nthese large particles include large dust grains and meteoroids detected by\nsatellites, near-Earth objects colliding with Earth, fragments in the Main\nAsteroid Belt and the Kuiper Belt, interstellar 'Oumuamua-like objects, and\nexoplanets. As a result, dust-type baryonic dark matter may be more abundant\nthroughout the galaxy by one order of magnitude or even more than previously\nassumed, with a significant portion of its mass concentrated in large compact\nbodies. Additionally, black holes may contribute significantly to the total\nmass of baryonic dark matter. Consequently, current galaxy models do not\nprovide reliable estimates of baryonic mass in galaxies.

    "abstract": "The success of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in mitigating\nhallucinations in Vision Language Models (VLMs) critically hinges on the true\nreward gaps within preference pairs. However, current methods, typically\nrelying on ranking or rewriting strategies, often struggle to optimize these\nreward gaps in a systematic way during data curation. A core difficulty lies in\nprecisely characterizing and strategically manipulating the overall reward gap\nconfiguration, that is, the deliberate design of how to shape these reward gaps\nwithin each preference pair across the data. To address this, we introduce\nTopic-level Preference Rewriting(TPR), a novel framework designed for the\nsystematic optimization of reward gap configuration. Through selectively\nreplacing semantic topics within VLM responses with model's own resampled\ncandidates for targeted rewriting, TPR can provide topic-level control over\nfine-grained semantic details. This precise control enables advanced data\ncuration strategies, such as progressively adjusting the difficulty of rejected\nresponses, thereby sculpting an effective reward gap configuration that guides\nthe model to overcome challenging hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate TPR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple hallucination\nbenchmarks, outperforming previous methods by an average of 20%. Notably, it\nsignificantly reduces hallucinations by up to 93% on ObjectHal-Bench, and also\nexhibits superior data efficiency towards robust and cost-effective VLM\nalignment.",

Existing deep learning\nand linear models often suffer from excessive parameter complexity and lack\nintuitive interpretability. To address these issues, we propose DiPE-Linear, a\nDisentangled interpretable Parameter-Efficient Linear network.

The decomposed model structure\nreduces parameter complexity from quadratic in fully connected networks (FCs)\nto linear and computational complexity from quadratic to log-linear.\nAdditionally, a Low-Rank Weight Sharing policy enhances the model's ability to\nhandle multivariate series.

Current imitation\nlearning-based planning algorithms often merge historical trajectories with\npresent observations to predict future candidate paths. However, these\nalgorithms typically assess the current and historical plans independently,\nleading to discontinuities in driving intentions and an accumulation of errors\nwith each step in a discontinuous plan. To tackle this challenge, this paper\nintroduces LHPF, an imitation learning planner that integrates historical\nplanning information. Our approach employs a historical intention aggregation\nmodule that pools historical planning intentions, which are then combined with\na spatial query vector to decode the final planning trajectory. Furthermore, we\nincorporate a comfort auxiliary task to enhance the human-like quality of the\ndriving behavior. Extensive experiments using both real-world and synthetic\ndata demonstrate that LHPF not only surpasses existing advanced learning-based\nplanners in planning performance but also marks the first instance of a purely\nlearning-based planner outperforming the expert. Additionally, the application\nof the historical intention aggregation module across various backbones\nhighlights the considerable potential of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "The detection and tracking of small, occluded objects such as pedestrians,\ncyclists, and motorbikes pose significant challenges for traffic surveillance\nsystems because of their erratic movement, frequent occlusion, and poor\nvisibility in dynamic urban environments. Traditional methods like YOLO11,\nwhile proficient in spatial feature extraction for precise detection, often\nstruggle with these small and dynamically moving objects, particularly in\nhandling real-time data updates and resource efficiency. This paper introduces\nDGNN-YOLO, a novel framework that integrates dynamic graph neural networks\n(DGNNs) with YOLO11 to address these limitations. Unlike standard GNNs, DGNNs\nare chosen for their superior ability to dynamically update graph structures in\nreal-time, which enables adaptive and robust tracking of objects in highly\nvariable urban traffic scenarios. This framework constructs and regularly\nupdates its graph representations, capturing objects as nodes and their\ninteractions as edges, thus effectively responding to rapidly changing\nconditions. Additionally, DGNN-YOLO incorporates Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and\nEigen-CAM visualization techniques to enhance interpretability and foster\ntrust, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. Extensive\nexperiments validate the framework's performance, achieving a precision of\n0.8382, recall of 0.6875, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.6476, significantly\noutperforming existing methods.

In this work, we propose DiffSLT, a novel gloss-free SLT framework\nthat leverages a diffusion model, enabling diverse translations while\npreserving sign language semantics.

We also introduce DiffSLT-P, a DiffSLT variant that conditions on\npseudo-glosses and visual features, providing key textual guidance and reducing\nthe modality gap.

In this paper, we address the problem of scheduling a set of\njobs on identical parallel machines with the objective of makespan\nminimization, by considering a local search neighborhood, called $k$-swap. A\n$k$-swap neighbor is obtained by interchanging the machine allocations of at\nmost $k$ jobs scheduled on two machines. While local search algorithms often\nperform well in practice, they can exhibit poor worst-case performance. In our\nprevious study, we showed that for $k \\geq 3$, there exists an instance where\nthe number of iterations required to converge to a local optimum is exponential\nin the number of jobs. Motivated by this discrepancy between theoretical\nworst-case bound and practical performance, we apply smoothed analysis to the\n$k$-swap local search. Smoothed analysis has emerged as a powerful framework\nfor analyzing the behavior of algorithms, aiming to bridge the gap between poor\nworst-case and good empirical performance. In this paper, we show that the\nsmoothed number of iterations required to find a local optimum with respect to\nthe $k$-swap neighborhood is bounded by $O(m^2 \\cdot n^{2k+2} \\cdot \\log m\n\\cdot \\phi)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the numbers of jobs and machines,\nrespectively, and $\\phi \\geq 1$ is the perturbation parameter.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present DM-Calib, a diffusion-based approach for estimating\npinhole camera intrinsic parameters from a single input image. Monocular camera\ncalibration is essential for many 3D vision tasks. However, most existing\nmethods depend on handcrafted assumptions or are constrained by limited\ntraining data, resulting in poor generalization across diverse real-world\nimages. Recent advancements in stable diffusion models, trained on massive\ndata, have shown the ability to generate high-quality images with varied\ncharacteristics. Emerging evidence indicates that these models implicitly\ncapture the relationship between camera focal length and image content.\nBuilding on this insight, we explore how to leverage the powerful priors of\ndiffusion models for monocular pinhole camera calibration. Specifically, we\nintroduce a new image-based representation, termed Camera Image, which\nlosslessly encodes the numerical camera intrinsics and integrates seamlessly\nwith the diffusion framework. Using this representation, we reformulate the\nproblem of estimating camera intrinsics as the generation of a dense Camera\nImage conditioned on an input image. By fine-tuning a stable diffusion model to\ngenerate a Camera Image from a single RGB input, we can extract camera\nintrinsics via a RANSAC operation. We further demonstrate that our monocular\ncalibration method enhances performance across various 3D tasks, including\nzero-shot metric depth estimation, 3D metrology, pose estimation and\nsparse-view reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets\nshow that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and provides broad\nbenefits to 3D vision tasks.",

This\nprocess incorporates two isolatedly studied tasks: Code Search (CS), which\nretrieves reference code from a code corpus to aid in code implementation, and\nFault Localization (FL), which identifies code entities responsible for bugs\nwithin the software project to boost software debugging. These two tasks\nexhibit similarities since they both address search problems. Notably, CS\ntechniques have demonstrated greater effectiveness than FL ones, possibly\nbecause of the precise semantic details of the required code offered by natural\nlanguage queries, which are not readily accessible to FL methods. Drawing\ninspiration from this, we hypothesize that a fault localizer could achieve\ngreater proficiency if semantic information about the buggy methods were made\navailable. Based on this idea, we propose CosFL, an FL approach that decomposes\nthe FL task into two steps: query generation, which describes the functionality\nof the problematic code in natural language, and fault retrieval, which uses CS\nto find program elements semantically related to the query. Specifically, to\ndepict the buggy functionalities and generate high-quality queries, CosFL\nextensively harnesses the code analysis, semantic comprehension, and\ndecision-making capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, to enhance the accuracy of CS,\nCosFL captures varying levels of context information and employs a\nmulti-granularity code search strategy, which facilitates a more precise\nidentification of buggy methods from a holistic view.

However, most existing weather\nrestoration approaches are only capable of handling a specific type of\ndegradation, which is often insufficient in real-world scenarios, such as\nrainy-snowy or rainy-hazy weather. Towards being able to address these\nsituations, we propose a multi-weather Transformer, or MWFormer for short,\nwhich is a holistic vision Transformer that aims to solve multiple\nweather-induced degradations using a single, unified architecture. MWFormer\nuses hyper-networks and feature-wise linear modulation blocks to restore images\ndegraded by various weather types using the same set of learned parameters. We\nfirst employ contrastive learning to train an auxiliary network that extracts\ncontent-independent, distortion-aware feature embeddings that efficiently\nrepresent predicted weather types, of which more than one may occur. Guided by\nthese weather-informed predictions, the image restoration Transformer\nadaptively modulates its parameters to conduct both local and global feature\nprocessing, in response to multiple possible weather. Moreover, MWFormer allows\nfor a novel way of tuning, during application, to either a single type of\nweather restoration or to hybrid weather restoration without any retraining,\noffering greater controllability than existing methods. Our experimental\nresults on multi-weather restoration benchmarks show that MWFormer achieves\nsignificant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art\nmethods, without requiring much computational cost. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat our methodology of using hyper-networks can be integrated into various\nnetwork architectures to further boost their performance.

Chiral phonons carry angular momentum, which is observable in heat\ncurrents, and, via coupling to electron spin, in spin currents. Two-dimensional\n(2D) halide perovskites, versatile direct band gap semiconductors, can easily\nform chiral structures by incorporating chiral organic cations. As a result,\nthey exhibit phenomena such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) and\nthe spin Seebeck effect, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.\nUsing on-the-fly machine-learning force fields trained against density\nfunctional theory calculations, we confirm the presence of chiral phonons, a\npotential key factor for these effects. Our analysis reveals that low-energy\nphonons, originating from the inorganic framework, primarily exhibit chirality.\nUnder a temperature gradient, these chiral phonons generate substantial angular\nmomentum, leading to experimentally observable effects.

We reveal three challenges of DDCQG: domain-specific knowledge\nrequirements across courses, long-tail distribution in course coverage, and\nhigh information density in diagrams. To address these, we propose the\nHierarchical Knowledge Integration framework (HKI-DDCQG), which utilizes\ntrainable CLIP for identifying relevant diagram patches, leverages frozen\nvision-language models for knowledge extraction, and generates questions with\ntrainable T5. Experiments demonstrate that HKI-DDCQG outperforms existing\nmodels on DiagramQG while maintaining strong generalizability across natural\nimage datasets, establishing a strong baseline for DDCQG.",

In this work we establish an analytical\ntheory for the ASQUID using the tunneling Hamiltonian method and find two\nphysical quantities that can be used for the rotation sensing. The first one is\nthe critical population bias, which characterizes the transition between the\nself-trapping and the Josephson oscillation regimes and demonstrates a periodic\nmodulation behavior due to the rotation of the system. We discuss the variation\nof critical population bias when the tunneling strengths of the junctions are\ntuned in different values, and find that the symmetric junctions are better\nchoice than the asymmetric ones in terms of rotation sensing. Furthermore, how\nthe initial phase difference between the two condensates affects the\nmeasurement of rotation is also discussed.

However, their high dimensionality\nand mixing patterns pose significant challenges in establishing an\ninterpretable and explicit mapping between historical and future series, as\nwell as extracting long-range feature dependencies. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a channel-time dual unmixing network for multivariate\ntime series forecasting (named MTS-UNMixer), which decomposes the entire series\ninto critical bases and coefficients across both the time and channel\ndimensions. This approach establishes a robust sharing mechanism between\nhistorical and future series, enabling accurate representation and enhancing\nphysical interpretability. Specifically, MTS-UNMixers represent sequences over\ntime as a mixture of multiple trends and cycles, with the time-correlated\nrepresentation coefficients shared across both historical and future time\nperiods. In contrast, sequence over channels can be decomposed into multiple\ntick-wise bases, which characterize the channel correlations and are shared\nacross the whole series. To estimate the shared time-dependent coefficients, a\nvanilla Mamba network is employed, leveraging its alignment with directional\ncausality. Conversely, a bidirectional Mamba network is utilized to model the\nshared channel-correlated bases, accommodating noncausal relationships.\nExperimental results show that MTS-UNMixers significantly outperform existing\nmethods on multiple benchmark datasets.

In large-scale cortical networks, an intriguing hierarchy of\ntimescales reflects diverse information processing speeds across spatial\nregions. As a non-equilibrium system, the brain incurs significant energy\ncosts, with long-distance connectivity suggesting an evolutionary spatial\norganization.

We examine a broad class of functions of the form\n$f^{\\star}=g^{\\star}\\circ \\bp$, where $\\bp:\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow\n\\mathbb{R}^{r}$ represents multiple quadratic features with $r \\ll d$ and\n$g^{\\star}:\\mathbb{R}^{r}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a polynomial of degree $p$.\nThis can be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of the multi-index model\n\\citep{damian2022neural}, and also an expansion upon previous work that focused\nonly on a single nonlinear feature, i.e. $r = 1$\n\\citep{nichani2023provable,wang2023learning}.\n  Our primary contribution shows that a three-layer neural network trained via\nlayerwise gradient descent suffices for\n  \\begin{itemize}\\item complete recovery of the space spanned by the nonlinear\nfeatures\n  \\item efficient learning of the target function $f^{\\star}=g^{\\star}\\circ\n\\bp$ or transfer learning of $f=g\\circ \\bp$ with a different link function\n  \\end{itemize} within $\\widetilde{\\cO}(d^4)$ samples and polynomial time. For\nsuch hierarchical targets, our result substantially improves the sample\ncomplexity ${\\Theta}(d^{2p})$ of the kernel methods, demonstrating the power of\nefficient feature learning. It is important to highlight that{ our results\nleverage novel techniques and thus manage to go beyond all prior settings} such\nas single-index and multi-index models as well as models depending just on one\nnonlinear feature, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of\nfeature learning in deep learning.",

In this study,\nsuch approximations are not used and an analytical dynamical depiction of an\nopen quantum system is provided. The system under consideration is an\noscillator that is surrounded by a bath of oscillators. The resulting dynamics\nare characterized by a second-order complex coefficient linear differential\nequation, which may be either homogeneous or inhomogeneous.

In cases where there is detuning between the system\nfrequency and the environmental central frequency within a non-Markovian\nregime, the AEN maintains its initial value for an extended period.\nFurthermore, the application of pulse control can effectively protect the\nquantum system from decoherence effects without using approximations. The pulse\ncontrol can not only prolong the relaxation time of the oscillator, but can\nalso be used to speed up the relaxation process, depending on the\nspecifications of the pulse.

Scalar and axion fields couple\ndifferently to the EM field due to their distinct parity properties, $\\phi\nF_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}$ for scalar fields and $\\phi F_{\\mu\\nu}\n\\tilde{F}^{\\mu\\nu}$ for axions. Building on analytical methods developed for\nALPs, this work presents a theoretical feasibility analysis that demonstrates\nhow the scalar field in modified gravity could produce observable EM signatures\nfrom oscillating field configurations. We also show that resonance effects can\namplify the EM radiation for the scalar field under specific conditions, and\nthat the enhancement mechanisms depend on the coupling structure and the\nconfiguration of the background magnetic field. Resonance phenomena can\naccentuate the differences in signal strength and spectral features,\npotentially aiding future observations in distinguishing scalar fields from\nALPs.

All of these strategies suffer from\nexpressing semantic relationships correctly. Here, we propose a novel Word\npair-based Gaussian Sentence Similarity (WGSS) algorithm for calculating the\nsemantic relation between two sentences. WGSS takes the geometric means of\nindividual Gaussian similarity values of word embedding vectors to get the\nsemantic relationship between sentences. It compares two sentences on a\nword-to-word basis which rectifies the sentence representation problem faced by\nthe word averaging method. The summarization process extracts key sentences by\ngrouping semantically similar sentences into clusters using the Spectral\nClustering algorithm. After clustering, we use TF-IDF ranking to pick the best\nsentence from each cluster. The proposed method is validated using four\ndifferent datasets, and it outperformed other recent models by 43.2% on average\nROUGE scores (ranging from 2.5% to 95.4%). It is also experimented on other\nlow-resource languages i.e. Turkish, Marathi, and Hindi language, where we find\nthat the proposed method performs as similar as Bengali for these languages. In\naddition, a new high-quality Bengali dataset is curated which contains 250\narticles and a pair of summaries for each of them. We believe this research is\na crucial addition to Bengali Natural Language Processing (NLP) research and it\ncan easily be extended into other low-resource languages.

Each CC contains a mist of tiny cool cloudlets dispersed\nin a warm/hot medium ($\\sim 10^5$ - $10^6$~K).

While particles of\nsmall size (below a critical size, ~20 nm) display superparamagnetic behavior\nat room temperature, these particles tend to penetrate highly sensitive areas\nof the body such as the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), leading to undesired\neffects. In addition, these particles possess a high probability of retention,\nwhich can lead to genotoxicity and biochemical toxicity. Increasing particle\nsize is a means for addressing these problems but also suppresses the\nsuperparamagnetism. We have overcome this particle size limit by synthesizing\nunique polycrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles composed of multiple\nnanocrystals of 10 to 15 nm size while tuning particle size from 160 to 400 nm.\nThese so-called superparticles preserve superparamagnetic characteristics and\nexhibit excellent hyperthermia responses. The specific absorption rates (SAR)\nexceed 250 W/g (HAC = 800 Oe, f = 310 kHz) at a low concentration of 0.5 mg/mL,\nindicating their capability in cancer treatment with minimum dose.

Already known emission knots in the HH 215\nflow and new features were studied. Moreover, a newly-formed HH knot was\nrevealed, presumably formed during the large maximum of PV Cep star in\n1976-1977. We found the high-velocity inner channel in the HH 215 ionized\noutflow, oriented accordingly to the mean direction of the whole HH outflow and\nthe axis of the symmetry of the reflection nebula. The HH-knots located along\nthe axis of the high-velocity channel have a position angle coinciding with its\naxis (abut 325$^{\\circ}$), however other ones have completely different value\n(about 25$^{\\circ}$), which supports the idea that those knots are formed by\noblique shocks.

The total length of HH 215 outflow should be about 0.2 pc, and the full\nlength of the bipolar outflow from PV Cep (HH 315 + HH 215) can be estimated as\n3.6 pc, assuming that it more or less keeps the same inclination angle.",

They are called sieves because\nthere are certain sets of numbers which, with appropriate groups, can select,\nfor example, a set of primes, think of the famous Eratosthenes sieve. In this\narticle we have given a general definition of algebraic sieves. And we also\nintroduced the notion of invariant and multi-invariant functions, certain\npermutations on the sieve set which, in the invariant case, commute with the\naction of a given sieve-selecting group and the automorphism of that group, and\nmulti-invariants which commute with all groups and their respective\nautomorphisms. By means of such functions we have given symmetries on such\nsieves. In particular, we studied certain groups of symmetries of invariant\nfunctions. Then, using such notions, we studied a particular example, the\nGoldbach sieve, where the selector groups are dihedral groups and the selected\nset consists of the primes and, in some cases, the numbers $1$ and $N-1=p$,\nwith $N$ being even and p prime, which satisfies the Goldbach conjecture for\n$N$.

While reliable\nrelic landslide detection benefits the effective monitoring and prevention of\nlandslide disaster, semantic segmentation using high-resolution remote sensing\nimages for relic landslides faces many challenges, including the object visual\nblur problem, due to the changes of appearance caused by prolonged natural\nevolution and human activities, and the small-sized dataset problem, due to\ndifficulty in recognizing and labelling the samples. To address these\nchallenges, a semantic segmentation model, termed mask-recovering and\ninteractive-feature-enhancing (MRIFE), is proposed for more efficient feature\nextraction and separation. Specifically, a contrastive learning and mask\nreconstruction method with locally significant feature enhancement is proposed\nto improve the ability to distinguish between the target and background and\nrepresent landslide semantic features. Meanwhile, a dual-branch interactive\nfeature enhancement architecture is used to enrich the extracted features and\naddress the issue of visual ambiguity. Self-distillation learning is introduced\nto leverage the feature diversity both within and between samples for\ncontrastive learning, improving sample utilization, accelerating model\nconvergence, and effectively addressing the problem of the small-sized dataset.\nThe proposed MRIFE is evaluated on a real relic landslide dataset, and\nexperimental results show that it greatly improves the performance of relic\nlandslide detection.

Quantifying such uncertainty is particularly pivotal for object\ndetection, where images contain multi-scale objects with occlusion,\nobscureness, and even noisy annotations, in contrast to images with centric and\nsimilar-scale objects in classification. This paper suggests modeling and\nexploiting the uncertainty inherent in object detection data with vision\nfoundation models and develops a data-centric reliable training paradigm.\nTechnically, we propose to estimate the data uncertainty of each object\ninstance based on the feature space of vision foundation models, which are\ntrained on ultra-large-scale datasets and able to exhibit universal data\nrepresentation. In particular, we assume a mixture-of-Gaussian structure of the\nobject features and devise Mahalanobis distance-based measures to quantify the\ndata uncertainty. Furthermore, we suggest two curial and practical usages of\nthe estimated uncertainty: 1) for defining uncertainty-aware sample filter to\nabandon noisy and redundant instances to avoid over-fitting, and 2) for\ndefining sample adaptive regularizer to balance easy/hard samples for adaptive\ntraining. The estimated aleatoric uncertainty serves as an extra level of\nannotations of the dataset, so it can be utilized in a plug-and-play manner\nwith any model.

While DSGE models\ntraditionally rely on rational expectations, we demonstrate that behavioral\nexpectations more accurately capture the distributional characteristics of\nIndia's output gap and inflation rates data. Utilizing both Hodrick-Prescott\nand Kalman filters, we estimate the output gap and establish congruence with\nthe moments of the simulated output gap.

To ensure model precision, we implement Mahalanobis distance\nminimization for model calibration. Our findings elucidate that vaccination\nprograms generated significant positive supply shocks, counterbalancing the\nprolonged negative demand shock precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMoreover, the analysis reveals that the positive supply shocks' persistence\nparameter exceeds that of the negative demand shocks, indicating the\nexceptional efficacy of India's vaccination strategy.

    "abstract": "Natural biological systems process environmental information through both\namplitude and frequency-modulated signals, yet engineered biological circuits\nhave largely relied on amplitude-based regulation alone. Despite the prevalence\nof frequency-encoded signals in natural systems, fundamental challenges in\ndesigning and implementing frequency-responsive gene circuits have limited\ntheir development in synthetic biology. Here we present a Time-Resolved Gene\nCircuit (TRGC) architecture that enables frequency-to-amplitude signal\nconversion in engineered biological systems. Through systematic analysis, we\nestablish a theoretical framework that guides the design of synthetic circuits\ncapable of distinct frequency-dependent responses, implementing both high-pass\nand low-pass filtering behaviors. To enable rigorous characterization of these\ndynamic circuits, we developed a high-throughput automated platform that\nensures stable and reproducible measurements of frequency-dependent r esponses\nacross diverse conditions. Using this platform, we demonstrate that these\nfrequency-modulated circuits can access cellular states unreachable through\nconventional amplitude modulation, significantly expanding the controllable\ngene expression space in multi-gene systems. Our results show that frequency\nmodulation expands the range of achievable expression patterns when controlling\nmultiple genes through a single input, demonstrating a new paradigm for\nengineering cellular behaviors. This work establishes frequency modulation as a\npowerful strategy for expanding the capabilities of engineered biological\nsystems and enhancing cellular response to dynamic signals.",

    "abstract": "Powered by large language models, the conversational capabilities of AI have\nseen significant improvements. In this context, a series of role-playing AI\nchatbots have emerged, exhibiting a strong tendency toward anthropomorphism,\nsuch as conversing like humans, possessing personalities, and fulfilling social\nand companionship functions. Informed by media dependency theory in\ncommunication studies, this work hypothesizes that a higher level of\nanthropomorphism of the role-playing chatbots will increase users' media\ndependency (i.e., people will depend on media that meets their needs and\ngoals). Specifically, we conducted a user study on a Chinese role-playing\nchatbot platform, Xuanhe AI, selecting four representative chatbots as research\ntargets. We invited 149 users to interact with these chatbots over a period. A\nquestionnaire survey revealed a significant positive correlation between the\ndegree of anthropomorphism in role-playing chatbots and users' media\ndependency, with user satisfaction mediating this relationship. Next, based on\nthe quantitative results, we conducted semi-structured interviews with ten\nusers to further understand the factors that deterred them from depending on\nanthropomorphic chatbots. In conclusion, this work has provided empirical\ninsights for the design of role-playing AI chatbots and deepened the\nunderstanding of how users engage with conversational AI over a longer period.",

This law states that electron\nheat and charge transport are linked by a constant $L_0$, i.e., the Sommerfeld\nvalue of the Lorenz number ($L$). Such relation can be violated at elevated\ntemperatures where the abundant inelastic scattering leads to a reduction of\nthe Lorenz number ($L < L_0$). Here, we report a rare case of remarkably\nenhanced Lorenz number ($L > L_0$) discovered in the magnetic topological\nsemimetal NdAlSi. Measurements of the transverse electrical and thermal\ntransport coefficients reveal that the Hall Lorenz number $L_{xy}$ in NdAlSi\nstarts to deviate from the canonical value far above its magnetic ordering\ntemperature. Moreover, $L_{xy}$ displays strong nonmonotonic temperature and\nfield dependence, reaching its maximum value close to 2$L_0$ in an intermediate\nparameter range. Further analysis excludes charge-neutral excitations as the\norigin of enhanced $L_{xy}$. Alternatively, we attribute it to the Kondo-type\nelastic scattering off localized 4$f$ electrons, which creates a peculiar\nenergy distribution of the quasiparticle relaxation time.

    "abstract": "In the detection of gravitational waves in space, during the science phase of\nthe mission, the point ahead angle mechanism (PAAM) serves to steer a laser\nbeam to compensate for the angle generated by the relative motion of the two\nspacecrafts (SCs) during the approximately 10 seconds of flight time a laser\nbeam will take from one SC to reach a distant SC of three million kilometers\naway. The common practice for pointing stability control of a laser beam is to\nfirst do a coarse tracking by the PAAM to steer a laser beam to compensate for\nthe relative motion between two SCs, to be followed by a fine pointing\nstability control. In the present work, by exploiting the near-circular orbit\nstructure of individual SC in the triangular constellation, the feasibility of\ninserting an adaptive Kalman filter (AEKF) into the PAAM control loop is\ninvestigated. By adopting a colored measurement noise model that closely\nresembles the prospective on orbit situation, numerical simulation suggests\nthat the dynamic range of the PAAM may be reduced to the level of nano-radians\nusing the prediction of the pointing head angle (PAA) by the AEKF. This will\ncut down on the TTL coupling noise and the position noise budget allocated to\nthe PAAM. This in turn reduces the dynamic range of the fine pointing control\nand leaves room to improve its accuracy, thereby offers the prospect of\nreduction of the position noise budget allocated to the laser pointing\ninstability as a whole.",

However,\nmost studies on 3D mechanical couplings have been limited to ad-hoc axial-twist\ndesigns due to a lack of comprehensive understanding of 3D non-centrosymmetry\nand chirality. Few theoretical methods exist to identify and quantify\nmechanical couplings in non-centrosymmetric and chiral lattices, typically\nrelying on crystal physics (point group symmetry) and generalized constitutive\nequations. By extending symmetry breaking to mirror and inversion symmetries,\nwe identify a broader range of mechanical couplings beyond axial-twist, such as\naxial-bending couplings. We develop a generalized 3D micropolar model of curved\ncubic lattices, encompassing both non-centrosymmetric achiral and chiral\ngeometries, to quantify anisotropic physical properties and mechanical\ncouplings as functions of curvature and handedness. Integrating point group\nsymmetry operations with micropolar homogenized constitutive equations for\ncurved cubic lattices, including mirror and inversion symmetry breaking,\nprovides a clear design framework for identifying and quantifying anisotropic\nphysical properties and mechanical couplings beyond axial-twist. This study\nuncovers a novel axial-bending coupling in non-centrosymmetric structures and\nhighlights the weak correlation between chirality and both axial-bending and\naxial-twisting couplings. It also offers design guidelines for achieving\nmultimodal couplings. The relationship between metamaterials' geometry and\nphysical properties aligns with Neumann's principle.

    "abstract": "Identifying influential spreaders in complex networks is a critical challenge\nin network science, with broad applications in disease control, information\ndissemination, and influence analysis in social networks. The gravity model, a\ndistinctive approach for identifying influential spreaders, has attracted\nsignificant attention due to its ability to integrate node influence and the\ndistance between nodes. However, the law of gravity is symmetric, whereas the\ninfluence between different nodes is asymmetric. Existing gravity model-based\nmethods commonly rely on the topological distance as a metric to measure the\ndistance between nodes. Such reliance neglects the strength or frequency of\nconnections between nodes, resulting in symmetric influence values between node\npairs, which ultimately leads to an inaccurate assessment of node influence.\nMoreover, these methods often overlook cycle structures within networks, which\nprovide redundant pathways for nodes and contribute significantly to the\noverall connectivity and stability of the network. In this paper, we propose a\nhybrid method called HGC, which integrates the gravity model with effective\ndistance and incorporates cycle structure to address the issues above.\nEffective distance, derived from probabilities, measures the distance between a\nsource node and others by considering its connectivity, providing a more\naccurate reflection of actual relationships between nodes. To evaluate the\naccuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted several\nexperiments on eight real-world networks based on the\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered model. The results demonstrate that HGC\noutperforms seven compared methods in accurately identifying influential nodes.",

    "abstract": "To guide a learner in mastering action skills, it is crucial for a coach to\n1) reason through the learner's action execution and technical points\n(TechPoints), and 2) provide detailed, comprehensible feedback on what is done\nwell and what can be improved. However, existing score-based action assessment\nmethods are still far from reaching this practical scenario. To bridge this\ngap, we investigate a new task termed Descriptive Action Coaching (DescCoach)\nwhich requires the model to provide detailed commentary on what is done well\nand what can be improved beyond a simple quality score for action execution. To\nthis end, we first build a new dataset named EE4D-DescCoach. Through an\nautomatic annotation pipeline, our dataset goes beyond the existing action\nassessment datasets by providing detailed TechPoint-level commentary.\nFurthermore, we propose TechCoach, a new framework that explicitly incorporates\nTechPoint-level reasoning into the DescCoach process. The central to our method\nlies in the Context-aware TechPoint Reasoner, which enables TechCoach to learn\nTechPoint-related quality representation by querying visual context under the\nsupervision of TechPoint-level coaching commentary. By leveraging the visual\ncontext and the TechPoint-related quality representation, a unified\nTechPoint-aware Action Assessor is then employed to provide the overall\ncoaching commentary together with the quality score. Combining all of these, we\nestablish a new benchmark for DescCoach and evaluate the effectiveness of our\nmethod through extensive experiments. The data and code will be made publicly\navailable.",

    "abstract": "In real-world applications, class-imbalanced datasets pose significant\nchallenges for machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines\n(SVMs), particularly in effectively managing imbalance, noise, and outliers.\nFuzzy support vector machines (FSVMs) address class imbalance by assigning\nvarying fuzzy memberships to samples; however, their sensitivity to imbalanced\ndatasets can lead to inaccurate assessments. The recently developed\nslack-factor-based FSVM (SFFSVM) improves traditional FSVMs by using slack\nfactors to adjust fuzzy memberships based on misclassification likelihood,\nthereby rectifying misclassifications induced by the hyperplane obtained via\ndifferent error cost (DEC). Building on SFFSVM, we propose an improved\nslack-factor-based FSVM (ISFFSVM) that introduces a novel location parameter.\nThis novel parameter significantly advances the model by constraining the DEC\nhyperplane's extension, thereby mitigating the risk of misclassifying minority\nclass samples. It ensures that majority class samples with slack factor scores\napproaching the location threshold are assigned lower fuzzy memberships, which\nenhances the model's discrimination capability. Extensive experimentation on a\ndiverse array of real-world KEEL datasets demonstrates that the proposed\nISFFSVM consistently achieves higher F1-scores, Matthews correlation\ncoefficients (MCC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) compared\nto baseline classifiers. Consequently, the introduction of the location\nparameter, coupled with the slack-factor-based fuzzy membership, enables\nISFFSVM to outperform traditional approaches, particularly in scenarios\ncharacterized by severe class disparity. The code for the proposed model is\navailable at \\url{https://github.com/mtanveer1/ISFFSVM}.",

Techniques from natural language processing and\ncomputer vision have been used widely to automatically identify and filter out\nsensitive content such as offensive languages, violence, nudity, and addiction\nin both text, images, and videos, enabling platforms to enforce content\npolicies at scale. However, existing methods still have limitations in\nachieving high detection accuracy with fewer false positives and false\nnegatives. Therefore, more sophisticated algorithms for understanding the\ncontext of both text and image may open rooms for improvement in content\ncensorship to build a more efficient censorship system. In this paper, we\nevaluate existing LLM-based content moderation solutions such as OpenAI\nmoderation model and Llama-Guard3 and study their capabilities to detect\nsensitive contents. Additionally, we explore recent LLMs such as GPT, Gemini,\nand Llama in identifying inappropriate contents across media outlets.

Stacking was\nconducted in halo mass bins and tested for AGN and X-ray binary contamination,\nsystematics in the halo mass proxy, and uncertainties in optical group centers.\nThe study provides average X-ray surface brightness profiles in six mass bins,\nspanning Milky Way-like systems to poor clusters. The scatter in the X-ray\nluminosity-mass (LX-M) relation is attributed to gas concentration: low X-ray\nluminosity systems at fixed halo mass exhibit lower central gas concentrations\nthan high-luminosity systems, consistent with Magneticum predictions. However,\ndiscrepancies in dark matter concentration arise, with Magneticum predicting\nundetected groups as older and more relaxed, while observations suggest the\nopposite. New LX-M relations are presented covering three decades of halo mass.\nThese relations fit a single power law, aligning with previous studies.\nMagneticum matches observed gas distributions across all masses, whereas\nIllustrisTNG, EAGLE, Simba, and FLAMINGO exhibit significant discrepancies at\nvarious mass scales. Simulations calibrated on local galaxy properties\naccurately reproduce central galaxies but fail to capture gas properties.\nConversely, simulations like Magneticum excel in gas predictions but produce\noverly massive central galaxies.

However, our understanding of\nrotating superfluid droplets remains limited. For instance, superfluid $^4$He\n(He II) can carry angular momentum through two distinct mechanisms: the\nformation of an array of quantized vortex lines, which induce flows resembling\nclassical solid-body rotation, and surface traveling deformation modes\nassociated with irrotational internal flows. These two mechanisms can result in\nsignificantly different droplet morphologies, and it remains unclear how the\ninjected angular momentum is partitioned between them. To investigate this\ncomplex problem experimentally, one must first levitate an isolated He II\ndroplet using techniques such as magnetic levitation. However, an outstanding\nchallenge lies in effectively injecting angular momentum into the levitated\ndroplet. In this paper, we describe a magneto-optical cryostat system designed\nto levitate He II droplets and present the design of a time-dependent,\nnon-axially symmetric electric driving system. Based on our numerical\nsimulations, this system should enable controlled angular momentum injection\ninto the droplet.

The origin of this gas remains uncertain, with one\npossibility being the unexpectedly long survival of PPDs (the primordial-origin\nscenario). To explore the plausibility of this scenario, we conduct 1D disk\nevolution simulations, varying parameters like stellar mass, disk mass,\nturbulent stress, and the model of magnetohydrodynamic winds, while\nincorporating stellar evolution to account for time-varying photoevaporation\nrates. Our focus is on disks where small grains are depleted, as these are\npotentially long-lived due to reduced far-ultraviolet photoevaporation. Our\nresults show that gas in these disks can survive beyond 10 Myr regardless of\nthe stellar mass, provided they are initially massive\n($M_{\\mathrm{disk}}\\approx 0.1M_*$) with relatively weak turbulent stress\n($\\alpha \\ll 10^{-2}$). The longest lifetimes are consistently found for $M_* =\n2 M_{\\odot}$ across a wide parameter space, with gas typically persisting at\n$\\sim 10$--$10^3$ au. Roughly estimated CO masses for these disks fall within\nthe observed range for the most massive gas-rich debris disks around early\nA~stars. These alignments support the plausibility of the primordial-origin\nscenario. Additionally, our model predicts that accretion persists for as long\nas the disk survives, which could explain the accretion signatures detected in\nold disks hosted by low-mass stars, including Peter Pan disks. Our finding also\nsuggests that ongoing accretion may exist in gas-rich debris disks. Thus,\nsearching for accretion signatures could be a key to determining the origins of\ngas in debris disks.",

Existing\nmethods typically estimate the true label posterior, conditioned on the\ninstance and noisy annotations, to infer true labels or adjust loss functions.\nThese estimates, however, often overlook potential misspecification in the true\nlabel posterior, which can degrade model performances, especially in high-noise\nscenarios. To address this issue, we investigate learning from noisy\nannotations with an estimated true label posterior through the framework of\nconditional distributionally robust optimization (CDRO). We propose formulating\nthe problem as minimizing the worst-case risk within a distance-based ambiguity\nset centered around a reference distribution. By examining the strong duality\nof the formulation, we derive upper bounds for the worst-case risk and develop\nan analytical solution for the dual robust risk for each data point. This leads\nto a novel robust pseudo-labeling algorithm that leverages the likelihood ratio\ntest to construct a pseudo-empirical distribution, providing a robust reference\nprobability distribution in CDRO. Moreover, to devise an efficient algorithm\nfor CDRO, we derive a closed-form expression for the empirical robust risk and\nthe optimal Lagrange multiplier of the dual problem, facilitating a principled\nbalance between robustness and model fitting.

The system's connectivity -- governed by compatibility constraints such\nas data residency or resource requirements -- is represented by an arbitrary\nbipartite graph. Each frontend operates independently without communication\nwith other frontends, and the goal is to minimize the expected average latency\nof all jobs. We propose a closed-loop policy called the Greatest Marginal\nService Rate (GMSR) policy that achieves effective coordination without\nrequiring knowledge of arrival rates.\n  In a discrete-time stochastic model, we show that the behavior of our routing\npolicy converges (almost surely) to the behavior of a fluid model, in the limit\nas job sizes tend to zero and job arrival rates are scaled so that the expected\ntotal volume of jobs arriving per unit time remains fixed. Then, in the fluid\nregime, we demonstrate that the policy attains an $\\epsilon$-suboptimal\nsolution in $O(\\delta + \\log{1/\\epsilon})$ time from $\\delta$-suboptimal\ninitial workloads, which implies global convergence to the centrally\ncoordinated optimal routing. Finally, we analyze the fluid model when the\nsystem is overloaded. We show that GMSR lexicographically maximizes throughput,\nmaximizes the number of stable backends, and minimizes their collective\nworkload.",

    "abstract": "The task of scholar name disambiguation is crucial in various real-world\nscenarios, including bibliometric-based candidate evaluation for awards,\napplication material anti-fraud measures, and more.

This\npaper proposes a novel approach by leveraging search-enhanced language models\nacross multiple languages to improve name disambiguation. By utilizing the\npowerful query rewriting, intent recognition, and data indexing capabilities of\nsearch engines, our method can gather richer information for distinguishing\nbetween entities and extracting profiles, resulting in a more comprehensive\ndata dimension. Given the strong cross-language capabilities of large language\nmodels(LLMs), optimizing enhanced retrieval methods with this technology offers\nsubstantial potential for high-efficiency information retrieval and\nutilization.

    "abstract": "In recent years, cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and\npersistent. Detection and investigation based on the provenance graph can\neffectively mitigate cyber intrusion. However, in the long time span of\ndefenses, the sheer size of the provenance graph will pose significant\nchallenges to the storage systems. Faced with long-term storage tasks, existing\nmethods are unable to simultaneously achieve lossless information, efficient\ncompression, and fast query support. In this paper, we propose a novel\nprovenance graph storage system, LESS, which consumes smaller storage space and\nsupports faster storage and queries compared to current approaches. We\ninnovatively partition the provenance graph into two distinct components, the\ngraph structure and attribute, and store them separately. Based on their\nrespective characteristics, we devise two appropriate storage schemes: the\nprovenance graph structure storage method based on machine learning and the use\nof the minimal spanning tree to store the graph attributes. Compared with the\nstate-of-the-art approach, LEONARD, LESS reduces 6.29 times in storage time,\nwhile also achieving a 5.24 times reduction in disk usage and an 18.3 times\nfaster query speed while using only 11.5% of the memory on DARPA TC dataset.",

    "abstract": "The impact of non-extensive statistics on the hard thermal loop (HTL)\nresummation technique is investigated, in the absence and presence of a\nmagnetic field. By utilizing the non-extensive bare propagators in the\nreal-time formalism of finite temperature field theory, we determine the\nnon-extensive deformations of both HTL gluon self-energies and resummed gluon\npropagators at the one-loop order. We observe that the introduction of\nnon-extensivity results in distinct shifts in the Debye masses for the\nretarded/advanced and symmetric gluon self-energies. Applying the non-extensive\nmodified resummed gluon propagators to obtain the dielectric permittivity of a\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP), we thereby derive the static heavy quark potential,\nwhich incorporates both short-range Yukawa and long-range string-like\ninteractions between heavy quarks and the QGP medium. The real part of the\npotential exhibits increased screening as the non-extensive parameter $q$ ($q\n\\geq 1$) increases, reducing the binding energies of heavy quarkonia.\nFurthermore, including non-extensivity enhances the magnitude of the imaginary\npart of the potential, causing a broadening in the decay widths of heavy\nquarkonia. Based on these observations, we estimate the melting temperatures of\nheavy quarkonia. Our results indicate that non-extensivity lowers the melting\ntemperatures of heavy quarkonia, thus facilitating their dissociation, whereas\nthe presence of a magnetic field inhibits this dissociation.",

    "abstract": "Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To\nreduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to\nstore intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational\noverhead for token generation. However, the memory required for the KV cache\ngrows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective\nalternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory\npressure, but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe\nconnection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these\nissues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU\nheterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and\ndependence on CPU capabilities. Fully overlapping PCIe communication latency\ngets challenging as the size of the KV cache grows and/or the GPU compute\ncapabilities increase. In this paper, we introduce KVPR, an efficient I/O-aware\nLLM inference method where the CPU first transfers a partial set of\nactivations, from which the GPU can start recomputing the KV cache values.\nWhile the GPU recomputes the partial KV cache, the remaining portion of the KV\ncache is transferred concurrently from the CPU. This approach overlaps GPU\nrecomputation with KV cache transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize\ninference performance. KVPR is fully automated by integrating a profiler module\nthat utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a\nscheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication\nworkloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution\nplan. Experimental results show that KVPR achieves up to 35.8% lower latency\nand 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art\napproaches.

    "abstract": "We introduce MUSE-VL, a Unified Vision-Language Model through Semantic\ndiscrete Encoding for multimodal understanding and generation. Recently, the\nresearch community has begun exploring unified models for visual generation and\nunderstanding. However, existing vision tokenizers (e.g., VQGAN) only consider\nlow-level information, which makes it difficult to align with language tokens.\nThis results in high training complexity and necessitates a large amount of\ntraining data to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, their performance\nis still far from dedicated understanding models. This paper proposes Semantic\nDiscrete Encoding (SDE), which effectively aligns the information of visual\ntokens and language tokens by adding semantic constraints to the visual\ntokenizer. This greatly reduces the amount of training data and improves the\nperformance of the unified model. With the same LLM size, our method improved\nthe understanding performance by 4.8% compared to the previous SOTA Emu3 and\nsurpassed the dedicated understanding model LLaVA-NeXT 34B by 3.7%. Our model\nalso surpasses the existing unified models on visual generation benchmarks.",

In\nthis paper, we propose and realize a simplified SSB generation scheme\nnecessitating only a single RF drive, by achieving effective RF phase shift\nusing on-chip optical delay lines. This approach not only reduces system\ncomplexity and saves energy consumption by 3 dB, but also enables easy\nscalability to higher frequencies. We demonstrate both full-carrier SSB\n(FC-SSB) and carrier-suppressed SSB (CS-SSB) modulation on thin-film lithium\nniobate platform. For FC-SSB, we show a maximum sideband suppression of 22.1 dB\nat 50 GHz and apply it to address the frequency-selective power fading problem\nin optical communication systems. For CS-SSB, we show a maximum sideband\nsuppression of 22.5 dB and a sideband-to-carrier suppression of 16.9 dB at 50\nGHz, which can act as an optical frequency shifter by sweeping the modulation\nfrequencies. Moreover, the shifted optical frequency can be transferred back to\nthe electrical domain by beating with a reference signal generated via a phase\nmodulator on the same chip, achieving broadband RF frequency shifting from a\nmaximum of 50 GHz down to 1 GHz.

However, designed as general-purpose visual\nencoders, ViT backbones often overlook the specific needs of task decoders,\nrevealing opportunities to design decoders tailored to efficient semantic\nsegmentation. This paper proposes Strip Cross-Attention (SCASeg), an innovative\ndecoder head explicitly designed for semantic segmentation. Instead of relying\non the simple conventional skip connections, we employ lateral connections\nbetween the encoder and decoder stages, using encoder features as Queries for\nthe cross-attention modules. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Layer Block\nthat blends hierarchical feature maps from different encoder and decoder stages\nto create a unified representation for Keys and Values. To further boost\ncomputational efficiency, SCASeg compresses queries and keys into strip-like\npatterns to optimize memory usage and inference speed over the traditional\nvanilla cross-attention. Moreover, the Cross-Layer Block incorporates the local\nperceptual strengths of convolution, enabling SCASeg to capture both global and\nlocal context dependencies across multiple layers. This approach facilitates\neffective feature interaction at different scales, improving the overall\nperformance. Experiments show that the adaptable decoder of SCASeg produces\ncompetitive performance across different setups, surpassing leading\nsegmentation architectures on all benchmark datasets, including ADE20K,\nCityscapes, COCO-Stuff 164k, and Pascal VOC2012, even under varying\ncomputational limitations.",

We developed algorithms to create neuron-like (neuromorphic)\nspiking representations of texture that are invariant to the scanning speed and\ncontact force applied in the sensing process. The spiking representations are\nbased on mimicking activity from mechanoreceptors in human skin and further\nprocessing up to the brain. The neuromorphic encoding process transforms analog\nsensor readings into speed and force invariant spiking representations in three\nsequential stages: the force invariance module (in the analog domain), the\nspiking activity encoding module (transforms from analog to spiking domain),\nand the speed invariance module (in the spiking domain). The algorithms were\ntested on a tactile texture dataset collected in 15 speed-force conditions. An\noffline texture classification system built on the invariant representations\nhas higher classification accuracy, improved computational efficiency, and\nincreased capability to identify textures explored in novel speed-force\nconditions. The speed invariance algorithm was adapted to a real-time\nhuman-operated texture classification system. Similarly, the invariant\nrepresentations improved classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and\ncapability to identify textures explored in novel conditions. The invariant\nrepresentation is even more crucial in this context due to human imprecision\nwhich seems to the classification system as a novel condition. These results\ndemonstrate that invariant neuromorphic representations enable better\nperforming neurorobotic tactile sensing systems.

The novel loss function resulted in faster loss\nconvergence, correlating to reduced training time, whilst also displaying an\n83.6% reduction in structural similarity error between the generated field and\nground truth simulations, a 76.6% higher maximum rate of loss and an increased\nability to fool a discriminator network.

    "abstract": "The batch and online workload of Internet data centers (IDCs) offer temporal\nand spatial scheduling flexibility. Given that power generation costs vary over\ntime and location, harnessing the flexibility of IDCs' energy consumption\nthrough workload regulation can optimize the power flow within the system. This\npaper focuses on multi-geographically distributed IDCs managed by an Internet\nservice company (ISC), which are aggregated as a controllable load. The load\nflexibility resulting from spatial load regulation of online workload is taken\ninto account. A two-step workload scheduling mechanism is adopted, and a\ncomputation-power coupling model of ISC is established to facilitate\ncollaborative optimization in active distribution networks (ADNs). To address\nthe model-solving problem based on the assumption of scheduling homogeneity, a\nmodel reconstruction method is proposed. An efficient iterative algorithm is\ndesigned to solve the reconstructed model. Furthermore, the Nash bargaining\nsolution is employed to coordinate the different optimization objectives of ISC\nand power system operators, thereby avoiding subjective arbitrariness.\nExperimental cases based on a 33-node distribution system are designed to\nverify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm in optimizing ISC's energy\nconsumption and power flow within the system.",

The key\nchallenge lies in maintaining high ID fidelity consistently while preserving\nthe original motion dynamic and semantic following after the identity\ninjection. Current video identity customization methods mainly rely on\nreconstructing given identity images on text-to-image models, which have a\ndivergent distribution with the T2V model. This process introduces a\ntuning-inference gap, leading to dynamic and semantic degradation. To tackle\nthis problem, we propose a novel framework, dubbed $\\textbf{PersonalVideo}$,\nthat applies a mixture of reward supervision on synthesized videos instead of\nthe simple reconstruction objective on images. Specifically, we first\nincorporate identity consistency reward to effectively inject the reference's\nidentity without the tuning-inference gap. Then we propose a novel semantic\nconsistency reward to align the semantic distribution of the generated videos\nwith the original T2V model, which preserves its dynamic and semantic following\ncapability during the identity injection. With the non-reconstructive reward\ntraining, we further employ simulated prompt augmentation to reduce overfitting\nby supervising generated results in more semantic scenarios, gaining good\nrobustness even with only a single reference image.

While DFKD methods have achieved success on smaller\ndatasets like CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, they encounter challenges on larger,\nhigh-resolution datasets such as ImageNet. A primary issue with previous\napproaches is their generation of synthetic images at high resolutions (e.g.,\n$224 \\times 224$) without leveraging information from real images, often\nresulting in noisy images that lack essential class-specific features in large\ndatasets. Additionally, the computational cost of generating the extensive data\nneeded for effective knowledge transfer can be prohibitive.

    "abstract": "Context: Crowdsourced testing has gained popularity in software testing,\nespecially for mobile app testing, due to its ability to bring diversity and\ntackle fragmentation issues. However, the openness of crowdsourced testing\npresents challenges, particularly in the manual review of numerous test\nreports, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Objective: The primary\ngoal of this research is to improve the efficiency of review processes in\ncrowdsourced testing. Traditional approaches to test report prioritization lack\na deep understanding of semantic information in textual descriptions of these\nreports. This paper introduces LLMPrior, a novel approach for prioritizing\ncrowdsourced test reports using large language models (LLMs). Method: LLMPrior\nleverages LLMs for the analysis and clustering of crowdsourced test reports\nbased on the types of bugs revealed in their textual descriptions. This\ninvolves using prompt engineering techniques to enhance the performance of\nLLMs. Following the clustering, a recurrent selection algorithm is applied to\nprioritize the reports. Results: Empirical experiments are conducted to\nevaluate the effectiveness of LLMPrior. The findings indicate that LLMPrior not\nonly surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of performance but\nalso proves to be more feasible, efficient, and reliable. This success is\nattributed to the use of prompt engineering techniques and the cluster-based\nprioritization strategy. Conclusion: LLMPrior represents a significant\nadvancement in crowdsourced test report prioritization. By effectively\nutilizing large language models and a cluster-based strategy, it addresses the\nchallenges in traditional prioritization approaches, offering a more efficient\nand reliable solution for app developers dealing with crowdsourced test\nreports.",

Recent\napproaches mitigate this cost by aggressively reducing the number of Gaussians.\nHowever, this inevitably removes Gaussians essential for high-quality\nrendering, leading to severe degradation in dynamic regions. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel 4D anchor-based framework that tackles the storage cost in\ndifferent perspective. Rather than reducing the number of Gaussians, our method\nretains a sufficient quantity to accurately model dynamic contents, while\ncompressing them into compact, grid-aligned 4D anchor features. Each anchor is\nprocessed by an MLP to spawn a set of neural 4D Gaussians, which represent a\nlocal spatiotemporal region. We design these neural 4D Gaussians to capture\ntemporal changes with minimal parameters, making them well-suited for the\nMLP-based spawning. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic-aware anchor growing\nstrategy to effectively assign additional anchors to under-reconstructed\ndynamic regions. Our method adjusts the accumulated gradients with Gaussians'\ntemporal coverage, significantly improving reconstruction quality in dynamic\nregions.

They arrive\nat the conclusion that the terrestrial planets did not form by pebble\naccretion. Although we welcome debate on this topic, we want to emphasize here\nseveral points that we disagree on. We will not address in detail every claim\nmade in MKN, but rather stick to four main points. Our conclusion is that\npebble accretion remains a viable mechanism to drive significant growth of\nprotoplanets in the protoplanetary disc, with as much as 70% of Earth formed by\npebble accretion. This rapid growth phase must nevertheless have been followed\nby an extended period of collisional growth after the end of the protoplanetary\ndisc phase, likely culminating with the moon-forming giant impact. We emphasize\nhere an important recent result from Olson & Sharp (2023), namely that\nsignificant growth by pebble accretion can be reconciled with the Hf-W decay\nsystem even for a canonical moon-forming giant impact with a Mars-mass\nprotoplanet and a low equilibration efficiency - a more massive impactor, as\nproposed in Johansen et al. (2023), is not necessary. Given that terrestrial\nplanet formation naturally involves both pebble accretion and a combination of\nsmall and large impactors, this challenges the very notion of making an\neither/or distinction between the classical collision model and the pebble\naccretion model.",

We obtain the analytical\nsolution to the inverse kinematics problem of the manipulator using a\nparameterization method, transforming the redundancy resolution problem into an\noptimization problem of determining the parameters at each path point. The\nconstraints on joint velocity and acceleration serve as constraints for the\noptimization problem. Then all feasible inverse kinematic solutions for each\npose under the joint angle constraints of the manipulator are obtained through\nparameterization methods, and the globally optimal solution to this problem is\nobtained through the dynamic programming algorithm. On the other hand, if a\nfeasible joint-space path satisfying the constraints does not exist, the\nproposed algorithm can compute the minimum number of breakpoints required for\nthe path and partition the path with as few breakpoints as possible to\nfacilitate the manipulator's operation along the path. The algorithm can also\ndetermine the optimal selection of breakpoints to minimize the global cost\nfunction, rather than simply interrupting when the manipulator is unable to\ncontinue operating.

Standard approaches to\nestimating graphs rely on conditional independence tests that may not be\nsensitive to associations that manifest at the tails of joint distributions,\ni.e., they may miss connections among variables that exhibit associations\nmainly at lower or upper quantiles. In this work, we propose a novel measure of\nquantile-specific conditional association called QuACC: Quantile Association\nvia Conditional Concordance. For a pair of variables and a conditioning set,\nQuACC quantifies agreement between the residuals from two quantile regression\nmodels, which may be linear or more complex, e.g., quantile forests. Using this\nmeasure as the basis for a test of null (quantile) association, we introduce a\nnew class of quantile-specific graphical models.

Specifically,\nwe leverage our discovery that the dynamics of observables in systems with\nlocal couplings satisfy Green's functions with kernels that are local in time\nand space. This enables us to employ the dynamics of small lattices over short\ntimes to predict the dynamics of thermodynamically large lattices over\narbitrarily long timescales while circumventing the deleterious impacts of\nfinite-size effects. We thus interrogate the \\textit{exact} nonequilibrium\nformation and migration of polarons in one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D)\nsystems, revealing that their motion approaches diffusive transport only\nasymptotically in time and system size. We also compare transport in 1D and 2D\nsystems to investigate the effect of dimension in polaron migration physics,\nillustrating how energy variations can cause localization -- a phenomenon\nobservable via current microscopy experiments.",

Stateful designs require clients to maintain\nplaintext-to-ciphertext mappings, imposing significant storage and management\noverhead. Stateless designs often rely on interactive protocols between the\nclient and server, leading to high communication latency and limited\nscalability. These limitations make existing schemes unsuitable for real-world\napplications that demand simplicity, efficiency, and scalability.\n  In this work, we present Homomorphic OPE (HOPE), a new OPE scheme that\neliminates client-side storage and avoids additional client-server interaction\nduring query execution. HOPE leverages the additive property of homomorphic\nencryption to introduce a novel comparison key mechanism, which transforms\nciphertext comparison into a randomized difference computation. This mechanism\nensures that only the sign of the comparison is preserved while fully masking\nthe underlying plaintext values, enabling secure and efficient range queries\nwithout leaking additional information about the data.\n  We provide a formal cryptographic analysis of HOPE, proving its security\nunder the widely accepted IND-OCPA model. Our proofs rigorously demonstrate\nthat the comparison key mechanism reveals no information beyond the order of\nthe plaintexts and ensures resistance to both chosen-plaintext attacks and\nfrequency analysis. To validate the practicality of HOPE, we conduct extensive\nexperiments comparing it with state-of-the-art OPE schemes.

    "abstract": "We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN)\n2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at\napproximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib\nSN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity ($L_{\\rm\npeak}\\approx4.3\\times10^{42}\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$), a faster rise to brightness\n($t_{\\rm rise} \\approx 11.6$ d), and a more gradual dimming ($\\Delta m_{15}^{V}\n\\approx 0.48$ mag) compared to typical SNe Ib. Analysis of the velocity\nevolution over the first $\\sim$ 20 days after the explosion supports the view\nthat the absorption near 6200\\AA is due to high-velocity H$\\alpha$ in the outer\nlayers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in\nthe envelope of progenitor before the explosion. Assuming the peak luminosity\nis entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 ${\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount\nof nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately ten days\nafter peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive\ndecay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the\ncircumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN-CSM interaction\nin SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of IIn-like features\nduring the nebular phase.",

These high-$z$\ngalaxies appear to form much earlier and exhibit greater UV luminosity than\npredicted by theoretical work. In this study, our goal is to reproduce the\nbrightness of these sources by simulating high-redshift galaxies with virial\nmasses $M_{\\rm vir} = 10^{9} - 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ at $z > 10$. To achieve this,\nwe conduct cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations, modifying baryonic\nsub-grid physics, and post-process our simulation results to confirm the\nobservability of our simulated galaxies. Specifically, we enhanced star\nformation activity in high-redshift galaxies by either increasing the star\nformation efficiency up to 100\\% or adopting a top-heavy initial mass function\n(IMF). Our simulation results indicate that both increasing star formation\nefficiency and adopting a top-heavy IMF play crucial roles in boosting the UV\nluminosity of high-redshift galaxies, potentially exceeding the limiting\nmagnitude of JWST surveys in earlier epochs. Especially, the episodic starburst\nresulting from enhanced star formation efficiency may explain the high-redshift\ngalaxies observed by JWST, as it evacuates dust from star-forming regions,\nmaking the galaxies more observable. We demonstrate this correlation between\nstar formation activity and dust mass evolution within the simulated galaxies.\nAlso, adopting a top-heavy IMF could enhance observability due to an\noverabundance of massive stars, although it may also facilitate rapid metal\nenrichment. Using our simulation results, we derive several observables such as\neffective radius, UV slope, and emission line rates, which could serve as\nvaluable theoretical estimates for comparison with existing spectroscopic\nresults and forthcoming data from the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI instruments.",

    "abstract": "The electron-positive fermion gas in three dimensions and $T=0$ is modeled as\ntwo independent fermion gases interacting via the coulomb interaction. The main\nadvantage of the simple model is that all existing results from the electron\ngas can be directly used for the positive fermion gas, which is the same as the\nelectron gas, but scaled for the mass of the positive fermion. Additional\nscreening from the positive fermions together with use of an accurate local\nfield factor naturally introduces charge density waves in addition to the $q=0$\ninstability that occurs when the bulk modulus equals zero. The\nelectron-positive fermion gas is completely specified by the density $r_s$ and\nthe mass ratio $M/m$. Although the problem and model can be simply stated, the\nresulting phase diagram is complex and not fully understood.\n  The results of the simple model are exact formulas, and are in close\nagreement with earlier numerical results obtained using density functional\ntheory in their region of overlap. Using these results, the electron-electron,\npositive fermion-positive fermion and electron-positive fermion many body\neffective interactions are calculated in the following paper. For conditions\nclose to the charge density wave, the positive fermion contribution to the\nelectron-electron interaction, which is attractive and the source of the\nsuperconductivity, becomes large and significantly enhances the superconducting\ntransition temperature, as well as leading to a large $T^2$ contribution to the\nnormal state electrical resistivity.",

These models can then be\nfine-tuned with small amounts of labeled training and applied to a variety of\napplications. Most existing foundation models are designed for high spatial\nresolution, cloud-free satellite imagery or photos, limiting their\napplicability in scenarios that require frequent temporal monitoring or broad\nspectral profiles. As a result, foundation models trained solely on cloud-free\nimages have limited utility for applications that involve atmospheric variables\nor require atmospheric corrections.
