    "abstract": "We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate\nclassification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.\nThis network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network\n(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an\narchitecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The\narchitecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,\nthus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,\nwhile maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using\nthe autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network\nachieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility\nfor difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments\nwith DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even\nwhen the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These\nfindings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and\nefficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.",

Bacaloglu and F. Casorati, among others. We pursue the\nfollowing question: what is the best way to quantify the deformation of space?\nThis important question could be viewed in a new paradigm after 1956, when John\nF. Nash, Jr. proved that a Riemannian manifold can be immersed isometrically\ninto an Euclidean ambient space of dimension sufficiently large. This important\ntheorem allowed to view the representation of space from its exterior, from an\noutside perspective. In 1968, S.-S. Chern pointed out that a key technical\nelement in applying Nash's Theorem effectively is finding useful relationships\nbetween intrinsic and extrinsic quantities characterising immersions. And such\nrelations seem to be rather few, at least few enough to present us with a\ntechnical challenge in applying Nash's Theorem. One technical difficulty is\npresented by the passing through the narrow gateway provided by Gauss'\nequation, and that's why in order to obtain some new results it might be useful\nto include additional natural conditions. A turning point in the history of the\nquestion we pursue was an enlightening paper written by B.-Y. Chen in 1993,\nwhich paved the way for a deeper understanding of the meaning of the Riemannian\ninequalities between intrinsic and extrinsic quantities. Our present discussion\ninvites a reflection on whether we could hope to characterise submanifolds by\nusing mainly extrinsic quantities.",

In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that\nuses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First\n(Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an\nincoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow\n(modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i)\nstagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a\nstagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each\nstage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow\nwith clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on\nspecialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream\ntasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying\ndeployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology,\nour single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.\n  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach\nshows that one VLM can both decide and do.

    "abstract": "The Schwinger model, which describes lattice quantum electrodynamics in $1+1$\nspace-time dimensions, provides a valuable framework to investigate fundamental\naspects of quantum field theory, and a stepping stone towards non-Abelian gauge\ntheories. Specifically, it enables the study of physically relevant dynamical\nprocesses, such as the nonperturbative particle-antiparticle pairs production,\nknown as the Schwinger effect. In this work, we analyze the quantum\ncomputational resource requirements associated with simulating the Schwinger\neffect under two distinct scenarios: (1) a quench process, where the initial\nstate is a simple product state of a non-interacting theory, and interactions\nare turned on at time $t=0$; (2) a splitting (or scattering) process where two\nGaussian states, peaked at given initial momenta, are shot away from (or\ntowards) each other. We explore different physical regimes in which the\nSchwinger effect is expected to be observable. These regimes are characterized\nby initial momenta and coupling strengths, as well as simulation parameters\nsuch as lattice size and electric-field cutoffs. Leveraging known rigorous\nbounds for electric-field cutoffs, we find that a reliable simulation of the\nSchwinger effect is provably possible at high cutoff scales. Furthermore, we\nprovide optimized circuit implementations of both the second-order Trotter\nformula and an interaction-picture algorithm based on the Dyson series to\nimplement the time evolution. Our detailed resource estimates show the regimes\nin which the interaction-picture approach outperforms the Trotter approach, and\nvice versa. The improved theoretical error bounds, optimized quantum circuit\ndesigns, and explicitly compiled subroutines developed in this study are\nbroadly applicable to simulations of other lattice models in high-energy\nphysics and beyond.",

    "abstract": "The rise of auto-bidding has created challenges for ensuring advertiser\nincentive compatibility, particularly when advertisers delegate bidding to\nagents with high-level constraints. One challenge in defining incentive\ncompatibility is the multiplicity of equilibria. After advertisers submit\nreports, it is unclear what the result will be and one only has knowledge of a\nrange of possible results. Nevertheless, Alimohammadi et al. proposed a notion\nof Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (AIC) which serves to highlight that\nauctions may not incentivize truthful reporting of constraints. However, their\ndefinition of AIC is very stringent as it requires that the worst-case outcome\nof an advertiser's truthful report is at least as good as the best-case outcome\nof any of the advertiser's possible deviations. Indeed, they show both\nFirst-Price Auction and Second-Price Auction are not AIC. Moreover, the AIC\ndefinition precludes having ordinal preferences on the possible constraints\nthat the advertiser can report.\n  In this paper, we introduce two refined and relaxed concepts: Risk-Averse\nAuto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (RAIC) and Optimistic Auto-bidding\nIncentive Compatibility (OAIC). RAIC (OAIC) stipulates that truthful reporting\nis preferred if its least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome is no worse than\nthe least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome from any misreport. This\ndistinction allows for a clearer modeling of ordinal preferences for\nadvertisers with differing attitudes towards equilibrium uncertainty. We\ndemonstrate that SPA satisfies both RAIC and OAIC. Furthermore, we show that\nSPA also meets these conditions for two advertisers when they are assumed to\nemploy uniform bidding. These findings provide new insights into the incentive\nproperties of SPA in auto-bidding environments, particularly when considering\nadvertisers' perspectives on equilibrium selection.",

The intermolecular parameters in the free\nenergy are chosen such that one species acts as a partially miscible\nsurfactant.

However, the factors that govern the\ndifficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger\nadoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship\nbetween the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its\ncorresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a\nsystem, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence\nfuture behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for\nevaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in\n$O((\\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement\nover the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or\nunpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that\nparallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the\noptimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable\nsystems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence\nlength. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing\npractical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently\nparallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for\nparallelizable models.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of communication technologies has established cellular\nnetworks as the backbone for diverse applications, each with distinct quality\nof service requirements. Meeting these varying demands within a unified\ninfrastructure presents a critical challenge that can be addressed through\nadvanced techniques such as multi-connectivity. Multiconnectivity enables User\nequipments to connect to multiple BSs simultaneously, facilitating QoS\ndifferentiation and provisioning. This paper proposes a QoS-aware\nmulti-connectivity framework leveraging machine learning to enhance network\nperformance. The approach employs deep neural networks to estimate the\nachievable QoS metrics of BSs, including data rate, reliability, and latency.\nThese predictions inform the selection of serving clusters and data rate\nallocation, ensuring that the User Equipment connects to the optimal BSs to\nmeet its QoS needs. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed\nalgorithm significantly enhances Quality of Service (QoS) for applications\nwhere traditional and state-of-the-art methods are inadequate. Specifically,\nthe algorithm achieves a QoS success rate of 98%. Furthermore, it improves\nspectrum efficiency by 30% compared to existing multi-connectivity solutions.",

Unlike existing neural ODEs that\npredict only state trajectories, UPN simultaneously model both state evolution\nand its associated uncertainty by parameterizing coupled differential equations\nfor mean and covariance dynamics. The architecture efficiently propagates\nuncertainty through nonlinear dynamics without discretization artifacts by\nsolving coupled ODEs for state and covariance evolution while enabling\nstate-dependent, learnable process noise. The continuous-depth formulation\nadapts its evaluation strategy to each input's complexity, provides principled\nuncertainty quantification, and handles irregularly-sampled observations\nnaturally.

We implement a customised AC Optimal\nPower Flow (AC OPF) formulation which integrates into the optimisation an\nindicator reflecting the social impact of flexibility from EV users, based on\nthe analysis of historical EV charging behaviours. The contribution of EV\nowners to reducing wind curtailment is optimised to enhance the acceptability\nof flexibility procurement, as the method targets EV users whose charging\nhabits are most likely to align with flexibility requirements. Our method\nintegrates social, technological, and economic perspectives with optimal\nflexibility coordination, and utilises clustering of EVs through a kmeans\nalgorithm. To ensure scalability, we introduce a polar coordinate-based\ndimension reduction technique. The flexibility optimisation approach is\ndemonstrated on the Orkney grid model, incorporating demand and wind farm\ngeneration data, as well as multi year charging data from 106 EVs. Results\nindicate that, by building upon the existing habits of EV users, curtailment\ncan be reduced by 99.5% during a typical summer week the period when\ncurtailment is most prevalent.

The stimulus threshold for wave propagation is a key biological\nparameter that determines when the system produces a global response to a local\nstimulus. However, it is unclear how this stimulus threshold is determined by\nthe properties of the underlying signaling network. To address this gap, we\nstudied a model of trigger waves with a realistic Hill-type auto-activation\nfunction. We obtained an analytic expression for the wave ignition threshold in\n1D and numerical solutions in 2D and 3D. In the limit of high sensitivity, we\nfound that the trigger wave threshold depends on both the effective\ndissociation constant, $K_D$, and the effective Hill coefficient, $n$, of the\npositive feedback circuit, with the dominant contribution scaling as\n$K_D^{n/(n-1)}$ in all dimensions. This result leads to a simple method for\npredicting the trigger wave ignition threshold from bulk activation data and is\npotentially of use for developing synthetic trigger wave circuits with desired\nsensitivities.",

    "abstract": "In countries without civil registration and vital statistics, verbal autopsy\n(VA) is a critical tool for estimating cause of death (COD) and inform policy\npriorities. In VA, interviewers ask proximal informants for details on the\ncircumstances preceding a death, in the form of unstructured narratives and\nstructured questions. Existing automated VA cause classification algorithms\nonly use the questions and ignore the information in the narratives. In this\nthesis, we investigate how the VA narrative can be used for automated COD\nclassification using pretrained language models (PLMs) and machine learning\n(ML) techniques. Using empirical data from South Africa, we demonstrate that\nwith the narrative alone, transformer-based PLMs with task-specific fine-tuning\noutperform leading question-only algorithms at both the individual and\npopulation levels, particularly in identifying non-communicable diseases. We\nexplore various multimodal fusion strategies combining narratives and questions\nin unified frameworks. Multimodal approaches further improve performance in COD\nclassification, confirming that each modality has unique contributions and may\ncapture valuable information that is not present in the other modality. We also\ncharacterize physician-perceived information sufficiency in VA. We describe\nvariations in sufficiency levels by age and COD and demonstrate that\nclassification accuracy is affected by sufficiency for both physicians and\nmodels. Overall, this thesis advances the growing body of knowledge at the\nintersection of natural language processing, epidemiology, and global health.\nIt demonstrates the value of narrative in enhancing COD classification. Our\nfindings underscore the need for more high-quality data from more diverse\nsettings to use in training and fine-tuning PLM/ML methods, and offer valuable\ninsights to guide the rethinking and redesign of the VA instrument and\ninterview.",

    "abstract": "The paper proposes a modular-based approach to constraint handling in process\noptimization and control. This is partly motivated by the recent interest in\nlearning-based methods, e.g., within bioproduction, for which constraint\nhandling under uncertainty is a challenge. The proposed constraint handler,\ncalled predictive filter, is combined with an adaptive constraint margin and a\nconstraint violation cost monitor to minimize the cost of violating soft\nconstraints due to model uncertainty and disturbances. The module can be\ncombined with any controller and is based on minimally modifying the controller\noutput, in a least squares sense, such that constraints are satisfied within\nthe considered horizon. The proposed method is computationally efficient and\nsuitable for real-time applications. The effectiveness of the method is\nillustrated through a realistic simulation case study of glycosylation\nconstraint satisfaction in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production\nusing Chinese hamster ovary cells, for which the metabolic network model\nconsists of 23 extracellular metabolites and 126 reactions.",

    "abstract": "Regression under uncertainty is fundamental across science and engineering.\nWe present an Anchored Mixture of Experts (Anchor-MoE), a model that handles\nboth probabilistic and point regression. For simplicity, we use a tuned\ngradient-boosting model to furnish the anchor mean; however, any off-the-shelf\npoint regressor can serve as the anchor. The anchor prediction is projected\ninto a latent space, where a learnable metric-window kernel scores locality and\na soft router dispatches each sample to a small set of mixture-density-network\nexperts; the experts produce a heteroscedastic correction and predictive\nvariance. We train by minimizing negative log-likelihood, and on a disjoint\ncalibration split fit a post-hoc linear map on predicted means to improve point\naccuracy. On the theory side, assuming a H\\\"older smooth regression function of\norder~$\\alpha$ and fixed Lipschitz partition-of-unity weights with bounded\noverlap, we show that Anchor-MoE attains the minimax-optimal $L^2$ risk rate\n$O\\!\\big(N^{-2\\alpha/(2\\alpha+d)}\\big)$. In addition, the CRPS test\ngeneralization gap scales as\n$\\widetilde{O}\\!\\Big(\\sqrt{(\\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\\Big)$; it is logarithmic in $Mh$\nand scales as the square root in $P$ and $K$. Under bounded-overlap routing,\n$K$ can be replaced by $k$, and any dependence on a latent dimension is\nabsorbed into $P$. Under uniformly bounded means and variances, an analogous\n$\\widetilde{O}\\!\\big(\\sqrt{(\\log(Mh)+P+K)/N}\\big)$ scaling holds for the test\nNLL up to constants. Empirically, across standard UCI regressions, Anchor-MoE\nconsistently matches or surpasses the strong NGBoost baseline in RMSE and NLL;\non several datasets it achieves new state-of-the-art probabilistic regression\nresults on our benchmark suite.

Data-driven frameworks have been widely used to obtain low-order\nmodels of aerodynamic systems; yet, resulting models tend to yield predictions\nthat grow unbounded with time. Recently introduced stability-promoting methods\ncan facilitate the identification of bounded models, but tend to require\nextensive brute-force tuning even in the context of simple academic systems.\nHere, we show how recent theoretical advances in the long-term boundedness of\ndynamical systems can be integrated into data-driven modeling frameworks to\nensure that resulting models will yield bounded predictions of incompressible\nflows. Specifically, we propose to solve a specific set of convex semi-definite\nprogramming problems to (i) certify whether a system admits a globally\nattracting bounded set for the chosen modeling parameters, and (ii) compute a\nmodel with the optimal (tightest) bound on this globally attracting set. We\ndemonstrate the approach via integration within the sparse identification of\nnonlinear dynamics (SINDy) modeling framework. Application on two low-order\nbenchmark problems establishes the merits of the approach. We then apply our\napproach to obtain a low-order (6-mode) model of unsteady separation over a\nNACA-65(1)-412 airfoil at Re = 20, 0000, a flow that has been notoriously\ndifficult to model using data-driven methods. The resulting model is found to\naccurately predict the dynamics of unsteady separation, with model predictions\nremaining bounded indefinitely.

The nature of LRDs is\ncontroversial. Recently, several studies have investigated LRDs through\nvariability, a characteristic feature of AGNs. These studies explore LRD\nvariability by extrapolating empirical relationships from local quasars. Here,\nwe adopt the Corona-heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, which is\nmotivated by accretion physics and applicable to reproduce AGN conventional\nvariability, to study the variability of $22$ LRDs in \\citet{Tee2025}. Our\nresults indicate that the observed variability in LRDs is dominated by\nmeasurement uncertainties. Within the CHAR model, the lack of variability in\nLRDs can be explained by two scenarios: either AGNs contribute $\\lesssim30\\%$\nof the observed luminosities, or they are intrinsically luminous AGNs. We use\nsimulations to demonstrate the observational requirements to effectively\ninvestigate LRDs via variability: first, a sample of about $200$ LRDs; second,\neach LRD has two observations separated by at least two years in the observed\nframe; third, the photometric uncertainty is $\\leq 0.07$ mag.

    "abstract": "Speech tokenizers serve as foundational components for speech language\nmodels, yet current designs exhibit several limitations, including: 1)\ndependence on multi-layer residual vector quantization structures or high frame\nrates, 2) reliance on auxiliary pre-trained models for semantic distillation,\nand 3) requirements for complex two-stage training processes. In this work, we\nintroduce the Text-aware Diffusion Transformer Speech Codec (TaDiCodec), a\nnovel approach designed to overcome these challenges. TaDiCodec employs\nend-to-end optimization for quantization and reconstruction through a diffusion\nautoencoder, while integrating text guidance into the diffusion decoder to\nenhance reconstruction quality and achieve optimal compression. TaDiCodec\nachieves an extremely low frame rate of 6.25 Hz and a corresponding bitrate of\n0.0875 kbps with a single-layer codebook for 24 kHz speech, while maintaining\nsuperior performance on critical speech generation evaluation metrics such as\nWord Error Rate (WER), speaker similarity (SIM), and speech quality (UTMOS).\nNotably, TaDiCodec employs a single-stage, end-to-end training paradigm, and\nobviating the need for auxiliary pre-trained models. We also validate the\ncompatibility of TaDiCodec in language model based zero-shot text-to-speech\nwith both autoregressive modeling and masked generative modeling, demonstrating\nits effectiveness and efficiency for speech language modeling, as well as a\nsignificantly small reconstruction-generation gap. We will open source our code\nand model checkpoints. Audio samples are are available at\nhttps:/tadicodec.github.io/. We release code and model checkpoints at\nhttps:/github.com/HeCheng0625/Diffusion-Speech-Tokenizer.",

To support this, we introduce REDDME, a new dataset of 4,760 posts\nfrom mental health subreddits annotated for the span and intensity of three key\nsupport attributes: event what happened?, effect what did the user experience?,\nand requirement what support they need?. Next, we devise a hierarchical\ntaxonomy, CueTaxo, of support attributes for controlled question generation.\nFurther, we propose MH-COPILOT, a reinforcement learning-based system that\nintegrates (a) contextual attribute-span identification, (b) support attribute\nintensity classification, (c) controlled question generation via a hierarchical\ntaxonomy, and (d) a verifier for reward modeling. Our model dynamically\nassesses posts for the presence/absence of support attributes, and generates\ntargeted prompts to elicit missing information.

Our functor\nspecializes to - and provides a higher-categorical explanation for - the\nTannakian reconstruction of a Hopf algebra from a monoidal category with duals\nand a fiber functor.\n  Towards this end, we review and develop the lax (aka Gray) tensor product\n$\\otimes$ of $(\\infty,\\infty)$-categories, and we analyze the \"lax smash\nproduct\" of pointed $(\\infty,\\infty)$-categories. We compute the\nlax-$\\wedge$-square of the \"walking adjunction\" and show that its\n$3$-localization corepresents retracts with some adjunctibilty conditions,\nwhereas the $3$-localization of the \"walking monad\" corepresents bialgebras.

    "abstract": "Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in\nrecent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and\nmay not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.\n  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to\nidentify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.\n  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage\ndata in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from\nBangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage\ndata. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse\nset of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,\nalong with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.\n  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light\ngradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the\nstable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students\n(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we\npresented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the\nall-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and\nshowed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis\nof our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to\ndepression.\n  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a\nworthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and\ndeveloping regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication\nof our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive\nsystems to better understand students who are depressed.",

Our findings\nreveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor.\nAnalysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e.,\nthose with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent\nregardless of quantization.

We introduce\nRoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables\nfine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic\nattributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first\nmodel to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,\nfacilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic\ndataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to\nevaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification\nmodels. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data\nnaively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data\nfor supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through\nextensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,\nwe demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model\nperformance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness\nacross demographic subgroups.

To facilitate the\nevaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,\noffering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with\ncurrent clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of\nrationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of\nLLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale\nlearning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where\nrationales produced by prompting LLMs with/without annotation examples are used\nas distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated\nrationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover,\nincorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves\nrationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches.",

Multi-site r-band and clear-filter light curves and WHT/ACAM\nspectra from the 2012 outburst are combined with time-series spectroscopy from\nGTC/OSIRIS and VLT/FORS2 in quiescence. Period searches are conducted using\ngeneralised Lomb-Scargle, phase-dispersion minimisation, and\nanalysis-of-variance algorithms. Diffuse interstellar bands constrain E(B-V),\nwhile empirical correlations involving H$\\alpha$ yield estimates of K2, q, and\ni. We detect a double-humped modulation with a period of $0.0941\\pm0.0007$d\n($2.26\\pm0.02$h) during the outburst. Its morphology is consistent with an\nearly superhump, suggesting that the true orbital period may be slightly\nshorter than 4.52h.

However,\nDDoS detection in this context remains challenging because of complex traffic\ndynamics, severe class imbalance, and scarce labeled data. While recent methods\nhave explored solutions to address class imbalance, many still struggle to\ngeneralize under limited supervision and dynamic traffic conditions. To\novercome these challenges, we propose MixGAN, a hybrid detection method that\nintegrates conditional generation, semi-supervised learning, and robust feature\nextraction. Specifically, to handle complex temporal traffic patterns, we\ndesign a 1-D WideResNet backbone composed of temporal convolutional layers with\nresidual connections, which effectively capture local burst patterns in traffic\nsequences. To alleviate class imbalance and label scarcity, we use a pretrained\nCTGAN to generate synthetic minority-class (DDoS attack) samples that\ncomplement unlabeled data. Furthermore, to mitigate the effect of noisy\npseudo-labels, we introduce a MixUp-Average-Sharpen (MAS) strategy that\nconstructs smoothed and sharpened targets by averaging predictions over\naugmented views and reweighting them towards high-confidence classes.\nExperiments on NSL-KDD, BoT-IoT, and CICIoT2023 demonstrate that MixGAN\nachieves up to 2.5% higher accuracy and 4% improvement in both TPR and TNR\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its robustness in large-scale\nIoT-cloud environments.

    "abstract": "Code language models (so-called CodeLLMs) are now commonplace in software\ndevelopment. As a general rule, CodeLLMs are trained by dividing training\nexamples into input tokens and then learn importance of those tokens in a\nprocess called machine attention. Machine attention is based solely on input\ntoken salience to output token examples during training. Human software\ndevelopers are different, as humans intuitively know that some tokens are more\nsalient than others. While intuition itself is ineffable and a subject of\nphilosophy, clues about salience are present in human visual attention, since\npeople tend to look at more salient words more often. In this paper, we present\nEyeMulator, a technique for training CodeLLMs to mimic human visual attention\nwhile training for various software development tasks. We add special weights\nfor each token in each input example to the loss function used during LLM\nfine-tuning. We draw these weights from observations of human visual attention\nderived from a previously-collected publicly-available dataset of eye-tracking\nexperiments in software engineering tasks. These new weights ultimately induce\nchanges in the attention of the subject LLM during training, resulting in a\nmodel that does not need eye-tracking data during inference. Our evaluation\nshows that EyeMulator outperforms strong LLM baselines on several tasks such as\ncode translation, completion and summarization. We further show an ablation\nstudy that demonstrates the improvement is due to subject models learning to\nmimic human attention.",

Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach to assist EDA design as\ncircuits can be naturally represented as graphs.

Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) can better interpret EDA\ncircuit graphs as they capture both topological relationships and geometric\nfeatures.

In this paper, we propose DR-CircuitGNN, a fast GPU kernel design\nby leveraging row-wise sparsity-aware Dynamic-ReLU and optimizing SpMM kernels\nduring heterogeneous message-passing to accelerate HGNNs training on\nEDA-related circuit graph datasets. To further enhance performance, we propose\na parallel optimization strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU concurrency by\nconcurrently processing independent subgraphs using multi-threaded CPU\ninitialization and GPU kernel execution via multiple cudaStreams.

    "abstract": "The interactive nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which closely track\nuser data and context, has prompted users to share personal and private\ninformation in unprecedented ways. Even when users opt out of allowing their\ndata to be used for training, these privacy settings offer limited protection\nwhen LLM providers operate in jurisdictions with weak privacy laws, invasive\ngovernment surveillance, or poor data security practices. In such cases, the\nrisk of sensitive information, including Personally Identifiable Information\n(PII), being mishandled or exposed remains high. To address this, we propose\nthe concept of an \"LLM gatekeeper\", a lightweight, locally run model that\nfilters out sensitive information from user queries before they are sent to the\npotentially untrustworthy, though highly capable, cloud-based LLM. Through\nexperiments with human subjects, we demonstrate that this dual-model approach\nintroduces minimal overhead while significantly enhancing user privacy, without\ncompromising the quality of LLM responses.",

Here we present an analysis of spirals\nspontaneously etched on the Ge surface. We obtain measurements of the growth\ndynamics of the spirals and measurements of the local strain field in the metal\nfilm. Both indicate that the near geometric order of the pattern originates\nfrom the unique far field of a singularity - a crystal defect. The measured\nengraving profile is found in quantitative agreement with a model of metal\ncatalyzed corrosion of the Ge surface. Specifically, local etch depth is\ninversely proportional to the normal velocity of the Ge-metal contact line. The\ngrowth mechanism combines crack propagation, reaction diffusion dynamics, and\nthin film mechanical instabilities, and illustrates how a defect's long range\nfield can impose geometric order in a non-equilibrium growth process. General\nfeatures relevant to other pattern forming systems are the coupling of\nchemistry and mechanics and the singularity driven order.",

Key\nfindings demonstrate that atmospheric attenuation and beam misalignment can\nnotably degrade secrecy capacity across both short- and long-range\ncommunication links, while high-altitude eavesdroppers face less signal\ndegradation, increasing their interception capability. Moreover, increasing\ntransmit power to counter environmental losses can inadvertently improve\neavesdropper reception, thereby reducing overall link confidentiality.

In this review, we argue that network\nscience finds its most direct and mechanistically grounded application in\nnanoscale connectomics-wiring diagrams reconstructed at the level of individual\nneurons and synapses, often from high-resolution electron microscopy volumes.\nAt this finer scale, core network concepts such as paths, motifs, communities,\nand centrality acquire concrete biological interpretations.

    "abstract": "Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social\nbiases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to\nresponsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models\nrely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to\nassess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible\nassessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,\nhuman-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to\nreplicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in\ntext-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization\nof debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct\ntext-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a\ngiven utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use\nNormalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,\nrespectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair\nDiffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that\nmost default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated\nsolutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find\nbetter hyperparameters.",

The method relies on analytical models for the\napproximately linear relationship between $w_c$ and condensation rate\n($\\dot{q}_{vc}$) in convective clouds, which we derive from steady-state and\nnon-steady-state plume models. We include in our analysis a version of\n$\\dot{q}_{vc}/w_c$ derived from the supersaturation rate in convective clouds,\nrecently presented in Kukulies et al. (2024). We assess the accuracy of the\nanalytical models against convective cloud simulations run with different model\ncores and spatial resolutions in both tropical and mid-latitude environments.\nDifferences in accuracies between tropical and mid-latitude environments\nsuggest that this approach for estimating $w_c$ may lead to higher\nuncertainties in the mid-latitudes, although the estimated velocities are\naccurate. Despite assumptions in the analytical expressions that theoretically\nrestrict them to liquid water clouds, $w_c$ is estimated to within $\\approx2$\nm/s of the simulated values at temperatures as low as 240 K.

However, such an approach has yet\nto be explored within a multimodal context. Prior work has shown that, within a\nmultimodal setting, different modalities contain modality-unique information\nthat can complement information of other modalities. Leveraging on this, we\npropose a novel subject-level loss function to learn fairer representations via\nthe following three mechanisms, adapting the variance-invariance-covariance\nregularization (VICReg) method: (i) the variance term, which reduces reliance\non the protected attribute as a trivial solution; (ii) the invariance term,\nwhich ensures consistent predictions for similar individuals; and (iii) the\ncovariance term, which minimizes correlational dependence on the protected\nattribute. Consequently, our loss function, coined as FAIRWELL, aims to obtain\nsubject-independent representations, enforcing fairness in multimodal\nprediction tasks. We evaluate our method on three challenging real-world\nheterogeneous healthcare datasets (i.e. D-Vlog, MIMIC and MODMA) which contain\ndifferent modalities of varying length and different prediction tasks. Our\nfindings indicate that our framework improves overall fairness performance with\nminimal reduction in classification performance and significantly improves on\nthe performance-fairness Pareto frontier.",

Policies that can express the service tree structure can offer\ndevelopment and security teams more fine-grained control over communication\npatterns.\n  To this end, we design an expressive policy language to specify service tree\nstructures, and we develop a visibly pushdown automata-based dynamic\nenforcement mechanism to enforce service tree policies.

To realize our method, we build a\nruntime monitor on top of a service mesh, an emerging network infrastructure\nlayer that can control inter-service communication during deployment. In\nparticular, we employ the programmable network traffic filtering capabilities\nof Istio, a popular service mesh implementation, to implement an online and\ndistributed monitor.

    "abstract": "Background: Accurate survival prediction in breast cancer is essential for\npatient stratification and personalized therapy. Integrating gene expression\ndata with clinical factors may enhance prognostic performance and support\nprecision medicine. Objective: To develop an integrative survival prediction\nmodel combining clinical variables and gene expression signatures, and to\nassess their contributions using penalized Cox regression and machine learning.\nMethods: We analyzed 1,867 patients from the METABRIC cohort with clinical\nannotations and microarray-based gene expression profiles. The top 5,000 most\nvariable genes were retained. Elastic Net-penalized Cox regression identified\n75 predictors (70 genes and 5 clinical variables: tumor size, stage, surgery\ntype, age at diagnosis, and Nottingham Prognostic Index). Model performance was\nevaluated with Harrell's concordance index (C-index) and 36-month\ntime-dependent AUC. Random Survival Forests (RSF) trained on the top 20 genes\nassessed nonlinear effects and validated variable importance. PCA and heatmaps\nvisualized gene expression patterns across risk groups. Results: The\nintegrative Cox model achieved a C-index of 0.922 and a 36-month AUC of 0.94,\noutperforming clinical-only models (C=0.64). RSF confirmed the prognostic value\nof top genes (e.g., OR2T27, TBATA, LINC01165, SLC10A4), yielding a 36-month AUC\nof 0.88. Conclusions: Combining gene expression signatures with clinical\nvariables substantially improves survival prediction in breast cancer and\nprovides a framework for individualized prognostic assessment and clinical\ndecision-making.",

Due to\nthe limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be\nrun independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we\npropose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire\nmonitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage\n1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips\nusing frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In\naddition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame\ninformation within the sequential policy network to improve prediction\naccuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as \"fire\", we employ the\nimproved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1\nmethod using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the\nFire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly\nreduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage\n1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage\n2 compared to baseline methods.",

We carefully explore this\nissue by comparing distance based localization with alternative covariance\nlocalization techniques, partially those taken from the statistical literature.\nThe comparison is done on test problems that we designed to challenge\ndistance-based localization, including joint state-parameter estimation in a\nmodified Lorenz '96 model and state estimation in a two-layer quasi-geostrophic\nmodel. Across all sets of experiments, we find that while localization of any\nkind (with rare exceptions) can lead to significant reductions in error,\ntraditional, distance-based localization generally leads to the largest error\nreduction. More general localization schemes can sometimes lead to greater\nerror reduction, though the impacts may only be marginal and may require more\ntuning and/or prior information.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component\nused within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A\ncompetitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs\ncomprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical\nattributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and\ndata is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched\nby indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.\nAlthough considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI\nsystems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and\nthere is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of\nevaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,\nunstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured\nevaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized\nattributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that\nfilters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize\nprecision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our\ncompetitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research\n(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with\nenterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst\nturnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\\sim$3 hours ($\\sim$20x) for the\ncompetitive analysis.",

Of particular interest are RTNs on hyperbolic geometries, with\nlocal tensors typically chosen from the unitary Haar measure, that model\ncritical boundary states of holographic bulk-boundary dualities. In this work,\nwe elevate static pictures of ensemble averages to a dynamical one, to show\nthat RTN states exhibit equilibration of time-averaged operator expectation\nvalues under a highly generic class of Hamiltonians with non-degenerate\nspectra. We prove that RTN states generally equilibrate at large bond dimension\nand also in the scaling limit for three classes of geometries: Those of matrix\nproduct states, regular hyperbolic tilings, and single \"black hole\" tensors.\nFurthermore, we prove a hierarchy of equilibration between finite-dimensional\ninstances of these classes for bulk and boundary states with small\nentanglement. This suggests an equivalent hierarchy between corresponding\nmany-body phases, and reproduces a holographic degree-of-freedom counting for\nthe effective dimension of each system. These results demonstrate that RTN\ntechniques can probe aspects of late-time dynamics of quantum many-body phases\nand suggest a new approach to describing aspects of holographic dualities using\ntechniques from statistical mechanics.",

Federated learning (FL) provides a\nprivacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints\nimposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the\nscarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical\nSemi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only\nunlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,\nhigh-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of\nExperts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox\ntackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse\nMixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features\nacross resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised\nlearning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on\nreal-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively\nadapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained\nmemory costs on edge devices.

    "abstract": "Modern data assimilation schemes typically use the same discrete dynamical\nmodel to evolve the state estimate in time also to approximate the evolution,\nor propagation, of the estimation error covariance. Ensemble-based methods,\nsuch as the ensemble Kalman filter, approximate the evolution of the covariance\nthrough the propagation of individual ensemble members. Thus, it is tacitly\nassumed that if the discrete state propagation and resulting mean state\nestimates are accurate, then the ensemble-based discrete covariance propagation\nwill be accurate as well, apart from sampling errors due to limited ensemble\nsize. Through a series of numerical experiments supported by analytical\nresults, we demonstrate that this assumption is false when correlation length\nscales approach grid resolution. We show for states that satisfy advective\ndynamics, that while the discrete state propagation and ensemble mean state\nestimates are accurate, the corresponding ensemble covariances can be\nremarkably inaccurate, well beyond that expected from sampling errors or\ntypical numerical discretization errors. The underlying problem is a\nfundamental discrepancy between discrete covariance propagation and the\ncontinuum covariance dynamics, which we can identify because the exact\ncontinuum covariance dynamics are known. Errors in the ensemble covariances,\nwhich can be at least one order of magnitude larger than those of the mean\nstate when correlation lengths begin to approach grid scale, cannot be\nrectified by the usual methods, such as covariance inflation and localization.\nThis work brings to light a fundamental problem for data assimilation schemes\nthat propagate covariances using the same discrete dynamical model used to\npropagate the state.",

Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different\nentities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy,\nlatency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded\nservice-level objectives (SLOs).\n  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic\nworkflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples\nworkflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer\nand adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow\ncomponents, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring\nexecution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of\nagentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing\nframeworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.\n  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that Murakkab reduces GPU usage by\nup to 2.8$\\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\\times$, and cost by 4.3$\\times$\nwhile maintaining SLOs.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the prospects for studying scalar non-standard interactions (SNSI)\nusing the neutrino burst from a Galactic supernova. SNSI modify the resonant\nflavor conversion and, correspondingly, the neutronization burst signal, and\nmay be identifiable in future multi-tonne-scale experiments such as DUNE. We\nshow that, in the presence of SNSI, neutrinos propagating out of the dense\nsupernova environment acquire a density-squared-dependent contribution to their\nmass-squared differences, which in turn modifies the energy levels of the\nneutrino mass eigenstates. This phenomenon is not present in less dense\nenvironments like the Earth or the Sun. For a given mass ordering, supernova\nneutrinos can improve the sensitivity to SNSI parameters by up to four orders\nof magnitude compared to that achievable with solar or terrestrial neutrino\nsources.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have\ndemonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works\nemploy Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained\nstable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due\nto the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different\ngenerative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods\nto fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion\nNetwork for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,\nwhich projects the same image into different latent features based on\ntimesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,\nthe student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the\npre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative\ncapabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different\ntimesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the\nstudent model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent\ngenerative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though\nutilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can\nnaturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by\nchanging the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results\nwith only a single step.",

It has apparent formal justification insofar as this approach\nmaximizes per-study power. But this comes at a cost: data reuse affects the\nshape of the tail distribution of inferential errors. Using the theory of risk\norderings we demonstrate how positively dependent testing procedures result in\nstrictly riskier distributions of inferential error.\n  We identify two remedies to this state of affairs: research portfolio\noptimization and what we term data temperance. Research portfolio optimization\nrequires that we formulate the enterprise of inference in a utility theoretic\nframework: associated to each hypothesis to be evaluated is some utility\ndependent on its truth as well as the impact of the statistical decision\nrendered on the basis of the data. Under certain models of data governance,\nthis approach can be used to optimally allocate data usage across multiple\ninferential tasks. On the other hand, data temperance is a more flexible\nstrategy for managing the distribution of inferential errors. Data temperance\nis the principle that an investigator use only as much data as is necessary to\nperform the task at hand.

    "abstract": "A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal\nworkings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it\nis challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.\nHere, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm\nprediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict\nwhether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within\n24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our\napproach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM\nnetwork to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the\nmodel's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc\nmodel-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the\npredicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's\nbehavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm\nprediction model.",

    "abstract": "A novel approach is introduced for deriving exact solutions to nonlinear\nsystems of ordinary differential equations. This method consists of four parts.\nIn the initial part, the examined nonlinear differential equation system is\ntransformed into a linear differential equation system using an infinite series\nsum transformation and Adomian polynomials. In the second part, we presented a\nmodified method of variation of parameters utilizing a revised Cramer's rule\nfor addressing a linear system of block matrices. In the following part, we\nmerged the outcomes of the prior two parts and introduced a new recursive\nmethod for acquiring a series solution of the system established in the first\nsection. In the final part, we introduce the fundamental ideas of the\nmultiplicative inverse of power series and methods for summing infinite series.\nThe method utilizes the property that the multiplicative inverse of the power\nseries either terminates after a finite number of terms or simplifies to a\ngeometric series, which can be easily summed to yield closed-form solutions for\nthe series in question. The effectiveness of this method is shown by\nsuccessfully deriving exact localized solutions for both integrable and\nnon-integrable coupled modified Korteweg-de Vries equations. Using the\nmultiplicative inverse technique, it is shown that a rational generating\nfunction can be created for the series solution derived from the proposed\nmethod for the specified system of nonlinear differential equations, regardless\nof whether it is integrable or non-integrable.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a Bayesian framework that unifies a wide class of\nopinion dynamics models. In this framework, an individual's opinion on a topic\nis the expected value of their belief, represented as a random variable with a\nprior distribution. Upon receiving a signal, modeled as the prior belief plus a\nbias term and subject to zero-mean noise with a known distribution, the\nindividual updates their belief distribution via Bayes' rule. By systematically\nvarying the prior, bias, and noise distributions, this approach recovers a\nbroad array of opinion dynamics models, including DeGroot, bounded confidence,\nbounded shift, and models exhibiting overreaction or backfire effects. Our\nanalysis shows that the signal score is the key determinant of each model's\nmathematical structure, governing both small- and large-signal behavior. All\nmodels converge to DeGroot's linear update rule for small signals, but diverge\nin their tail behavior for large signals. This unification not only reveals\ntheoretical linkages among previously disconnected models but also provides a\nsystematic method for generating new ones, offering insights into the rational\nfoundations of opinion formation under cognitive constraints.",

Achieving many-photon collisions\nbetween these gamma rays and the high intensity laser pulse in practice is\nextremely difficult, however, due to significant shot-to-shot jitter in laser\npointing and timing.\n  We model these practical difficulties using simulated Monte-Carlo\nexperiments.

Using Gaussian Process Regression we then\nefficiently find optimal conditions for maximising pair production by changing\nthe laser spot size, the energy in the colliding beam, and the stand-off\ndistance between the laser wakefield accelerator and the focus of the colliding\nlaser pulse. We find that the optimal stand-off distance increases with the\ndegree of laser jitter and that the best conditions for producing\nelectron-positron pairs are not the same as the best conditions for maximising\nthe energy in the gamma rays.

As a case study, we\nconsider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \\binom{n}2$), and the\n$k$-clique count function $\\rho_k := C_k(G)/\\mathbb{E}_{G' \\sim\nG_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing\nif $G \\sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to\nthe sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\\rho_k(G)\\approx 1$ requires\n$p^{-\\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control\nproblem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \\geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with\nrespect to $\\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing\nquality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting.\nMore generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\\Delta(H)$, the respective\nquality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\\Delta(H))}$ queries and\nrunning time.",

    "abstract": "Prompt-based reasoning strategies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\nIn-Context Learning (ICL) have become widely used for eliciting reasoning\ncapabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, these methods rely on\nfragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds,\nformats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for\ntasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based\nneuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and\ntrustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with\ndeterministic transitions. In this work, we extend RetoMaton by replacing its\nglobal datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA),\nconstructed directly from external domain corpora. This local automaton\nstructure promotes robust, context-aware retrieval while preserving symbolic\ntraceability and low inference overhead. Unlike prompting, which entangles\ncontext and memory in opaque ways, our approach leverages the explicit\nstructure of WFAs to provide verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, making\nit better suited for domain transfer and interoperability. We evaluate this\nlocal RetoMaton variant on two pretrained LLMs LLaMA-3.2-1B and Gemma-3-1B-PT\nacross three reasoning tasks: TriviaQA (reading comprehension), GSM8K\n(multi-step math), and MMLU (domain knowledge).

By fitting the\nsame data set with the same models, we can compare the radial trends (out to ~\nR_e) of IMF slope, age, metallicity and 19 elemental abundances when allowed\nwith the four codes. To further test the robustness of our analysis, we carried\nout parallel simulations by creating inputs with different star formation\nhistory (SFH) complexity. The results from simulations show that codes such as\nALF and PyStaff, which both assume a simple stellar population (SSP) return\ngreater precision and accuracy only when the underlying population is a pure\nSSP; however, in cases where the SFH is more complex, these codes return\nerroneous results. Although codes like Starlight and pPXF, which retrieve the\nbest-fit SFH without prior assumptions, tend to produce results with greater\nscatter and bias, they are generally more reliable in identifying secondary\ncomponents. Our analysis on the two targets shows that ALF and PyStaff, that\nassume an SSP, give results pointing to a single old age, a decreasing\nmetallicity with radius and a flat super-Salpeter IMF.

Calculations reveal that strongly oxidizing\ngroups, such as carbonyl and carbonyl acetate, significantly redshift\nabsorption and emission spectra. In contrast, less oxidizing groups, such as\nhydroxyl, behave as spectators with minimal impact on absorption and emission,\nexcept when they interact strongly with more oxidizing groups. We find that not\nonly the excitation energy, but also the excitation character itself is\nimpacted by the presence of specific groups, and the pH-dependence of the\nspectroscopic properties can be attributed to their protonation state-dependent\nexcitation character. We show that the twisting, sliding, and linker-mediated\nfolding of surface-functionalized layers in CDs markedly alter excitation\nenergies and characters, offering a molecular explanation for experimentally\nobserved emission intermittency and polarization fluctuations. These insights\nprovide strategies for optimizing CDs for various applications, including\nbioimaging, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "The h index is a widely recognized metric for assessing the research impact\nof scholars, defined as the maximum value h such that the scholar has published\nh papers each cited at least h times. While it has proven useful measuring\nindividual scholarly productivity and citation impact, the h index has\nlimitations, such as an inability to account for interdisciplinary\ncollaboration or demographic differences in citation patterns. Moreover, it is\nsometimes mistakenly treated as a measure of research quality, even though it\nonly reflects how often work has been cited. While metric based evaluations of\nresearch have grown in importance in some areas of academia, such as medicine,\nthese evaluations fail to consider other important aspects of intellectual\nwork, such as representational and epistemic diversity in research. In this\narticle, we propose a new metric called the c index, or the community index,\nwhich combines multiple dimensions of scholarly impact. This is important\nbecause a plurality of perspectives and lived experiences within author teams\ncan promote epistemological reflection and humility as part of the creation and\nvalidation of scientific knowledge. The c index is a means of accounting for\nthe often global, and increasingly interdisciplinary nature of contemporary\nresearch, in particular, the data that is collected, curated and analyzed in\nthe process of scientific inquiry. While the c index provides a means of\nquantifying diversity within research teams, diversity is integral to the\nadvancement of scientific excellence and should be actively fostered through\nformal recognition and valuation. We herein describe the mathematical\nfoundation of the c index and demonstrate its potential to provide a more\ncomprehensive representation and more multidimensional assessment of scientific\ncontributions of research impact as compared to the h index.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of collaborative filtering recommendation systems, Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance but face significant\nchallenges in deployment on resource-constrained edge devices due to their high\nembedding parameter requirements and computational costs. Using common\nquantization method directly on node embeddings may overlooks their graph based\nstructure, causing error accumulation during message passing and degrading the\nquality of quantized embeddings.To address this, we propose Graph based\nNode-Aware Dynamic Quantization training for collaborative filtering (GNAQ), a\nnovel quantization approach that leverages graph structural information to\nenhance the balance between efficiency and accuracy of GNNs for Top-K\nrecommendation. GNAQ introduces a node-aware dynamic quantization strategy that\nadapts quantization scales to individual node embeddings by incorporating graph\ninteraction relationships. Specifically, it initializes quantization intervals\nbased on node-wise feature distributions and dynamically refines them through\nmessage passing in GNN layers. This approach mitigates information loss caused\nby fixed quantization scales and captures hierarchical semantic features in\nuser-item interaction graphs. Additionally, GNAQ employs graph relation-aware\ngradient estimation to replace traditional straight-through estimators,\nensuring more accurate gradient propagation during training. Extensive\nexperiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GNAQ outperforms\nstate-of-the-art quantization methods, including BiGeaR and N2UQ, by achieving\naverage improvement in 27.8\\% Recall@10 and 17.6\\% NDCG@10 under 2-bit\nquantization. In particular, GNAQ is capable of maintaining the performance of\nfull-precision models while reducing their model sizes by 8 to 12 times; in\naddition, the training time is twice as fast compared to quantization baseline\nmethods.",

In this work, we investigate the\neffects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured\ndriving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity\nimproves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We\nattribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality\nand dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures\nwithin temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these\nobjectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive\nnature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant\nscene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic\nbehavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize\nsurface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this\nphenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay\nfrom diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial\naccuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.",

    "abstract": "Designing photonic circuits that prepare graph states with high fidelity and\nsuccess probability is a central challenge in linear optical quantum computing.\nExisting approaches rely on hand-crafted designs or fusion-based assemblies. In\nthe absence of multiplexing/boosting, both post-selected ballistic circuits and\nsequential fusion builds exhibit exponentially decreasing single-shot yields,\nmotivating automated discovery of higher-success circuits. We present a\ngeneral-purpose optimization framework for automated photonic circuit discovery\nusing a novel polynomial-based simulation approach, enabling efficient strong\nsimulation and gradient-based optimization. Our framework employs a two-pass\noptimization procedure: the first pass identifies a unitary transformation that\nprepares the desired state with perfect fidelity and maximal success\nprobability, while the second pass implements a novel sparsification algorithm\nthat reduces this solution to a compact photonic circuit with minimal\nbeamsplitter count while preserving performance. This sparsification procedure\noften reveals underlying mathematical structure, producing highly simplified\ncircuits with rational reflection coefficients. We demonstrate our approach by\ndiscovering optimized circuits for $3$-, $4$-, and $5$-qubit graph states\nacross multiple equivalence classes. For 4-qubit states, our circuits achieve\nsuccess probabilities of $2.053 \\times 10^{-3}$ to $7.813 \\times 10^{-3}$,\noutperforming the fusion baseline by up to $4.7 \\times$. For 5-qubit states, we\nachieve $5.926 \\times 10^{-5}$ to $1.157 \\times 10^{-3}$, demonstrating up to\n$7.5 \\times$ improvement.

    "abstract": "Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely\nimplemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'\nquality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise\ncomplaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile\napplications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited\ninformation about when their service requests will be addressed, which can\nreduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of\nfollow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests\nis challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal\ncorrelations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request\ntypes, and high variation in service duration even within the same request\ncategory. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view\nSpatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned\nchallenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.\nIn detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among\nheterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to\nmodel service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a\nspatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal\ncorrelations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with\nextensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that\nMuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,\nhuman problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.

However,\nhigh-$Q^2$ data of the nucleon electromagnetic form factor is scarce due to the\nchallenges associated with such measurements. This thesis reports preliminary\nresults from high-precision measurements of the neutron magnetic form factor\n($G_M^n$) to unprecedented $Q^2$ using Durand's method, also known as the\n\"ratio\" method.

While numerous candidates have recently been identified\nthrough spectroscopic techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, central challenges remain on how to tune FBs towards the Fermi\nlevel $E_F$ and to understand their impact on low-energy excitations probed in\nelectronic transport experiments. Here, we show that, by attributing the\ntemperature dependence of the electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures\nto electron-phonon interband scattering, one can infer the position of FBs near\n$E_F$ across diverse material classes. As charge carriers scatter off phonons,\ninterband transitions into FB states lead to distinctive sub- or superlinear\nresistivity at elevated temperatures, governed by the proximity of the FB to\n$E_F$. Our phenomenological model captures these universal transport behaviors\nobserved across several recently studied FB compounds and offers a simple,\nbroadly applicable method for detecting flat bands.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented\ncapabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these\nmodels as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments\npresents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches\ncan be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of\nreal-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,\nwe propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-\nand few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as\na framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology\nemphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain\nknowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical\nexpansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing\nand mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous\nmonitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between\nthe raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and\nmaintainable classification systems in industry applications.",

YANNs provide an interpretable neural\nnetwork which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of\narbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic\nsubdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit\nsolutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this,\nwe propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which\nenables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of\nlinear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the\nmulti-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an\napproximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form\nof the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward\nfunction as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional\nnetwork layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which\ncan be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear\nsystem. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly\nrepresent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution\nof a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented\nto provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an\neffective lower bound to the performance of RL policy.

Minor changes in the elastic constitutive equation from a canonical\nupper convected Oldroyd-B model lead to fundamentally different scalings and\npredictions for tangential stress compared to either a Newtonian fluid and an\nOldroyd-B fluid.

Pb atom is sensitive to all phase transitions,\nchanging its dynamics with temperature. As temperature decreases, the crystal\nundergoes a sequence of three phase transitions. The first one to an\nintermediate (IM) phase, in which polar fluctuations are detected by THz and IR\nspectroscopy at frequencies below 100 cm-1 contributing to the maximum of\npermittivity and revealing important softening. Additional antipolar Pb\nfluctuations and softening were detected by Raman spectroscopy. At lower\ntemperature, another transition to an antiferroelectric (AFE2) phase is\nrevealed by nonpolar soft modes (antipolar and antiferrodistortive ones), and\nby an important drop of the dielectric strength of polar phonons. The final\ntransition to the antiferroelectric phase (AFE1) is revealed by the appearance\nof new modes and a sudden change in the frequency of the soft modes when the\nantipolar shifts become larger. Using symmetry analysis and optical observation\nto study how the domain pattern changes with temperature, we identified a path\nfor the cubic-AFE2 transition throughout the IM phase, of plausible tetragonal\nsymmetry, driven by an instability from the center of the Brillouin zone. This\nmechanism coexists with antiferrodistortive instabilities that eventually drive\nthe material into the AFE2 phase.

    "abstract": "Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of\ndisability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging\n(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring\ninfarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such\nlesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,\nscanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have\nbeen key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,\nthese strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one\ninstitution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape\nmodels. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to\nadjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework\nfor segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge\nfrom deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare\ncenters with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \\pm\n0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \\pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \\pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \\pm\n0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated\nrules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,\nshowing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable\nperformance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \\pm 0.29$ and AVD\nof $4.44 \\pm 8.74$ without any additional training).",

    "abstract": "The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly\ntransformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot\nclassification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for\nreal-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes\nwithout requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when\ndownstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL\napproaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs\nduring incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by\ndevising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the\nzero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding\nRecomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple\ntextual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a\nfoundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub\nand compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that\nimproves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two\npopular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total\nof 14 datasets.

This new version of extended\nwell-posedness allows one to extend many existing results on exact penalty\nfunctions and global saddle points of augmented Lagrangians from the finite\ndimensional to the infinite dimensional case. Such extensions provide first\nverifiable sufficient conditions for the exactness of penalty functions and the\nexistence of global saddle points of augmented Lagrangians in the infinite\ndimensional case that do not rely on very restrictive and difficult to verify\nassumptions (nonlocal metric regularity of constraints, existence of nonlocal\nerror bounds, the Palais-Smale condition, abstract properties of the\nperturbation function, etc.) that are typically used in the literature.",

Thus, the\nrelative information used to estimate the lateral state of UAVs enables the\nidentification of the unambiguous state of UAVs with respect to the local\nconstellation.

Simulation results show\nthat, notably, narrower fluctuation bands, larger single-site capacities, or\ndispersed siting can intensify oscillations across multiple modes.

Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the\naccuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp\n- \\alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$\nrepresents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\\alpha$ determines the\nrate of convergence.

    "abstract": "Various so-called anomalies have been found in both the WMAP and Planck\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature data that exert a mild tension\nagainst the highly successful best-fit 6 parameter cosmological model,\npotentially providing hints of new physics to be explored. That these are real\nfeatures on the sky is uncontested. However, given their modest significance,\nwhether they are indicative of true departures from the standard cosmology or\nsimply statistical excursions, due to a mildly unusual configuration of\ntemperature anisotropies on the sky which we refer to as the \"fluke\nhypothesis\", cannot be addressed further without new information.\n  No theoretical model of primordial perturbations has to date been constructed\nthat can explain all of the temperature anomalies. Therefore, we focus in this\npaper on testing the fluke hypothesis, based on the partial correlation between\nthe temperature and $E$-mode CMB polarisation signal. In particular, we compare\nthe properties of specific statistics in polarisation, built from unconstrained\nrealisations of the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model as might be observed by the\nLiteBIRD satellite, with those determined from constrained simulations, where\nthe part of the $E$-mode anisotropy correlated with temperature is constrained\nby observations of the latter. Specifically, we use inpainted Planck 2018 SMICA\ntemperature data to constrain the $E$-mode realisations. Subsequent analysis\nmakes use of masks defined to minimise the impact of the inpainting procedure\non the $E$-mode map statistics.\n  We find that statistical assessments of the $E$-mode data alone do not\nprovide any evidence for or against the fluke hypothesis. However, tests based\non cross-statistical measures determined from temperature and $E$ modes can\nallow this hypothesis to be rejected with a moderate level of probability.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming the backbone of modern cloud\nservices, yet their inference costs are dominated by GPU energy. Unlike\ntraditional GPU workloads, LLM inference has two stages with different\ncharacteristics: the prefill phase, which is latency sensitive and scales\nquadratically with prompt length, and the decode phase, which progresses token\nby token with unpredictable length. Current GPU power governors (for example,\nNVIDIA's default) overlook this asymmetry and treat both stages uniformly. The\nresult is mismatched voltage and frequency settings, head-of-line blocking, and\nexcessive energy use.\n  We introduce GreenLLM, an SLO-aware serving framework that minimizes GPU\nenergy by explicitly separating prefill and decode control. At ingress,\nrequests are routed into length-based queues so short prompts avoid\nhead-of-line blocking and TTFT improves. For prefill, GreenLLM collects short\ntraces on a GPU node, fits compact latency-power models over SM frequency, and\nsolves a queueing-aware optimization to select energy-minimal clocks per class.\nDuring decode, a lightweight dual-loop controller tracks throughput (tokens per\nsecond) and adjusts frequency with hysteretic, fine-grained steps to hold tail\nTBT within target bounds. Across Alibaba and Azure trace replays, GreenLLM\nreduces total energy by up to 34 percent versus the default DVFS baseline, with\nno loss of throughput and with less than 3.5 percent additional SLO violations.",

However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has\nextensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been\ngiven to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution\nof ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses\nthis gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking\nframework for managing software engineering practices, with large language\nmodels (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist\nstudents and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot\nemploys a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant\ncontextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were\nused to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base\nmodel and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated\nthrough both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated\nresponses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated\nthat the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in\ndomain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software\nengineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between\ntheoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process\nmanagement and the adoption of software development practices.

While general insurers typically use Dynamic\nFinancial Analysis (DFA) for a comprehensive view of financial impacts,\ntraditional DFA as presented in the literature does not consider the impact of\nclimate change. To address this gap, we introduce a climate-dependent DFA\napproach that integrates climate risk into DFA, providing a holistic assessment\nof the long-term impact of climate change on the general insurance industry.\nThe proposed framework has three key features. First, it captures the long-term\nimpact of climate change on the assets and liabilities of general insurers by\nconsidering both physical and economic dimensions across different climate\nscenarios within an interconnected structure. Second, it addresses the\nuncertainty of climate change impacts using stochastic simulations within\nclimate scenario analysis that are useful for actuarial applications. Finally,\nthe framework is tailored to the general insurance sector by addressing its\nunique characteristics. To demonstrate the practical application of our model,\nwe conduct an extensive empirical study using Australian data to assess the\nlong-term financial impact of climate change on the general insurance market\nunder various climate scenarios.

Our aim is to generalize this concept\nto the nonstationary case, i.e., we associate Markov partitions to\nnonstationary sequences of toral automorphisms. Special emphasis is placed on\nsequences of toral automorphisms produced by strongly convergent\nmultidimensional continued fraction algorithms. The convergence of the\nalgorithms is expressed in terms of a Pisot type condition which yields\nhyperbolicity for the nonstationary dynamics. For a multidimensional continued\nfraction map, we first consider its natural extension, whose orbits are given\nby bi-infinite sequences of matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$. The\nhyperbolicity property allows us to interpret almost every orbit of this\nnatural extension as an Anosov mapping family, i.e., as a bi-infinite sequence\nof toral automorphisms with well-defined stable and unstable manifolds. We\nprove that this Anosov mapping family admits a bi-infinite sequence of explicit\nnonstationary Markov partitions. To obtain the atoms of the Markov partitions,\na combinatorial structure, expressed in terms of substitutions and\n$\\mathcal{S}$-adic dynamical systems, has to be superimposed on the Anosov\nmapping family. In particular, the atoms of the Markov partitions are geometric\nrealizations of $\\mathcal{S}$-adic dynamical systems, defined by suspensions of\n$\\mathcal{S}$-adic Rauzy fractals. These Markov partitions then provide a\nsymbolic model as a nonstationary edge shift for the Anosov mapping family.

This is evident in their poorer\nperformance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This\nbias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies\nreceive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden\nin children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric\nquestion-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced.

The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic\npipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question\nbanks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources.

However,\nexisting approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented\nmulti-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior\nmethods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as\nrule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2)\nSuboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query\nreformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate\ngolden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing\nmethods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient\ninformation from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.\nFundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between\nretrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures.

While recent\nlearning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated\nimpressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are\nprimarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to\nhandle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an\nextension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,\nuncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder\nobtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a\nstate-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better\nunderstanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates\nadditional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via\nDensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more\ncomprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different\nheads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic\ninformation in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization\npipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable\nfor real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,\ntwo challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.\nAdditionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo\nand multi-view pose regression tasks.

    "abstract": "Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly\naggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their\nrapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status\nof the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical\nbiomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the\nalkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation\nstatus using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the\ncomplex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven\ncontrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This\nstudy introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status\nPrediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to\nenhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first,\ngenerating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively\ncaptures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different\nMRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a\nconvolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The\nadaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as\ncontrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI\nimage synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures\nacross all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an\naccuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly\noutperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the\nCAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more\npersonalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinearity is often associated with amplification, instability, or emergent\nbehavior - where small inputs produce disproportionately large outputs. Yet in\nmany physical systems, nonlinearities act as limiting mechanisms, suppressing\nthe response below linear expectations, as exemplified by the breakdown of\nHooke's law at large forces. These limiting effects can become significant in\nthe optical control of quantum materials, where large-amplitude lattice motion\nis essential for reaching states far from equilibrium. Displacive excitation of\ncoherent phonons, perhaps the most widely used control strategy, assumes\nlinearity between the driving force on the lattice and the optically excited\ncarrier density. However, the breakdown of this assumption remains largely\nunexplored, and strategies are needed to overcome the resulting nonlinear\nbottlenecks. Here, we show that sequential optical excitation overcomes the\nnonlinear amplitude saturation of a key phonon mode in the van der Waals\nferroelectric Td-WTe$_2$. Using time-resolved second harmonic generation, we\ntrack the response of the interlayer sliding mode governing ferroelectricity to\nboth single- and double-pulse excitation. With increasing optical excitation,\nthe phonon amplitude saturates and declines - a limitation we trace to\nband-specific electron-phonon coupling that weakens the driving force on the\nnuclei. Sequential in-phase excitation of coherent sliding motion, which\noutlasts the electronic excitation, avoids population of counteracting\nelectronic states. This enables higher phonon amplitudes for the same optical\nenergy input. We exploit the enhanced lattice response to perform\nhigh-amplitude vibrational spectroscopy in the excited state, revealing a novel\nform of anharmonic phonon coupling that emerges exclusively under\nnonequilibrium conditions, and previously elusive coherent vibrational\nmodulations of electronic states.",

Despite the importance of host star mass, radius, and\nelemental abundance inferences for the derivation of exoplanet internal\nstructure constraints, published constraints have often been based on\ninferences that are not self-consistent. For 24 dwarf stars hosting terrestrial\nexoplanets, we use astrometric and photometric data plus high-resolution\nspectroscopy to infer accurate, precise, homogeneous, and physically\nself-consistent photospheric and fundamental stellar parameters as well as\nelemental abundances. We infer updated planetary masses and radii using these\ndata plus Doppler and transit observables, then use the complete data set to\nderive constraints on the core-mass fractions of these terrestrial exoplanets.\nWe find that the population of resonant or likely formerly resonant terrestrial\nexoplanets represented by Kepler-36 b and Kepler-105 c has a significantly\nlower mean core-mass fraction than the rest of the terrestrial exoplanets in\nour sample.

Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies\nthat maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset.

Reinforcement learning via\nsupervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,\nenabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different\ndesired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision\nTransformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with\nspecified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented\nreturns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we\npropose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target\nalignment for Offline RL.

The hysteresis is observed under\nboth out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields with significant anisotropy, and\nexhibits coalescing minima at zero field, fundamentally distinct from trapped\nvortices or long-range-ordered magnetism with coercivity. Successive oxygen\nreductions simultaneously suppress the superconductivity and hysteresis,\nrevealing their mutual connections to the selective electronic orbitals.

A similar metallic state is found in an anomalous\nregion with likely T-H-H' stacking at the surface. Our results exclude cluster\nMott localisation in either the bulk or surface of 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ and point to\na scenario of superconductivity arising from Josephson-like tunneling between\nthe H layers.",

    "abstract": "Continuous-time Conflict Based-Search (CCBS) has long been viewed as the\nde-facto optimal solver for multi-agent path finding in continuous time\n(MAPFR). Recent findings, however, show that the original theoretical variant\nof CCBS can suffer from non-termination, while the widely used implementation\ncan return sub-optimal solutions. We introduce an analytical framework that\nyields simple and sufficient conditions under which any CCBS-style algorithm is\nboth sound, i.e., returns only optimal solutions, and solution complete, i.e.,\nterminates on every solvable MAPFR instance. Investigating the publicly\navailable implementation of CCBS reveals that it violates these conditions.\nThough this merely indicates that CCBS might be unsound, this indication is\nsupported by counter-examples.\n  Leveraging the analytical framework, we propose a novel branching rule and\nprove that it satisfies the sufficient conditions, thereby restoring soundness\nand termination guarantees. Consequently, the resulting CCBS variant is both\nsound and solution complete, matching the guarantees of the discrete-time CBS\nfor the first time in the continuous domain. We experimentally apply standard\nCCBS and CCBS under our branching rule to an example problem, with our\nbranching rule returning a solution with lower sum-of-costs than standard CCBS.\nBecause the branching rule largely only affects the branching step, it can be\nadopted as a drop-in replacement in existing code-bases, as we show in our\nprovided implementation. Beyond CCBS, the analytical framework and termination\ncriterion provide a systematic way to evaluate other CCBS-like MAPFR solvers\nand future extensions.",

While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental\nconditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or\nobstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach\ntailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR\nsensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor\nfusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar\nmodalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor\ndata through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement\non the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features\neffectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs\nmodalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method\nimproves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles\nunder challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions\nand real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP\ncompared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances\nand challenging foggy scenes.

Despite\npromising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high\ncomputational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their\ndeployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight\napproaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable\nconvolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,\nthese methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack\neffective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully\nleverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose\nGMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction\nand interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)\nmodules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature\nextraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further\nintegrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a\nparameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to\nenhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational\noverhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that\nGMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU\nand 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.\nAdditional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further\nconfirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its\npotential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect\ndetection.

Although existing global climate models (GCMs) provide\nessential tools for climate prediction, they face limitations such as\ninsufficient resolution and high computational costs when simulating extreme\nevents. To address these issues, this study proposes a spatiotemporal\ndownscaling model based on generative machine learning-the Domain Aligned\nClimate Downscaling model (DACD), designed to enhance the simulation\ncapabilities for extreme weather events. The proposed model employs domain\nadaptation tricks and a Flow Matching training framework to transform global\nlow-resolution climate data into high-resolution local-scale climate\ninformation while achieving precise simulation of multivariable and temporal\nscales. The results show that during the historical period (2005-2014), our\nmodel outperformed existing methods in simulating high temperatures, extreme\nprecipitation, strong wind, and tropical cyclone tracks, significantly reducing\nerrors and improving the ability to capture extreme events. Under different\nfuture scenarios (2015-2100), the model reveals a significant increasing trend\nin the frequency and intensity of extreme events, particularly under the\nhigh-emission scenario (SSP585). Compared to traditional methods, our model\nmore accurately simulates the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of\nextreme events, providing an essential tool for understanding the impacts of\nclimate change. This study offers a new technological pathway for\nhigh-resolution climate analysis and extreme event prediction, providing\nscientific support for addressing future climate change and formulating\nadaptation strategies.",

For the case of monotone\nmaps Mo, we show that the complexity depends on restricted identifies we call\nordered polymorphisms; we identify the \"connector\" polymorphism as the likely\nFPT boundary. We show that its absence implies that udCSP($\\Gamma$,Mo) defines\nall permutations, and the problem is W[1]-hard; while its presence for a binary\nlanguage implies bounded twin-width, and the problem is FPT (Twin-Width IV;\nBonnet et al., JACM 2024).

More recently, this technique has been adopted by organizations\nthat generate synthetic data from real personal binary data, enabling data\nstorage and sharing for research or commercial purposes without compromising\nindividual privacy. While the main aim in statistical surveys is the accurate\nestimation of sensitive group proportions, synthetic data generation\nprioritizes privacy preservation. To achieve precise estimation, statisticians\ntypically determine the required sample size based on a pre-specified power of\nhypothesis testing. However, we find that designing randomized response studies\nto achieve high statistical power can come at the expense of increased privacy\nrisk. In this work, we analyze how various established randomized response\ndesigns perform with respect to both statistical power and differential privacy\n(DP), the latter quantifying the risk of privacy leakage.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from\ncomposing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to\nusing slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human\nonline. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained\neye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a\nlinguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be\nlinked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional\nregister analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from\ndifferent registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style\ndepending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college\nessay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.\nConcretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in\ndifferent registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,\nthus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor\nlanguage in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.\nIt is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of\nthought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial\nIntelligence.",

While it is\npossible to na\\\"ively integrate the delay sampling into AAL algorithms such as\n$L^*$, this leads to considerable oversampling near the root of the state\nspace. We address this problem by separating conceptually the learning of\nbehavior and delays such that the learner uses the information gained while\nlearning the logical behavior to arrive at efficient input sequences for\ncollecting the needed delay samples. We put emphasis on treating cases in which\nidentical input/output behaviors might stem from distinct delay\ncharacteristics.

    "abstract": "We present a quantum image encryption protocol that harnesses discrete-time\nquantum walks (DTQWs) on cycles and explicitly examines the role of the\nParrondo paradox in security. Using the NEQR representation, a DTQW-generated\nprobability mask is transformed into a quantum key image and applied via CNOT\nto encrypt grayscale images. We adopt an efficient circuit realization of DTQWs\nbased on QFT-diagonalization and coin-conditioned phase layers, yielding low\ndepth for $N=2^n$ positions and $t$ steps. On $64\\times 64$ benchmark images,\nthe scheme suppresses adjacent-pixel correlations to near zero after\nencryption, produces nearly uniform histograms, and achieves high ciphertext\nentropy close to the 8-bit ideal. Differential analyses further indicate strong\ndiffusion and confusion: NPCR exceeds $99\\%$ and UACI is around $30\\%$,\nconsistent with robust sensitivity to small plaintext changes. Crucially, we\nidentify parameter regimes in which alternating coin operations induce the\nParrondo paradox and degrade security-raising correlations, lowering entropy,\nand reducing NPCR/UACI, thereby constituting practical failure modes. Our\nresults provide both a performant DTQW-based quantum image cipher and clear\nguidance on coin/message parameter selection to avoid paradox-dominated\nregimes.

Ensuring chip functional safety\nrequires performing a large number of time-consuming RTL fault simulations\nduring the design phase, significantly increasing the verification cycle. To\nmeet time-to-market demands while ensuring thorough chip verification, parallel\nacceleration of RTL fault simulation is necessary. Due to the dynamic nature of\nfault propagation paths and varying fault propagation capabilities, task loads\nin RTL fault simulation are highly imbalanced, making traditional\nsingledimension parallel methods, such as structural-level parallelism,\nineffective. Through an analysis of fault propagation paths and task loads, we\nidentify two types of tasks in RTL fault simulation: tasks that are few in\nnumber but high in load, and tasks that are numerous but low in load. Based on\nthis insight, we propose a two-dimensional parallel approach that combines\nstructurallevel and fault-level parallelism to minimize bubbles in RTL fault\nsimulation. Structural-level parallelism combining with workstealing mechanism\nis used to handle the numerous low-load tasks, while fault-level parallelism is\napplied to split the high-load tasks. Besides, we deviate from the traditional\nserial execution model of computation and global synchronization in RTL\nsimulation by proposing a unified computation/global synchronization scheduling\napproach, which further eliminates bubbles.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have achieved impressive performance\non multimodal tasks, including text-image retrieval, based on dense\nrepresentations. Meanwhile, Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) has gained traction\nin text-only settings due to its interpretability and efficiency with fast\nterm-based lookup via inverted indexes. Inspired by these advantages, recent\nwork has extended LSR to the multimodal domain. However, these methods often\nrely on computationally expensive contrastive pre-training, or distillation\nfrom a frozen dense model, which limits the potential for mutual enhancement.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework that\nenables bi-directional learning between dense and sparse representations\nthrough Self-Knowledge Distillation. This bi-directional learning is achieved\nusing an integrated similarity score-a weighted sum of dense and sparse\nsimilarities-which serves as a shared teacher signal for both representations.\nTo ensure efficiency, we fine-tune the final layer of the dense encoder and the\nsparse projection head, enabling easy adaptation of any existing VLP model.\nExperiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k demonstrate that our sparse retriever not\nonly outperforms existing sparse baselines, but also achieves performance\ncomparable to-or even surpassing-its dense counterparts, while retaining the\nbenefits of sparse models.",

By calculating the levelized cost of hydrogen depending\non a variable degradation threshold, the cost optimal time for stack\nreplacement can be identified.

The variation of the identified major uncertainty degradation\nscale results in a difference of up to 9 years regarding the cost optimal time\nfor stack replacement, respectively lifetime of the stacks.

Current approaches are not universal because they have limited\ngeneralization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are\nnot interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To\novercome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual\nstreams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the\nfeature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via\nGradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented\ndataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,\nand normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,\nMobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of\n98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The\nextensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative\nanalysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,\nDenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease\nin training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show\ntumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and\nimproving interpretability.

This paper proposes a dimensional reduction method integrating\nroot subsystem embedding, $\\theta$-weight projection, and Langlands\nparameterization: by embedding the non-compact root subsystem of E6(-14) into\nthe C2 root system of Sp(4), combined with weight space quotient (eliminating\ncompact root redundancy), the problem is reduced from 6 dimensions to 2; the\nrationality of $\\theta$-projection is verified from both algebraic and analytic\nperspectives, including analytic realization on representation spaces,\nredundancy of compact weight sublattices, and compatibility with analytic\ncontinuation of Langlands parameters; based on Langlands parameter restriction,\nthe injectivity of representation correspondence and type preservation for\ndiscrete series, principal series, and complementary series are proven.

The type of a cell $c$ is the cyclic sequence of crossings and vertices\nalong the boundary walk of $c$. For example, all triangular cells with three\nincident crossings and no incident vertex share the same cell type. When a\nnon-homotopic drawing of an $n$-vertex multigraph $G$ does not contain any such\ncells, Ackerman and Tardos [JCTA 2007] proved that $G$ has at most $8n-20$\nedges, while Kaufmann, Klemz, Knorr, Reddy, Schr\\\"oder, and Ueckerdt [GD 2024]\nshowed that this bound is tight. In this paper, we initiate the in-depth study\nof non-homotopic drawings that do not contain one fixed cell type\n$\\mathfrak{c}$, and investigate the edge density of the corresponding\nmultigraphs, i.e., the maximum possible number of edges. We consider\nnon-homotopic as well as simple drawings, multigraphs as well as simple graphs,\nand every possible type of cell. For every combination of drawing style, graph\ntype, and cell type, we give upper and lower bounds on the corresponding edge\ndensity. With the exception of the cell type with four incident crossings and\nno incident vertex, we show for every cell type $\\mathfrak{c}$ that the edge\ndensity of $n$-vertex (multi)graphs with $\\mathfrak{c}$-free drawings is either\nquadratic in $n$ or linear in $n$. In most cases, our bounds are tight up to an\nadditive constant.

The self-attention is a\nmechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different\nparts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general\nextension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching\nand comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal\ncontribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to\nproduce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,\nthese contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In\nfact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average\ncorrelation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they\nwork in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential\npattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of\nthe input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the\nself-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW\nagainst Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\\% performance improvement on the\nSomething-Something V2 dataset.",

Beyond validating the system's efficacy, our findings\nhighlight the positive impact of integration policies perceived by the children\nand demonstrate the importance of scenario-based activities in students'\nenjoyment, observed to be significantly higher when applying storytelling.\nAdditionally, several implications of using LLMs and social robots in long-term\nclassroom activities are discussed.",

    "abstract": "At ultra-high energies, the flux of cosmic rays is too low for direct\nmeasurements to be meaningful. When a cosmic ray enters the atmosphere, it\ninitiates an extensive air shower, producing a cascade of secondary particles\nthat propagate toward the ground. Large arrays of surface detectors are used to\nmeasure these secondary particles upon arrival.\n  The signal detected at a specific reference distance from the shower core\nserves as a proxy for the shower size and, consequently, as a reliable\nestimator of the energy of primary cosmic ray. However, shower development is\ninfluenced by attenuation effects: measured signals at the ground depend on the\namount of traversed atmospheric density (column density) through which the\nshower evolves. Since the column density varies with the inclination of the\nshower, it is important to account for these attenuation effects to ensure\naccurate energy estimation.\n  In this study, we derive physics-and-geometry-based functional forms to\ndescribe attenuation and propose appropriate expansion terms using simple\none-dimensional shower-development models, incorporating one or two main\nparticle-cascade components. We then evaluate the applicability and\neffectiveness of these functional forms using a Monte-Carlo dataset that\nincludes various primary cosmic-ray particles. By directly calibrating the the\nshower size derived from ground signals to the Monte-Carlo energy, we\ncharacterize attenuation behavior across different primary particles, assess\nthe energy dependence of attenuation, and quantify systematic uncertainties\nintroduced by different functional forms.",

It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally\nequivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered\nsequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is\ntherefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under\ncyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning\nfrom contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance\nthrough complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and\ncharacterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling\nlayers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks.

A key focus is the strong damping of\nlarge-amplitude kink oscillations, which observational evidence suggests is\nnonlinear. However, directly identifying the nonlinearity is a challenge. This\nwork presents an analytic formula describing nonlinear standing kink\noscillations dissipated by turbulence, characterised by a time-varying damping\nrate and period drift. We investigate how the damping behaviour depends on the\ndriving amplitude and loop properties, showing that the initial damping time\n$\\tau$ is inversely proportional to the velocity disturbance over the loop\nradius, $V_i/R$. Using MCMC fitting with Bayesian inference, the nonlinear\nfunction better fits an observed decaying kink oscillation than traditional\nlinear models, including exponential damping, suggesting its nonlinear nature.\nBy applying a Bayesian model comparison, we establish regimes in which\nnonlinear and linear resonant absorption mechanisms dominate based on the\nrelationship between the damping rate $\\tau/P$ and $V_i/R$. Additionally,\nanalysis of two specific events reveals that while one favours the nonlinear\nmodel, the other is better explained by the linear model. Our results suggest\nthat this analytical approximation of nonlinear damping due to turbulence\nprovides a valid and reliable description of large-amplitude decaying kink\noscillations in coronal loops.",

This paper introduces Vevo2, a\nunified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To\ntackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable\nflexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a\nmusic-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from\nspeech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5\nHz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style\nfor both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2\nconsists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to\nenable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a\nflow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control.\nParticularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and\nimplicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice.\nMoreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody,\nwe design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both\nintelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show\nthat the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and\nsinging voice generation.

    "abstract": "The 21 cm signal contains a wealth of information about the formation of the\nfirst stars and the reionization of the intergalactic medium during the Cosmic\nDawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The timing of these important\nmilestones has only roughly been constrained through indirect measurements,\nsuch as from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) optical depth, and\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest. Therefore, inferring the neutral fraction over cosmic\ntime is a goal of upcoming 21 cm experiments, such as the Square Kilometer\nArray (SKA). We contrast two approaches to infer astrophysical parameters and\nionization history from 21 cm 2D power spectra (2DPS). We develop an emulator\nof the 21 cm 2DPS, trained on 21cmFAST simulations, taking into account the\nexpected instrumental noise from the SKA and sample variance. We then perform\nsimulation based inference (SBI) using neural posterior estimation (NPE). We\ncompare training on datasets of noisy 2DPS obtained from 21cmFAST simulations\nand an emulator, to infer astrophysical parameters of interest. Using an\nemulator of the ionization history, which has been trained on simulations from\nthe same astrophysical parameters, we then obtain posterior distributions of\nthe ionization history over the redshift range z $\\sim$ 5-12. We demonstrate\nthat both methods are capable of accurately recovering the ionization history\nand astrophysical parameters. However, coverage tests indicate that adding\nemulated samples does not improve predictions. This work suggests that due to\nthe stochastic nature of the 2DPS, using an emulator of this summary statistic\nmay result in poorer inference.",

Although plant communication through\nVOCs is well-documented, the interaction between VOC emissions and\nsoil-released allelochemicals remains less understood. In this study, we\ninvestigated the relationship between the release of allelochemicals and VOCs\nby chickpea (gram) plants, focusing on their role in plant signalling. We grew\n25 chickpea plants in individual beakers with soil as the growth medium. The\nrelease of allelochemicals was monitored indirectly by measuring the electrical\nresistance of the soil, while VOC emissions were analyzed using MQ-3 gas\nsensors. Continuous monitoring provided insights into soil chemistry changes\npotentially influenced by allelochemical release, alongside the VOC profile\ncaptured by the sensors.

While deep learning has\nrevolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a\ncritical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively\nexpensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert\nsurveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental\nquestion: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without\nreal-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing\ntwo paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam\necho-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar\nsimulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art\nneural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that\nleverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry\nsurveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks\ntrained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated\nscenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.\nConversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data\nwithout requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic\nnoise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom\nabout data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection.

This result is\nmotivated by an open question in the literature and generalizes the previous\nalgorithms parameterizing by the vertex cover number of G. The proof relies on\na newly developed Ramsey pruning technique. Vertex integrity intuitively\nmeasures the vertex deletion distance to a subgraph with only small connected\ncomponents.\n  (2) An n^(O(q * l)) algorithm for computing l-page stack and queue layouts of\npage width at most q. This is the first algorithm avoiding a double-exponential\ndependency on the parameters. The page width of a layout measures the maximum\nnumber of edges one needs to cross on any page to reach the outer face.\n  (3) A 2^(O(n)) algorithm for computing 1-page queue layouts.

This paper\nintroduces SATORI (Static API Test ORacle Inference), a black-box approach for\ngenerating test oracles for REST APIs by analyzing their OpenAPI Specification.\nSATORI uses large language models to infer the expected behavior of an API by\nanalyzing the properties of the response fields of its operations, such as\ntheir name and descriptions. To foster its adoption, we extended the\nPostmanAssertify tool to automatically convert the test oracles reported by\nSATORI into executable assertions.

    "abstract": "This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should\nbe image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is\nbiological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral\ntrait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is\nefficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal\nwith vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our\nlimited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders\nshould be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at\nhand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps\ntowards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.\nDespite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to\nachieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.",

To tackle these challenges\nand save many researchers from annoying, time-consuming tasks, we present\nQUEENS (Quantification of Uncertain Effects in Engineering Systems), an\nopen-source Python framework for composing and managing simulation analyses\nwith arbitrary (physics-based) solvers on distributed computing\ninfrastructures. Besides simulation management capabilities, QUEENS offers a\ncomprehensive collection of efficiently implemented state-of-the-art algorithms\nranging from routines for convergence studies and common optimization\nalgorithms to more advanced sampling algorithms for uncertainty quantification\nand Bayesian inverse analysis. Additionally, we provide our latest cutting-edge\nresearch in multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification, efficient multi-fidelity\nBayesian inverse analysis, and probabilistic machine learning. QUEENS adopts a\nBayesian, probabilistic mindset but equally supports standard deterministic\nanalysis without requiring prior knowledge of probability theory. The modular\narchitecture allows rapid switching between common types of analyses and\nfacilitates building sophisticated hierarchical algorithms. Encouraging natural\nincremental steps and scaling towards complexity allows researchers to consider\nthe big picture while building towards it through smaller, manageable steps.\nThe open-source repository is available at https://github.com/queens-py/queens.",

To address this limitation, we created\nand curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000\nverifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in\ndrug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug\nperturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by\npost-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable\nRewards strategy.

Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of\ngeneralization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently\noutperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization\neffect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were\ntrained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task\nimprovements.

REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct\nstructured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance\nmultimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing\ncritical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior\napproaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured\nfeedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and\nscalability.

When the onset process follows a stationary Poisson\nprocess, the resulting data are length-biased. This sampling mechanism induces\na selection bias towards longer survival individuals, and nonparametric and\nsemiparametric methods for traditional survival data are not directly\napplicable. While tree-based methods developed for left-truncated data can be\napplied, they may be inefficient for length-biased data, as they do not account\nfor the distribution of truncation times. To address this, we propose new\nsurvival trees and forests for length-biased right-censored data within the\nconditional inference framework. Our approach uses a score function derived\nfrom the full likelihood to construct permutation test statistics for unbiased\nvariable selection. For survival prediction, we consider two estimators of the\nunbiased survival function, differing in statistical efficiency and\ncomputational complexity. These elements enhance efficiency in tree\nconstruction and improve accuracy of survival prediction in ensemble settings.\nSimulation studies demonstrate efficiency gains in both tree recovery and\nsurvival prediction, often exceeding the gains from ensembling alone.

We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the\nextent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally\nexpensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose\nMetamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code\nexecuted by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is\nthat, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed\nwhen executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more\ndifferential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to\nexpose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this\ngeneral intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five\nwidely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines,\ncompilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the\nbug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC\nhas a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is\n4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods'\neffectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage\nwhile still capturing the part of the program that is being tested.

The features are reconstructed based on the node\nneighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different\nmodality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)\nto focus on pertinent information within a modality.

These\nstrategies incorporate different combinations of controllers (active and\npassive), quantizers (centered on the origin or custom-designed), and network\nconfigurations (with or without ACK signals). For each strategy, specific\nupdate laws for the encoder and decoder are designed to avoid quantization\nsaturation.\n  Furthermore, the uniformity of encoder and decoder operations is maintained\nby transmitting additional information to the decoder. To achieve asymptotic\nstability, sufficient conditions concerning the switching signal and DoS attack\nconstraints are derived by taking into account the asynchronous behaviors. The\nproposed active quantization strategy with the ACK signal leverages the system\nmodel information to compute the control signal in real-time, allowing for\npossible convergence of the system state despite DoS attack. Additionally, a\nwell-designed switching signal is suggested to further mitigate the impact of\nDoS attack. A passive quantization strategy with ACK signal is also developed\nas a simplified version of the active quantized control strategy, providing the\nfoundation for a strategy without ACK signal. Inspired by time-triggered and\nevent-triggered mechanisms, the passive quantization strategy without ACK\nsignal is investigated, with two feasible update laws for the quantizer.\nFinally, two simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed strategies.",

Secondly, action elements in competitions are\nseparated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but\nexisting methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each\naction element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and\ninefficient to handle long-range contexts.

In this work, we propose a general approach -- the\nstatistics-encoded tensor network (SeTN) -- to study such systems. By encoding\ndisorder into an auxiliary layer and averaging separately, SeTN restores\ntranslational invariance, enabling a well-defined transfer matrix formulation.\nWe derive a universal criterion, $n \\gg \\alpha^2 t^2$, linking discretization\n$n$, disorder strength $\\alpha$, and evolution duration $t$. This sets the\nresolution required for faithful disorder averaging and shows that encoding is\nmost efficient in the weak-disorder, typically chaotic regime. Applied to the\ndisordered transverse-field Ising model, SeTN shows that the spectral form\nfactor is governed by the leading transfer-matrix eigenvalue, in contrast to\nthe kicked Ising model. SeTN thus provides a novel framework for probing the\ndisorder-driven dynamical phenomena in many-body quantum systems.",

Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart\ngovernance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the\nmost used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological\nmodeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great\nmajority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven\nin operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their\nresults in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the\npresented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better\nunderstanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a\nfoundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities\nmodeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the\nModel-Driven Engineering community.",

    "abstract": "With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid\nadvancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from\npixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands\nmore from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and\ntopological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:\nlimited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural\ninformation. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global\nremote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land\ncover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive\nvector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects\n(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an\nintelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to\nimprove efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six\ncontinents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks\nlike pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline\nextraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized\nbenchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing\ngeographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for\nglobal geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The\ndataset is publicly available at https://github.com/ucas-dlg/IRSAMap",

    "abstract": "Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with\nevents to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such\nsemantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a\nprocess (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to\ntraditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,\nreality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling\nsemantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through\ntask-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in\nmodels that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of\ngeneralization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of\ninstruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of\ninstruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for\ndifferent tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making\nit more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better\nat unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied\nimpact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on\nprocess discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly\ndetection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for\ninstruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,\ntypically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing\n(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their\nhistorical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge\nconcepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts\nbelieved to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,\nerror-prone, or overly general.\n  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary\nrepresentations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence\nof a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These\nrepresentations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations\nand are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep\nlearning KT architectures.\n  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student\nmodeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show\nthat augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved\npredictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs\nenhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based\nmethod (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes\nwithin a simulated student environment.",

The estimated highest value of the imaginary part of the dielectric\nfunction using IQPA is 7 at 2 eV, which slightly decreases to 5.7 due to LFEs.\nWithin BSE, the peak value is obtained to be maximum at 1.6 eV with a magnitude\nof 10.8, which indicates the strong excitonic effect below the optical gap.\nLarge number of bright and dark bound excitons are found, where the binding\nenergies of four main bound bright excitons are found in the range of 299-350\nmeV.

    "abstract": "A search for the charmless baryonic decay $B^+\\to \\bar{\\Lambda} p\\bar{p}p$ is\nperformed using proton-proton collision data recorded by the LHCb experiment,\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.4~$\\text{fb}^{-1}$. The\nbranching fraction for this decay is measured for the first time relative to\nthat of the topologically similar decay $B^+\\to J/\\psi K^+$, with $J/\\psi\\to\n\\bar{\\Lambda} p K^-$.

Personalizing AIGC services to meet individual user demands is\nessential but challenging for AIGC service providers (ASPs) due to the\nsubjective and complex demands of mobile users (MUs), as well as the\ncomputational and communication resource constraints faced by ASPs. To tackle\nthese challenges, we first develop a novel multi-dimensional\nquality-of-experience (QoE) metric. This metric comprehensively evaluates AIGC\nservices by integrating accuracy, token count, and timeliness. We focus on a\nmobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled AIGC network, consisting of multiple ASPs\ndeploying differentiated AIGC models on edge servers and multiple MUs with\nheterogeneous QoE requirements requesting AIGC services from ASPs. To\nincentivize ASPs to provide personalized AIGC services under MEC resource\nconstraints, we propose a QoE-driven incentive mechanism. We formulate the\nproblem as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC), where\nMUs as leaders determine rewards, while ASPs as followers optimize resource\nallocation. To solve this, we develop a dual-perturbation reward optimization\nalgorithm, reducing the implementation complexity of adaptive pricing.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism achieves a\nreduction of approximately $64.9\\%$ in average computational and communication\noverhead, while the average service cost for MUs and the resource consumption\nof ASPs decrease by $66.5\\%$ and $76.8\\%$, respectively, compared to\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks.",

Two-dimensional steady-state\nconvective solutions with the Frank-Kamenetskii viscosity are obtained by the\nNewton method for a number of different values of the Rayleigh number and the\nstrength of the dependence of the viscosity on temperature. By classifying the\nsolutions with the top surface mobility, we find the sluggish lid regime\nbetween the mobile and stagnant lid regimes. The solutions of the sluggish\nregime are characterized by a large viscosity contrast through the boundary\nlayer below the conductive lid and a rapid increase of the Nusselt number with\nrespect to the Rayleigh number. For most solutions in the mobile and stagnant\nlid regimes, the Nusselt number is proportional to the 1/6 power of the\nRayleigh number, which can be derived by taking into account the effect of thin\nand strong downwelling plumes. Time evolution calculations show that the steady\nsolutions become unstable for large Rayleigh numbers, where additional downward\nplumes grow on the background convective flows. This can be explained by the\ntimescale of the Rayleigh--Taylor instability for the thermal boundary layer\nbetween the conductive lid and the convective core, which is shorter than the\ntimescale of horizontal advection by the background flow. In addition, steady\nconvective solutions with Arrhenius-law viscosity are calculated for several\nvalues of the parameters.

Most studies were developed for relativistic beams and room-temperature\nconductivity. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the\nhigh-frequency impedance behavior of ultra-short bunches, as in the case of\nFELs, and in the anomalous conductivity at cryogenic temperatures of the vacuum\nchambers.

In this paper we\npresent a formal and general solution to the full grain of truth problem: we\nconstruct a class of strategies wide enough to contain all computable\nstrategies as well as Bayes-optimal strategies for every reasonable prior over\nthe class. When the \"environment\" is a known repeated stage game, we show\nconvergence in the sense of [KL93a] and [KL93b]. When the environment is\nunknown, agents using Thompson sampling converge to play $\\varepsilon$-Nash\nequilibria in arbitrary unknown computable multi-agent environments. Finally,\nwe include an application to self-predictive policies that avoid planning.\nWhile these results use computability theory only as a conceptual tool to solve\na classic game theory problem, we show that our solution can naturally be\ncomputationally approximated arbitrarily closely.",

Through complementary energy barrier calculations\nand micromagnetic simulations incorporating Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch dynamics, we\nelucidate the underlying mechanism: transient ultrafast demagnetization\nfollowed by rapid remagnetization that enables a dipolar-driven collective\nrearrangement. Moreover, a tailored decreasing-fluence laser annealing protocol\nis shown to enhance ground-state ordering, consistently achieving over 92%\nground-state vertex populations. This work opens the way to ultrafast and\nspatially selective control of magnetic states in artificial spin ice for\nspin-based computation and memory technologies, and highlights the critical\ninterplay of thermal fluctuations, magnetostatic coupling, and transient\nmagnetization dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.\nUnlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or\ncaption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where\ntextual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing\nmethods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they\nrequire specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from\nsemantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies\nin economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the\nsemantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,\nwe propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE\npromotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by\nproposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the\ntextual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to\naugment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic\ncreative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by\nextending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,\nto advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with\naround 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,\ndemonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.",

Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local\nneighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as\npairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches\ncan mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of\nmanifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the\ncompactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to\nseparate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this\nresearch, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with\nTwo-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by\neffectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by\ndividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,\nit constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second\nphase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional\ncharacteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms\nwidely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure\npreservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO\noutperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against\ninitialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data\nanalysis.

    "abstract": "Parallel quasi-one-dimensional metals are known to experience strong\ndispersion (van der Waals, vdW) interactions that fall off unusually slowly\nwith separation between the metals. Examples include nanotube brushes,\nnano-wire arrays, and also common biological structures. In a many-stranded\nbundle, there are potentially strong multi-strand vdW interactions that go\nbeyond a simple sum of negative (attractive) pairwise inter-strand energies.\nPerturbative analysis showed that these contributions alternate in sign, with\nthe odd (triplet, quintuplet, ...) terms being positive (repulsive). The\ntriplet case leds to the intriguing speculation that these strands may prefer\nto coalesce into even-numbered bundles, which could have implications for the\nformation kinetics of DNA, for example. Here we use a non-perturbative vdW\nenergy analysis to show that this conjecture is not true in general. As our\ncounter-example we consider 6 strands and show that 2 well-separated bundles of\n3 strands have a more negative total vdW energy than 3 well-separated bundles\nof 2 strands ( i.e. an odd-number preference). We also discuss a bundle of 6\nstrands and explore the relative contributions beyond pairwise interactions.",

Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts\n-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.\nExisting benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy\nscores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and\nworkflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative\nhint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across\nsix specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question\nis paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing\nabout 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,\ngeneral-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling\nover 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and\nAnti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45\nDegrees plot.

The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81\nDegrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both.

In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration\nmethod that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.\nUnlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step\nsimilarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach\noriginates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically\nanalyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache\nreuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more\neffective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion\ntrajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the\nsampling procedure. In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate\nthe corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling\ndirection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the\nsampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a\npromising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based\ngenerative models.",

While many methods assume overlapping users or\nitems to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.\nThus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are\nneeded.\n  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of\noverlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional\ndiscrepancies degrading transfer performance.

We benchmark simple linear probes,\nadvanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and\nCLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.\nBuilding on these insights, we introduce T-MASK -- a new image-to-video probing\nmethod that leverages temporal token masking and emphasizes more dynamic video\nregions.

FGL does\nthat by leveraging the passive movement of energy-constrained nanodevices\ncirculating through the bloodstream. Existing FGL solutions rely on graph\nmodels with fixed topologies or handcrafted features, which limit their\nadaptability to anatomical variability and hinder scalability. In this work, we\nexplore the use of Set Transformer architectures to address these limitations.\nOur formulation treats nanodevices' circulation time reports as unordered sets,\nenabling permutation-invariant, variable-length input processing without\nrelying on spatial priors. To improve robustness under data scarcity and class\nimbalance, we integrate synthetic data generation via deep generative models,\nincluding CGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and CVAE. These models are trained to replicate\nrealistic circulation time distributions conditioned on vascular region labels,\nand are used to augment the training data. Our results show that the Set\nTransformer achieves comparable classification accuracy compared to Graph\nNeural Networks (GNN) baselines, while simultaneously providing by-design\nimproved generalization to anatomical variability. The findings highlight the\npotential of permutation-invariant models and synthetic augmentation for robust\nand scalable nanoscale localization.",

To\nreflect global diversity, we compared the results with the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights and three regional charters from Asia, the Middle\nEast, and Africa. Models with lower alignment to WEIRD values, such as BLOOM\nand Qwen, produced more culturally varied responses but were 2% to 4% more\nlikely to generate outputs that violated human rights, especially regarding\ngender and equality. For example, some models agreed with the statements ``a\nman who cannot father children is not a real man'' and ``a husband should\nalways know where his wife is'', reflecting harmful gender norms.

A significant challenge is\npresented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)\ntasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and\nindividual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very\ndifficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability\namong individuals.

A simple drawing is\ngeneralized twisted if it fulfills certain rather specific constraints on how\nthe edges are drawn. An abstract rotation system of a graph assigns to each\nvertex a cyclic order of its incident edges. A realizable rotation system is\none that admits a simple drawing such that at each vertex, the edges emanate in\nthat cyclic order, and a generalized twisted rotation system can be realized as\na generalized twisted drawing. Generalized twisted drawings have initially been\nintroduced to obtain improved bounds on the size of plane substructures in any\nsimple drawing of $K_n$. They have since gained independent interest due to\ntheir surprising properties. However, the definition of generalized twisted\ndrawings is very geometric and drawing-specific.\n  In this paper, we develop characterizations of generalized twisted drawings\nthat enable a purely combinatorial view on these drawings and lead to efficient\nrecognition algorithms. Concretely, we show that for any $n \\geq 7$, an\nabstract rotation system of $K_n$ is generalized twisted if and only if all\nsubrotation systems induced by five vertices are generalized twisted. This\nimplies a drawing-independent and concise characterization of generalized\ntwistedness. Besides, the result yields a simple $O(n^5)$-time algorithm to\ndecide whether an abstract rotation system is generalized twisted and sheds new\nlight on the structural features of simple drawings. We further develop a\ncharacterization via the rotations of a pair of vertices in a drawing, which we\nthen use to derive an $O(n^2)$-time algorithm to decide whether a realizable\nrotation system is generalized twisted.",

Motivated by this observation, we will design\nSWFs that guarantee that every input ranking is proportionally represented by\nthe output ranking. Specifically, our central fairness condition requires that\nthe number of pairwise comparisons between candidates on which an input ranking\nand the output ranking agree is proportional to the weight of the input\nranking. As our main contribution, we present a simple SWF called the\nProportional Sequential Borda rule, which satisfies this condition. Moreover,\nwe introduce two variants of this rule: the Ranked Method of Equal Shares,\nwhich has a more utilitarian flavor while still satisfying our fairness\ncondition, and the Flow-adjusting Borda rule, which satisfies an even stronger\nfairness condition. Many of our axioms and techniques are inspired by results\non approval-based committee voting and participatory budgeting, where the\nconcept of proportional representation has been studied in depth.",

    "abstract": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most devastating natural hazards, yet\ntheir intensity remains notoriously difficult to predict. Numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) models are constrained by both computational demands and\nintrinsic predictability, while state-of-the-art deep learning-based weather\nforecasting models tend to underestimate TC intensity due to biases in\nreanalysis-based training data. Here, we present FuXi-TC, a diffusion-based\ngenerative forecasting framework that combines the track prediction skill of\nthe FuXi model with the intensity representation of NWP simulations. Trained on\noutputs from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model driven by FuXi\nbackground fields, FuXi-TC corrects systematic biases and reconstructs\nrealistic TC structures without retraining global models. Across 21 TCs in\n2024, FuXi-TC substantially reduces root mean square error in 5-day intensity\nforecasts relative to both FuXi and ERA5, achieving skill comparable to the\nhigh-resolution deterministic forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range\nWeather Forecasts (ECMWF). Moreover, FuXi-TC delivers forecasts within seconds,\nover three orders of magnitude faster than WRF, enabling real-time operational\nuse and large ensembles. These results demonstrate the value of integrating\ngenerative diffusion models with physics-informed datasets to advance TC\nprediction, offering both improved accuracy and transformative computational\nefficiency for disaster preparedness.

Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in\nan image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted\nas region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided\nattention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly\nconsidered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions\nbetween unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,\nour approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image\ninformation, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional\nSISR techniques.

To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate\nthat collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its\nunderlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low\nnoise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting\nin high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,\nultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing\ntechniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our\nexplanation of collapse errors.

To\novercome the growing energy consumption of LLM inference systems, this paper\nproposes a Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit (HNLPU), which physically\nhardwires LLM weight parameters into the computational fabric, achieving\nseveral orders of magnitude computational efficiency improvement by extreme\nspecialization. However, a significant challenge still lies in the scale of\nmodern LLMs. An ideal estimation on hardwiring gpt-oss 120 B requires\nfabricating at least 6 billion dollars of photomask sets, rendering the\nstraightforward solution economically impractical. Addressing this challenge,\nwe propose the novel Metal-Embedding methodology. Instead of embedding weights\nin a 2D grid of silicon device cells, Metal-Embedding embeds weight parameters\ninto the 3D topology of metal wires. This brings two benefits: (1) a 15x\nincrease in density, and (2) 60 out of 70 layers of photomasks are made\nhomogeneous across chips, including all EUV photomasks. In total,\nMetal-Embedding reduced the photomask cost by 112x, bringing the Non-Recurring\nEngineering (NRE) cost of HNLPU into an economically viable range. Experimental\nresults show that HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36\ntokens/J (1,047x/283x of GPU/WSE), 13,232 mm2 total die area (29% inscribed\nrectangular area in a 300 mm wafer), \\$184M estimated NRE at 5 nm technology.\nAnalysis shows that HNLPU achieved 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon\nfootprint reduction compared to H100 clusters, under an annual weight updating\nassumption.",

    "abstract": "Linear regression is fundamental to statistical analysis and machine\nlearning, but its application to large-scale datasets necessitates distributed\ncomputing. The problem also arises in quantum computing, where handling\nextensive data requires distributed approaches. This paper investigates\ndistributed linear regression in the quantum coordinator model. Building upon\nthe distributed quantum least squares protocol developed by Montanaro and Shao,\nwe propose improved and extended quantum protocols for solving both ordinary\n(unregularized) and L2-regularized (Tikhonov) least squares problems. For\nordinary least squares methods, our protocol reduces the quantum communication\ncomplexity compared to the previous protocol. In particular, this yields a\nquadratic improvement in the number of digits of precision required for the\ngenerated quantum states. This improvement is achieved by incorporating\nadvanced techniques such as branch marking and branch-marked gapped phase\nestimation developed by Low and Su. Additionally, we introduce a quantum\nprotocol for the L2-regularized least squares problem and derive its quantum\ncommunication complexity.",

To mitigate these\nchallenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV\ncache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high\nsimilarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,\nresulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache.

Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave,\ncode completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code\nLLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and\nintrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the\npractical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex\ncalculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such\nas perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence\nor uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and\ncan serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in\nLLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when\ngenerating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages,\nmodels, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657\nGitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity\nthan dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher\nperplexity.

    "abstract": "Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative\nRecommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the\napplication of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation).\nHowever, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest\n(POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by\nspatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper,\nwe propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for\nlarge-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling\nability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal\ninformation encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware\nhierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary\nmodeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to\nseamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,\nthereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.\nFurthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic\nunderstanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we\ndevelop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient\npre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to\ngenerate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI\ncandidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,\nranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both\npublic benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating\nits superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation\naccuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative\nmodel deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of\nmillions of POIs and users.",

Although peephole optimization is a\ncritical class of compiler optimizations, discovering new and effective\npeephole optimizations is challenging as the instruction sets can be extremely\ncomplex and diverse. Previous methods either do not scale well or can only\ncapture a limited subset of peephole optimizations. In this work, we leverage\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to detect missed peephole optimizations. We\npropose Lampo, a novel automated framework that synergistically combines the\ncreative but unreliable code optimization ability of LLMs with rigorous\ncorrectness verification performed by translation validation tools, integrated\nin a feedback-driven iterative process. Through a comprehensive evaluation\nwithin LLVM ecosystems, we show that Lampo can successfully detect up to 17 out\nof 25 previously reported missed optimizations in LLVM on average, and that 22\nout of 25 can potentially be found by Lampo with different LLMs. For\ncomparison, the state-of-the-art superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper, identified 15\nof them. Moreover, within seven months of development and intermittent\nexperiments, Lampo found 26 missed peephole optimizations, 15 of which have\nbeen confirmed and 6 already fixed.

Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a\ntext-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately\n9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes\nfrom a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples\nrequire textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,\nfor correct classification.

Several models of nuclear equation of state\n(EOS) are constructed with varying saturation parameters, particularly the\nsymmetry energy $S_0$ and its density slope $L$. Using the Thomas--Fermi\napproximation, the mass and proton numbers of heavy nuclei at subnuclear\ndensities are systematically evaluated, along with their dependence on the EOS.\nCooling simulations of protoneutron stars reveal that EOSs with smaller $L$\nvalues lead to a longer cooling timescale and higher average neutrino energies.\nThis behavior is attributed to the enhanced neutrino scattering caused by\nlarger mass numbers, which increases the thermal insulation. Furthermore, the\ncrystallization temperature, marking the onset of crust formation, is found to\nbe higher for EOSs with smaller values of $L$. This is due to the enhanced\nCoulomb energy associated with larger proton numbers. As a result, despite\nslower cooling, crust formation occurs earlier for smaller-$L$ EOSs. These\nfindings indicate that the timing of crust formation is sensitive to the EOS\nand highlight the importance of late-time neutrino observations as probes of\nthe matter properties at subnuclear densities.",

Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an\nimportant role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low\ncost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical\nprocesses and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical\nknowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this\npaper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular\nstructure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate\nexpert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent\nspecializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary\nroles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of\nstructure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\nIR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but\nalso shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.",

These challenges are\ncompounded when the outcome is binary, a setting for which robust IV methods\nremain underdeveloped. A fundamental contribution of this paper is the\ndevelopment of a general identification strategy justified under a structural\nequilibrium dynamic generative model of so-called stable confounding and a\nquasi instrumental variable (QIV), i.e. a variable that is only assumed to be\npredictive of the outcome. Such a model implies (a) stability of confounding on\nthe multiplicative scale, and (b) stability of the additive average treatment\neffect among the treated (ATT), across levels of that QIV. The former is all\nthat is necessary to ensure a valid test of the causal null hypothesis;\ntogether those two conditions establish nonparametric identification and\nestimation of the conditional and marginal ATT. To address the statistical\nchallenges posed by the need for boundedness in binary outcomes, we introduce a\ngeneralized odds product re-parametrization of the observed data distribution,\nand we develop both a principled maximum likelihood estimator and a triply\nrobust semiparametric locally efficient estimator, which we evaluate through\nsimulations and an empirical application to the UK Biobank.",

However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic\nfeatures of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this\nissue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the\nphase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This\nis represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the\nurgency of a turn movement in the phase.

Through strain-dependent transport measurements of the Weyl\nsemimetal SrRuO3, we observed a significant enhancement of anomalous Hall\nconductivity by 21% under a tiny strain level of 0.2%, while longitudinal\nresistivity remains almost constant -- a hallmark of intrinsic topological\nresponse. First-principles calculations reveal a distinct mechanism where\nstrain-driven non-monotonic evolution of Weyl nodes across the Fermi level,\nexclusively governed by lattice constant modulation, drives the striking AHC\nbehavior.

Within this framework, the charge $q$ can exceed the extremal bound\n$q/M > 1$, and a single event horizon is maintained provided the parameter\n$\\mu$ exceeds the $\\mu_{\\text{max}} = 0.019$, with the ADM mass fixed at $M =\n1/2$. We obtain a single branch of scalarized EEH (sEEH) black holes for $q >\n0$ which is considered as the simplest model for scalarization of EEH black\nholes. We found that this class of hairy black holes is not thermodynamically\nfavored, and their quasinormal modes indicate they are dynamically unstable. An\ninteresting feature is that when $q < 1/2$, the scalar charge varies only\nslightly with $q$ for a fixed mass. In contrast, for $q>1/2$, the scalar charge\nincreases more rapidly as $q$ increases. This distinct behavior suggests that\nthe scalar charge exhibits the characteristics of a primary charge for $q <\n1/2$, and of a secondary charge for $q > 1/2$.

For the practical\nmulti-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a\nsecond-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our\nempirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,\ndemonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory\nin both norm and direction.

The vehicular\nvisible light communication (VVLC) system is a key feature in leveraging\nexisting infrastructures, but it still has several critical challenges.\nEspecially, VVLC channels are highly correlated due to the small gap between\nlight emitting diodes (LEDs) in each headlight, making it difficult to increase\ndata rates by spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we exploit recently\nsynthesized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to reduce the correlation between LEDs,\ni.e., the chiroptical properties of GNPs for differential absorption depending\non the azimuth angle of incident light are used to mitigate the LED\ncorrelation. In addition, we adopt a signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio\n(SLNR)-based precoder to support multiple users. The ratio of RGB light sources\nin each LED also needs to be optimized to maximize the sum SLNR satisfying a\nwhite light constraint for illumination since the GNPs can vary the color of\ntransmitted light by the differential absorption across wavelength. The\nnonconvex optimization problems for precoders and RGB ratios can be solved by\nthe generalized Rayleigh quotient with the approximated shot noise and\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA). The simulation results show that the\nSLNR-based precoder with the optimized RGB ratios significantly improves the\nsum rate in a multi-user vehicular environment and the secrecy rate in a\nwiretapping scenario.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted\nTransformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong\nperformance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict\nconsistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,\nwhich limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by\nconvolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection\naccuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a\nnovel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and\ndiffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,\nsubmanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure\ncomputational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth\nof the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)\ndiffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich\nspatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to\nstrengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features\nproduced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or\nSSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,\nhighlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several\nbenchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based\nmodels. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves\ndetection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7\nmAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP\non ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code\nwill be made publicly available.",

For\na given quantum master equation, the set of trajectories generated from all\ninitial states encodes its essential dynamical features. Thus, Markovianity can\nbe determined directly from the trajectory set, reducing the problem to a\ngeneral mathematical one: determing the non-Markovianity of the set itself,\nregardless of whether it originates from a quantum or classical process. Here,\nwe solve this problem and classify the trajectory sets into three types:\n\\textit{strictly Markovian}, \\textit{initial-state Markovian}, and\n\\textit{non-Markovian}.

In the\ndiagonal case, both diagnostics identify R(5,5) at n=45.

With the astounding\nadvances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been\ndeveloped to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the\npotential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently\nconstrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs\ntypically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input\nlayer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in\ndeeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual\nembeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer\nSteerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to\ndirectly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the\nprogressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF\nleverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically\nrich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across\nLLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are\ndesigned to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual\nmodalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures\nefficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven\nbenchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared\nwith baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE.

    "abstract": "In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the use of\ndual-functional signals inherently exposes confidential communication\ninformation during radar sensing, particularly when the sensing target itself\nacts as an eavesdropper. Conventional physical-layer security solutions rely on\ndirectional beamforming or artificial noise injection implemented via signal\nprocessing in the baseband (BB) domain. However, these BB-domain approaches are\nconstrained by insufficient spatial resolution and the adverse effects of\nspatially correlated channels. To overcome these limitations, this paper\nproposes a novel secure ISAC framework empowered by compound reconfigurable\nantenna (CRA) arrays, which offer simultaneous reconfigurability of radiation\npatterns and polarization states in the electromagnetic (EM) domain.\nSpecifically, we develop a comprehensive channel model incorporating virtual\nangular domain, spatial domain, and depolarization effects, and formulate a\nmixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly design EM-domain\nand BB-domain precoders and combiners. To efficiently solve this complex\noptimization problem, we propose an iterative decomposition-based algorithm\nleveraging fractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM),\nsecond-order cone programming (SOCP), and penalty methods. Extensive simulation\nresults demonstrate that the CRA array architecture with proposed joint EM-and\nBB-domain design achieves significant performance improvements in secure ISAC\nsystems. In particular, radar sensing gains of up to 12dB are observed over\nconventional beamforming, while robust communication security is maintained.\nThese results highlight the considerable benefits attainable by jointly\nleveraging additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the EM domain for secure\nISAC system design.",

Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient\noutcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled\nfoundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support\nclinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR\ndata into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We\nintroduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that\nnatively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and\nfuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a\nLLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,\nwhere it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while\nalso performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction\n(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for\nclinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day\nreadmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on\nMIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and\n30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved\nROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,\nGDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical\nutility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing\naccuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can\nboth predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical\nnarratives.

It builds upon the\nwork of Altuhaifa, which used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results\n(SEER) data from 1975-2018 to evaluate these models. Altuhaifa's study found\nthat ARIMA (0,2,2), SES with smoothing parameter $\\alpha=0.995$, and HDES with\nparameters $\\alpha=0.4$ and $\\beta=0.9$ were the optimal models from their\nanalysis, with HDES providing the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of\n132.91. The paper extends the dataset to 2021 and re-evaluates the models.\nUsing the same SEER data from 1975-2021, it identifies ARIMA (0,2,2), SES\n($\\alpha=0.999$), and HDES ($\\alpha=0.5221$, $\\beta=0.5219$) as the\nbest-fitting models. Interestingly, ARIMA (0,2,2) and HDES yield the lowest\nRMSE of 2.56. To obtain forecasts with higher accuracy, an average model\n(HDES-ARIMA) consisting of HDES and ARIMA was constructed to leverage their\nstrengths. The HDES-ARIMA model also achieves an RMSE of 2.56. The forecast\nfrom the average model suggests declining lung cancer mortality rates in the\nUnited States. The study highlights how expanding datasets and re-evaluating\nmodels can provide updated insights. It recommends further analysis using\nmonthly data separated by gender, ethnicity, and state to understand lung\ncancer mortality dynamics in the United States.

Moreover, developing multimodal\nmodels can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an\nAdaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning\nmodules.

To handle\nretrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific\nstrategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types.

In low-demand\nareas, drone-assisted trucks may underutilize resources due to high upfront\ncosts. Accurately predicting demand is challenging due to uncertainties from\nunforeseen events or infrastructure disruptions. To address this, a market\nentry and exit real option approach is used to optimize switching between\ntruck-only and drone-assisted delivery under stochastic demand. Results show\nthat deploying multiple drones per truck offers significant cost advantages in\nhigh-demand regions. Using the proposed dynamic switching model, deterministic\nand stochastic approaches reduce costs by 17.4% and 31.3%, respectively,\ncompared to immediate cost-saving switching. Sensitivity analysis reveals\nasymmetric effects of stochastic parameters on entry and exit timings. A\nstochastic multiple-options model is further developed to dynamically switch\nbetween truck-only and drone-assisted delivery with varying drone numbers.\nApplying these models to Miami-Dade County, we evaluate dynamic switching costs\nfor three major logistics operators.

Given queries and certain index-related\nconstraints, traditional methods rely on heuristic optimization or\nlearning-based models to select effective indexes and improve query\nperformance.

With the recent rapid development of\nlarge language models (LLMs), methods using prompt tuning have been proposed to\nenhance the efficiency of index selection. However, such methods still can not\nachieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, and preparing the index selection\ndemonstrations is also resource-intensive. To address these issues, we propose\nMAAdvisor, a zero-shot LLM-based index advisor with a multi-agent framework. We\ndecompose the index recommendation problem into sub-steps, including planning,\nselection, combination, revision, and reflection. A set of LLM-embedded agents\nis designed to handle each one of the different sub-steps. Our method utilizes\nglobal agents to control the index selection process and local agents to select\nand revise indexes.

    "abstract": "Dynamic targeting (DT) is a spacecraft autonomy concept in which sensor data\nis acquired and rapidly analyzed and used to drive subsequent observation. We\ndescribe the low Earth orbit application of this approach in which lookahead\nimagery is analyzed to detect clouds, thermal anomalies, or land use cases to\ndrive higher quality near nadir imaging. Use cases for such a capability\ninclude: cloud avoidance, storm hunting, search for planetary boundary layer\nevents, plume study, and beyond. The DT concept requires a lookahead sensor or\nagility to use a primary sensor in such a mode, edge computing to analyze\nimages rapidly onboard, and a primary followup sensor. Additionally, an\ninter-satellite or low latency communications link can be leveraged for cross\nplatform tasking. We describe implementation in progress to fly DT in early\n2025 on the CogniSAT-6 (Ubotica/Open Cosmos) spacecraft that launched in March\n2024 on the SpaceX Transporter-10 launch.",

Conventional mobility aids -\nwhite canes and ultrasound-based intelligent canes - are inherently limited in\nthe feedback they can offer and generally will not be able to differentiate\namong types of obstacles in dense or complex environments. Here, we introduce\nthe IoT Cane, an internet of things assistive navigation tool that integrates\nreal-time computer vision with a transformer-based RT-DETRv3-R50 model\nalongside depth sensing through the Intel RealSense camera. Our prototype\nrecords a mAP of 53.4% and an AP50 of 71.7% when tested on difficult datasets\nwith low Intersection over Union (IoU) boundaries, outperforming similar\nultrasound-based systems. Latency in end-to-end mode is around 150 ms per\nframe, accounting for preprocessing (1-3 ms), inference (50-70 ms), and\npost-processing (0.5-1.0 ms per object detected). Feedback is provided through\nhaptic vibration motors and audio notifications driven by a LiPo battery, which\ncontrols power using a PowerBoost module. Future directions involve iOS\nintegration to tap into more compute, hardware redesign to minimize cost, and\nmobile companion app support over Bluetooth.

However, numerical models still fall short of achieving the\ntheoretical predictability limit for the MJO due to inherent constraints. In an\neffort to extend the skillful prediction window for the MJO, machine learning\n(ML) techniques have gained increasing attention. This study examines the MJO\nprediction performance of the FuXi subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) ML model\nduring boreal winter, comparing it with the European Centre for Medium- Range\nWeather Forecasts S2S model. Results indicate that for the initial strong MJO\nphase 3, the FuXi-S2S model demonstrates reduced biases in intraseasonal\noutgoing longwave radiation anomalies averaged over the tropical western\nPacific (WP) region during days 15-20, with the convective center located over\nthis area. Analysis of multiscale interactions related to moisture transport\nsuggests that improvements could be attributed to the FuXi-S2S model's more\naccurate prediction of the area-averaged meridional gradient of low-frequency\nbackground moisture over the tropical WP. These findings not only explain the\nenhanced predictive capability of the FuXi-S2S model but also highlight the\npotential of ML approaches in advancing the MJO forecasting.",

Analyzing 260 million comments from 6.2\nmillion users over 13 years on Naver News, South Korea's largest news\naggregation platform, we quantify participation inequality using the Gini and\nPalma indexes and estimate hostility levels with a KC-Electra model, which\noutperformed other Korean pre-trained transformers in multi-label\nclassification tasks. The findings reveal a highly skewed participation\nstructure, with a small number of frequent users dominating discussions,\nparticularly in the Politics and Society domains and popular news stories.\nParticipation inequality spikes during presidential elections, and frequent\ncommenters are significantly more likely to post hostile content, suggesting\nthat online discourse is shaped disproportionately by a highly active and often\nhostile subset of users.

In other words,\nplain changes traces a Hamilton path in the permutohedron. In 2013 it was shown\nthat plain changes can be generated by a greedy algorithm: swap the largest\nvalue. Algorithm J replaces the swap operation with the jump operation (which\nmoves a larger digit past one or more smaller digits) and forms the basis of\nthe wildly successful Combinatorial Generation via Permutation Languages series\nof papers.\n  Here we further generalize this line of research to languages of s-words\n(i.e., multiset permutations). We generalize jumps to bumps, which moves a\nsequential run of the same larger digit past one or more smaller digits.\nAlgorithm B greedily applies minimum-length bumps prioritized by largest value,\nthen largest index, then rightward before leftward (e.g. 1122, 1221, 1212,\n2112, 2121, 2211 for s = (2, 2)).\n  We show that the algorithm works for s-word languages avoiding a wide variety\nof tame patterns. Specific applications include efficient algorithm for\ngenerating s-Stirling words (which avoid 121) and new Gray codes for various\ns-Catalan objects (which avoid 132 and 121). The former result leads to\nHamilton paths in every s-permutahedron.",

Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic\n(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture\noptimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling\nheterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we\ndevise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates\nfine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant\nfeaturing a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces\ncomputational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical\nconvergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through\nextensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%\nimprovements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,\nover the latest MARL solutions.

    "abstract": "Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused\nhigher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on\nafter-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We\nintroduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to\nmaximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon\nthe sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore,\nproactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse\nQA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top\ncontextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a\nno-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting\n(\"paraphrase\" or \"expand\") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we\nempirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating\nhallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite.\nInterestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a\nconsiderable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher\ncumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites\ncan worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm\nregression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite\nstrategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via\nexploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in\noutput behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for\nretraining or gradient-based adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for\nautomated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the\ndistribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel\nselection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose\nWavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform\n(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM\napplies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific\nfrequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates\nthem channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.\nThis DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature\nselection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging\nmulti-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We\nevaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones\n(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in\nanomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%\nImage-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized\nconfigurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance\ntrade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)\noften enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level\ndetection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to\nrandom feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for\nindustrial inspection with comparable efficiency.",

To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a hybrid computational framework by coupling\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations with a temporally progressive\nneural network architecture. Our method incorporates a structure-preserving\nweak-form loss -- combining DG residuals and Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions\n-- with a causality-respecting progressive training strategy. The proposed\nframework trains neural networks sequentially across temporally decomposed\nsubintervals, leveraging pseudo-label supervision to ensure temporal coherence\nand solution continuity. This approach mitigates error accumulation and\nenhances the model's capacity to resolve shock waves and steep gradients\nwithout explicit limiters. Besides, a theoretical analysis establishes error\nbounds for the proposed framework, demonstrating convergence toward the\nphysical solution under mesh refinement and regularized training. Numerical\nexperiments on Burgers and Euler equations show that our method consistently\noutperforms standard PINNs, PINNs-WE, and first-order DG schemes in both\naccuracy and robustness, particularly in capturing shocks and steep gradients.\nThese results highlight the promise of combining classical discretization\ntechniques with machine learning to develop robust and accurate solvers for\nnonlinear hyperbolic systems.",

    "abstract": "In the graph stream model of computation, an algorithm processes the edges of\nan input graph in one or more sequential passes while using a memory sublinear\nin the input size. This model poses significant challenges for constructing\nlong paths. Many known algorithms tasked with extending an existing path as a\nsubroutine require an entire pass to add a single additional edge. This raises\na fundamental question: Are multiple passes inherently necessary to construct\npaths of non-trivial lengths, or can a single pass suffice? To address this\nquestion, we study the Longest Path problem in the one-pass streaming model. In\nthis problem, given a desired approximation factor $\\alpha$, the objective is\nto compute a path of length at least $\\lp(G) / \\alpha$, where $\\lp(G)$ is the\nlength of a longest path in the input graph. We give algorithms as well as\nspace lower bounds for both undirected and directed graphs. Our results\ninclude: We show that for undirected graphs, in both the insertion-only and the\ninsertion-deletion models, there are semi-streaming algorithms, that compute a\npath of length at least $d /3$ with high probability, where $d$ is the average\ndegree of the graph. These algorithms can also yield an $\\alpha$-approximation\nto Longest Path using space $\\tilde{O}(n^2 / \\alpha)$. Next, we show that such\na result cannot be achieved for directed graphs, even in the insertion-only\nmodel. We show that computing a $(n^{1 - o(1)})$-approximation to Longest Path\nin directed graphs in the insertion-only model requires space $\\Omega(n^2)$. We\nfurther show two additional lower bounds. First, we show that semi-streaming\nspace is insufficient for small constant factor approximations to Longest Path\nfor undirected graphs in the insertion-only model. Last, in undirected graphs\nin the insertion-deletion model, we show that computing an\n$\\alpha$-approximation requires space $\\Omega(n^2 / \\alpha^3)$.",

Our approach uses Stern-Gerlach interferometers (SGIs)\nequipped with a novel dual sensing technique, combining non-destructive\ntransparent sensors (TSs) and projective opaque detectors (ODs), to test\nfoundational principles in a closed system. The first stage employs a single\nSGI with dual sensors to search for anomalous \"delayed-choice\" events that\nchallenge the instantaneous collapse of CI and the global branching of MWI. The\nsecond stage involves a full-loop SGI with two TSs and one OD to investigate\nrecoherence phenomena, which would violate both CI and MWI if observed.\nFinally, the third stage introduces a second full-loop SGI with a test ion to\ngenerate an electromagnetic phase shift, enabling discrimination between\nretrocausal and unitary recoherence mechanisms. Successfully observing these\nrare anomalies, while without breaking any conservation laws, would offer\nstrong evidence for the local branching framework of BHSI, showing a fuzzy\nquantum-classical boundary within dual sensing. The proposed experiments are\nfeasible with current trapped-ion and quantum sensing technologies, offering a\npromising path forward in the ongoing debate over quantum interpretations.",

The aim is to\nintroduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric\nspaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms.

    "abstract": "The additional layer degree of freedom in trilayer moir\\'e superlattices of\ntransition metal dichalcogenides enables the emergence of novel excitonic\nspecies, such as quadrupolar excitons, which exhibit unique excitonic\ninteractions and hold promise for realizing intriguing excitonic phases and\ntheir quantum phase transitions. Concurrently, the presence of strong\nelectronic correlations in moir\\'e superlattices, as exemplified by the\nobservations of Mott insulators and generalized Wigner crystals, offers a\ndirect route to manipulate these new excitonic states and resulting collective\nexcitonic phases. Here, we demonstrate that strong exciton-exciton and\nelectron-exciton interactions, both stemming from robust electron correlations,\ncan be harnessed to controllably drive transitions between quadrupolar and\ndipolar excitons. This is achieved by tuning either the exciton density or\nelectrostatic doping in a trilayer semiconducting moir\\'e superlattice. Our\nfindings not only advance the fundamental understanding of quadrupolar excitons\nbut also usher in new avenues for exploring and engineering many-body quantum\nphenomena through novel correlated excitons in semiconducting moir\\'e systems.",
