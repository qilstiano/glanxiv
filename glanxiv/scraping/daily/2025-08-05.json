    "abstract": "Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly\nacross diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding\noverall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet\neffective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of\nExperts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by\nutilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.\nBy assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the\nlimitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a\nspeech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while\njointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation\n(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,\nachieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to\nboth the encoder and decoder.",

Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in\ndephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same\ndevice. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise.\nHowever, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of\ndephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations\nin the dephasing time, $T_{\\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While\ncharge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to\nthe charge offset and can affect $T_{\\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement\na protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which\nare interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in\nthe same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both\nparities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even\nwith $E_\\text{J}/E_\\text{C} \\approx 50$.

    "abstract": "Urban inequality, as reflected by uneven spatial allocations of resources,\nservices, and opportunities, has arisen as a major topic for quantitative\nresearch and policy intervention. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide\na solid framework for quantifying, analyzing, and visualizing these\ndisparities; nevertheless, the many statistical approaches used in different\nstudies have not been completely pooled. This analysis looks at 201\npeer-reviewed articles published between 1996 and 2024, obtained from the Web\nof Science and Scopus databases, that use GIS-based approaches to investigate\nintra-urban differences. Eligibility was limited to English-language,\npeer-reviewed research that focused on urban settings, with the screening\ntechnique following the PRISMA methodology. The review identifies five key\ntheme domains: accessibility, green space, health-related disparity,\nsocioeconomic status, and open space provision. In the literature, statistical\nand network-based approaches, such as spatial clustering, regression analysis,\nand bibliometric mapping, are critical for identifying patterns and driving\nthematic synthesis. Although accessibility remains the core focus, the subject\nhas expanded to include a variety of indicators such as environmental justice\nand health vulnerability, aided by advances in data sources and spatial\nanalytics.

Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with\ngeneralization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and\nmodel-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID\ndynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach\nutilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with\ncategory-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further\nintegrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the\nquery, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID\ngenerates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images\nfrom a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched\ninput for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the\nUniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that\nRAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.\nRAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining\nhigh accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG\ncompression.

Using\na novel light curve scoring algorithm and a scalable workflow tailored for\nanalyzing millions of light curves, we have identified 81 new dipper star\ncandidates. Our sample reveals a diverse phenomenology of light curve dimming\nshapes, such as skewed and symmetric dimmings with timescales spanning days to\nyears, some of which closely resemble exaggerated versions of KIC 8462852. Our\nsample reveals no clear periodicity patterns sensitive to ZTF in many of these\ndippers and no infrared excess or irregular variability. Using archival data\ncollated for this study, we thoroughly investigate several classification\nscenarios and hypothesize that the mechanisms of such dimming events are either\ndriven by circumstellar clumps or occultations by stellar/sub-stellar\ncompanions with disks. Our study marks a significant step forward in\nunderstanding main-sequence dipper stars.",

All of our results also admit efficient polynomial-time algorithms.\n  To obtain these results, we exploit a new technique of ``decoupling via\naffine spectral-independence'' in designing rounding algorithms. In particular,\nour algorithms obtain the desired colorings via a discrete Brownian motion,\nguided by a semidefinite program (SDP). Besides standard constraints used in\nprior works, we add some extra affine spectral-independence constraints, which\neffectively decouple the evolution of discrepancies across different rows, and\nallow us to better control how many rows accumulate large discrepancies at any\npoint during the process.

    "abstract": "This work aims to overcome an assumption of conventional MR simulators:\nIndividual isochromats should be simulated individually. To reduce the\ncomputational times of MR simulation, a new simulation method using grouped\nisochromats is proposed. When multiple isochromats are grouped before\nsimulations, some parts of the simulation can be shared in each group. For a\ncertain gradient type, the isochromats in the group can be easily chosen for\nensuring that they behave the same. For example, the group can be defined as\nthe isochromats whose locations along x-axis, T1, T2 and magnetic field\ninhomogeneity values are the same values. In such groups, simulations can be\ncombined when a pulse sequence with the magnetic field gradient along x-axis\nonly are processed. The processing times of the conventional and proposed\nmethods were evaluated with several sequences including fast spin echo (FSE)\nand echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences. The simulation times of the proposed\nmethod were 3 to 72 times faster than those of the conventional methods. In the\ncases of 27.5 million isochromats using single instruction multiple data (SIMD)\ninstructions and multi-threading, the conventional method simulated FSE and EPI\nsequences in 208.4 and 66.4 seconds, respectively.

To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video\ngenerator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\\% additional trainable\nparameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the\ngenerator's prior knowledge.

    "abstract": "Flavour physics plays a central role in the search for physics beyond the\nStandard Model, posing fundamental questions whose answers may point to new\nphysics scales far above the electroweak scale. The flavour structure of the\nStandard Model is strikingly hierarchical, hinting at underlying organizing\nprinciples yet to be uncovered. At the same time, flavour-changing processes\nrank among the most sensitive probes of new physics. In this chapter, we review\nhow precision measurements of flavour-violating observables, in particular\nmeson-antimeson mixing and rare decays, provide powerful indirect tests of new\nphysics, constraining scenarios from heavy mediators to light, weakly coupled\nparticles. We also survey theoretical frameworks proposed to explain the origin\nof the Standard Model flavour hierarchies.

Model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and\nknowledge distillation have gained traction in addressing these challenges.\nHowever, the impact of these strategies on the robustness of compressed\nlanguage models for code in adversarial scenarios remains poorly understood.\nUnderstanding how these compressed models behave under adversarial attacks is\nessential for their safe and effective deployment in real-world applications.\nTo bridge this knowledge gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of how\ncommon compression strategies affect the adversarial robustness of compressed\nmodels. We assess the robustness of compressed versions of three widely used\nlanguage models for code across three software analytics tasks, using six\nevaluation metrics and four commonly used classical adversarial attacks. Our\nfindings indicate that compressed models generally maintain comparable\nperformance to their uncompressed counterparts. However, when subjected to\nadversarial attacks, compressed models exhibit significantly reduced\nrobustness. These results reveal a trade-off between model size reduction and\nadversarial robustness, underscoring the need for careful consideration when\ndeploying compressed models in security-critical software applications.

    "abstract": "Design of experiments has traditionally relied on the frequentist hypothesis\ntesting framework where the optimal size of the experiment is specified as the\nminimum sample size that guarantees a required level of power. Sample size\ndetermination may be performed analytically when the test statistic has a known\nasymptotic sampling distribution and, therefore, the power function is\navailable in analytic form. Bayesian methods have gained popularity in all\nstages of discovery, namely, design, analysis and decision making. Bayesian\ndecision procedures rely on posterior summaries whose sampling distributions\nare commonly estimated via Monte Carlo simulations. In the design of scientific\nstudies, the Bayesian approach incorporates uncertainty about the design\nvalue(s) instead of conditioning on a single value of the model parameter(s).\nAccounting for uncertainties in the design value(s) is particularly critical\nwhen the model includes nuisance parameters. In this manuscript, we propose\nmethodology that utilizes the large-sample properties of the posterior\ndistribution together with Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to\nefficiently obtain the optimal sample size and decision criteria in fixed and\nadaptive designs.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the notion of control closure certificates to\nsynthesize controllers for discrete-time control systems against\n$\\omega$-regular specifications. Typical functional approaches to synthesize\ncontrollers against $\\omega$-regular specifications rely on combining inductive\ninvariants (for example, via barrier certificates) with proofs of\nwell-foundedness (for example, via ranking functions). Transition invariants,\nprovide an alternative where instead of standard well-foundedness arguments one\nmay instead search for disjunctive well-foundedness arguments that together\nensure a well-foundedness argument. Closure certificates, functional analogs of\ntransition invariants, provide an effective, automated approach to verify\ndiscrete-time dynamical systems against linear temporal logic and\n$\\omega$-regular specifications. We build on this notion to synthesize\ncontrollers to ensure the satisfaction of $\\omega$-regular specifications. To\ndo so, we first illustrate how one may construct control closure certificates\nto visit a region infinitely often (or only finitely often) via disjunctive\nwell-founded arguments. We then combine these arguments to provide an argument\nfor parity specifications. Thus, finding an appropriate control closure\ncertificate over the product of the system and a parity automaton specifying a\ndesired $\\omega$-regular specification ensures that there exists a controller\n$\\kappa$ to enforce the $\\omega$-regular specification. We propose a\nsum-of-squares optimization approach to synthesize such certificates and\ndemonstrate their efficacy in designing controllers over some case studies.",

We\npresent Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a\nsingle expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel\nobject geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train\nclosed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and\ngeneralize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior\nwork using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert\ndemonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those\nworks, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as\nkeypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must\ntrack a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To\ngenerate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for\neach task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its\nassociated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint\nconfigurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the\ntransformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to\nthe first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and\nfour real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and\ntight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve\nan average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves\nan average of 50%.",

Five of\nthese topologies imply that singularly perturbed trajectory includes a segment\n(or segments) of sliding, and one topology, which we study here, implies the\nevolution characterised by switchings between trajectory segments along the\nswitching surface, but without any sliding. In particular, we show that in the\ncase of $n$-dimensional Filippov systems with one switching surface and\n$m$-dimensional fast dynamics, which plays the role of a stable singular\nperturbation, the flow follows sliding motion of the reduced system, but the\nperturbation becomes time dependent and may create a micro chaotic behaviour.\nHowever, a significant change in the flow direction is not possible.

While Connectionist Temporal Classification\n(CTC) is a widely used approach for such tasks due to its efficiency, it often\nfalls short in recognition performance, especially under unclear and nonfluent\nspeech. In this work, we propose LCS-CTC, a two-stage framework for\nphoneme-level speech recognition that combines a similarity-aware local\nalignment algorithm with a constrained CTC training objective. By predicting\nfine-grained frame-phoneme cost matrices and applying a modified Longest Common\nSubsequence (LCS) algorithm, our method identifies high-confidence alignment\nzones which are used to constrain the CTC decoding path space, thereby reducing\noverfitting and improving generalization ability, which enables both robust\nrecognition and text-free forced alignment.

    "abstract": "Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as\nintentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)\nis commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended\nquestions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a\nnegative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions\nprovide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require\ntime-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether\nlarge language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We\nused a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain\ninjury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their\nopen-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these\nresponses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested\nthe fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed\nthat model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions\nof hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher\nalignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and\naccidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group\ndifferences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI\nand HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent\nnonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible\nscoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options.

In quantum phononics,\nmechanical resonators at these frequencies can remain in their quantum ground\nstate even at kelvin temperatures, obviating the need for millikelvin cooling\ntypically required for GHz resonators. However, electrical actuation and\ndetection of mechanical motion at such high frequencies present significant\nchallenges, primarily due to the need for device miniaturization to support\nacoustic waves with nanometer-scale wavelengths. One effective strategy is to\naggressively thin down piezoelectric thin films, ideally to a thickness on the\norder of the acoustic wavelength, which is in the tens of nanometers. In this\nwork, we aggressively reduce the thickness of lithium niobate from 300 nm to 67\nnm through several stages, and fabricate suspended Lamb-wave resonators at each\nthickness level. These resonators achieve resonant frequencies as high as 220\nGHz, doubling the previous record and approaching the terahertz frequency\nthreshold.

The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are\ncentral to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject\nclassifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which\ncreates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary\ncomplexity to be ``solved\", using a novel interpretation of causal\napproximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes\nof operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal\nhomotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this\npaper, every causal diagram has a ``solution\" in the form of a (co)limit: this\nimplies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated\" by some global\nfunction with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.\nNatural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.\nIn addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject\nclassifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.\nExponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal\nequivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an\ninternal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated\nKripke-Joyal semantics.

The packed representation\nof a string of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\\sigma$ is given as a\nsequence of $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ machine words in the word-RAM model (a machine\nword consists of $\\omega \\ge \\log_2 n$ bits).

We use the techniques for\nextracting squares from runs described by Crochemore et al.

The\nlong-period runs with a string period that is periodic itself (called layer\nruns) are an obstacle, since their number can be $\\Omega(n)$. The number of all\nother long-period runs is $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ and we can construct an implicit\nrepresentation of all long-period runs in $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ time by\nleveraging the insights of Amir et al. [ESA 2019]. We count squares in layer\nruns by exploiting combinatorial properties of pyramidally-shaped groups of\nlayer runs. Another difficulty lies in computing the locations of Lyndon roots\nof runs in packed strings, which is needed for grouping runs that may generate\nequal squares. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce sparse-Lyndon roots\nwhich are based on string synchronizers [Kempa and Kociumaka, STOC 2019].",

    "abstract": "Arrays of hybrid metal-semiconductor islands offer a new approach to quantum\nsimulation, with key advantages over arrays of conventional quantum dots.\nBecause the metallic component of these hybrid islands has a quasi-continuous\nlevel spectrum, each site in an array can be effectively electronically\nidentical; in contrast, each conventional semiconductor quantum dot has its own\nspectral fingerprint. Meanwhile, the semiconductor component retains\ngate-tunability of intersite coupling. This combination creates a scalable\nplatform for simulating correlated ground states driven by Coulomb\ninteractions. We report the fabrication and characterization of hybrid\nmetal-semiconductor islands, featuring a submicron metallic component\ntransparently contacting a gate-confined region of an InAs quantum well with\ntunable couplings to macroscopic leads. Tuning to the weak-coupling limit forms\na single-electron transistor with highly-uniform Coulomb peaks, with no\nresolvable excitation spectrum in the Coulomb diamonds. Upon increasing the\ntransmissions toward the ballistic regime we observe an evolution to dynamical\nCoulomb blockade.",

We propose a combined manifold and machine\nlearning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent\ncrowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical\nresults demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus\nallowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from\nagent-based simulations.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is\nchallenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor\ngeneralization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering\ncontrollable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample\ndiversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically\nrequiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided\nFine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion\ntransfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional\ncomputational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the\ntraining loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the\nfine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation\nthat during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger\nmarginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable\nfidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength\nvalue as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning\nmechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the\nguidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies,\ni.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training\nstability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target\ndomains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer\nlearning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling\nTFLOPS.",

Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of\ntransfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets\nand find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail\noff as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off\nin performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good\njob of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points\ntowards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when\nthese less useful points are eventually added.

However, the chemistry and evolution of C$_2$H within\nyounger (Class 0/I) protostars remains much more poorly understood. Here, using\ndata observed as part of the PEACHES survey along with new ALMA ACA\nobservations, we investigate the C$_2$H emission towards an unbiased sample of\n35 Class 0/I low-mass protostars in Perseus. With this large sample, we\nidentify a clear association between C$_2$H emission and the protostellar\noutflow cavity walls, and a consistent spatial anti-correlation between C$_2$H\nand SO emission. Together, these trends confirm that C$_2$H is tracing\nphotochemically active, O-poor gas in these younger sources. We fitted the\nC$_2$H spectra with a simple LTE model to yield column density maps, and find\nvalues ranging from 10$^{14}$ -- 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ in these sources. We also\nlooked for trends in the C$_2$H emission morphology as a function of various\nprotostellar evolutionary metrics, but find no clear patterns: the C$_2$H\nemission remains spatially extended in most sources, independent of age. This\nindicates that the transition to the compact C$_2$H emission observed on the\nsurface of Class II disks must happen rapidly, sometime just after the embedded\nstage.",

    "abstract": "One of the most promising paths towards large scale fault tolerant quantum\ncomputation is the use of quantum error correcting stabilizer codes. Just like\nevery other quantum circuit, these codes must be compiled to hardware in a way\nto minimize the total physical error introduced into the system, for example\neither due to high latency execution or excessive gates to meet connectivity\nlimitations of the target hardware. However, unlike arbitrary quantum circuits,\nall syndrome extraction circuits have several common properties, for example\nthey have a bipartite connectivity graph, consist only of commuting\nsubcircuits, among other properties. For the most part, compilation methods\nhave aimed at being generic, able to map any input circuit into executables on\nthe hardware, and therefore cannot appropriately exploit these properties and\nresult in executables which have higher physical error. In the case of modular\ntrapped ion systems, specifically QCCDs, this corresponds to the insertion of\nexcessive shuttling operations necessary to realize arbitrary qubit\ninteractions. We propose a compilation scheme explicitly tailored for the\nstructural regularity of QEC circuits based on several key observations: 1.\nonly ancilla or data (but not both) should be shuttled, 2. stabilizers can be\nexecuted in any order meaning we can dynamically modify circuit execution on a\nper-cycle basis 3. ancilla are indistinguishable meaning any can be selected to\nbegin a stabilizer measurement and retain a fixed-point mapping between cycles,\nand 4. QCCD hardware limits the number of parallel operations equal to the\nnumber traps in the system, meaning fewer ancilla are necessary and can be\nreused. Our resulting compiler, leads to QEC circuits which are on average\n3.38x faster to execute, and lead to up to two orders of magnitude of\nimprovement in logical error rates with realistic physical error rates.",

This\ninterpretation remains questionable given the observed broad wings in forbidden\n[O III] emission. Based on spectroscopic properties derived from our KCWI/KCRM\nintegral-field observation of super star clusters 1 and 2 (SSCs 1$\\&$2), we\npropose instead that these BH signatures originate from a luminous blue\nvariable (LBV) outburst in a binary system like $\\eta$ Carinae. First, the [Fe\nII] emission-line ratio and detected O I 8446 pumped emission require\nhigh-density gas ($n_e \\sim 10^6$ $\\rm{cm^{-3}}$). This dense gas resides in\nthe circumstellar medium (CSM) formed by pre-outburst stellar winds. Subsequent\nshock interaction between the LBV outburst ejecta and CSM efficiently produces\nwarm dust and the corresponding NIR excess. Second, SSCs 1$\\&$2 are\nnitrogen-enriched relative to other SSCs. This enrichment arises from ejections\nof CNO-cycled material by multiple LBV outbursts. Third, we detect asymmetric\nbroad H$\\alpha$ wings extending from $\\sim -5\\,000$ to $\\sim 10\\,000\\\n\\rm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. This asymmetry results from electron scattering in the\nexpanding, optically thick CSM. The proposed CSM shock interaction naturally\nexplains the luminosities of [Fe V] and ultra-luminous X-ray emission.\nContrarily, [Fe II] and [Fe IV] emission originates primarily from gas\nphotoionized by the cool primary LBV and hot secondary stars, respectively. Our\nresults highlight how the shock interaction of massive stars with high-density\nCSM mimics active massive BH signatures in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies.",

The primary\nfocus of this work, however, is the derivation of the de Broglie relation\ndirectly from the principles of special relativity, employing the four-momentum\nformalism.

Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains\nlimited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing\nchallenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address\nthis, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that\nexplains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing\npredictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint\ncross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly\nparameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and\nfeature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures\nexplanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable\nmeaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between\nnetworks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA\nexplanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics\ntailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and\nefficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA\nmodels.",

Zak-OTFS carriers are quasi-periodic pulses in the delay-Doppler (DD)\ndomain, characterized by two parameters, (i) the pulse period along the delay\naxis (``delay period\") (Doppler period is related to the delay period), and\n(ii) the pulse shaping filter.

However, social interactions have two key\ncharacteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,\nwhere utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit\nassignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as\nrapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal\nachievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL\nwith single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines\ncoarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.\nUtterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by\nattributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards\ncapture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.\nExperiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate\nthat Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17\non Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing\napproaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level\ncredit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training.

A new action is found that\nreduces to Sen's action in a certain limit and gives the same results as Sen's\ntheory for physical superstring amplitudes. However, the new theory is\nbackground independent: there is a shift symmetry so that a change in the\nbackground can be compensated for by a corresponding shift in the string\nfields. Sen's theory has two string fields leading to the physical interacting\nsuperstring plus a free superstring that decouples from the physical\nsuperstring. The new terms in the action give self-interactions to the second\nsuperstring which remains decoupled from the physical superstring. The two\nsuperstrings each have a graviton and the effective action for the two\ngravitons coupled to a background metric is studied and shown to be background\nindependent and diffeomorphism invariant, and the origin of further\ndiffeomorphism-like symmetries is explained.",

    "abstract": "Core-periphery (CP) structure is an important meso-scale network property\nwhere nodes group into a small, densely interconnected {core} and a sparse\n{periphery} whose members primarily connect to the core rather than to each\nother. While this structure has been observed in numerous real-world networks,\nthere has been minimal statistical formalization of it. In this work, we\ndevelop a statistical framework for CP structures by introducing a\nmodel-agnostic and generalizable population parameter which quantifies the\nstrength of a CP structure at the level of the data-generating mechanism. We\nstudy this parameter under four canonical random graph models and establish\ntheoretical guarantees for label recovery, including exact label recovery.\nNext, we construct intersection tests for validating the presence and strength\nof a CP structure under multiple null models, and prove theoretical guarantees\nfor type I error and power. These tests provide a formal distinction between\nexogenous (or induced) and endogenous (or intrinsic) CP structure in\nheterogeneous networks, enabling a level of structural resolution that goes\nbeyond merely detecting the presence of CP structure. The proposed methods show\nexcellent performance on synthetic data, and our applications demonstrate that\nstatistically significant CP structure is somewhat rare in real-world networks.",

    "abstract": "The main motivation of this work is the quantitative prediction and\ndescription of particle manipulation (displacement across streamlines) in\nmicrofluidic flow. Much attention has been paid recently to placing particles\nin fast oscillatory flow fields, usually driven by microbubbles actuated by\nlow-frequency ultrasound, where particle inertia leads to deterministic\ndisplacements. However, such devices invariably set up simultaneous streaming\nflows that are interpretable as driven Stokes flows. The potential role of\nthese flows in not just passively transporting but likewise manipulating the\nparticles has not been appreciated. Therefore, we investigate whether a Stokes\nflow by itself can meaningfully affect the displacement of a single particle or\na rigid dumbbell, given the properties and symmetries of the flow. To\nmanipulate a single particle, its hydrodynamic interaction with a nearby\nboundary is crucial for obtaining non-trivial results. To irreversibly displace\na particle using this effect, we find that the flow symmetry must be broken in\nspecified ways. Controlling the flow geometry, one can drive particles to fixed\npoints, cycles, or towards boundaries, with the possibility of controlling\neventual attachment (sticking) of the particle. For rigid dumbbell particles,\nwe show that such controlled displacement in Stokes flow is possible even\nwithout the presence of nearby boundaries, but again with requirements on the\nbroken symmetry of the chosen flow. In practical microfluidic devices, these\neffects could be set up in manifold ways, by themselves or in combination with\ninertial forces for more versatile particle manipulation.",

The thin outer envelope convection zone\nwas implemented through modification of the opacity model, shifting the Fe\nopacity bump inward and enhancing its amplitude to ensure computational\nfeasibility. The luminosity power spectrum from our primary simulation (M424)\nexhibits qualitative and quantitative characteristics similar to observed SLF\nvariability, with a two-order-of-magnitude difference between high and low\nfrequencies matching observational data. The spectrum displays distinct\nfeatures attributable to internal gravity waves (IGWs) evanescent in the thin\nouter envelope convection zone, originating from the thin outer envelope\nconvective boundary. To isolate the contributions of different stellar regions,\nwe performed controlled numerical experiments with suppressed core convection,\nenvelope convection and thin outer envelope-only configurations. The\ncomparative analysis demonstrates that thin outer envelope convection alone\nproduces significantly less power at low frequencies than the full-star\nconfiguration. Our results indicate that IGWs excited at the thin outer\nenvelope convection inner boundary and interacting with the thin outer envelope\nconvection are the dominant contributors to SLF variability in our simulations.\nThe IGW spectral characteristics depend on the complete stellar stratification,\ndemonstrating that interior structure could influence observable surface\nvariability.",

For the comparison between TDE and AGN X-ray variability, we\ncross-match the publicly available XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT point source\ncatalogs with the Million Quasars Catalog and optically selected TDEs.

    "abstract": "We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures\n(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like\": a topos has\nall (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous\ntheoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal\nsequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all\ncontinuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings\nof tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures\nfor LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as\nfunctions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have\nfocused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this\npaper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM\narchitectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,\nthese new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM\ncategories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential\nobjects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new\ncompositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,\nmeaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on\nthis completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,\na ``set-like\" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential\nobjects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization\nof backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos\narchitecture.",

We analyzed a gold\nstandard dataset of 4,495 app reviews enriched with metadata (e.g., app\nversion, ratings, age restriction, in-app purchases). Correlation analyses\nidentified mostly weak associations between app properties and explanation\nneeds, with moderate correlations only for specific features such as app\nversion, number of reviews, and star ratings.

    "abstract": "Malware and cheat developers use fileless execution techniques to evade\ntraditional, signature-based security products. These methods include various\ntypes of manual mapping, module stomping, and threadless injection which work\nentirely within the address space of a legitimate process, presenting a\nchallenge for detection due to ambiguity between what is legitimate and what\nisn't. Existing tools often have weaknesses, such as a dependency on Portable\nExecutable (PE) structures or a vulnerability to time-of-check-to-time-of-use\n(TOCTOU) race conditions where an adversary cleans up before a periodic scan\nhas the chance to occur. To address this gap, we present RX-INT, a\nkernel-assisted system featuring an architecture that provides resilience\nagainst TOCTOU attacks. RX-INT introduces a detection engine that combines a\nreal-time thread creation monitor with a stateful Virtual Address Descriptor\n(VAD) scanner alongside various heuristics within. This engine snapshots both\nprivate and image-backed memory regions, using real-time memory hashing to\ndetect illicit modifications like module stomping. Critically, we demonstrate a\nhigher detection rate in certain benchmarks of this approach through a direct\ncomparison with PE-sieve, a commonly used and powerful memory forensics tool.\nIn our evaluation, RX-INT successfully detected a manually mapped region that\nwas not identified by PE-sieve. We then conclude that our architecture\nrepresents a tangible difference in the detection of fileless threats, with\ndirect applications in the fields of anti-cheat and memory security.",

The core of our method is a\nconstrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state\nfeatures, enabling safe policy learning under clinical and resource\nconstraints. The framework incorporates biologically realistic factors,\nincluding insulin decay, leading to policies that better reflect real-world\ntherapeutic behaviour.

    "abstract": "As engineering advances toward the nanoscale, understanding design principles\nfor molecular motors becomes increasingly valuable. Many molecular motors\nconsist of coupled components transducing one free-energy source into another.\nHere, we study the performance of coupled rotary molecular motors with\ndifferent rotational symmetries under constant and scaling driving forces.\nUnder constant driving and strong coupling, symmetry match between the motors\ndecreases the output power. In contrast, under a scaling driving force, the\noutput power is not sensitive to symmetries. However, driving the upstream\nmotor too strongly reduces the downstream motor's output power, leading to a\nperhaps counterintuitive phenomenon we term disruption, in which the two motors\nbecome disconnected. Across both driving schemes, output power peaks at\nintermediate coupling, confirming the value of flexible coupling. Beyond\nproviding insights into biological motors, these findings could inform the\nfuture design of synthetic nanomotors and structure-based drugs.",

Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as\ndedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this\nparadigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,\nand (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,\nsystem-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents\nfurther raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nEvo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that\nenables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than\nrelying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to\nsimultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,\nensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.\nFurthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing\nreinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial\ntraining paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS\nperformance under co-evolving threats.

This likely leads to a layer in which overturning\nconvection is inhibited due to a stabilizing compositional gradient. The\npresence of such a stably stratified layer impacts the location and mechanism\nof convectively-driven dynamo action. Juno's measurements of Jupiter's magnetic\nfield enabled an estimate of its dynamo radius based on the magnetic Lowes\nspectrum. A depth of ~0.8R_J is obtained, where 1R_J is Jupiter's radius. This\nis rather deep, considering that the electrical conductivity inside Jupiter is\nexpected to reach significant values at ~0.9R_J. Here we use 3-dimensional\nnumerical dynamo simulations to explore the effects of the existence and\nlocation of a stably stratified helium rain layer on both the inferred Lowes\nradius and location of the radial extent of dynamo action. We focus on a\nJupiter-like internal structure and electrical conductivity profile. We find\nthat for shallower stable layers, there is no magnetic field generation\noccurring above the stable layer and the effective dynamo radius and the\ninferred Lowes radius is at the base of the layer. For deeper stable layers,\nLowes radii of ~0.87R_J are inferred as a shallow secondary dynamo operates\nabove the stable layer. Our results strongly suggest the existence of a stable\nlayer extending from ~0.8R_J up to at least ~0.9R_J inside Jupiter.

However, as training\nsystems expand with massive GPUs, the traditional fully parallelism strategies\nfor embedding table post significant scalability challenges, including\nimbalance and straggler issues, intensive lookup communication, and heavy\nembedding activation memory. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\ntwo-dimensional sparse parallelism approach. Rather than fully sharding tables\nacross all GPUs, our solution introduces data parallelism on top of model\nparallelism. This enables efficient all-to-all communication and reduces peak\nmemory consumption. Additionally, we have developed the momentum-scaled\nrow-wise AdaGrad algorithm to mitigate performance losses associated with the\nshift in training paradigms. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed approach significantly enhances training efficiency while maintaining\nmodel performance parity. It achieves nearly linear training speed scaling up\nto 4K GPUs, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for recommendation model\ntraining.",

This leads to a confirmation of the weak isomorphic reverse\nisoperimetry conjecture for $X$, namely, we demonstrate that there exists a\nconvex body $L=L_X\\subset B_X$ such that $\\mathrm{vol}_{n^2}(L)^{1/n^2}\\asymp\n\\mathrm{vol}_{n^2}(B_{X})^{1/n^2}$, yet its isoperimetric quotient is at most a\nuniversal constant multiple of $n$.

Most importantly,\nA11yShape employs a cross-representation highlighting mechanism to synchronize\nsemantic selections across all model representations -- code, semantic\nhierarchy, AI description, and 3-D rendering. We conducted a multi-session user\nstudy with four BLV programmers, where, after an initial tutorial session,\nparticipants independently completed 12 distinct models across two testing\nsessions, achieving results that aligned with their own satisfaction.

Like several\nother surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an\nencoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional\nlatent space, $\\bm\\mu_{\\bm\\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is\nused to map $\\bm\\mu_{\\bm\\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\\bm\\mu_{\\bm\\phi_h}$, of\nthe PDE solution $h(\\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct\n$h(\\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its\nthree components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease\nin both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading\noperator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is\nachieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE)\nfor $y(\\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\\bm{x},t)$ VAE.

Their evaluation with 22 applications from state-of-the-art benchmark\nsuites shows intermediate performance relative to gem5 Ruby's MI and MOESI\nmodels. The hybrid gem5-Verilator co-simulation flow incurs a moderate\nsimulation overhead, up to 2.7 times compared to gem5 MI, but achieves higher\nfidelity by simulating real RTL hardware.

While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in\nbandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved\nsimultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit\nalgorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas\nfairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes\ninequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound\n(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures\n$\\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,\nmatching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is\nsufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential\nprivacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time\nhorizon.

    "abstract": "A vast number of software systems include components that parse and process\nstructured input. In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by\ncompilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process\nstandardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such\ncomponents were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such\nas a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of\nsoftware evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs\nthey actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to\nreconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches\nalready produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is\navailable to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this\ncompleteness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during\nthe operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for\ngrammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs\nbut not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software\ncomponent. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no\nlonger appear in the available input data are missing from the generated\ngrammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for\nthe automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input\ngenerators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether\nthey are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid,\nthis work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach\nleverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms\nto overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First,\nthe search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with\na single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is\nstructured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of\ninputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a\ndiverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature.\nResults demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for\nextracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners\nsuch as Mimid. Notably, it successfully uncovers subtle features and edge cases\nin parsers that are typically missed by such grammar miners. The effectiveness\nof the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve\nhigh performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This\ncontribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software\nengineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar\nmining. By eliminating the need for manual input generation, the approach not\nonly reduces workload but also enhances the robustness and comprehensiveness of\nthe extracted grammars. Following this approach, software engineers can\nreconstruct specification from existing (legacy) parsers.",

    "abstract": "**Context:** The design of static type systems that can validate\ndynamically-typed programs (**gradually**) is an ongoing challenge. A key\ndifficulty is that dynamic code rarely follows datatype-driven design. Programs\ninstead use runtime tests to narrow down the proper usage of incoming data.\nType systems for dynamic languages thus need a **type narrowing** mechanism\nthat refines the type environment along individual control paths based on\ndominating tests, a form of flow-sensitive typing. In order to express\nrefinements, the type system must have some notion of sets and subsets. Since\nset-theoretic types are computationally and ergonomically complex, the need for\ntype narrowing raises design questions about how to balance precision and\nperformance. **Inquiry:** To date, the design of type narrowing systems has\nbeen driven by intuition, past experience, and examples from users in various\nlanguage communities. There is no standard that captures desirable and\nundesirable behaviors. Prior formalizations of narrowing are also significantly\nmore complex than a standard type system, and it is unclear how the extra\ncomplexity pays off in terms of concrete examples. This paper addresses the\nproblems through If-T, a language-agnostic **design benchmark** for type\nnarrowing that characterizes the abilities of implementations using simple\nprograms that draw attention to fundamental questions. Unlike a traditional\nperformance-focused benchmark, If-T measures a narrowing system's ability to\nvalidate correct code and reject incorrect code. Unlike a test suite, systems\nare not required to fully conform to If-T. Deviations are acceptable provided\nthey are justified by well-reasoned design considerations, such as compile-time\nperformance. **Approach:** If-T is guided by the literature on type narrowing,\nthe documentation of gradual languages such as TypeScript, and experiments with\ntypechecker implementations. We have identified a set of core technical\ndimensions for type narrowing. For each dimension, the benchmark contains a set\nof topics and (at least) two characterizing programs per topic: one that should\ntypecheck and one that should not typecheck. **Knowledge:** If-T provides a\nbaseline to measure type narrowing systems. For researchers, it provides\ncriteria to categorize future designs via its collection of positive and\nnegative examples. For language designers, the benchmark demonstrates the\npayoff of typechecker complexity in terms of concrete examples. Designers can\nuse the examples to decide whether supporting a particular example is\nworthwhile. Both the benchmark and its implementations are freely available\nonline. **Grounding:** We have implemented the benchmark for five typecheckers:\nTypeScript, Flow, Typed Racket, mypy, and Pyright. The results highlight\nimportant differences, such as the ability to track logical implications among\nprogram variables and typechecking for user-defined narrowing predicates.\n**Importance:** Type narrowing is essential for gradual type systems, but the\ntradeoffs between systems with different complexity have been unclear. If-T\nclarifies these tradeoffs by illustrating the benefits and limitations of each\nlevel of complexity. With If-T as a way to assess implementations in a fair,\ncross-language manner, future type system designs can strive for a better\nbalance among precision, annotation burden, and performance.",

    "abstract": "The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world\napplications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating\nharmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the\nmessage into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically\ndecode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text\nand improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs\ndemonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and\ntext generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.",

Existing\ninverse game-theoretic approaches frame this challenge in terms of a \"level-1\"\ninference problem, in which we take the perspective of a third-party observer\nand assume that individual agents share complete knowledge of one another's\nobjectives. However, this assumption breaks down in decentralized, real-world\ndecision scenarios like urban driving and bargaining, in which agents may act\nbased on conflicting views of one another's objectives. We demonstrate the\nnecessity of inferring agents' heterogeneous estimates of each other's\nobjectives through empirical examples, and by theoretically characterizing the\nprediction error of level-1 inference on fictitious gameplay data from\nlinear-quadratic games. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a\nframework for level-2 inference to address the question: \"What does each agent\nbelieve about all agents' objectives?\" We prove that the level-2 inference\nproblem is non-convex even in benign settings like linear-quadratic games, and\nwe develop an efficient gradient-based approach for identifying local\nsolutions. Experiments on a synthetic urban driving example show that our\napproach uncovers nuanced misalignments that level-1 methods miss.",

    "abstract": "We consider the extraction of parameters of dark matter halos hosting\nultra-faint dwarf galaxies, in the case where there are only ${\\cal O}(10)$\nidentified member stars with measured line-of-sight velocities. This scenario\nis likely to be increasingly common, as upcoming newly discovered dwarf\ngalaxies in the Milky Way, by e.g. the Rubin Observatory, will likely (at least\ninitially) have only a few identified members. Assuming an NFW dark matter\nprofile, equilibrium modeling likely can only robustly extract one halo\nparameter ($\\rho_s r_s$), but the scale radius itself will typically be\nunconstrained. In these cases, the results obtainable from Jeans modeling can\nbe well replicated by a simple scaling relation motivated by the half-light\nmass estimator. As a application, we examine the recently discovered stellar\nsystem Ursa Major III, which has been optimistically assessed to have the\nlargest $J$-factor of any known object. We suggest that, because of the\npresence of outlier stars, the $J$-factor obtained from modeling of Ursa Major\nIII is likely inflated, as it is inconsistent with the half-light mass\nestimator, while removal of the outliers will leave the $J$-factor\nunconstrained from below.",

By analogy with topological insulators\nand superconductors, we map the Lindblad generator to a first-quantized\nnon-Hermitian matrix representation that plays the role of a band Hamiltonian.\nEdge modes of this matrix with vanishing real part are exactly\ndissipation-free. We show that this matrix is always adiabatically deformable,\nthrough a symmetry-preserving path, to a topologically trivial Hermitian\nmatrix. Hence no symmetry-protected, dissipation-free edge modes exist in\nquadratic open fermions. Our results apply to generic quadratic fermionic\nLindbladians and require only a gapped bulk and a bounded spectrum. They\nestablish a clear boundary for robust topological phenomena in open fermionic\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for\nadapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model\nsizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) (arXiv:2106.09685) stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity,\nexpressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive\nempirical studies demonstrate LoRA's practical utility, theoretical\nunderstanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA\n(arXiv:2410.08305) took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work,\nwe introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and\nextends existing LoRA approaches. Our method introduces a probabilistic\nBernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach\nencompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while\nmaintaining theoretical tractability. Under standard assumptions from\nnon-convex optimization literature, we analyze several variants of our\nframework: Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE,\nBernoulli-LoRA-MVR, Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA, and\nBernoulli-LoRA-EF21, establishing convergence guarantees for each variant.\nAdditionally, we extend our analysis to convex non-smooth functions, providing\nconvergence rates for both constant and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes.\nThrough extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical\nfindings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach. This work is a\nstep toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Indirect searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles with mass in the MeV -- GeV\nscale have received significant attention lately. Pair-annihilations of such DM\nparticles in the Galaxy can give rise to (at the same time) MeV to GeV\n$\\gamma$-rays via prompt emission, sub-GeV $e^\\pm$ in cosmic-rays, as well as a\nbroad photon spectrum ranging from $X$-rays to soft $\\gamma$-rays, produced by\nthe DM induced $e^\\pm$ via inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung and\nin-flight annihilation processes (collectively called `secondary emissions').\nWe focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the\nvector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a\ndetailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing $X$-rays,\n$\\gamma$-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned\nsignals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon\ntelescope COSI, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission\nsignals. We compare our results with the constraints and (or) projections from\ncosmological and terrestrial observations. We find that, for both the sub-GeV\nDM models, the current observations constrain the annihilation cross-section at\nthe level of $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle \\lesssim 10^{-27} {\\rm cm}^3/{\\rm s}$,\nor lower for some specific mass ranges or under optimistic assumptions.\nMoreover, new unconstrained DM parameter space can be probed at the upcoming\ninstruments like COSI, thanks to the inclusion of secondary photons which in\nmany cases provide the dominant signal.",

    "abstract": "Double-lobed radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs)\nare typically found in elliptical galaxies, while supermassive black holes\n(SMBHs) in disk galaxies rarely produce powerful kpc-scale jets. However, the\ngrowing number of spiral- and disk-hosted DRAGNs challenges this classical\ndichotomy. We present a study of the jet collimation profile for one such\nsource, 0313-192, using VLBA and VLA data, tracing the jet morphology across\nnearly five orders of magnitude in scale -- from $\\sim$ pc to $\\sim100$ kpc\n(projected). We find that the jet exhibits a parabolic expansion up to $\\sim\n610$ pc ($\\sim 7.9 \\times 10^6$ Schwarzschild radii), followed by a transition\nto a nearly conical shape, assuming kpc-scale emission primarily originates\nfrom the jet rather than the lobe. This structural evolution closely resembles\nthose in AGNs hosted by elliptical galaxies and provides an explanation for how\nthe jet in this system could extend to large distances by magnetohydrodynamic\ncollimation and acceleration. However, this collimation break occurs beyond the\nsphere of gravitational influence of the SMBH ($\\sim7.3\\times10^{5} R_{S}$),\nand no extended X-ray halos or dense molecular gas structures are detected to\nprovide the necessary external pressure. Therefore we suggest that jet\nconfinement in 0313-192 is mediated by contributions from non-thermal\ncomponents, such as ram and magnetic pressure from magnetized disk winds. These\nmechanisms may enable jet collimation even in the absence of dense ambient gas.\nOur results highlight how large-scale jets can arise in disk galaxies under\nrare conditions and demonstrate the need to broaden studies of AGN jet\nformation beyond traditional models.",

A SETH-based lower-bound\nestablished by Abboud et al.

In this study, our objective is to\ninvestigate the empirical chi_eff distribution (and constrain individual spin\ncomponents) of binary BH mergers and compare them with extensive simulations,\nassuming that they originate purely from isolated binaries or a mixture of\nformation channels. We explore scenarios using BH kicks with and without the\neffect of spin-axis tossing during BH formation.

The\nsynthetic chi_eff distribution is compared to the empirical data from LVK\nscience runs O1-O3 using functional data analysis, kernel density estimations,\nand three different statistical tests, accounting for data uncertainties. We\nfind strong indications for spin-axis tossing during BH formation if LVK\nsources are dominated by the isolated binary channel. Simulations with\nspin-axis tossing achieve high p-values (up to 0.882) using Kolmogorov-Smirnov,\nCramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests, while without tossing, all\np-values drop below 0.001 for isolated binaries. A statistically acceptable\nsolution without tossing, however, emerges if ~72+/-8% of detected binary BH\nmergers result from dynamical interactions causing random BH spin directions.\nFinally, for an isolated binary origin, we find a preference for mass reversal\nin ~30% of the progenitor binaries. Predictions from this study can be tested\nwith LVK O4+O5 data as well as the 3G detectors, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic\nExplorer, enabling improved constraints on formation channel ratios and the\ncritical question of BH spin-axis tossing.",

The\noff-nuclear TDE 2024tvd exhibits double-peaked radio light curves and the\nfastest evolving radio emission observed from a TDE to date. With respect to\nthe optical discovery date, the first radio flare rises faster than $F_{\\rm\n\\nu} \\sim t^{9}$ at $\\Delta t = 88-131$ days, and then decays as fast as\n$F_{\\rm \\nu} \\sim t^{-6}$.

We\ninterpret these observations in the context of a self-absorbed and free-free\nabsorbed synchrotron spectrum, while accounting for both synchrotron and\nexternal inverse-Compton cooling. We find that a single prompt outflow cannot\neasily explain these observations and it is likely that either there is only\none outflow that was launched at $\\Delta t \\sim 80$ days, or two distinct\noutflows, with the second launched at $\\Delta t \\sim 170-190$ days. The nature\nof these outflows, whether sub-, mildly-, or ultra-relativistic, is still\nunclear, and we explore these different scenarios. Finally, we find a temporal\ncoincidence between the launch time of the first radio-emitting outflow and the\nonset of a power-law component in the X-ray spectrum, attributed to\ninverse-Compton scattering of thermal photons.",

In particular, some specific models predict those with a blue-tilted\nspectrum, which is consistent with the constraints from cosmic microwave\nbackground such as Planck, although isocurvature fluctuations with an almost\nscale-invariant spectrum are severely constrained. We argue that cold dark\nmatter (CDM) isocurvature fluctuations with blue-tilted spectrum are not only\nconsistent with current cosmological data, but also can loosen the bound on the\nmasses of warm dark matter (WDM), which suppresses small-scale power. In pure\nthermal WDM models with the adiabatic initial condition, a combination of the\ndata from Lyman-$\\alpha$, gravitational lensing, and Milky Way satellites gives\na lower bound on the WDM mass as $6~{\\rm keV}$ at $95\\%$ C.L. while mixed\nWDM+CDM models loosen these bounds to $m_{\\rm WDM}\\sim1$ keV for a\nwarm-fraction $f_{\\rm WDM}\\lesssim0.14$ and $m_{\\rm WDM}\\sim600$ eV for $f_{\\rm\nWDM}\\lesssim0.08$. On the other hand, as we demonstrate, WDM scenarios with a\nblue-tilted CDM isocurvature power spectrum, even with only $1\\%$ CDM\ncontribution ($f_{\\rm WDM}\\sim0.99$), can allow WDM masses as low as $600$ eV.\nWe further assess the implications of this ``warm + cold-isocurvature''\nextension for the small-scale structure by performing $N$-body simulations,\nparticularly focusing on nonlinear matter power spectrum and halo mass\nfunction.",

Traditionally examples of non-thermalizing systems are\neither integrable, or disordered. Recently, examples of\ntranslationally-invariant physical systems have been discovered whose excited\nenergies avoid thermalization either due to local constraints (whether exact or\nemergent), or due to higher-form symmetries. In this article, we extend these\ninvestigations for the case of 3D $U(1)$ quantum dimer models, which are\nlattice gauge theories with finite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces (also\ngenerically called quantum link models) with staggered charged static matter.\nUsing a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we uncover a class of\nathermal states that arise in large winding sectors, when the system is\nsubjected to external electric fields. The polarization of the dynamical fluxes\nin the direction of applied field traps excitations in 2D planes, while an\ninterplay with the Gauss Law constraint in the perpendicular direction causes\nexotic athermal behaviour due to the emergence of new conserved quantities.\nThis causes a geometric fragmentation of the system. We provide analytical\narguments showing that the scaling of the number of fragments is exponential in\nthe linear system size, leading to weak fragmentation. Further, we identify\nsectors which host fractonic excitations with severe mobility restrictions.

It builds on the\nHot New Early Dark Energy (Hot NEDE) setup, featuring a dark $SU(N)$ gauge\nsymmetry broken to $SU(N-1)$ in a supercooled phase transition that creates a\nthermal bath of self-interacting dark radiation in the epoch between Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis and recombination. Adding a fermion multiplet charged under the\ngauge symmetry provides a naturally stable component of dark matter that\ninteracts with dark radiation. Spontaneous symmetry breaking predicts a\ndecoupling of this interaction once the dark sector cools down, that we refer\nto as dark radiation matter decoupling (DRMD). We find agreement between the\nSH${}_0$ES determination of $H_0$ as well as combined Planck 2018, Pantheon+\nand DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data at 1.4$\\sigma$ level, compared\nto a 5.7$\\sigma$ tension in the $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model.

It was the\nfirst such code to surpass the break-even point, thereby demonstrating the\npractical utility of quantum error correction. In this work, we propose a\nplanar fault-tolerant architecture for this code by concatenating it with the\nXZZX code via fusion-based error-correction. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first 2D nearest-neighbor architecture for fault-tolerant fusion-based\nerror-correction. We demonstrate how all the required operations, namely\nresource state preparation and Bell measurements, can be carried out using\nstandard circuit-QED techniques, such as intercavity beam-splitter coupling,\ncavity displacements, cavity-transmon dispersive coupling, and transmon drives.\nWe show analytically and numerically that all dominant hardware errors in the\nbosonic modes and control ancillae are corrected, to first-order, at the\nhardware level. Consequently, the outer XZZX code only needs to address smaller\nresidual errors, which are quadratically suppressed, effectively doubling the\narchitecture's fault-distance. Moreover, the performance of our architecture is\nnot limited by unwanted nonlinearities such as cavity self-Kerr, and it avoids\ndemanding coupling techniques like $\\chi$-matching or high-order coupling.\nOverall, our architecture substantially reduces the hardware complexity needed\nto achieve fault tolerance with the four-legged cat code.",

Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to\nscale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In\nthis paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate\nnoise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the\nlimitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose\nLongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video\ngeneration. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:\n1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation\nacross clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces\nalignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual\ndegradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates\nboth dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,\ncomplemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively\nbalances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality.

However, in domains like\nautonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we\nneed not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal\nguarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability\nguarantees can be costly.

    "abstract": "The rate of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from isolated Pop III stars\nis not well known, as it depends on our poor understanding of their initial\nmass function (IMF), rotation rates, stellar evolution, and mass loss. A\nsub-population of massive ($M_{\\rm ZAMS}\\gtrsim20M_\\odot$) Pop III stars is\nexpected to suffer core-collapse and launch a relativistic jet that would power\na GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a key requirement is that the pre-supernova\nstar imparts sufficient angular momentum to the remnant black hole to form an\naccretion disc and launch a relativistic jet, which demands rapid initial\nrotation of the progenitor star and suppression of line-driven mass loss during\nits chemically homogeneous evolution. Here we explore a grid of stellar\nevolution models of Pop III stars with masses $20\\leq M_{\\rm ZAMS}/M_\\odot \\leq\n100$, which are initially rotating with surface angular velocities $0.6\\leq\n\\Omega_0/\\Omega_{\\rm crit}\\leq 0.9$, where centrifugally-driven mass loss\nensues for $\\Omega>\\Omega_{\\rm crit}$. Realistic accretion and jet propagation\nmodels are used to derive the initial black hole masses and spins, and jet\nbreakout times for these stars. The GRB production efficiency is obtained over\na phase space comprising progenitor initial mass, rotation, and wind\nefficiency. For modest wind efficiency of $\\eta_{\\rm wind}=0.45-0.35$, the Pop\nIII GRB production efficiency is $\\eta_{\\rm\nGRB}\\sim10^{-5}-3\\times10^{-4}\\,M_\\odot^{-1}$, respectively, for a top-heavy\nIMF. This yields an observable all-sky equivalent rate of $\\sim2-40\\,{\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$ by \\textit{Swift}, with 75\\% of the GRBs located at $z\\lesssim8$. If\nthe actual observed rate is much lower, then this would imply $\\eta_{\\rm\nwind}>0.45$, which leads to significant loss of mass and angular momentum that\nrenders isolated Pop III stars incapable of producing GRBs and favours a binary\nscenario instead.",

    "abstract": "Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models\n(LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but\nalso serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation\nframeworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer\nverification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules\nor evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current\nmethodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically\nevaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent\nstage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the\nrobustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across\ndifferent domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and\nrobust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It\ndemonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse\nreasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including\nmulti-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively\nidentifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark\ncomprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented\nthrough manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We\nanticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer\nverification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research.

To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):\nan asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and\ngenerates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer\nand solver are trained via reinforcement learning.

In this\nwork, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve\na counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the\ninstitution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual\nexplanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect,\ninformation-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of\nprivate counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that\nkeeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the\ninstitution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the\namount of information leaked about the institution database to the user,\ncompared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability\nof all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the\nuser retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of\ntheir features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their\nfeature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we\npropose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically,\nbut ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and\nI-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their\nattributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we\npresent numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the\ndatabase leakage of the proposed schemes.",

    "abstract": "A large body of research has employed Machine Learning (ML) models to develop\nlearned operating systems (OSes) and kernels. The latter dynamically adapts to\nthe job load and dynamically adjusts resources (CPU, IO, memory, network\nbandwidth) allocation to respond to the actual user demand. What this work has\nin common is that it utilizes ML to improve kernel decisions. To this day, and\nto the best of our knowledge, no work has taken the opposite direction, i.e.,\nusing OS to improve ML. While some work proposes applying system-level\noptimizations to ML algorithms, they do not tailor the OS to adapt to the ML\ncontext. To address this limitation, we take an orthogonal approach in this\npaper by leveraging the OS to enhance the performance of ML models and\nalgorithms. We explore the path towards an ML-specialized OS, MaLV-OS. MaLV-OS\nrethinks the OS architecture to make it specifically tailored to ML workloads,\nespecially in virtualized clouds, which are now widely used to run ML\napplications. MaLV-OS envisioned architecture includes (1) a micro-kernel,\nMicro-LAKE, which allows kernel space applications to use the GPU, and (2) an\nMLaaS (ML as a Service) subsystem that gathers ML models to help Micro-LAKE\nwith memory management and CPU scheduling. MaLV-OS architecture also offloads\nsystem-sensitive parts of the models to the OS, to lighten the model complexity\nand programming, and speed up its execution. Finally, MaLV-OS integrates an\nopen-source GPU virtualization software, merged directly into the hypervisor.\nFor more flexibility, MaLV-OS vision is to enable the virtual machine to\ndynamically select MLaaS policies that can improve the performance of the model\nthe user is running. Because MLaaS is designed as loadable kernel modules, the\nMaLV-OS architecture enables the dynamic addition of new capabilities to the\nMLaaS subsystem.",

These challenges lead\nto vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation.\n  This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It\nuses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to\nmitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into\nstructured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling\nreal-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances.

Modeling user\nbehavior sequences as text to leverage Language Models (LMs) for this task has\ngained traction, owing to LMs' strong semantic understanding and contextual\nmodeling capabilities. However, a critical structural gap exists: user behavior\nsequences consist of discrete actions connected by semantically empty\nseparators, differing fundamentally from the coherent natural language in LM\npre-training. This mismatch causes semantic fragmentation, where LM attention\nscatters across irrelevant tokens instead of focusing on meaningful behavior\nboundaries and inter-behavior relationships, degrading prediction performance.\nTo address this, we propose $\\textit{CTR-Sink}$, a novel framework introducing\nbehavior-level attention sinks tailored for recommendation scenarios. Inspired\nby attention sink theory, it constructs attention focus sinks and dynamically\nregulates attention aggregation via external information. Specifically, we\ninsert sink tokens between consecutive behaviors, incorporating\nrecommendation-specific signals such as temporal distance to serve as stable\nattention sinks. To enhance generality, we design a two-stage training strategy\nthat explicitly guides LM attention toward sink tokens and a attention sink\nmechanism that amplifies inter-sink dependencies to better capture behavioral\ncorrelations.

One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs.

Our analysis reveals that PEFT\ntechniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the\nnumber of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models\nend-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of\ntotal parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot\nperformance of the base pretrained a policy.",

Within the\nspecified temperature range, the orthorhombic phase of ZnNb2O6 (space group:\nPbcn) demonstrated notable phase stability, with a thermal expansion\ncoefficient similar to that of isomorphic compounds. Notably, a reversible\nphase transition was observed under compression at 10 GPa, with diffraction\nexperiments indicating a shift to a monoclinic structure (space group P2/a),\nwhich remained stable up to 30 GPa. Changes in Raman modes, lattice parameters,\nand the unit-cell volume were monitored. A significant 2.5% discontinuity in\nthe unit-cell volume at the phase transition pressure from orthorhombic to\nmonoclinic suggests a first-order phase transition.

We also\nincorporate real-time reference arm adjustment to maintain signal strength and\ncontrast as the focus moves deeper into the sample. Using this system, we\nimaged fresh ex vivo mouse liver and small intestine with unprecedented depth\nand detail. In these tissues, the dynamic contrast clearly revealed fine\nstructures not visible with conventional OCT-for example, the sinusoidal\nmicrovasculature and organized cell layers in the liver, as well as neural\nplexuses and crypts in the intestine-all visualized label-free.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents\nsignificant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction\nimpedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require\nmillions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical\nfine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion\npolicies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong\ndependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for\nfine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement\nlearning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment\ninteractions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective\nadaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline\nplay interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,\nmaking the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot\nlearning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across\neight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude\nfewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this\nis the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world\nrobotic skills using an offline world model.

By encoding values as serial bitstreams, SC\nsignificantly reduces energy dissipation compared to conventional\nfloating-point (FP) designs; however, further improvement of layer-wise\nmixed-precision implementation for SC remains unexplored. This article\nintroduces Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL), a novel scheme that applies\nmixed-precision concepts specifically to SC NNs. By introducing an\noperator-norm-based theoretical model, this article shows that truncation noise\ncan cumulatively propagate through the layers by the estimated amplification\nfactors. An extended sensitivity analysis is presented, using random forest\n(RF) regression to evaluate multilayer truncation effects and validate the\nalignment of theoretical predictions with practical network behaviors. To\naccommodate different application scenarios, this article proposes two\ntruncation strategies (coarse-grained and fine-grained), which apply diverse\nsequence length configurations at each layer. Evaluations on a pipelined SC MLP\nsynthesized at 32nm demonstrate that ASL can reduce energy and latency\noverheads by up to over 60% with negligible accuracy loss.

We\nhave developed a simple radiative transfer model for PPDs that reasonably\ntreats stellar non-thermal (XUV), stellar thermal (optical/infrared), and\nre-emitted radiations, reproducing the temperature structures from Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer. Our simulations show fast one-sided surface accretion\n($\\sim 10\\%$ of Keplerian velocity) and asymmetric disk winds when the vertical\nmagnetic field is aligned with the disk angular momentum. The asymmetry is due\nto the failure of the wind on the side with the accretion layer. On the\naccreting surface, clumps are repeatedly generated and accrete, driven by\nradiative feedback. For the anti-aligned fields, surface accretion becomes more\nmoderate and time-variable, while the winds remain largely symmetric. For the\nthermal structure, accretion heating does not affect the disk temperature in\nany of our runs. This is because (1) the accretion energy dissipates via Joule\nheating at 2--3 gas scale heights, where low optical depth enables efficient\nradiative cooling, and (2) the winds remove $\\gtrsim 10\\%$ of the accretion\nenergy. In contrast, the winds enhance radiative heating by elevating the\nirradiation front. These results highlight the importance of coupling between\ngas dynamics and radiation transport in PPDs, and provide observable magnetic\nactivities such as fast episodic accretion, wind asymmetry, and molecular\nsurvival in XUV-irradiated winds.",

These\nmodels have attracted attention due to the discovery of Mathieu moonshine\nphenomena for the elliptic genera of K3 surfaces, and have played a pivotal\nrole in extending Mukai's theorem on classification of symplectic automorphisms\nof $K3$ surfaces. We report on recent progress (arXiv:2402.08719 [hep-th]) in\ncharacterizing topological defects in $K3$ models, generalizing the notion of\nsymmetries to categories of topological operators supported on arbitrary\ncodimension submanifolds with possibly non-invertible fusion rules. Taking\nadvantage of the interpretation of Mukai lattice as the D-brane charge lattice,\nwe present a number of general results for the category of topological defect\nlines preserving the superconformal algebra and spectral flow, obtained by\nstudying their fusion with boundary states. While for certain K3 models\ninfinitely many simple defects, and even a continuum, can occur, at generic\npoints in the moduli space the category is actually trivial, i.e. it is\ngenerated by the identity defect. Furthermore, if a K3 model is at the\nattractor point for some BPS configuration of D-branes, then all topological\ndefects have integral quantum dimension. We also introduce a conjecture that a\ncontinuum of topological defects arises if and only if the K3 model is a\n(possibly generalized) orbifold of a torus model. These general results are\nconfirmed by the analysis of significant examples. We also point out the\nconnection to recent studies of topological defects in the Conway moonshine\nmodule theory (arXiv:2412.21141 [hep-th],arXiv:2504.18619 [hep-th]).",

    "abstract": "As a freeway-driving strategy, jam-absorption driving (JAD) clears a shock\nwave (i.e., an upstream-moving congestion wave) by modulating the velocity of a\nsingle vehicle (called the absorbing vehicle) upstream of the wave, and\nimproves traffic performances such as fuel consumption and collision risk.\nHowever, the deceleration of the absorbing vehicle causes trailing vehicles to\nslow down, generating secondary shock waves that undermine these benefits. This\nstudy proposes a method to suppress secondary shock waves by controlling the\nbehavior of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) upstream of the absorbing\nvehicle, which are called support vehicles (SVs). A string-stability-based\ncontrol method is applied in which SVs dynamically extend their time gaps to\nprovide support driving (SD) for JAD. Numerical simulations using a traffic\nstream composed of 2000 vehicles, including five SVs, revealed that SD damped\nperturbations caused by the absorbing vehicle and prevented secondary shock\nwaves, consistent with the head-to-tail string stability criterion. The\ncombination of JAD and SD reduced total fuel consumption by 109 kg and\ncollision risk (inverse time-to-collision) by 1940 compared with the JAD-only\nmethod, but increased total travel time by 49.3 hours. Reverting the extended\ntime gap to its initial value reduced total travel time by 27.1 hours while\nmaintaining low collision risk compared with the non-reverting method, albeit\nwith increased total fuel consumption by 113 kg. SD alone could not eliminate\nthe target shock wave. The results indicate that combining JAD and SD\neffectively eliminates the target shock wave while suppressing the secondary\nshock waves with guaranteed string stability even with only six CAVs (an\nabsorbing vehicle and five SVs) out of 2000 vehicles, which is consistent with\nlow CAV penetration rates anticipated in early implementation stages.",

    "abstract": "Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and\neconomic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting\nperformance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving\ncomplicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric\nphysics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial\nintelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous\nUnited States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical\nsatellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational\noverhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows\nSolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating\n24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer\nresolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the\nCONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly\nreduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%\nin reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively\ncaptures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the\nfirst-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,\naccurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the\ntransition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.",

    "abstract": "Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.\nHowever, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from\nhistorical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a\nmajor asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data\navailable for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer\nfor Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this\nasymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed\nweather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict\nrich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows\nthe model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during\ndeployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all\nevaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under\nnormal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme\nweather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p\n\\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN\nusing less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in\ndata-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can\novercome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a\nchanging climate.",

However, existing\nmethods struggle to leverage the semantic complementarity across different\ntypes of flows for representing program behaviors, and their context-unaware\nnature further hinders the accuracy of cross-flow semantic integration. We\npropose and implement MalFlows, a novel technique that achieves context-aware\nfusion of heterogeneous flow semantics for Android malware detection. Our goal\nis to leverage complementary strengths of the three types of flow-related\ninformation for precise app profiling. We adopt a heterogeneous information\nnetwork (HIN) to model the rich semantics across these program flows. We\nfurther propose flow2vec, a context-aware HIN embedding technique that\ndistinguishes the semantics of HIN entities as needed based on contextual\nconstraints across different flows and learns accurate app representations\nthrough the joint use of multiple meta-paths. The representations are finally\nfed into a channel-attention-based deep neural network for malware\nclassification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to\ncomprehensively aggregate the strengths of diverse flow-related information for\nassessing maliciousness within apps. We evaluate MalFlows on a large-scale\ndataset comprising over 20 million flow instances extracted from more than\n31,000 real-world apps.

Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific\ndecoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a\ngradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this\nmethod and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled\nsetting with a linear decoder.

We investigate the influence of\nthe DF of DM on the detectability of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH)-MS\nbinaries as low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. Taking into account\nthe DF of DM, we employ the detailed binary evolution code MESA to model the\nevolution of a large number of IMBH-MS binaries. Our simulation shows that the\nDF of DM can drive those IMBH-MS binaries to evolve toward low-frequency GW\nsources for a low donor-star mass, a high spike index, or a short initial\norbital period.

We present a simple, fast-computing\nmodel to estimate such probability, validated with a Monte Carlo approach based\non dark flight computations from real meteorite-dropping fireball data.\nConsidering meteorite masses higher than 10 g, our results indicate that in\nregions with minimal weathering, like Antarctica, the probability of\nencountering a previous meteorite within a new fall strewn field may be as high\nas 75%. In environments with higher weathering rates, like countryside or urban\nregions, this probability decreases to <1%.

In this paper, this limitation is addressed by\nproposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse\nbuilding distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine\nlearning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are\nfirst used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain\nbuildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The\nremaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation\nalgorithms to extract building features.

Application of the\ntechnique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights\nits potential for historical and archaeological discovery.

However,\nmost existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual\nbackground, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme\nmatching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude\nthe many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of\nautomated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to\ncontemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader\nformulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show\nthat conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise\ncomputation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes\nbut fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the\nsegment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image\nmeasures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a\nprompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for\nmeme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared\nvisual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that\nrequires more sophisticated matching techniques.",

    "abstract": "While recent advances in foundation models have improved the state of the art\nin many domains, some problems in empirical sciences could not benefit from\nthis progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains\nchallenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a\ncomplex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of\nsoil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts\nagricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate\nresilience. In this work, we propose $\\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal\nmultitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized\npipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first\npredict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.\nEach segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological\nfeatures. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal\nconcatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to\naccount for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our\nmethod is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the\nnumber of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially\nstructured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world\nsoil profile dataset. All code and experiments can be found in our repository:\nhttps://github.com/calgo-lab/BGR/",

It is estimated\nthat the minimum safe ramp-up/down times for the JET, SPARC, and ITER tokamaks\nare 4.2, 2.0, and 14.7 seconds, respectively. The JET ramp time is in\naccordance with operational experience. The SPARC and ITER minimum safe ramp\ntimes are less than the ramp times in the respective designs. Hence, there is\nno indication that the design ramp times are infeasible, as was recently\nsuggested in arXiv:2507.05456 (2025). The typical ratios of the inductive\nelectric field to the Connor-Hastie field in SPARC and ITER are found to be\nless than those in JET.

While recent Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in\ndesign-to-code tasks, they often fail to accurately preserve the layout during\ncode generation. To this end, we draw inspiration from the Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) reasoning in human cognition and propose LaTCoder, a novel approach that\nenhances layout preservation in webpage design during code generation with\nLayout-as-Thought (LaT). Specifically, we first introduce a simple yet\nefficient algorithm to divide the webpage design into image blocks. Next, we\nprompt MLLMs using a CoTbased approach to generate code for each block.\nFinally, we apply two assembly strategies-absolute positioning and an\nMLLM-based method-followed by dynamic selection to determine the optimal\noutput. We evaluate the effectiveness of LaTCoder using multiple backbone MLLMs\n(i.e., DeepSeek-VL2, Gemini, and GPT-4o) on both a public benchmark and a newly\nintroduced, more challenging benchmark (CC-HARD) that features complex layouts.\nThe experimental results on automatic metrics demonstrate significant\nimprovements.

    "abstract": "In today's rapidly evolving field of electronic design automation (EDA), the\ncomplexity of hardware designs is increasing, necessitating more sophisticated\nautomation solutions. High-level synthesis (HLS), as a pivotal solution,\nautomates hardware designs from high-level abstractions (e.g., C/C++). However,\nit faces significant challenges, particularly in design space exploration and\noptimization. While large language models (LLMs) have shown notable\ncapabilities in code generation, their application to HLS has been limited due\nto the scarcity of (publicly) available HLS code datasets. Hence, research in\nthis domain has primarily focused on techniques such as prompt engineering and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces SAGE-HLS, the first-of-its-kind fine-tuned LLM specifically for HLS\ncode generation. Our method includes three key advancements: (i) We implement\nVerilog-to-C/C++ porting, converting verified and synthesizable Verilog codes\ninto corresponding C, creating a dataset of 16.7K HLS codes; (ii) We implement\na fine-tuning strategy, which is based on instruction prompting to code\ngeneration guided by abstract syntax tree (AST); (iii) We develop a\nsemi-automated evaluation framework using VerilogEval to assess the\nfunctionality of the generated HLS code. Our experiments show that SAGE-HLS,\nfined-tuned on the QwenCoder (2.5) 7B model, achieves a near 100% success rate\nin code synthesizability and a 75% success rate in functional correctness.",

In this paper we extend previous\naxisymmetric runs by performing local three-dimensional simulations of the COS,\nusing the code SNOOPY. As parameters are varied, we characterise how the\nvarious axisymmetric COS saturated states are transformed in 3D, while also\ntracking their interrelationship with the subcritical baroclinic instability.\nIn particular, at low Reynolds number (Re) our 3D simulations exhibit similar\nweakly nonlinear and wave turbulent states to our earlier axisymmetic runs. At\nhigher Re, but low Peclet number (Pe), we obtain bursty cycles involving the\ncreation of zonal flows, the subsequent development of planar vortices, and\ntheir destruction by elliptical instability. For larger Pe, however, zonal\nflows can persist, alongside weaker more elongated vortices. These results\nfurther reveal the diversity of the COS's behaviour, and show that solid\naccumulation via COS-induced vortices may not be straightforward.",

To address these challenges, we propose\nMultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source\nretrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches.

    "abstract": "The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of\nautomated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as\n\"LLMas-a-judge.\" However, improving its alignment with human preferences\nwithout complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work,\nmotivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode\nsemantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with\nhuman judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and\nefficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,\nvia internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by\naggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from\na softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully\nleverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the\nlimitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the\nstandard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman\ncorrelation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the\nbest baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches\nor outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,\nsuch as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the\neffectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "A total coloring of a simple undirected graph $G$ is an assignment of colors\nto its vertices and edges such that the colors given to the vertices form a\nproper vertex coloring, the colors given to the edges form a proper edge\ncoloring, and the color of every edge is different from that of its two\nendpoints. That is, $\\phi:V(G)\\cup E(G)\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}$ is a total\ncoloring of $G$ if $\\phi(u)\\neq\\phi(v)$ and $\\phi(uv)\\neq\\phi(u)$ for all\n$uv\\in E(G)$, and $\\phi(uv)\\neq\\phi(uw)$ for any $u \\in V(G)$ and distinct $v,w\n\\in N(u)$ (here, $N(u)$ denotes the set of neighbours of $u$). A total coloring\n$\\phi$ of a graph $G$ is said to be ``Adjacent Vertex Distinguishing'' (or AVD\nfor short) if for all $uv\\in E(G)$, we have that $\\phi(\\{u\\}\\cup\\{uw:w\\in\nN(u)\\})\\neq\\phi(\\{v\\}\\cup\\{vw\\colon w\\in N(v)\\})$. The AVD Total Coloring\nConjecture of Zhang, Chen, Li, Yao, Lu, and Wang (Science in China Series A:\nMathematics, 48(3):289--299, 2005) states that every graph $G$ has an AVD total\ncoloring using at most $\\Delta(G)+3$ colors, where $\\Delta(G)$ denotes the\nmaximum degree of $G$. For some $s\\in\\mathbb{N}$, a graph $G$ is said to be\n$s$-degenerate if every subgraph of $G$ has minimum degree at most $s$. Miao,\nShi, Hu, and Luo (Discrete Mathematics, 339(10):2446--2449, 2016) showed that\nthe AVD Total Coloring Conjecture is true for 2-degenerate graphs.

The\nimprovement in con-vergence property reduces the computational cost and\ntrain-ing time of EP by orders of magnitude, delivering perfor-mance on par\nwith backpropagation (BP) in benchmark tasks. Meanwhile, residual connections\nwith brain-inspired topologies help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem\nthat arises when feedback pathways are weak in deep RNNs. Our approach\nsubstantially enhances the applicabil-ity and practicality of EP in large-scale\nnetworks that un-derpin artificial intelligence. The techniques developed here\nalso offer guidance to implementing in-situ learning in physical neural\nnetworks.",

    "abstract": "Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing\ndiffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural\ndeficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic\ncontrollability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis\napproach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal\nimages via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated\nauto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked\nsampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves\nfine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over\nsynthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly\nDetection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy\nthat emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text\nsimilarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three\nbenchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD\noutperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection\ntasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup\ncompared to diffusion-based alternatives.

Then, we propose\na collaborative grasping framework, which decomposes the task into local grasp\npose generation and global collaboration. Finally, we design a 2-stage planning\nmodule that can generate collision-free trajectories to achieve this task.\nExperiments show a success rate of 52% across different numbers of robots,\nobjects, and tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach\nfor Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise\ncharacteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these\ndecoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open\nquestion. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the\nvulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The\nRL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome\nmodifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to\na Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code\ndata from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can\nsuccessfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high\nattack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through\nadversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples\ngenerated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability\ndiscovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for\ndeveloping more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant\nquantum computing.",

    "abstract": "The performance of decoders in Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is key to\nrealizing practical quantum computers. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies\nare not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring\ntheoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect\nMatching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can\neffectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by\nrigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT)\narchitecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first\nis a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels,\nwhile the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the\ntheoretical error probabilities from MWPM. Using public experimental data from\nGoogle, our evaluation reveals that while the final test accuracy of the\nknowledge distillation model was nearly identical to the baseline, its training\nloss converged more slowly, and the training time increased by a factor of\napproximately five. This result suggests that modern GNN architectures possess\na high capacity to efficiently learn complex error correlations directly from\nreal hardware data, without guidance from approximate theoretical models.",

    "abstract": "As the size of a mechanical lattice with beam-modeled edges approaches zero,\nit undergoes homogenization into a continuum model, which exhibits unusual\nmechanical properties that deviate from classical Cauchy elasticity, named\nmicropolar elasticity. Typically, the homogenization process is qualitative in\nthe engineering community, lacking quantitative homogenization error estimates.\nIn this paper, we rigorously analyze the homogenization process of a beam\nlattice to a continuum. Our approach is initiated from an engineered mechanical\nproblem defined on a triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions. By\napplying Fourier transformations, we reduce the problem to a series of\nequations in the frequency domain. As the lattice size approaches zero, this\nyields a homogenized model in the form of a partial differential equation with\nperiodic boundary conditions. This process can be easily justified if the\nexternal conditions in the frequency domain are nonzero only at low-frequency\nmodes. However, through numerical experiments, we discover that beyond the\nlow-frequency regime, the homogenization of the beam lattice differs from\nclassical periodic homogenization theory due to the additional rotational\ndegrees of freedom in the beams. A crucial technique in our analysis is the\ndecoupling of displacement and rotation fields, achieved through a linear\nalgebraic manipulation known as the Schur complement. Through dedicated\nanalysis, we establish the coercivity of the Schur complements in both lattice\nand continuum models, which enables us to derive convergence rate estimates for\nhomogenization errors. Numerical experiments validate the optimality of the\nhomogenization rate estimates.",

We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning\nframework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on\nuser-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA\ncompliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent\ninitialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that\neliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,\nand (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization\npriorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a\nself-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state\nrepresentation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA\ncompliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation\ndecisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML\nworkloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL\nachieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%\nreduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in\noverall SLA compliance compared to static baselines.

These limitations can be traced back to the reliance of\nexisting techniques on numerical optimization algorithms. In this paper, we\npropose a novel perspective on the design of feedback optimization algorithms,\nby framing these objectives as an output regulation problem. We place\nparticular emphasis on time-varying optimization problems, and show that an\nalgorithm can track time-varying optimizers if and only if it incorporates a\nmodel of the temporal variability inherent to the optimization - a requirement\nthat we term the internal model principle of feedback optimization. Building on\nthis insight, we introduce a new design methodology that couples\noutput-feedback stabilization with a control component that drives the system\ntoward the critical points of the optimization problem.

This study introduces a capability-based network\nmethodology that maps the structural relationships among innovation actors\nbased on the similarity of their research and development (R&D) capabilities.\nDrawing on Economic Complexity Theory, we measure each actor's revealed\ncomparative advantage (RCA) across scientific and technological fields and\nconstruct an R&D Actor Space - a proximity-based network that reflects the\nrelational configuration of innovation capacities. Applying this method to\nKorean R&D data, we uncover a stratified system in which central, highly\ndiversified universities coexist with more specialized firms and government\ninstitutes. Network analysis reveals assortative and unequal structures, and\nhierarchical clustering further highlights layered subgroupings. By moving\nbeyond categorical classification, this capability-based network approach\nprovides a scalable and generalizable tool for analyzing structural complexity\nwithin national innovation systems.",

However, progress is limited by the\nscarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is\ncostly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data\nsynthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise\ninstruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To\naddress these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a\ngarment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories\naligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced\nand diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit\nScore, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies\nbetween garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during\nconstruction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate\ntriplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the\nfirst instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing.

    "abstract": "In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image\nretrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is\nessential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in\nmedical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,\nmulti-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable\nretrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced\nConfidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes\nfor each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval\nrobustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages\nprototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to\ncontrol the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to\nradiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements\nin retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and\nadvancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios.

As an example we consider here image recovery,\nwhere SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of\nproblems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms\nthat are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the\nlearned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing\nor storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a\ncombination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.\nTherefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in\nSDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the\nsparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization\nmethods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on\nthe method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in\ngeneral not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite\ndifferent from the learning database.",

ECG signals suffer from low-resolution\n(LR) due to the use of convenient acquisition devices, as well as internal and\nexternal noises and artifacts. Classical ECG super-resolution (ECGSR) methods\nadopt an open-loop architecture that converts LR ECG signals to\nsuper-resolution (SR) ones. According to the theory of automatic control, a\nclosed-loop framework exhibits superior dynamic and static performance compared\nwith its open-loop counterpart. This paper proposes a closed-loop approach,\ntermed circular ECGSR (CECGSR), which models the degradation process from SR\nECG signals to LR ones. The negative feedback mechanism of the closed-loop\nsystem is based on the differences between the LR ECG signals. A mathematical\nloop equation is constructed to characterize the closed-loop infrastructure.\nThe Taylor series expansion is employed to demonstrate the near-zero\nsteady-state error of the proposed method. A Plug-and-Play strategy is\nconsidered to establish the SR unit of the proposed architecture, leveraging\nany existing advanced open-loop ECGSR methods. Simulation experiments on both\nnoiseless and noisy subsets of the PTB-XL datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed CECGSR outperforms state-of-the-art open-loop ECGSR algorithms in the\nreconstruction performance of ECG signals.",

Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative\nprogressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can\nautomatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start\nphase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through\nfeedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted\nrule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness\nrewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a \"code diff\nmatching\" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production\ndeployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers,\nresolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85%\nremediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters.

However, their high computational cost and large\nparameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce\nmemory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from\nsevere performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two\nkey obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model\nweights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform\nquantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;\n(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated\nvalues, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in\nspecific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these\nissues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We\nintroduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with\nthe weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an\nAdaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or\noutlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating\nthe impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX\nunder various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,\nand sDCI datasets.

These models\nare typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral\ndrift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.\nHowever, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due\nto its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose\nSmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior\ndata to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen\nconsists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware\nSplit module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically\ncoherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose\nSemantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving\nrepresentative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,\nwe introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior\nrelationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the\nLLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core\nbehavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify\nand remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve\nthe factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.\nExperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen\nsignificantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior\nprediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by\n85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these\ncapabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has\nattempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative\nmodels, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to\nvideo content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named\nVideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious\nediting. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly\nunnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended\ngenerative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and\ninter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying\nimage-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield\nvideo from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint\nframe optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.\nFurthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization\nobjectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce\noutputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to\noptimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and\nsubjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results\nshow that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the\nbaseline methods.",

This has been proved in\nseveral special cases, including all sufficiently large symmetric and\nalternating groups. For a simple group $G$, in view of a theorem of Mazurov and\nZenkov from 1996, the conjecture implies the existence of an element $x \\in G$\nwith $H_p \\cap H_p^x = 1$ for all $p$. In turn, this statement implies a\nconjecture of Vdovin from 2002, which asserts that if $G$ is simple and $H$ is\na nilpotent subgroup, then $H \\cap H^x = 1$ for some $x \\in G$.\n  In this paper, we adopt a probabilistic approach to prove the Lisi-Sabatini\nconjecture for all non-alternating simple groups. By combining this with\nearlier work of Kurmazov on nilpotent subgroups of alternating groups, we\ncomplete the proof of Vdovin's conjecture. Moreover, by combining our proof for\ngroups of Lie type with earlier work of Zenkov on alternating and sporadic\ngroups, we are able to establish a stronger form of Vdovin's conjecture: if $G$\nis simple and $A,B$ are nilpotent subgroups, then $A \\cap B^x = 1$ for some $x\n\\in G$. In addition, we study the asymptotic probability that a random pair of\nSylow $p$-subgroups in a simple group of Lie type intersect trivially,\ncomplementing recent work of Diaconis et al. and Eberhard on symmetric and\nalternating groups.",

Thus, the collective prices of all related\noutcomes should be \\$1, representing a combined probability of 1 of any\noutcome. Despite this design, Polymarket exhibits cases where dependent assets\nare mispriced, allowing for purchasing (or selling) a certain outcome for less\nthan (or more than) \\$1, guaranteeing profit. This phenomenon, known as\narbitrage, could enable sophisticated participants to exploit such\ninconsistencies.\n  In this paper, we conduct an empirical arbitrage analysis on Polymarket data\nto answer three key questions: (Q1) What conditions give rise to arbitrage (Q2)\nDoes arbitrage actually occur on Polymarket and (Q3) Has anyone exploited these\nopportunities. A major challenge in analyzing arbitrage between related markets\nlies in the scalability of comparisons across a large number of markets and\nconditions, with a naive analysis requiring $O(2^{n+m})$ comparisons. To\novercome this, we employ a heuristic-driven reduction strategy based on\ntimeliness, topical similarity, and combinatorial relationships, further\nvalidated by expert input.\n  Our study reveals two distinct forms of arbitrage on Polymarket: Market\nRebalancing Arbitrage, which occurs within a single market or condition, and\nCombinatorial Arbitrage, which spans across multiple markets. We use on-chain\nhistorical order book data to analyze when these types of arbitrage\nopportunities have existed, and when they have been executed by users.

    "abstract": "Indexes can significantly improve search performance in relational databases.\nHowever, if the query workload changes frequently or new data updates occur\ncontinuously, it may not be worthwhile to build a conventional index upfront\nfor query processing. Adaptive indexing is a technique in which an index gets\nbuilt on the fly as a byproduct of query processing. In recent years, research\nin database indexing has taken a new direction where machine learning models\nare employed for the purpose of indexing. These indexes, known as learned\nindexes, can be more efficient compared to traditional indexes such as B+-tree\nin terms of memory footprints and query performance. However, a learned index\nhas to be constructed upfront and requires training the model in advance, which\nbecomes a challenge in dynamic situations when workload changes frequently. To\nthe best of our knowledge, no learned indexes exist yet for adaptive indexing.\nWe propose a novel learned approach for adaptive indexing.

To\nenhance query performance, we employ a query workload prediction technique that\nmakes future workload projection based on past workload data.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated\nsignificant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face\nthe inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative\ninference, which often leads to \"hallucinations\", outputs that are not grounded\nin the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these\nissues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational\ncost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit\na long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,\nyet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive\nresearch into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship\nbetween this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify\na consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input\ndiminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key\nfactor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these\ninsights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative\nDecoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more\nimage-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with\nhigher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those\nfrom the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and\nsuppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.\nExtensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks\ndemonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and\nimproving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no\nadditional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient\nframework applicable to various models.",

While analytical solutions like the Hohmann and\nBi-elliptic transfers offer optimal strategies for specific cases, they lack\nthe flexibility for more general optimization problems. This paper presents a\ncomputational framework that couples a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the\nPoliastro orbital mechanics library to autonomously discover fuel-optimal,\nthree-impulse transfer trajectories between coplanar circular orbits. We\nvalidate this framework across two distinct scenarios: a low-energy transfer\nfrom Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to a Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and a high-energy\ntransfer to a distant orbit with a radius 20 times that of LEO. Our results\ndemonstrate the framework's remarkable adaptability. For the LEO-to-GEO\ntransfer, the GA precisely converges to the classical Hohmann transfer,\nachieving an identical $\\Delta V$ of 3853.96 m/s and validating the method's\naccuracy. Conversely, for the high-energy transfer, the GA identifies a\nsuperior Bi-elliptic trajectory that yields a significant $\\Delta V$ saving of\n213.47 m/s compared to the Hohmann transfer. This fuel efficiency, however,\nnecessitates a trade-off, extending the mission duration from approximately 1\nday to over 140 years.

This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems\nas directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike\nclassical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or\nrequire belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it\nsupports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary\njustification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and\ndeliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a\nfoundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief\nsystems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and\nrepresentational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief\nstrength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states\nthan existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and\nintermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,\ndynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which\ncan facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike\nfixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera\nmovement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural\nintegrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address\nthese challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network\n(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy\nvideos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction\nand Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)\nmodule. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature\nrepresentation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,\nsparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in\nfeature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch\ninformation exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen\nmulti-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying\nreceptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,\nthereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on\nseveral challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and\ngeneralization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive\nperformance in video-based polyp detection tasks.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the\nfield of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow\ninference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based\ntalking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first\nreal-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our\napproach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via\na temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate\ngeneration. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed\nlatent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to\ngenerate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video\nlatent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully\ndesigned Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient\ntalking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and\naccelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous\nnoise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our\nframework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous\nmotion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated\nvideo clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with\nsignificantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and\nspeed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.",

Prior works have achieved notable progress on\nhuman-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware\ninpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving\nhuman-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background\ninterferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as\nexisting datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and\ndiverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances\ncannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In\nthis work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with\ndiverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer\nDiffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically\nseparated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance\nhuman-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance,\nintegrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present\nSpatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow.

At depths of 50-125 meters above bottom, the temperature flux is\nup-gradient, rather than down the mean gradient, and the corresponding vertical\ndivergence of the diathermal temperature flux implies a diapycnal velocity of\napproximately 1 mm/s, consistent with diathermal migration estimated from a dye\nrelease study.

Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,\nextensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods\nby 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and\nmedical datasets.

    "abstract": "Binding energy is a fundamental thermodynamic property that governs molecular\ninteractions, playing a crucial role in fields such as healthcare and the\nnatural sciences. It is particularly relevant in drug development, vaccine\ndesign, and other biomedical applications. Over the years, various methods have\nbeen developed to estimate protein binding energy, ranging from experimental\ntechniques to computational approaches, with machine learning making\nsignificant contributions to this field. Although classical computing has\ndemonstrated strong results in constructing predictive models, the variation of\nquantum computing for machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative.\nQuantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained traction as a research focus,\nraising the question of their potential advantages in predicting binding\nenergies. To investigate this potential, this study explored the feasibility of\nQNNs for this task by proposing thirty variations of multilayer\nperceptron-based quantum neural networks. These variations span three distinct\narchitectures, each incorporating ten different quantum circuits to configure\ntheir quantum layers. The performance of these quantum models was compared with\nthat of a state-of-the-art classical multilayer perceptron-based artificial\nneural network, evaluating both accuracy and training time. A primary dataset\nwas used for training, while two additional datasets containing entirely unseen\nsamples were employed for testing. Results indicate that the quantum models\nachieved approximately 20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset, although\ntheir accuracy was lower on the other datasets. Notably, quantum models\nexhibited training times several orders of magnitude shorter than their\nclassical counterparts, highlighting their potential for efficient protein\nbinding energy prediction.",

    "abstract": "Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in\nimage and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the\nstandard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite\ntheir practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with\ndifferent stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step\nregimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and\nanalyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely\nsensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative\nstrength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous\ntheoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is\nintrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and\ncauses exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To\naddress this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive\nguidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps\nbased on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method\nis lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible\nwith standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image\n(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables\nup to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,\nrobustness, and semantic alignment.

Recent advancements aim to address\nthis limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,\nabstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.\nThis paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by\nexamining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.\nContrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous\nexploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs\npredominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during\nsubsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different\nreasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,\nobscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.\nTo tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce\n\\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the\nGumbel-Softmax trick.

This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences.

The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable.

To\naddress heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC\nfirst standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional\nunification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.\nUnlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,\nIMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment.

    "abstract": "We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system\nthat continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient\nintelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art\n(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each\npatient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle\ndeviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods\nthat require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our\napproach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for\nreactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly\ndetection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical\ndevices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.\nHowever, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been\nsuccessfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By\noperating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system\nproves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade\nequipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,\ntranslating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare\nprofessionals.",

In this way, the tool does not only\nfind exact and syntactically similar near-miss code clones, but also code\nclones that are harder to detect due to their larger variety in the syntax. We\ndemonstrate StoneDetector's versatility as a conventional clone detection\nplatform and analyze its various available configuration parameters, including\nthe usage of different string metrics, hashing algorithms, etc. In our\nexhaustive evaluation with other conventional clone detectors on several\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks, we can show StoneDetector's performance and\nscalability in finding code clones in both, Java source and Bytecode.",

    "abstract": "Superconducting qubits have achieved exceptional gate fidelities, exceeding\nthe error-correction threshold in recent years. One key ingredient of such\nimprovement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the\nqubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant\nquantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step\ntoward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux\ncontrol (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and\ncouplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein\nmagnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits\nor couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux\nbias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In\nthis study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a\nmultiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout\nfor couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits\nand couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise\ncompensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line\ncrosstalk from 56.5$\\,$permille$\\,$to 0.13$\\,$permille$\\,$ which is close to\nstatistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading\nto a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free\ncalculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a\nnear-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system. These results highlight\nthe effectiveness of our approach in enhancing flux crosstalk-free control and\nsupporting its potential for scaling superconducting quantum processors.",

    "abstract": "The reduction of the fragment assembly problem to (variations of) the\nclassical Eulerian trail problem [Pevzner et al., PNAS 2001] has led to\nremarkable progress in genome assembly. This reduction employs the notion of de\nBruijn graph $G=(V,E)$ of order $k$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$. A single\nEulerian trail in $G$ represents a candidate genome reconstruction. Bernardini\net al. have also introduced the complementary idea in data privacy [ALENEX\n2020] based on $z$-anonymity.\n  The pressing question is: How hard is it to reconstruct a best string from a\nde Bruijn graph given a function that models domain knowledge? Such a function\nmaps every length-$k$ string to an interval of positions where it may occur in\nthe reconstructed string. By the above reduction to de Bruijn graphs, the\nlatter function translates into a function $c$ mapping every edge to an\ninterval where it may occur in an Eulerian trail. This gives rise to the\nfollowing basic problem on graphs: Given an instance $(G,c)$, can we\nefficiently compute an Eulerian trail respecting $c$? Hannenhalli et\nal.~[CABIOS 1996] formalized this problem and showed that it is NP-complete.\n  We focus on parametrization aiming to capture the quality of our domain\nknowledge in the complexity. Ben-Dor et al. developed an algorithm to solve the\nproblem on de Bruijn graphs in $O(m \\cdot w^{1.5} 4^{w})$ time, where $m=|E|$\nand $w$ is the maximum interval length over all edges. Bumpus and Meeks\n[Algorithmica 2023] rediscovered the same algorithm on temporal graphs,\nhighlighting the relevance of this problem in other contexts. We give\ncombinatorial insights that lead to exponential-time improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art. For the important class of de Bruijn graphs, we develop an\nalgorithm parametrized by $w (\\log w+1) /(k-1)$. Our improved algorithm shows\nthat it is enough when the range of positions is small relative to $k$.",

While topologically non-trivial\nphases have been identified in certain cases -- such as Te-doped FeSe and\nmonolayer FeSe -- topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In\nthis work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in\nbulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the tetragonal $C_4$ rotational\nsymmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong\ntopological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional\ntheory calculations and analyze the band structure using Topological Quantum\nChemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial\nstrain and temperature-induced structural changes lead to non-trivial band\ntopology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical\nmean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi\nlevel remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate\nrenormalization.

In contrast to the extensively studied toponium\n($t\\bar{t}$) system, analyzed primarily within perturbative QCD, topped mesons\noffer a complementary nonperturbative probe of QCD dynamics in the heavy-quark\nlimit. These states are expected to exhibit longer lifetimes and narrower decay\nwidths than toponium, as only a single top quark undergoes weak decay. We\nemploy QCD sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory to\nstudy the structure and mass spectrum of ground-state topped mesons. Our\nanalysis predicts masses near 173.1 GeV, approximately 0.5-0.6 GeV above the\ntop-quark pole mass. Compared to singly topped baryons ($tqq$, with $q = u, d,\ns$) studied in [arXiv:2507.05895], topped mesons feature a simpler quark\ncomposition and more favorable decay channels, enhancing their potential for\nboth theoretical analysis and experimental discovery.",

Compared to fully connected neural networks,\nPINNs based on convolutional neural networks offer advantages in the hard\nenforcement of boundary conditions and in reducing the computational cost of\npartial derivatives. However, the latter still struggles with slow convergence\nand even failure in some scenarios. In this study, we propose a matrix\npreconditioning method to improve the convergence of the latter. Specifically,\nwe combine automatic differentiation with matrix coloring to compute the\nJacobian matrix of the PDE system, which is used to construct the\npreconditioner via incomplete LU factorization. We subsequently use the\npreconditioner to scale the PDE residual in the loss function in order to\nreduce the condition number of the Jacobian matrix, which is key to improving\nthe convergence of PINNs. To overcome the incompatibility between automatic\ndifferentiation and triangular solves in the preconditioning, we also design a\nframework based on the adjoint method to compute the gradients of the loss\nfunction with respect to the network parameters. By numerical experiments, we\nvalidate that the proposed method successfully and efficiently solves the\nmulti-scale problem and the high Reynolds number problem, in both of which\nPINNs fail to obtain satisfactory results.",

Accordingly, automatically distinguishing\nmisinformation, dubbed as Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an\nincreasingly active research topic. The mainstream methods formulate MD as a\nstatic learning paradigm, which learns the mapping between the content, links,\nand propagation of news articles and the corresponding manual veracity labels.\nHowever, the static assumption is often violated, since in real-world\nscenarios, the veracity of news articles may vacillate within the dynamically\nevolving social environment. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\nframework, namely Misinformation detection with Dynamic Environmental\nRepresentations (MISDER). The basic idea of MISDER lies in learning a social\nenvironmental representation for each period and employing a temporal model to\npredict the representation for future periods. In this work, we specify the\ntemporal model as the LSTM model, continuous dynamics equation, and pre-trained\ndynamics system, suggesting three variants of MISDER, namely MISDER-LSTM,\nMISDER-ODE, and MISDER-PT, respectively. To evaluate the performance of MISDER,\nwe compare it to various MD baselines across 2 prevalent datasets, and the\nexperimental results can indicate the effectiveness of our proposed model.",

However, most existing studies oversimplify the coordination\nsystem, assuming accurate vehicle state information and ideal state update\nprocess. The oversights pose driving risks in the presence of state uncertainty\nand communication constraint. To address this gap, we propose a robust and\ncomprehensive intersection coordination framework consisting of a robust\ncooperative trajectory planner and a context-aware status update scheduler. The\ntrajectory planner directly controls the evolution of the trajectory\ndistributions during frequent vehicle interactions, thereby offering\nprobabilistic safety guarantees. To further align with coordination safety in\npractical bandwidth-limited conditions, we propose a context-aware status\nupdate scheduler that dynamically prioritizes the state updating order of\nvehicles based on their driving urgency. Simulation results validate the\nrobustness and effectiveness of the proposed coordination framework, showing\nthat the collision probability can be significantly reduced while maintaining\ncomparable coordination efficiency to state-of-theart strategies. Moreover, our\nproposed framework demonstrates superior effectiveness in utilizing wireless\nresources in practical uncertain and bandwidth-limited conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cornelis Easton (1864-1929) became a journalist and newspaper editor. During\nmost of his career he was active as an amateur astronomer and contributed\nimportant papers in international astronomical journals This concerned three\nareas. The first was mapping the Milky Way. The book, La Voie Lactee dans\nl'hemisphere boreal, which he published in 1893, made some impression. Since it\nhad in addition to drawings of the surface brightness of the Milky Way, also\nextensive descriptions and discussions of features in the structure and a\ncomprehensive, essentially complete, listing and discussion on everything that\nhad ever been published on the Milky Way. Later he produce an isophotal chart\nand used photographs to improve the map. Easton had been struck by the idea\nthat what he saw was actually a spiral nebula, but then seen edge-on.\nConsidering bright and dark areas he proposed a form for the spiral in the\nMilky Way System with the center in the direction of the constellation Cygnus.\nHis publications on this Theory of the Milky Way in the Astrophysical Journal\nin 1900 and 1913 drew much attention, although many astronomers, including\nJacobus Kapteyn, kept quite some reservations.\n  The third area concerned correlations between surface densities of stars and\nsurface brightness of the Milky Way. Easton maintained that there was such a\ncorrelation for relatively bright stars. T\n  There is a publication Easton failed to include in his list of his\npublications, namely an 1894 short article in Nature. The elliptical companion\nNGC205 of the Andromeda Nebula between had on in 1874 and 1889 rotated by 15\ndegrees. Isophote twists are responsible for the apparent rotation.\n  In 1903 Kapteyn and the University of Groningen bestowed an honorary\ndoctorate upon Easton.",

To address this, we\npropose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that\nexternalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e.,\nthe coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code\ngeneration.

We\nevaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and\nassess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12).

To extract practical\ninsights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution\nanalysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these\ndistinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users\nwith diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with\nseveral LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems.

We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework\nthat learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled\nrepresentations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training\nsolely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible\ndisentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on\narbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion\nmodels and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51\nstyles $\\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement\nthrough systematic style-content pairing.

Compressible turbulence adds\nfurther anomalous dissipation mechanisms, which we investigate in this work. To\nthis end, the Duchon-Robert framework (DR) for anomalous dissipation is\nextended from the incompressible to the compressible Navier-Stokes flow case.\nWe obtain three integral dissipation terms, two anomalous and a viscous one,\nwhich arise from the pressure-dilatation and density variations, differently\nfrom the incompressible case. Subsequently, fully compressible one-dimensional\nflows with traveling and mutually crossing shock waves are analysed in detail.\nIn such flows, DR reveals a local maximum of anomalous dissipation at the shock\nfront. Furthermore, DR is compared with a coarse-grain cascade theory of\ncompressible turbulence due to Aluie (AL) and the relevant dissipation flux\nterms of both frameworks are identified and compared with each other. The\ncomparison shows that each contribution related to the compressibility effects\nin DR has its analogue in AL. Finally, a piecewise linear shock-type velocity\nprofile, which approximates the crossing of two shock waves from the\nsimulations, is used for an analytical analysis of the anomalous dissipation\nterms of DR to analyse the dependence of the terms on the local H\\\"older\nexponent.

To address these challenges, we\npropose DeepAP, an efficient and accurate two-stage deep learning framework for\naperture photometry. Specifically, for a given source, we first train a Vision\nTransformer (ViT) model to assess its feasibility of aperture photometry. We\nthen train the Residual Neural Network (ResNet) to predict its optimal aperture\nsize. For aperture photometry feasibility assessment, the ViT model yields an\nROC AUC value of 0.96, and achieves a precision of 0.974, a recall of 0.930,\nand an F1 score of 0.952 on the test set. For aperture size prediction, the\nResNet model effectively mitigates biases inherent in classical growth curve\nmethods by adaptively selecting apertures appropriate for sources of varying\nbrightness, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across a wide\nrange of targets. Meanwhile, some samples in the test set have a higher SNR\nthan those obtained by exhaustive aperture size enumeration because of the\nfiner granularity of aperture size estimation. By integrating ResNet with the\nViT network, the DeepAP framework achieves a median total processing time of 18\nmilliseconds for a batch of 10 images, representing a speed-up of approximately\n59000 times compared to exhaustive aperture size enumeration.

    "abstract": "Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which\nare closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons\nhave dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of\ncapturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,\nand capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and\nsilhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D\nsilhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly\nestimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new\nmodality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In\naddition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been\ndeveloped to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.\nExtensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed\nDepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and\nattains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.",

While recent studies have begun\nto address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static\nerrors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,\nwe propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error\ngeneration and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG\ninvolves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which \"hides\" by generating subtle,\ndeceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which \"seeks\" to accurately detect\nthem. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic\nprecision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that\nHSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\\%--31.4\\% higher\naccuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of\ndeceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.",

To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods\nmerge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose MEEtBrain, a portable and multimodal framework for\nemotion analysis (valence/arousal), integrating AI-generated music stimuli with\nsynchronized EEG-fNIRS acquisition via a wireless headband. By MEEtBrain, the\nmusic stimuli can be automatically generated by AI on a large scale,\neliminating subjective selection biases while ensuring music diversity.

Pure data-driven deep\nlearning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding\nduring training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their\napplicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nU-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully\ndeep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational\nEM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational\nefficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers\nand the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the\ndecomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a\nmultiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a\nphysics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-\nand mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)\nobjects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering\nmodeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.\nExperimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface\ncurrent distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while\nsignificantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep\nlearning baselines in both accuracy and robustness.

    "abstract": "General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on\ndomain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models\n(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not\ninterpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in\nneurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on\ndomain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on\ndomain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.",

While prior research\nhas primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,\ntheir potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To\nfill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),\na new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two\nreasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.\nSpecifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:\none in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of\nThinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,\nusing a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both\ncandidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\\%\nin GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,\nresulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms\nfew-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer\nrobustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to\ntraining-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on\nout-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the\ncalibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes\nconsistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural\nthinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between\nactual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round\nof thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach.

A random temporal graph generated by the RST\nmodel is a sequence of independent samples drawn from $\\mu$.\n  We initiate a systematic study of the Temporal Graph Exploration problem in\nsuch random temporal graphs and establish tight general bounds on exploration\ntime. Our first main result proves that any RST model can, with high\nprobability (w.h.p.), be explored in $O(n^{3/2})$ time, and we show that this\nbound is tight up to a constant factor. This demonstrates a fundamental\ndifference between the adversarial and random settings. Our second main result\nshows that if all trees of an RST are subgraphs of a fixed graph with $m$ edges\nthen, w.h.p.\\ , it can be explored in $O(m)$ time.",

In this study, we\npropose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual\nand cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for\nspeech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal\npipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning\nEnglish and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,\nCIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade\nsubstantially when transferred across domains.

Furthermore, we explore\nlightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which\nsignificantly improves generalization in target domains.

This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,\nwhich severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a\nnovel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach\nenables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference\nby strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that\nleverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal\nreasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps\ncontinuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from\nlarge-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,\nencoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of\ndegradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to\ndistribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.\nTherefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to\nsystematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level\nCausal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with\nthe brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a\nFeature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective\nAttention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by\nillumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while\nenhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible\nfeature-level intervention.

    "abstract": "Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a promising research field for\nenhancing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) without extra\ntraining. However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and\nSelf-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model\n(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling\n(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that\nthe proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be\nreleased at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.",

However,\nit remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular\ndata tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world\napplications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular\ndata, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks\nusing five real-world datasets and four common ML models.

Recent observational studies found\nthat dynamically-old GCs have P1 and P2 spatially mixed due to relaxation\nprocesses. However, in dynamically-young GCs, where P2 is expected to be more\ncentrally concentrated from birth, the spatial distributions of P1 and P2 are\nsometimes very different from system to system. This suggests that more complex\ndynamical processes specific to certain GCs might have shaped those\ndistributions. We aim to investigate the discrepancies between the spatial\nconcentration of P1 and P2 stars in dynamically-young GCs. Our focus is to\nevaluate whether massive binary stars (e.g. BHs) can cause the expansion of the\nP2 stars through binary-single interactions in the core, and whether they can\nmix or even radially invert the P1 and P2 distributions. We use a set of\ntheoretical and empirical arguments to evaluate the effectiveness of\nbinary-single star scattering. We then construct a set of direct N-body models\nwith massive primordial binaries to verify our estimates further and gain more\ninsights into the dynamical processes in GCs. We find that binary-single star\nscatterings can push the central P2 stars outwards within a few relaxation\ntimes. While we do not produce radial inversion of P1 and P2 for any initial\nconditions we tested, this mechanism systematically produces clusters where P1\nand P2 look fully mixed even in projection.

    "abstract": "While TLS has become the de-facto standard for end-to-end security, its use\nto secure critical communication in evolving industrial IoT scenarios is\nseverely limited by prevalent resource constraints of devices and networks.\nMost notably, the TLS handshake to establish secure connections incurs\nsignificant bandwidth and processing overhead that often cannot be handled in\nconstrained environments. To alleviate this situation, we present BiTHaC which\nrealizes bidirectional TLS handshake caching by exploiting that significant\nparts of repeated TLS handshakes, especially certificates, are static. Thus,\nredundant information neither needs to be transmitted nor corresponding\ncomputations performed, saving valuable bandwidth and processing resources. By\nimplementing BiTHaC for wolfSSL, we show that we can reduce the bandwidth\nconsumption of TLS handshakes by up to 61.1% and the computational overhead by\nup to 8.5%, while incurring only well-manageable memory overhead and preserving\nthe strict security guarantees of TLS.",

    "abstract": "The hydrated electron ($e_{aq}^-$), a key species in radiation chemistry, is\ntraditionally modeled as an interior electron confined within a solvent cavity\nand stabilized by electrostatic interactions. However, this picture fails to\naccount for its high binding energy and discrete excited states, as the cavity\nlacks sufficient dipole strength to support deep electronic confinement. Using\n\\textit{ab initio} methods that capture resonant interactions between the free\nelectron and water, we show that the hydrated electron is stabilized through\ncovalent delocalization. Existing approaches misrepresent this as electrostatic\ntrapping within a cavity -- an interpretation rooted in assumptions of a\npre-bound electron and the omission of the resonant character of the initial\ninteraction between the free electron and water. Our results reveal that the\nelectron forms transient negative ion molecular states through resonant\nattachment to neighboring water molecules, where it is initially captured, and\ndelocalizes over them via an intermolecular bonding network formed by the\nsuperposition of $a_1$ valence orbitals. This covalent delocalization yields\ncavity-like structures without requiring electrostatic trapping and naturally\nexplains observed spectral features, including higher-nodal excited states and\nenhanced binding energies. In short, cavity formation is initiated by\n\\textit{associative electron attachment (AEA)} -- a molecular process driven by\na resonant interaction between the free electron and its neighboring water\nmolecules, and wherein the electron becomes covalently shared to them -- during\nthe energy dissipation phase of the free electron preceding full solvation.",

The\nlocalized purification designed for HVTs is, however, ineffective against SVTs,\nwhich globally perturb benign features. We therefore model an SVT-poisoned\ninput as a mixture of a trigger and benign features, where we unconventionally\ntreat the benign features as \"noise\". This formulation allows us to reconstruct\nSVTs by applying a denoising process that removes these benign \"noise\"\nfeatures. The SVT-free input is then obtained by subtracting the reconstructed\ntrigger. Finally, to neutralize the nearly imperceptible but fragile LVTs, we\nintroduce lightweight noise to disrupt the trigger pattern and then apply DDPM\nto restore any collateral impact on clean features. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art defenses. Compared\nwith baselines, BDFirewall reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average\nof 33.25%, improving poisoned sample accuracy (PA) by 29.64%, and achieving up\nto a 111x speedup in inference time.

To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation\nprotocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision\nScoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to\nresolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware\nRetrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to\nquantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple\nmodels with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate\nthat HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately\nrecovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and\nreliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.",

A key advantage of this framework is its ability to derive reduced\nmodels independent of a clear timescale separation in the variables which, in\nturn, means less-restricted parameter regimes. We demonstrate our approach on\ntwo benchmark systems. For the Michaelis-Menten (MM) reaction, we derive a\nunique model reduction for normally hyperbolic and attracting critical\nmanifolds of a specific parameter configuration.

In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and\nProgressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive\nsemantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text\ndescription of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the\nlack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf\ntext-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring\nsource domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images\nintroduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images\ncannot be precisely maintained.

    "abstract": "Galaxy image translation is an important application in galaxy physics and\ncosmology. With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has\nbeen performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information\nextraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly\ndetection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the\npixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack\nof discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical\ninformation, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely\non high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the\neffectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical\ninformation (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and\nmorphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin\nTransformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS\nand CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of\nincapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures\nof galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In\nparticular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain\nmeaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable\nuncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to\nthe nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images\nmay still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise\nfor downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly\nrequired. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical\ninformation is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the\ndevelopment of image translation models for scientific use.",

We introduce a new low-energy two-band model of rhombohedral\ngraphene that captures the band structure more accurately than previous models\nwhile keeping the number of parameters low.

We also find that the exciton shift is\nelectrically tunable: by varying the electric field strength, the exciton\nWannier centre can be exchanged between inequivalent corners of the moir\\'e\nunit cell. Our results suggest the possibility of detecting excitonic corner or\nedge modes, as well as novel excitonic crystal defect responses in hBN/R5G/hBN.\nLastly, we find that the excitons in hBN/R5G/hBN inherit excitonic Berry\ncurvature from the underlying electronic bands, enriching their semiclassical\ntransport properties.

As a result, researchers have attempted to\nadapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing\nextra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the\nsuperior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their\nbase KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this\npaper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods\nand then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our\nresults show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of\nHKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods\nalter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.\nMoreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in\ncapturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate\nmain-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.\nTo further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE\nresearch, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a\nqualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based\ngraph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an\nimproved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to\nmitigate compression issues.

It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed\nbehavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon\n(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most\nexisting approaches treat these two components as independent classification\ntasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking\ntheir inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented\nrepresentations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct\nthe egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting\nstrategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified\nPrompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component\nrepresentations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and\nnouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair\nform. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an\nattention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure\nthe prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training\nobjective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two\nperspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge\nOrthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,\nEPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and\nbase-to-novel generalization benchmarks.",

Consequently, they\noften impart the model with excessive stability (i.e., retention of old\nknowledge) but limited plasticity (i.e., acquisition of new knowledge). To\naddress this issue, we propose a Stability-Plasticity Trade-off (SPT) method\nfor CNER that balances these aspects from both representation and weight\nperspectives. From the representation perspective, we introduce a pooling\noperation into the original KD, permitting a level of plasticity by\nconsolidating representation dimensions. From the weight perspective, we\ndynamically merge the weights of old and new models, strengthening old\nknowledge while maintaining new knowledge. During this fusion, we implement a\nweight-guided selective mechanism to prioritize significant weights. Moreover,\nwe develop a confidence-based pseudo-labeling approach for the current\nnon-entity type, which predicts entity types using the old model to handle the\nsemantic shift of the non-entity type, a challenge specific to CNER that has\nlargely been ignored by previous methods.

Existing optimization strategies for\ndeploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires\nextensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the\ncomputational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this\npaper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective\nscheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse\ntasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies\nperiodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an\nAdaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic\nUpdate Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed\nqueries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and\nminimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler\ndynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted\nperformance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific\nfeatures as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and\nscheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to\nenhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based\nsoftware engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation.

Real-world data acquisition is\nconstrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while\nexisting synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or\ninconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods\ntypically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often\ndistort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and\ntext-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,\nundermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality\nsynthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles\nwhile preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon\nthe diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from\nexisting datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup\ntransfer method that disentangles identity and makeup.

A giant impact on Venus\ncould have affected its rotation rate and possibly its thermal evolution. In\nthis work, we explore a range of possible impacts using smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH). We consider the final major collision, assuming that\ndifferentiation already occurred and that Venus consists of an iron core (30%\nof Venus' mass) and a forsterite mantle (70% of Venus' mass). We use\ndifferentiated impactors with masses ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 Earth masses,\nimpact velocities between 10 and 15 km/s, various impact geometries (head-on\nand oblique), different primordial thermal profiles, and a range of pre-impact\nrotation rates of Venus. We analyse the post-impact rotation periods and debris\ndisc masses to identify scenarios that can reproduce Venus' present-day\ncharacteristics. Our findings show that a wide range of impact scenarios are\nconsistent with Venus' current rotation. These include head-on collisions on a\nnon-rotating Venus and oblique, hit-and-run impacts by Mars-sized bodies on a\nrotating Venus. Importantly, collisions that match Venus' present-day rotation\nrate typically produce minimal debris discs residing within Venus' synchronous\norbit. This suggests that the material would likely reaccrete onto the planet,\npreventing the formation of long-lasting satellites - consistent with Venus'\nlack of a moon. We conclude that a giant impact can be consistent with both\nVenus' unusual rotation and lack of a moon, potentially setting the stage for\nits subsequent thermal evolution.",

This pest is widely distributed, particularly in\nnortheastern China, the country's primary soybean-producing region, where its\noutbreaks have significantly affected both yield and quality. Although\nstatistical and mechanistic models have been applied to pest forecasting,\nexisting approaches often fail to effectively integrate climatic factors with\npest dynamics and lack sufficient expressive power. To address these\nlimitations, this study proposes a novel pest prediction method based on\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

We evaluate\nPCM-NN using daily monitoring data of soybean pod borer collected in Changchun,\nJilin Province, from July to September during 2020-2023.

    "abstract": "Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of\nexecuting long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing\nembodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and\ncoarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce\nCookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios.\nBy leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful\nUnity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic\nenvironment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process.\nFirst, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's\ncomplex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the\nidentified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of\nphysical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the\naction granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational\ninformation while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We\nprovide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified\nAPI supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing\ningredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical\ninteraction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and\ndecision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of\nstate-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model,\nrevealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex,\nlong-horizon tasks. The full benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate\nfuture research.",

In this paper, we aim to resolve\nthis issue. First, we present an exact time-domain signal model for OFDM-based\ngrant-free access under frequency-selective fading. Then, we present a maximum\na posteriori (MAP)-based device activity detection problem and two minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE)-based channel estimation problems. The MAP-based device\nactivity detection problem and one of the MMSE-based channel estimation\nproblems are formulated for the first time. Next, we build a new factor graph\nthat captures the exact statistics of time-domain channels and device\nactivities. Based on it, we propose two approximate message passing (AMP)-based\nalgorithms, AMP-A-EC and AMP-A-AC, to approximately solve the MAP-based device\nactivity detection problem and two MMSE-based channel estimation problems. Both\nproposed algorithms alleviate the AMP's inherent convergence problem when the\npilot length is smaller or comparable to the number of active devices. Then, we\nanalyze AMP-A-EC's error probability of activity detection and mean square\nerror (MSE) of channel estimation via state evolution and show that AMP-A-AC\nhas the lower computational complexity (in dominant term).

BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate\nspecific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while\nmaintaining normal functionality in the remaining components. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate and low\nperceptual quality loss , even under extremely constrained computational\nresources and GPU time. Moreover, BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense\nframeworks, especially the attention-based backdoor detection method,\nhighlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat. Ablation studies further\ndemonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the\nentire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers\nin backdoor mapping. Overall, BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to\nconducting backdoor attacks in all aspects. It enables attackers to inject\nbackdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.",

    "abstract": "Modern MRI relies on the well-established Echo-Planar-Imaging (EPI) method\nfor fast acquisition. EPI is the workhorse of diffusion and functional MRI in\nneuroscience as well as of many dynamic applications for clinical body imaging.\nIts speed stems from rapidly switching currents through the gradient coils\nresponsible for spatial encoding. These quick changes, within a strong static\nmagnetic field induce Lorentz forces that generate mechanical vibrations,\nleading to the loud, characteristic MRI noise. This acoustic noise is already a\nsignificant concern in standard clinical scanners, requiring hearing protection\nand risking image degradation or even hardware strain. In ultra-high-field\nsystems, the issue is exacerbated due to stronger Lorentz forces. In this\nstudy, we introduce a novel model that characterizes the acoustic spectrum for\na given EPI scan. The spectrum results from interference between multiple\nidentical periods of alternating currents, making the relative timing between\nthem a key factor. We show that even subtle timing changes significantly alter\nthe sound level. Scans of either high spatial resolution or high temporal\nresolution, on clinical 7T and investigational 10.5T human scanners,\ncorroborated the model and its predicted acoustics spectra. Acoustic energy\nchanges of up to 47-fold were reached in close to mechanical resonances and up\nto 5-fold in other regions. Intriguingly, under certain conditions, doubling\nthe acquisitions per unit time actually reduced the minimal acoustic energy\ntwo-fold. Not less important, ghosting-artifacts exhibit strong dependence on\nthe scan's acoustic characteristics and the benefit of subtle time delays of\ninternal correction-acquisitions (navigators) is also demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due\nto the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in\nhigh-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress\nof general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action\nestimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.\nTo this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,\nActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of\nlearning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink\nreformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,\ncalled \"action flow\", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be\nretrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,\nActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a\ncoarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of\naction flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is\na dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that\ndynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be\nused to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a\nmulti-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action\nflows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate\naction estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our\nActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\\%\nsuccess rate, and obtained nearly an 8\\% accuracy gain on the challenging\nlong-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the influence of token\nrouting algorithms on market performance and stakeholder outcomes remain\nunderexplored. This paper introduces the concept of Standardized Total\nArbitrage Profit (STAP), computed via convex optimization, as a systematic\nmeasure of DEX efficiency. We prove that executing the trade order maximizing\nSTAP and reintegrating the resulting transaction fees eliminates all arbitrage\nopportunities-both cyclic arbitrage within DEXs and between DEXs and\ncentralized exchanges (CEXs). In a fully efficient DEX (i.e., STAP = 0), the\nmonetary value of target tokens received must not exceed that of the source\ntokens, regardless of the routing algorithm. Any violation indicates arbitrage\npotential, making STAP a reliable metric for arbitrage detection. Using a token\ngraph comprising 11 tokens and 18 liquidity pools based on Uniswap V2 data, we\nobserve a decline in DEX efficiency between June 21 and November 8, 2024.\nSimulations comparing two routing algorithms-Yu Zhang et al.'s line-graph-based\nmethod and the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm-show that employing more\nprofitable routing improves DEX efficiency and trader returns over time.\nMoreover, while total value locked (TVL) remains stable with the line-graph\nmethod, it increases under the DFS algorithm, indicating greater aggregate\nbenefits for liquidity providers.",

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating\ncode with programming languages and could potentially aid in system model\ndevelopment, no benchmarks currently exist for evaluating their ability to\ngenerate system models with specific description languages. We present\nSysMBench, which comprises 151 human-curated scenarios spanning a wide range of\npopular domains and varying difficulty levels.

The\nrequirements description is fed as user input to the LLM, the system model with\ndescription language is used to verify if the generated system model conforms\nto the requirements, and the visualized diagram serves to support manual\nvalidation. We introduce SysMEval, a semantic-aware evaluation metric to\nevaluate the quality of generated system models. We evaluate 17 popular LLMs on\nthis task with three traditional metrics and SysMEval, from directly prompting\nto three commonly used enhancement strategies.

    "abstract": "This study investigates bifurcation dynamics in an SIRS epidemic model with\ncubic saturated incidence, extending the quadratic saturation framework\nestablished by Lu, Huang, Ruan, and Yu (Journal of Differential Equations, 267,\n2019). We rigorously prove the existence of codimension-three Bogdanov-Takens\nbifurcations and degenerate Hopf bifurcations, demonstrating, for the first\ntime in epidemiological modeling, the coexistence of three limit cycles. By\ninnovatively applying singularity theory, we characterize the topology of the\nbifurcation set through the local unfolding of singularities and the\nidentification of nondegenerate singularities for fronts. Our results reveal\nthat cubic nonlinearities induce significantly richer dynamical structures than\nquadratic models under both monotonic and nonmonotonic saturation. Numerical\nsimulations verify three limit cycles in monotonic parameter regimes and two\nlimit cycles in nonmonotonic regimes. This work advances existing bifurcation\nresearch by incorporating higher-order interactions and comprehensive\nsingularity analysis, thereby providing a mathematical foundation for decoding\ncomplex transmission mechanisms that are critical to the design of public\nhealth strategies.",

Further numerous generalizations of the classical Hess case were\nproposed, which take place during the motion of a heavy rigid body and a\ngyrostat with a fixed point in various force fields.\n  The first studies that provided a qualitative description of the motion of a\nheavy rigid body in the integrable Hess case were published almost immediately\nafter this case was found. In 1892 P.A.

A similar result regarding the problem of\nthe motion of a heavy gyrostat in the Hess - Sretensky case was presented by\nSretensky.\n  In this paper we present the derivation of the corresponding second order\nlinear differential equation and reduce the coefficients of this equation to\nthe form of rational functions.

To\nfurther prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy\nexceeds a provable threshold.

In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography\nangiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological\nchanges, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,\naccurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for\nclinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular\nCNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and\nboundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets\nconstraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper\nconstructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a\nnovel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation\nnetwork (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological\ninformation, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the\ngraph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two\ngraph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)\nand Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework\nencodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the\nimage into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason\nabout higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,\nenabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,\nan uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts\nand noise on segmentation accuracy.

This advancement is underpinned by the concept\nof Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training\ndata enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed\nbreakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and\nadvanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its\npotential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for\ndecision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by\nsystematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,\nand training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data\nefficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the\nrelationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we\ninvestigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,\nensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which\ncollectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational\nchallenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of\ndistributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary\ntraining on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these\nstrategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in\nadvancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future\nresearch. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with\ncomputational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging\nscaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot\ncontrol, autonomous driving and LLM training.",

This assumption often does\nnot hold in real-world speech systems, where distribution shifts are common due\nto varying environments, recording conditions, and speaker diversity.\n  The method of Domain Shifts with Uncertainty (DSU) augments the input of each\nneural network layer based on the input feature statistics. It addresses the\nproblem of out-of-domain generalization by assuming feature statistics follow a\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution and substitutes the input with sampled\nfeatures from this distribution. While effective for computer vision, applying\nDSU to speech presents challenges due to the nature of the data. Unlike static\nvisual data, speech is a temporal signal commonly represented by a spectrogram\n- the change of frequency over time. This representation cannot be treated as a\nsimple image, and the resulting sparsity can lead to skewed feature statistics\nwhen applied to the entire input.\n  To tackle out-of-distribution issues in keyword spotting, we propose\nPatchDSU, which extends DSU by splitting the input into patches and\nindependently augmenting each patch. We evaluated PatchDSU and DSU alongside\nother methods on the Google Speech Commands, Librispeech, and TED-LIUM.\nAdditionally, we evaluated performance under white Gaussian and MUSAN music\nnoise conditions. We also explored out-of-domain generalization by analyzing\nmodel performance on datasets they were not trained on. Overall, in most cases,\nboth PatchDSU and DSU outperform other methods.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors\ncontinuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery\ndetection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn\nnew forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,\na phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling\nthem to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while\nleaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for\naddressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant\nlimitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional\nimages, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images\nlack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when\nfeatures from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to\ndistinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the\nsame regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery\nDetection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector\n(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift\nCompensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional\nimage inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity.

    "abstract": "A common assumption in evolutionary thought is that adaptation drives an\nincrease in biological complexity. However, the rules governing evolution of\ncomplexity appear more nuanced. Evolution is deeply connected to learning,\nwhere complexity is much better understood, with established results on optimal\ncomplexity appropriate for a given learning task. In this work, we suggest a\nmathematical framework for studying the relationship between evolved organismal\ncomplexity and enviroenmntal complexity by leveraging a mathematical\nisomorphism between evolutionary dynamics and learning theory. Namely, between\nthe replicator equation and sequential Bayesian learning, with evolving types\ncorresponding to competing hypotheses and fitness in a given environment to\nlikelihood of observed evidence. In Bayesian learning, implicit regularization\nprevents overfitting and drives the inference of hypotheses whose complexity\nmatches the learning challenge. We show how these results naturally carry over\nto the evolutionary setting, where they are interpreted as organism complexity\nevolving to match the complexity of the environment, with too complex or too\nsimple organisms suffering from \\textit{overfitness} and \\textit{underfitness},\nrespectively. Other aspects, peculiar to evolution and not to learning, reveal\nadditional trends. One such trend is that frequently changing environments\ndecrease selected complexity, a result with potential implications to both\nevolution and learning. Together, our results suggest that the balance between\nover-adaptation to transient environmental features, and insufficient\nflexiblity in responding to environmental challenges, drives the emergence of\noptimal complexity, reflecting environmental structure. This framework offers\nnew ways of thinking about biological complexity, suggesting new potential\ncauses for it to increase or decrease in different environments.",

In this paper, we propose a new scenario where\nVerilog code must be optimized for specific attributes without leaking\nsensitive IP information.

Our\napproach employs local small LLMs (e.g., Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B) to perform secure\ncomparative analysis between paired high-quality target designs and novice\ndraft codes, yielding general design principles that summarize key insights for\nimprovements. These principles are then used to query stronger cloud LLMs\n(e.g., Deepseek-V3) for targeted code improvement, ensuring that only\nabstracted and IP-safe guidance reaches external services. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that the framework achieves significantly higher\noptimization success rates compared to baseline methods.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable\nrendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on\ncomputationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in\nsignificant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this\npaper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy\nGaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve\nphotorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the\noverhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for\nlocal Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further\nacceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent\nTransparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering\ntechnique that simultaneously eliminates \"popping\" and \"transparency\"\nartifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.\nExtensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the\nrobustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale\ntraining views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the\nadvantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving\nhigh-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT\nbased Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix\nsort overhead without quality degradation.",

Specifically, we first generate\ninstructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain\nvalid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard,\neasy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to\ncurate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization\nof the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns.\nSubsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning\n(Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL)\nreinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach\nencourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering\ngeneralizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.\nExtensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate\nremarkable performance improvements across various model scales.

    "abstract": "Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current\nneural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to\nbe 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes\nthe training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the\n\"target-approach-1\" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all\nsamples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already\nbeen classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply\nrequires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve\nthe above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which\ndesigns a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For\nmore purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores\ncompared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on\nlearning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is\nalso the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,\ntext multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio\nclassification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show\nthat AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss\nof AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in\nvalidation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring\nabout 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while\nmaintaining classification effectiveness.",

This is one of the\nleast luminous targets of the Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages\n(POETS) survey, which has been recently carried out to study young outflow\nemission on scales of 10-100 au. The combination of multi-epoch water maser\nvery long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations with sensitive Jansky\nVery Large Array (JVLA) continuum and Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) H$_2$\n2.12 $\\mu$m observations, allows us to study the protostellar outflows from the\nintermediate-mass binary system VLA 3A and 3B, separated by ~0.22\", and from\nVLA 2, an intermediate-mass YSO placed ~1\" to northwest of VLA 3. Toward VLA 2,\nthe 2001 and 2011 Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations consistently\nshow that the water masers are tracing a jet. The analysis of the 3D flow\nvelocities proves that the jet is magneto-centrifugally launched in a\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind (DW). We infer launch radii in the range\n10-50 au for the streamlines traced by the water masers. The global VLBI 2023\nwater maser observations indicate that the jet propagation can be hindered by a\nvery dense clump placed northeast of VLA 2 and that is consistent with the\nlarge-scale LBT H$_2$ emission, tracing only the southwest lobe of the VLA 2\njet. Instead, the parallel jets emitted by the nearby YSOs VLA 3A and 3B can be\nreliably tracked with the H$_2$ emission at scales of a few 10\" to both the\nsouthwest and the northeast. In particular, northeast of VLA 3 the direction of\nthese two jets crosses a linear chain of spaced H$_2$ knots, which is a clear\nsignature of an episodic jet. The variable ejection from VLA 3B, witnessed by\nthe water masers at scales of ~10 au, could be the origin of the episodic jet\nobserved at larger scales.",

Recent\nmachine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their\nreliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their\napplicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities\ndriven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual\ndata, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.\nTo address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM\nwith chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox\ncombines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)\nterms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step\nreasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional\nmachine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance\nacross various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we\nfind that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier\nfor LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and\nimproves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug\ndevelopment, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and\nincorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This\napproach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with\nphysiological responses, as shown in case study.

However, the success of these state-of-the-art\nmodels largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which\nlack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises\nquestions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.\nTo address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel\ninformation-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should\nbe a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based\non this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space\nModel (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by\noptimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach\nencourages the model to maximally compress historical information without\nlosing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and\nspurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nsignificantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy\nscenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness.

Using output measurements, a\nlaw with weighted sampling error is used to determine the sampling sequence\nbetween the system and the observer. The observer dynamics are designed using\nthe standard Luenberger structure with the event-based sampled output\ninformation, which is updated only when an event occurs. Assuming observability\nand sufficient conditions for the positivity of the system, the asymptotic\nstability of the observer dynamics with sampled information is established.\nSufficient conditions of stability and positivity are derived using linear\nmatrix inequalities. Moreover, the design ensures that the event-based\narchitecture is free from Zeno behavior, ensuring a positive minimum bound on\nthe inter-execution time.

In the nonlinear regime, high harmonic of ion acoustic wave (IAW) leads\nto the reduction of saturation level at high laser intensities ($I\\gtrsim\n10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{W/cm^2}$).

    "abstract": "IoT environments such as smart homes are susceptible to privacy inference\nattacks, where attackers can analyze patterns of encrypted network traffic to\ninfer the state of devices and even the activities of people. While most\nexisting attacks exploit ML techniques for discovering such traffic patterns,\nthey underperform on wireless traffic, especially Wi-Fi, due to its heavy noise\nand packet losses of wireless sniffing. In addition, these approaches commonly\ntarget at distinguishing chunked IoT event traffic samples, and they failed at\neffectively tracking multiple events simultaneously. In this work, we propose\nWiFinger, a fine-grained multi-IoT event fingerprinting approach against noisy\ntraffic. WiFinger turns the traffic pattern classification task into a\nsubsequence matching problem and introduces novel techniques to account for the\nhigh time complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms existing approaches on Wi-Fi traffic, achieving an\naverage recall of 85% (vs. 0.49% and 0.46%) for various IoT events while\nmaintaining almost zero false positives for most of them.",

    "abstract": "Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content\nthrough natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as\nsemantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent\ninversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved\npromising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in\ntheir editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in\nthe inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This\nissue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are\ndissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure\nor unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a\ntraining-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the\ninverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and\ncontrollability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and\ngeneral-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural\nmodification or model fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively\nanticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional\nnavigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for\ndynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a\nresult, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when\nhandling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language\nmodels and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive\nhazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping\nframework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential\ndynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling\nrobots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this\nlanguage-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only\nidentifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around\npotential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated\nand diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method\nsignificantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters,\ncompared to reactive baseline planners.

    "abstract": "The generation of a long story consisting of several thousand words is a\nsub-task in the field of long text generation~(LTG). Previous research has\naddressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a\nmulti-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach\nsuffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the\nloss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic\nthat are less appealing to human readers.\n  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to\nimprove the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core\ncomponents of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model\ncomprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most\nimportant memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory\nstorage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To\nincorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle\nframework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain\nfactors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates\nthe similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by\nbuilding a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we\nestablish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction\nthrough dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it\nremains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods\ndemonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the formulation of a distributionally robust Markov\ngame (DR-MG) with average rewards, a crucial framework for multi-agent\ndecision-making under uncertainty over extended horizons. Unlike finite-horizon\nor discounted models, the average-reward criterion naturally captures long-term\nperformance for systems designed for continuous operation, where sustained\nreliability is paramount. We account for uncertainty in transition kernels,\nwith players aiming to optimize their worst-case average reward. We first\nestablish a connection between the multi-agent and single agent settings, and\nderive the solvability of the robust Bellman equation under the average-reward\nformulation. We then rigorously prove the existence of a robust Nash\nEquilibrium (NE), offering essential theoretical guarantees for system\nstability. We further develop and analyze an algorithm named robust\nNash-Iteration to compute the robust Nash Equilibria among all agents,\nproviding practical tools for identifying optimal strategies in complex,\nuncertain, and long-running multi-player environments. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe connection between the average-reward NE and the well-studied discounted\nNEs, showing that the former can be approximated as the discount factor\napproaches one. Together, these contributions provide a comprehensive\ntheoretical and algorithmic foundation for identifying optimal strategies in\ncomplex, uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments, which allow for\nthe future extension of robust average-reward single-agent problems to the\nmulti-agent setting.",

A necessary enabler to this capability is to\nfind and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,\nsuch as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,\nwhereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost\nof more demanding computational resources which might not be available on\nspace-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods\nare not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of\ninterest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to\nlarge biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the\nreal-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state\nestimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a\nchaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast\nFEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed\nto leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking\nsensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours\nto their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to\nthe motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an\nattention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly\ntrained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames.

    "abstract": "Accurately identifying the material composition of objects is a critical\ncapability for AI robots powered by large language models (LLMs) to perform\ncontext-aware manipulation. Radar technologies offer a promising sensing\nmodality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar\ntechnologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of\nvarious objects. However, existing radar-based solutions are often constrained\nto closed-set object categories and typically require task-specific data\ncollection to train deep learning models, largely limiting their practical\napplicability. This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful\nreasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material\ncomposition from raw radar signals? Answering this question is non-trivial due\nto the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs\nhave no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we\nintroduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using\nLLM to identify materials directly from radar signals. First, we introduce a\nphysics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar\nraw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the\nmaterial's intrinsic characteristics. Second, we adopt a retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) strategy to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge,\nenabling it to interpret and reason over the extracted intermediate parameters.\nLeveraging this integration, the LLM is empowered to perform step-by-step\nreasoning on the condensed radar features, achieving open-set material\nrecognition directly from raw radar signals. Preliminary results show that\nLLMaterial can effectively distinguish among a variety of common materials,\nhighlighting its strong potential for real-world material identification\napplications.",

Existing methods either address unobserved\nconfounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback\nbut under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer\neffect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning\nframework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an\ninstrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback\nand unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and\nhigh-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to\ndisentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the\nsimultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct\nvalid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on\nthese IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the\nunobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network\naugmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as\na control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no\nresidual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in\ncapturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances\nthe effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and\nhidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard\nregularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect.\nEmpirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset\ndemonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.",

The ionic\nmechanisms underlying action potentials in the squid giant axon were first\ndescribed by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 and their findings have formed our\northodox view of how the physiological action potential functions. However,\nsubstan-tial evidence has now accumulated to show that the action potential is\naccompanied by a syn-chronized coupled soliton pressure pulse in the cell\nmembrane, the action potential pulse (AP-Pulse) which we have recently shown to\nhave an essential function in computation. Here we ex-plore the interactions\nbetween the soliton and the ionic mechanisms known to be associated with the\naction potential. Computational models of the action potential usually describe\nit as a binary event, but we have shown that it must be a quantum ternary event\nknown as the computa-tional action potential (CAP), whose temporal fixed point\nis the threshold of the soliton, rather than the rather plastic action\npotential peak used in other models to facilitate meaningful compu-tation. We\nhave demonstrated this type of frequency computation for the retina, in detail,\nand also provided an extensive analysis for computation for other brain neural\nnetworks. The CAP ac-companies the APPulse and the Physiological action\npotential. Therefore, we conclude that nerve impulses appear to be an ensemble\nof three inseparable, interdependent, concurrent states: the physiological\naction potential, the APPulse and the CAP.

    "abstract": "Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are\ncritical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the\ninherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with\nvarious cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on\npersonalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three\ndirectional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,\nMono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative\nreciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented\nby three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning\ncontents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of\ncommunication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided\ninto base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that\ngenerative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest\naccuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study\nprovides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and\ninspire smart education models.",

We find that in order to eliminate a pathological mode that is unstable\nat high frequencies and strongly coupled at low frequencies the theory must be\nfurther restricted so that the slices of the preferred foliation each have\nconstant mean curvature. We dub this theory \"minimal minimal Ho\\v{r}ava\ngravity\" ($\\mathrm{m^2Hg}$). It has two regimes; one in which the mean\ncurvature is time independent, in which case it is equivalent to a particular\nfoliation of GR with nonzero cosmological constant, and another in which the\nmean curvature is time dependent. In the latter there is an infinite\npropagation speed since the lapse evolves via an elliptic equation, and the\ntheory thus differs from GR in a peculiar nonlocal fashion. To probe the\nviability of the sector with time dependent mean curvature, we study in detail\nthe problem of spherical collapse of a thin dust shell.

Directly applying\nexisting CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to\nthree key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders\noverlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,\nresulting in suboptimal representations.

(3) The\nprimary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the\nability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive\nrepresentation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its\nco-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,\nwe introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework\nwith semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised\nlearning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a\nstructure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of\nconventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware\naugmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and\nsemantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.\nFurthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing\nobjectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture\nlong-range dependencies.

    "abstract": "Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using\nlimited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled\nrepresentations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process\nto obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which\nhinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual\ndisentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal\nalignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent\ncross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through\nfine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a\ncross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations\nthrough mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification\noutputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification\naccuracy.

Our method\ndynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering\nmechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the\ncontinual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention\nmodule, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can\nleverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce\nclass-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical\nand natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We\nwill release the code publicly.",

Unlearnable Examples\n(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model\ntraining, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning\nof meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically\ngenerate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their\nassociated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is\noften computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on\nexternal third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:\nusers must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve\nprotection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction\nhas severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection\nsolutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \\textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable\nExample (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using\nonly text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by\nemploying a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image\n(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce\neffective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected\ndata substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal\nretrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect\ngeneralizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning\nsettings.

    "abstract": "Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)\nthrough their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying\ntheir success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that\nreinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our\nmodel finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which\nsimplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate\nthat attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements\nof classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional\nstimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that\ncontain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention\noperation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where\nCS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our\nframework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized\nmodel: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store\nO($\\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an\nerror propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of\nbalancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and\n(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance\ntransformer architectures.

(3) Reasoning\n(\"thinking\") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely\ndue to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate \"no\nrelated clause\" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are\npresent. This suggests \"laziness\" in thinking or low confidence in extracting\nrelevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of\nperformance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These\nfindings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior\nlegal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure\ncorrectness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval\noffers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.",

However, existing feedforward\napproaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and\nhigh-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under\nchallenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in\ninaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement\nmodule, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward\n3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D\nreconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing\npretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction\nrobustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized\nDegradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and\ndistributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby\nenhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D\nreconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space\nmodel. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance\ncorrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware\nstrategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,\nenabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further\nimproving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play\nmanner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across\nvarious types of degradations.",

In this setting, each\ndecision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial\nlogit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have\nsimultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,\nmotivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop\nalgorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy\nupdates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and\nRS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,\nrespectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update\nrounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can\nchoose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first\nalgorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the\nmultinomial setting and achieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the\ncontexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\\Omega(\\log \\log T)$\nupdate rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated\ncontexts and can achieve $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\\tilde{O}(\\log T)$\npolicy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our\nalgorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive\n(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their\npolicy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various\npractical scenarios.",

In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,\na Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D\nmedical image segmentation.

In the frequency\ndomain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global\ncontextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency\ndomain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D\nmulti-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and\nglobal cues.

We design a universal and black-box attack method that trains an\nadversarial model solely using real data, applicable for various GMs and\nagnostic to AMs. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding attack\ncapability and universal applicability of our method, achieving an average\nattack success rate (ASR) of 97.08\\% against 6 advanced AMs on DeepFakes\ngenerated by 9 GMs. Even in the presence of defensive mechanisms, our method\nmaintains an ASR exceeding 72.39\\%.

In this\nregard, this research proposes a lightweight, efficient, recomputation-based\nfault detection module implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)\nfor Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). The NTT is primarily composed of memory\nunits and the Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit (CT-BU), a critical and\ncomputationally intensive hardware component essential for polynomial\nmultiplication. NTT and polynomial multiplication are fundamental building\nblocks in many PQC algorithms, including Kyber, NTRU, Ring-LWE, and others. In\nthis paper, we present a fault detection method called : Recomputation with a\nModular Offset (REMO) for the logic blocks of the CT-BU using Montgomery\nReduction and another method called Memory Rule Checkers for the memory\ncomponents used within the NTT. The proposed fault detection framework sets a\nnew benchmark by achieving high efficiency with significant low implementation\ncost. It occupies only 16 slices and a single DSP block, with a power\nconsumption of just 3mW in Artix-7 FPGA.

We propose additive tree models for the density ratio along with\nefficient algorithms for training these models using a new loss function called\nthe balancing loss. With this loss, additive tree models for the density ratio\ncan be trained using algorithms original designed for supervised learning.\nSpecifically, they can be trained from both an optimization perspective that\nparallels tree boosting and from a (generalized) Bayesian perspective that\nparallels Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). For the former, we present\ntwo boosting algorithms -- one based on forward-stagewise fitting and the other\nbased on gradient boosting, both of which produce a point estimate for the\ndensity ratio function. For the latter, we show that due to the loss function's\nresemblance to an exponential family kernel, the new loss can serve as a\npseudo-likelihood for which conjugate priors exist, thereby enabling effective\ngeneralized Bayesian inference on the density ratio using backfitting samplers\ndesigned for BART. The resulting uncertainty quantification on the inferred\ndensity ratio is critical for applications involving high-dimensional and\ncomplex distributions in which uncertainty given limited data can often be\nsubstantial. We provide insights on the balancing loss through its close\nconnection to the exponential loss in binary classification and to the\nvariational form of f-divergence, in particular that of the squared Hellinger\ndistance.

Such noise may cause models to lose attention on\nkey words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward\ndenoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the\nvalue model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value\nmodel is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and\nenabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric\nframework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two\ncore designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a\nfrozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These\nmechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture\nkey words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a\npassive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math\nreasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and\nmodel-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO\nbaselines.

However,\ntheir performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects\nlike hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha\nmattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present\nFaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality\nalpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes\nand per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this\nuncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive\nknowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on\nambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic\nconsistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation\nmasks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for\nreal-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by\nexplicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling\nclearer compositing strategies.

To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline\nthat efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve\nSkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual\nobservations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a\nRay-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature\nrepresentation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To\nimprove alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor\n(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site\nconstructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide\nnavigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a\nlarge margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%\nrelatively. Our code and dataset will be released.",

Typical examples are the calculation of nucleation and crystal\ngrowth rates in heterogeneous solutions where the driving force depends on the\ncomposition of the fluid. Constant chemical potential molecular dynamics\nsimulations would instead be required to compute time-independent growth and\nnucleation rates. While this can, in principle, be achieved through the\naddition and deletion of particles using the grand canonical partition\nfunction, this is very inefficient in the condensed phase due to the low\nacceptance probability of these events. Adaptive resolution schemes, which use\na reservoir of non-interacting particles that can be transformed into solute\nparticles, circumvent this problem, but at the cost of relatively complicated\ncode implementations. In this work, a simpler approach is proposed that uses\nharmonic volumetric restraints to control the solute osmotic pressure, which\ncan be considered a proxy for the system's chemical potential. The osmotic\npressure regulator is demonstrated to reproduce the expected properties of\nideal gases and ideal solutions.

Existing approaches primarily focus on\nregularization techniques that leverage low-rankness and local smoothness\npriors. Recently, correlated total variation has been introduced for tensor\nrecovery, integrating these priors into a single regularization framework.\nDirect application to HSI-SR, however, is hindered by the high spectral\ndimensionality of hyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose a unified\ntensor regularizer, called JLRST, which jointly encodes low-rankness and local\nsmoothness priors under a subspace framework. Specifically, we compute the\ngradients of the clustered coefficient tensors along all three tensor modes to\nfully exploit spectral correlations and nonlocal similarities in HSI. By\nenforcing priors on subspace coefficients rather than the entire HR-HSI data,\nthe proposed method achieves improved computational efficiency and accuracy.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the bias introduced by the tensor nuclear norm (TNN),\nwe introduce the mode-3 logarithmic TNN to process gradient tensors.

Traditional diagnostic methods,\ntypically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the\nmultifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from\nthree primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This\nframework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and\nbiomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by\naggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques\nlike weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not\nonly improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the\nidentification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage\nover conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is\nparticularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of\nclinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially\naltering the course of the disease.

As more sources are investigated, this\ncollimation profile appears to represent a common paradigm. Previous works\nsuggest that the Bondi radius may serve as an indicator of the transition\nlocation, although discrepancies have been observed in some sources. To explore\nthis further, we selected CTA 102 for which existing literature presents mixed\nevidence regarding the presence of a jet geometry break. We investigated the\njet width profile of CTA 102 to study the possible transition changes in the\njet, thereby improving the understanding of connection between Bondi radius and\njet transition. We used multi-frequency VLBA images of CTA 102 at 2, 5, and 8\n(single epoch), and 15, 22 and 43 GHz (stacked). The jet width profile was\nmodeled with a single power law $W_{jet}\\propto r^{\\epsilon}$ yielding a\npower-law index of $\\epsilon=0.69\\pm0.02$, indicative of a quasi-parabolic\ngeometry with no clear transition to a conical regime. The absence of\ndiscernible structural break around the Bondi radius implies that the physical\nconditions associated with the radius alone are insufficient to explain the jet\ncollimation behaviour. On the other hand, we observe oscillatory features in\nthe jet width profile, suggesting the influence of additional physical\nprocesses beyond gravitational confinement. These findings contribute to a more\nnuanced understanding of jet collimation in AGN and highlight the complexity of\njet-environment interactions.",

This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot\ninertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high\nsusceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers\nrequires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the\nhardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and\nenvironmental uncertainty.

Our model predictive\ncontroller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To\nachieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we\ndesign imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural\nnetwork, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of\ncentral nervous system and motor neurons.

VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a\nhuman-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking\nalgorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple\nvideo sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that\nhierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and\n3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this\nhierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our\napproach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset\nspecifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental\nresults demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning\ntasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior\nanalysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly\noutperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for\ncross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through\nperson-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed\nvisual information while maintaining computational efficiency.",

On one hand, flat\nbands can arise from strong Coulomb interactions that localize atomic orbitals.\nOn the other hand, quantum destructive interference can quench the electronic\nkinetic energy. Although both have a narrow bandwidth, the two types of flat\nbands should exhibit very distinct spectral properties arising from their\ndistinctive origins. So far, the two types of flat bands have only been\nrealized in very different material settings and chemical environments,\npreventing a direct comparison. Here, we report the observation of the two\ntypes of flat bands within the same material system--an above-room-temperature\nvan der Waals ferromagnet, Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$, distinguishable by a switchable\niron site order. The contrasting nature of the flat bands is also identified by\nthe remarkably distinctive temperature-evolution of the spectral features,\nindicating that one arises from electron correlations in the Fe(1)\nsite-disordered phase, while the other geometrical frustration in the Fe(1)\nsite-ordered phase. Our results therefore provide a direct juxtaposition of the\ndistinct formation mechanism of flat bands in quantum materials, and an avenue\nfor understanding the distinctive roles flat bands play in the presence of\nmagnetism, topology, and lattice geometrical frustration, utilizing sublattice\nordering as a key control parameter.",

However,\nmost imaging demonstrations thus far have relied on costly, millimeter-sized\nbulk diamond substrates, which cannot be easily scaled or integrated with other\nmaterials. Here, we report a scalable method for fabricating NV-containing\ndense and homogenous fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) layers through electrostatic\nself-assembly and demonstrate the utility of the FND layers for magnetic\nimaging. We investigate the effect of FND concentration in suspension,\nsubstrate immersion time, and solvent pH on the FND density on the substrate.\nWe identify optimized self-assembly conditions that maximize the FND density\nwhile minimizing aggregation. Using FND layers on a quartz substrate, we\ndemonstrate magnetic field and magnetic noise imaging at the microscale, based\non NV optically detected magnetic resonance magnetometry and T$_1$ relaxometry,\nrespectively. Our results provide a direction for the development of\ncost-effective and scalable FND layers and surface coatings.

In this work, we propose\nCogniPlan, a novel path planning framework that leverages multiple plausible\nlayouts predicted by a COnditional GeNerative Inpainting model, mirroring how\nhumans rely on cognitive maps during navigation. These predictions, based on\nthe partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning vectors, enable our\nplanner to reason effectively under uncertainty.

We\nextensively evaluate CogniPlan on two datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic\nfloor plans), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art planners.

As the first paper of the series, in the present work we model the\ndistance distribution and luminosity function of IWSs formed via the Hills\nmechanism of the Galactic central massive black hole (GCMBH).

Our results\nsuggest that a few hundred thousand IWSs have been generated by the GCMBH via\nthe Hills mechanism in the past 14 billion years. These IWSs have an apparent\nmagnitude peaking at 30 to 35 mag in SDSS $r-$band, which are hard to detect.\nHowever, a few thousand of them at the bright end are detectable by upcoming\nwide-field deep surveys, such as China Space Station Telescope (CSST) and Vera\nRubin Observatory (LSST).

While precise stellar ages for evolved\nstars have been derived from large ground- and space-based stellar surveys,\nreliable age determination for cool main-sequence dwarf stars remains a\nchallenge. In this work, we set out to estimate the age of dwarf stars from the\nLAMOST spectra with a data-driven approach. We build a training set by using\nwide binaries that the primary component has reliable isochrone age estimate\nthus gives the age of the secondary. This training set is further supplemented\nwith field stars and cluster stars whose ages are known. We then train a\ndata-driven model for inferring age from their spectra with the XGBoost\nalgorithm. Given a spectral signal-to-noise ratio greater than 50, the age\nestimation precise to 10% to 25% for K-type stars, as younger stars have larger\nrelative errors. Validations suggest that the underlying information used for\nour age estimation is largely attributed to the LAMOST spectral features of\nchemical abundances. It means our result is a manifestation of stellar chemical\nclock effectively acted on LAMOST spectra ($R\\simeq1800$). Applying our model\nto the LAMOST DR10 yields a massive age catalog for $\\sim4$ million dwarf\nstars.

At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization\nparameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed\nprecision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of\nquantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy\nimprovement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the\nbit-width selection process has received little attention.

In\nthis study, we introduce a flexible, self-powered triboelectric nanogenerator\n(MB-TENG) engineered from commercially available medical elastic bandages for\nbiomechanical sensing during rehabilitation and gait analysis. Leveraging the\nporous and skin-friendly properties of the bandage combined with a PTFE film,\nthe MB-TENG delivers robust electrical performance, achieving a peak\nopen-circuit voltage (VOC) of 122~V, a short-circuit current (ISC) of\n25~$\\mu$A, and a transferred charge (QSC) of 110~nC, while maintaining\nlong-term stability across 40{,}000 mechanical cycles. Its inherent\nself-adhesive property allows for multi-layer assembly without extra bonding\nagents, and mechanical stretching enhances output, enabling dual\nconfigurability. A stacked design further improves the power capacity,\nsupporting applications in wearable medical electronics. The MB-TENG device\nseamlessly conforms to joint surfaces and foot regions, providing accurate\ndetection of motion states and abnormal gait patterns.

The connectivity state between\nthe sources and the encoders and the vector-linear function are all arbitrary.\nIn the paper, we are interested in the function-compression capacity to measure\nthe efficiency of using the system. We first present a general lower bound on\nthe function-compression capacity applicable to arbitrary connectivity states\nand vector-linear functions. Next, we confine to the nontrivial models with\nonly three sources and no more than three encoders, and prove that all the\n$3\\times2$ column-full-rank matrices $T$ can be divided into two types $T_1$\nand $T_2$, for which the function-compression capacities are identical if the\nmatrices $T$ have the same type. We explicitly characterize the\nfunction-compression capacities for two most nontrivial models associated with\n$T_2$ by a novel approach of both upper bounding and lower bounding the size of\nimage sets of encoding functions. This shows that the lower bound thus obtained\nis not always tight. Rather, by completely characterizing their capacities, the\nlower bound is tight for all the models associated with $T_1$ and all the\nmodels associated with $T_2$ except for the two most nontrivial models. We\nfinally apply the obtained results to network function computation and answer\nthe open problem whether the best known upper bound proved by Guang et. al.\n(2019) on computing capacity is in general asymptotically tight.",

By design, AFOG\nis neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large\ntransformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a\nunified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original\ncontributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that\nfocuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,\nincreasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,\nAFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss\nthrough learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial\nperturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial\nperturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by\nadding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which\ncan cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments\nconducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the\nefficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms\nexisting attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to\n83% with superior speed and imperceptibility.

    "abstract": "We develop a geometric extension of the Kerr-Schild ansatz that incorporates\nboth electric and magnetic sectors of the Maxwell field in a unified framework,\nwithout resorting to duality rotations. We start observing that the known\npurely electric solution satisfies Maxwell's equations due to a closedness\ncondition obeyed by the Kerr-Schild null congruence. From the associated local\nexactness property, we construct a new one-form naturally linked to the\ncongruence as a sort of Poincar\\'e dualization. This leads us to propose a\ngeometrically motivated dyonic vector potential within the Kerr-Schild ansatz,\ndefined as a superposition of an electric contribution along the congruence and\na magnetic one that aligns to the dualized one-form. We then show that for a\nstationary and axisymmetric Kerr-Schild ansatz, the electrovac circularity\ntheorem uniquely constrains not only the scalar profile of the metric, but also\nthose associated to the electric-magnetic splitting of the gauge field. The\nresulting formalism provides a transparent derivation of the dyonic Kerr-Newman\nsolution and extends naturally to the (A)dS case, highlighting the intrinsic\ninterplay between geometry and matter in a Kerr-Schild setting.",

    "abstract": "The chromatic discrepancy of a graph $G$, denoted $\\phi(G)$, is the least\nover all proper colourings $\\sigma$ of $G$ of the greatest difference between\nthe number of colours $|\\sigma(V(H))|$ spanned by an induced subgraph $H$ of\n$G$ and its chromatic number $\\chi(H)$. We prove that the chromatic discrepancy\nof a triangle-free graph $G$ is at least $\\chi(G)-2$. This is best possible and\npositively answers a question raised by Aravind, Kalyanasundaram, Sandeep, and\nSivadasan.\n  More generally, we say that a graph $G$ is locally $s$-colourable if the\nclosed neighbourhood of any vertex $v\\in V(G)$ is properly $s$-colourable; in\nparticular, a triangle-free graph is locally $2$-colourable. We conjecture that\nevery locally $s$-colourable graph $G$ satisfies $\\phi(G) \\geq \\chi(G)-s$, and\nshow that this would be almost best possible. We prove the conjecture when\n$\\chi(G) \\le 11s/6$, and as a partial result towards the general case, we prove\nthat every locally $s$-colourable graph $G$ satisfies $\\phi(G) \\geq \\chi(G) -\ns\\ln \\chi(G)$.\n  If the conjecture holds, it implies in particular, for every integer\n$\\ell\\geq 2$, that any graph $G$ without any copy of $C_{\\ell+1}$, the cycle of\nlength $\\ell+1$, satisfies $\\phi(G) \\geq \\chi(G) - \\ell$. When $\\ell \\ge 3$ and\n$G\\neq K_\\ell$, we conjecture that we actually have $\\phi(G)\\ge \\chi(G) - \\ell\n+ 1$, and prove it in the special case $\\ell = 3$ or $\\chi(G) \\le 5\\ell/3$. In\ngeneral, we further obtain that every $C_{\\ell+1}$-free graph $G$ satisfies\n$\\phi(G) \\geq \\chi(G) - O_{\\ell}(\\ln \\ln \\chi(G))$. We do so by determining an\nalmost tight bound on the chromatic number of balls of radius at most $\\ell/2$\nin $G$, which could be of independent interest.",
