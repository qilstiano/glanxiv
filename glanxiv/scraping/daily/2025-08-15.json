    "abstract": "We investigate the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high\nredshift ($z \\ge 10$) from a combination of dark matter capture, black-hole\nmergers, and gas accretion. It has previously been shown that SMBHs can form by\n$z \\approx 10$ via black-hole mergers, Eddington-limited Bondi gas accretion\nand tidal disruption events with stars within dense nuclear clusters. Here, we\nshow that the capture of collisionless dark matter by a growing SMBH also\nsubstantially contributes, in some cases by an order of magnitude to the final\nSMBH mass. In particular, we show that a small seed stellar-remnant black hole\ncan more easily reach $> 10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$ by $z = 10$ in the core of dense\nnuclear star clusters when dark matter is included. This remains true for\neither cold dark matter or ultralight dark matter if the mass of the ULDM\nparticle is $^>_\\sim 10^{-20}$ eV. We highlight the unique evolution of ULDM\ncapture by the growing SMBH when the ULDM de Broglie wavelength exceeds the\ninitial nuclear star cluster half-mass radius.",

    "abstract": "Bioacoustics, the study of sounds produced by living organisms, plays a vital\nrole in conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and behavioral studies. Many\ntasks in this field, such as species, individual, and behavior classification\nand detection, are well-suited to machine learning. However, they often suffer\nfrom limited annotated data, highlighting the need for a general-purpose\nbioacoustic encoder capable of extracting useful representations for diverse\ndownstream tasks. Such encoders have been proposed before, but are often\nlimited in scope due to a focus on a narrow range of species (typically birds),\nand a reliance on a single model architecture or training paradigm. Moreover,\nthey are usually evaluated on a small set of tasks and datasets. In this work,\nwe present a large-scale empirical study that covers aspects of bioacoustics\nthat are relevant to research but have previously been scarcely considered:\ntraining data diversity and scale, model architectures and training recipes,\nand the breadth of evaluation tasks and datasets. We obtain encoders that are\nstate-of-the-art on the existing and proposed benchmarks. We also identify what\nmatters for training these encoders, such that this work can be extended when\nmore data are available or better architectures are proposed. Specifically,\nacross 26 datasets with tasks including species classification, detection,\nindividual ID, and vocal repertoire discovery, we find self-supervised\npre-training followed by supervised post-training on a mixed bioacoustics +\ngeneral-audio corpus yields the strongest in- and out-of-distribution\nperformance. We show the importance of data diversity in both stages. To\nsupport ongoing research and application, we will release the model\ncheckpoints.",

    "abstract": "Light curve analysis of W UMa-type contact binary systems using MCMC or MC\nmethods can be time-consuming, primarily because the repeated generation of\nsynthetic light curves tends to be relatively slow during the fitting process.\nAlthough various approaches have been proposed to address this issue, their\nimplementation is often challenging due to complexity or uncertain performance.\nIn this study, we introduce the BSN application, whose name is taken from the\nBSN project. The application is designed for analyzing contact binary system\nlight curves, supporting photometric data, and employing an MCMC algorithm for\nefficient parameter estimation. The BSN application generates synthetic light\ncurves more than 40 times faster than PHOEBE during the MCMC fitting process.\nThe BSN application enhances light curve analysis with an expanded feature set\nand a more intuitive interface while maintaining compliance with established\nscientific standards. In addition, we present the first light curve analyses of\nfour contact binary systems based on the TESS data, utilizing the BSN\napplication version 1.0. We also conducted a light curve analysis using the\nPHOEBE Python code and compared the resulting outputs. Two of the target\nsystems exhibited asymmetries in the maxima of their light curves, which were\nappropriately modeled by introducing a cold starspot on one of the components.\nThe estimated mass ratios of these total-eclipse systems place them within the\ncategory of low mass ratio contact binary stars. The estimation of the absolute\nparameters for the selected systems was carried out using the $P-a$ empirical\nrelationship. Based on the effective temperatures and masses of the components,\nthree of the target systems were classified as A-subtype, while TIC 434222993\nwas identified as a W-subtype system.",

In particular, we\nfocus on the setting where the parameter of interest is a linear combination of\nthe mean connectivities within and between estimated communities. Inference in\nthis setting poses a challenge, since the communities are themselves estimated\nfrom the data. Furthermore, since only a single realization of the network is\navailable, sample splitting is not possible. In this paper, we show that it is\npossible to split a single realization of a network consisting of $n$ nodes\ninto two (or more) networks involving the same $n$ nodes; the first network can\nbe used to select a data-driven parameter, and the second to conduct inference\non that parameter. In the case of weighted networks with Poisson or Gaussian\nedges, we obtain two independent realizations of the network; by contrast, in\nthe case of Bernoulli edges, the two realizations are dependent, and so extra\ncare is required. We establish the theoretical properties of our estimators, in\nthe sense of confidence intervals that attain the nominal (selective) coverage,\nand demonstrate their utility in numerical simulations and in application to a\ndataset representing the relationships among dolphins in Doubtful Sound, New\nZealand.",

We identify a set of compatibility and regularity conditions on\nthis framed curve that ensure the existence of a $C^1$ isometric immersion that\nis $C^2$ almost everywhere and possesses finite bending energy. Under these\nconditions, we derive an exact dimensional reduction of the bending energy to a\nline integral over the boundary curve, without relying on asymptotic\nassumptions or approximations. By analyzing the behavior of the unit normal\nvector along the framed boundary, we distinguish between planar and curved\nregions of the immersed surface. We identify the geometric conditions under\nwhich global $C^2$ regularity is potentially lost, in which case the associated\nimmersion belongs to $W^{2,2}$ -- a Sobolev space that arises naturally in\nvariational models of unstretchable elastic surfaces.",

While stable contact at the\ndevice-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains\nchallenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability.\nExisting methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer\nfrom contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of\nelectronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising\nalternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or\nchemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface\nassumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin.\nInspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive\nsystem that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical\nmodeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based\nframework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate\ncompliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be\ntailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid\nsurfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the\nchamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate\nstronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft,\ntacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design\nprinciples for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of\nrigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and\nelectrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These\nfindings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of\nskin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics.",

    "abstract": "Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD), owing to their\nunique performance, are currently the standard detector in most demanding\nsingle-photon experiments. One important metric for any single-photon detector\nis the deadtime (or recovery time), defined as the minimum temporal separation\nbetween consecutive detection events. In SNSPDs, the recovery time is more\nsubtle, as the detection efficiency does not abruptly drop to zero when the\ntemporal separation between detection events gets smaller, instead, it\nincreases gradually as the SNSPD current recovers. SNSPD's recovery time is\ndominated by its kinetic inductance, the readout impedance, and the degree of\nsaturation of internal efficiency. Decreasing the kinetic inductance or\nincreasing the readout impedance can accelerate the recovery process.\nSignificant reduction of the SNSPD recovery time, by, for example, adding a\nseries resistor in the readout circuitry, is possible but can lead to detector\nlatching which hinders further detector operation or enforces underbiasing and\nhence a reduction in detection efficiency. Previous research has demonstrated\npassive resistive networks for the reduction of recovery time that rely on\ntrial and error to find the appropriate resistance values. Here we show, using\na novel, cryogenically compatible, and tunable resistor technology, one can\nfind the optimized impedance values, delivering fast SNSPD recovery time, while\nmaintaining maximum internal detection efficiency. Here we show an increase of\nmore than 2 folds in both maximum achievable detection rates and the achievable\ndetection efficiency at high photon fluxes, demonstrating detection rates as\nhigh as 120 Mcps with no loss of internal detection efficiency.",

This paper presents\nthe Large Wing Model (LWM), a probabilistic machine learning model designed to\npredict pressure coefficient ($C_p$) distributions using a small, strictly\nexperimental data set. From its uncertainty-aware $C_p$ predictions, the\nsectional and total wing lift coefficients ($c_l$, $C_L$) and their confidence\nintervals are calculated. The LWM features a modified deep kernel learning\narchitecture, building a Gaussian Process model in a 15-dimensional space\nformed by 14 latent variables and the wing spanwise dimension. It is trained on\nan open-source database of wind tunnel measurements developed for this work.\nThe Bayesian approach ingests uncertainties associated with experimental\nmeasurements and data digitization into the model. The model demonstrates\nsatisfactory extrapolation abilities, enabling predictions on wings with new\nairfoil sections via the physics-driven prior formed from two-dimensional $C_p$\npredicted by the Large Airfoil Model. The model accuracy is assessed for three\ntest cases, rectangular wings with varying airfoil sections and operating\nconditions. For all test cases, the model performed well; the error in $C_L$\ndid not exceed 1.7\\%. The model effectively captures three-dimensional effects\nsuch as those induced by wing tip vortices.

    "abstract": "Advances in generative artificial intelligence are transforming how\nmetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are designed and discovered. This Perspective\nintroduces the shift from laborious enumeration of MOF candidates to generative\napproaches that can autonomously propose and synthesize in the laboratory new\nporous reticular structures on demand. We outline the progress of employing\ndeep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and\nlarge language model-based agents, that are fueled by the growing amount of\navailable data from the MOF community and suggest novel crystalline materials\ndesigns. These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput\ncomputational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated,\nclosed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular\nchemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for\nhigh-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications. Finally,\nwe highlight remaining challenges such as synthetic feasibility, dataset\ndiversity, and the need for further integration of domain knowledge.",

Our analysis reveals a diffuse X-ray feature\non the southern side, disconnected from the galactic disk. This feature\nexhibits a hard X-ray spectrum, which is highly unusual for an outflow from a\ndwarf galaxy. We interpret the irregularly shaped feature as hot plasma in a\nyoung galaxy cluster at redshift 0.5, supported by X-ray spectral fitting and\nconsistent with the optical redshift of the central elliptical galaxy of a\nknown cluster identified by a red sequence. Additionally, we detect a radio\nlobe east of the X-ray feature, likely produced by an AGN offset from the\ncluster center and confined primarily by ram pressure from the ambient medium.\nThe lobe shows a steep nonthermal radio spectrum, suggesting a cosmic-ray age\nof $\\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^{7}$~yr. Assuming energy equipartition between cosmic\nrays and magnetic fields, we estimate the lobe's total energy to be $\\sim 9\n\\times 10^{56}~\\mathrm{erg}$, comparable to the thermal energy in the same\nvolume. This study thus identifies a background young cluster projected next to\nKUG~1138+327 and highlights the potentially significant role of off-center AGN\nfeedback in shaping the intracluster medium.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic algorithms like AES and RSA are widely used and they are\nmathematically robust and almost unbreakable but its implementation on physical\ndevices often leak information through side channels, such as electromagnetic\n(EM) emissions, potentially compromising said theoretically secure algorithms.\nThis paper investigates the application of machine learning (ML) techniques and\nDeep Learning models to exploit such leakage for partial key recovery. We use\nthe public ASCAD `fixed' and `variable' key dataset, containing 700 and 1400 EM\ntraces respectively from an AES-128 implementation on an 8-bit microcontroller.\nThe problem is framed as a 256-class classification task where we target the\noutput of the first-round S-box operation, which is dependent on a single key\nbyte. We evaluate standard classifiers (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector\nMachine (SVM)), a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and a Residual Neural\nNetwork(ResNet). We also explore the utility of RF-based feature importance for\ndimensionality reduction. Crucially, we employ this domain-specific Key Rank\nmetric for evaluation, showing its necessity over standard classification\naccuracy. Our results show that SVM and RF on full features perform poorly in\nkey ranking. However, RF trained on reduced (top 100) identified via importance\nanalysis achieves Rank 0 (successful key byte recovery) using almost half the\nattack traces. The implemented CNN also achieves Rank 0 efficiently using\napproximately 65 attack traces for the fixed-key dataset. The ResNets perform\nbest on large and complex datasets but may not always be the best choice for\nsimple fixed key dataset in terms of efficiency. Thus we conclude that models,\nparticularly CNNs, ResNets and feature-selected RF, coupled with the Key Rank\nmetric, are an effective tool for side-channel key recovery, confirming the\npractical vulnerability of the cryptographic implementations.",

We\nshow that in theory, binary prediction calibration is equivalent to a special\ncase of SBC, but with finite resources, binary prediction calibration is\ntypically more sensitive. With well-designed test quantities, SBC can however\ndetect all possible problems in computation, including some that cannot be\nuncovered by binary prediction calibration.\n  Previous work on Bayes factor validation includes checks based on the\ndata-averaged posterior and the Good check method. We demonstrate that both\nchecks miss many problems in Bayes factor computation detectable with SBC and\nbinary prediction calibration. Moreover, we find that the Good check as\noriginally described fails to control its error rates. Our proposed checks also\ntypically use simulation results more efficiently than data-averaged posterior\nchecks. Finally, we show that a special approach based on posterior SBC is\nnecessary when checking Bayes factor computation under improper priors and we\nvalidate several models with such priors.\n  We recommend that novel methods for Bayes factor computation be validated\nwith SBC and binary prediction calibration with at least several hundred\nsimulations. For all the models we tested, the bridgesampling and BayesFactor R\npackages satisfy all available checks and thus are likely safe to use in\nstandard scenarios.",

A requirement\nfor shared computing environments is a centralized identity system to\nauthenticate and authorize user access. An organization's digital identity\nplane is a prime target for cyber threat actors. When compromised, identities\ncan be exploited to steal credentials, create unauthorized accounts, and\nmanipulate permissions-enabling attackers to gain control of the network and\nundermine its confidentiality, availability, and integrity. Cybercrime losses\nreached a record of 16.6 B in the United States in 2024. For organizations\nusing Microsoft software, Active Directory is the on-premises identity system\nof choice.

Our proposed\napproaches aim to confine the movement of compromised credentials, preventing\nsignificant privilege escalation and theft.

While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise,\nthese models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible\nto implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to\nimprove multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization\nframework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity,\nand training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both\ninfluence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in\nsmall models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and\nscaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline\nthat generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting\nthe hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup,\nsuccessfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier\ngeneralization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic\ndata to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate\nthat prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and\nthat targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive\nhate detection.",

One the one hand the organizations want to\nmaintain a consistent brand identity in all units through centralized control,\nbut on the other hand, they want to provide the units with sufficient autonomy\nto respond to the challenges they face locally. Traditionally, this challenge\nwas perceived to require a trade-off between performance and organizational\nsynchrony, with performance demanding more decentralization and synchrony\nrequiring more centralized control. However, our research explores how\norganizations can potentially resolve this trade-off by promoting norms for\nknowledge-sharing and setting up the right communication channels, relying on\nthe unit managers' intrinsic tendency to conform to the behavior of their\npeers. We build an agent-based model of an organization with multiple\ninterdependent units facing highly similar task environments to investigate how\nunit managers' ability to communicate, share knowledge, and conform to peer\npractices might influence organizational dynamics. We find that, under specific\ncommunication network structures, increased decentralization can enhance both\nperformance and organizational synchrony without sacrificing one or the other.\nFurthermore, we discover that centralization might still be preferable for\nsynchrony if the units are interdependent.",

Although stochastic noise has been\nthe primary form of modeling uncertainty in such systems, these formulations\nmight fall short in addressing uncertainties that are deterministic in nature\nor simply lack probabilistic data. To ensure safety under such scenarios, we\nemploy the concept of robust constraints that must hold for all possible\nuncertainty realizations lying inside a bounded set. Nevertheless, standard\nrobust optimization approaches become intractable due to the large number or\nnon-convexity of the constraints involved in safe multi-agent control. To\naddress this, we introduce novel robust reformulations that significantly\nreduce complexity without compromising safety. The applicability of the\nframework is further broadened to address both deterministic and stochastic\nuncertainties by incorporating robust chance constraints and distribution\nsteering techniques. To achieve scalability, we derive a distributed approach\nbased on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), supported by a\nconvergence study that accounts for the underlying non-convexity. In addition,\ncomputational complexity bounds highlighting the efficiency of the proposed\nframeworks against standard approaches are presented.

For galaxies observed by galaxy surveys, the relation between\n$b_{\\phi}$ and the galaxy bias $b_{g}$ is poorly understood and differs\nsignificantly from the universal mass function ansatz. In this paper, we\ninvestigate this non-universality in the context of dark-matter halos using the\nSeparate Universe framework, focussing on dark-matter halos selected by mass\nand/or concentration. We show that the Separate Universe framework provides a\nnatural explanation of the observed universality in the bias of dark-matter\nhalos selected purely by their mass, independent of the spherical collapse\npicture of halo formation. We further propose an explanation for the observed\nnon-universality in halos selected by concentration and corroborate it with\n$N$-body simulations in scale-free (EdS) and $\\Lambda\\text{CDM}$ cosmologies.\nIn particular, we show that the relation between $b_{\\phi}$ and halo bias\n$b_{h}$ for halos selected by concentration in matter-dominated cosmologies\ntends towards universality at the highest halo masses due to such halos\ngravitationally dominating their environment throughout their evolution. We\nalso argue that concentration-selected halos of lower masses exhibit\nnon-universality due to their mass accretion being significantly affected by\nthe gravitational influence of neighbouring, more massive halos.

We estimate that the EUDR would cover\naround 6 billion US dollars in exported value, but only 2.84% is not compliant\nwith the EUDR, with soy and cattle being the most affected production chains.\nWe use a dynamic computable general equilibrium model to simulate the impact of\nthe EUDR on the Argentine economy. If the non-compliant production cannot enter\nthe EU market because of the EUDR, the results of the simulations suggest that\nthe potential macroeconomic impacts are limited: GDP would be reduced by an\naverage of 0.14% with respect to the baseline scenario. However, the potential\nenvironmental impact is greater. Deforested hectares would be reduced by 2.45%\nand GHG emissions by 0.19%. Notwithstanding, EUDR due diligence costs may still\nprevent compliant production from entering the EU market, so the total impacts\ncould be higher.",

    "abstract": "Robust generalization under climate change remains a major challenge for\nmachine learning applications in climate science. Most existing approaches\nstruggle to extrapolate beyond the climate they were trained on, leading to a\nstrong dependence on training data from model simulations of warm climates. Use\nof climate-invariant inputs improves generalization but requires challenging\nmanual feature engineering. Here, we present CERA (Climate-invariant Encoding\nthrough Representation Alignment), a machine learning framework consisting of\nan autoencoder with explicit latent-space alignment, followed by a predictor\nfor downstream process estimation. We test CERA on the problem of\nparameterizing moist-physics processes. Without training on labeled data from a\n+4K climate, CERA leverages labeled control-climate data and unlabeled\nwarmer-climate inputs to improve generalization to the warmer climate,\noutperforming both raw-input and physically informed baselines in predicting\nkey moisture and energy tendencies. It captures not only the vertical and\nmeridional structures of the moisture tendencies, but also shifts in the\nintensity distribution of precipitation including extremes. Ablation\nexperiments show that latent alignment improves both accuracy and the\nrobustness across random seeds used in training. While some reduced skill\nremains in the boundary layer, the framework offers a data-driven alternative\nto manual feature engineering of climate invariant inputs. Beyond\nparameterizations used in hybrid ML-physics systems, the approach holds promise\nfor other climate applications such as statistical downscaling.",

    "abstract": "Real-time fault classification in resource-constrained Internet of Things\n(IoT) devices is critical for industrial safety, yet training robust models in\nsuch heterogeneous environments remains a significant challenge. Standard\nFederated Learning (FL) often fails in the presence of non-IID data, leading to\nmodel divergence. This paper introduces Fed-Meta-Align, a novel four-phase\nframework designed to overcome these limitations through a sophisticated\ninitialization and training pipeline. Our process begins by training a\nfoundational model on a general public dataset to establish a competent\nstarting point. This model then undergoes a serial meta-initialization phase,\nwhere it sequentially trains on a subset of IOT Device data to learn a\nheterogeneity-aware initialization that is already situated in a favorable\nregion of the loss landscape. This informed model is subsequently refined in a\nparallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that\nweights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine\nsimilarity alignment. Finally, an on-device personalization phase adapts the\nconverged global model into a specialized expert for each IOT Device.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that Fed-Meta-Align achieves an average\ntest accuracy of 91.27% across heterogeneous IOT devices, outperforming\npersonalized FedAvg and FedProx by up to 3.87% and 3.37% on electrical and\nmechanical fault datasets, respectively.

While reducing power backoff can enhance PA efficiency, it\nintroduces nonlinear distortions that degrade signal quality. Existing\nsolutions, such as digital pre-distortion, require complex feedback mechanisms\nfor optimal performance, leading to increased UE complexity and power\nconsumption. Instead, in this study we explore digital post-distortion (DPoD)\ntechniques, which compensate for these distortions at the base station,\nleveraging its superior computational resources. In this study, we conduct an\ncomprehensive study concerning the challenges and advantages associated with\napplying DPoD in time-domain, frequency-domain, and DFT-s-domain. Our findings\nsuggest that implementing DPoD in the time-domain, complemented by\nfrequency-domain channel equalization, strikes a good balance between low\ncomputational complexity and efficient nonlinearity compensation. In addition,\nwe demonstrate that memory has to be taken into account regardless of the\nmemory of the PA. Subsequently, we show how to pose the complex-valued problem\nof nonlinearity compensation in a real Hilbert space, emphasizing the potential\nperformance enhancements as a result.

The latter remains a\nchallenging task due to the domain-specific vocabulary and semantic ambiguity\nin user queries. We propose BMQExpander, a novel ontology-aware query expansion\npipeline that combines medical knowledge - definitions and relationships - from\nthe UMLS Metathesaurus with the generative capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs) to enhance retrieval effectiveness. We implemented several\nstate-of-the-art baselines, including sparse and dense retrievers, query\nexpansion methods, and biomedical-specific solutions. We show that BMQExpander\nhas superior retrieval performance on three popular biomedical Information\nRetrieval (IR) benchmarks: NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, and SciFact - with\nimprovements of up to 22.1% in NDCG@10 over sparse baselines and up to 6.5%\nover the strongest baseline. Further, BMQExpander generalizes robustly under\nquery perturbation settings, in contrast to supervised baselines, achieving up\nto 15.7% improvement over the strongest baseline. As a side contribution, we\npublish our paraphrased benchmarks. Finally, our qualitative analysis shows\nthat BMQExpander has fewer hallucinations compared to other LLM-based query\nexpansion baselines.",

    "abstract": "Biological organisms are simple at heart: cells, their basic units, perform a\nvariety of behaviors by expressing proteins from DNA-encoded genes. Gene\nexpression though depends on sets of often-convoluted regulatory interactions\nknown as gene networks, contributing to biology's apparent complexity. Even in\nEscherichia coli K-12, the pioneering model organism of molecular biology, gene\nnetworks are complicated and inconsistent with gene expression data. Recent\ndiscoveries of multicellular self-organization in E. coli suggest a new model\nfor gene regulation that may help in many cases: control of gene networks by\nmulticellular interaction networks, i.e. the changing physical and chemical\ninteractions between cells in communities. E. coli's observed dynamics indicate\nmulticellular interactions serve as inputs for key gene networks, thereby\nproducing robust expression of otherwise noisy genes. In turn, multicellular\ninteraction networks are dynamically generated as outputs of gene networks\nduring self-organization. Thus, multicellular self-organization enables\nuniquely-biological control mechanisms that are not available to individual\ncells. As further suggested by E. coli self-organization, the gene-network\noutputs from one multicellular stage can be linked, via multicellular\ninteraction networks, to serve as the gene-network inputs for later stages,\nthereby creating multicellular daisy chains. Daisy chains are a general model\nfor reliably propagating multicellular communities and, therefore, for\npredictably determining the gene-network inputs of each cell throughout\nmulticellular self-organization and development. Considerations for several\nfields are briefly discussed and suggest multicellular daisy chains are a\ngeneral mechanism for biological organisms to control cell behavior and to be\nsimpler than the sum of their parts.",

The equations are of the type of a generalized Langevin equation,\nwhich accounts for the frictional memory of the system. The BP is assumed to be\ncharged while the bath particles are neutral. They thus do not directly respond\nto the external field, but their interaction with the BP leads to changes in\nthe bath state. Using the solution of the equations found, we calculate the\naverage bath angular momentum and show that it persists for long times when the\nsystem is assumed to reach equilibrium. This indicates a possible violation of\nthe Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem for baths consisting of charged particles.\nHowever, this must be confirmed by a substantial generalization of the\npresented model when the bath particles feel the external field, which affects\nthe memory in the dynamics of the system.",

In this paper, we investigate filler types to\nmitigate these effects and lead to a more positive experience and perception of\nthe agent. In a within-subject study, we asked 24 participants to communicate\nwith ECAs in virtual reality, comparing four strategies displayed during the\ndelays: a multimodal behavioral filler consisting of conversational and\ngestural fillers, a base condition with only idle motions, and two symbolic\nindicators with progress bars, one embedded as a badge on the agent, the other\none external and visualized as a thinking bubble. Our results indicate that the\nbehavioral filler improved perceived response time, three subscales of\npresence, humanlikeness, and naturalness.

We organize individual tasks that computer science\nstudies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate\nLLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the\nassessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding\na specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable\narbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs\nwith questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a\nsolid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We\nexemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the\nprompts. Adopting first-rate Information Systems articles at three top journals\nas the input texts and an abundant set of text metrics, we record a compromised\nperformance of the leading LLM - Google's Gemini: its summary and paraphrase of\nacademic text is acceptably reliable; using it to rank texts through pairwise\ntext comparison is faintly scalable; asking it to grade academic texts is prone\nto poor discrimination; its qualitative reflection on the text is\nself-consistent yet hardly insightful to inspire meaningful research.

The localized thermal hot spots were\ndetected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based\nfield-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was\nobserved by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN\ninsulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface\nand the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The\ndeep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated\nheat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral\ndepletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at\ndielectric/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed\nsignificantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared\nto BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN\nfield-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration.

The\ngeomodel includes a target aquifer (into which supercritical CO2 is injected),\nsurrounding regions, caprock, two extensive faults, and two overlying aquifers.\nThe faults can act as leakage pathways between the three aquifers. The\nheterogeneous property fields in the target aquifer are characterized by\nhierarchical uncertainty, meaning both the geological metaparameters (e.g.,\nmean and standard deviation of log-permeability) and the detailed cell\nproperties of each realization, are uncertain. Fault permeabilities are also\ntreated as uncertain. The model is trained with simulation results for (up to)\n4000 randomly sampled realizations. Error assessments show that this model is\nmore accurate than a previous recurrent residual U-Net, and that it maintains\naccuracy for qualitatively different leakage scenarios. The new surrogate is\nthen used for global sensitivity analysis and data assimilation. A hierarchical\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo data assimilation procedure is applied. Different\nmonitoring strategies, corresponding to different amounts and types of observed\ndata collected at monitoring wells, are considered for three synthetic true\nmodels. Detailed results demonstrate the degree of uncertainty reduction\nachieved with the various monitoring strategies. Posterior results for 3D\nsaturation plumes and leakage volumes indicate the benefits of measuring\npressure and saturation in all three aquifers.",

    "abstract": "Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not\nadmit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the\nsource of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It\nhas been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local\nentanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to\nWigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is\nintroduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting\nquantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In\nparticular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest\ncontextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested\ncontextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be\nlarger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt\nqubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain\ntradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the\nharvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting\nregimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of\ncontextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as\ngeneral harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local\nentanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are\nput forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible\nharvesting parameter regimes.",

This perspective paper examines the\nrelationship between QC and high-performance computing (HPC), highlighting\ntheir complementary roles in enhancing computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "If a unitary transformation has a decomposition into a quantum circuit with\nno directed path from input $a$ to output $b$, then $a$ does not influence $b$\nthrough the overall unitary. Conversely, it is known that if $a$ does not\ninfluence $b$, one may always find a circuit decomposition lacking a path\nbetween these systems, thus making the no-influence condition directly apparent\nin the connectivity of the circuit. Causal decompositions are circuit\ndecompositions in which, more generally, multiple such no-influence conditions\nare made apparent simultaneously. They bridge two fundamental concepts in\nquantum causality: causal structure, as expressed by influences through unitary\ntransformations (and related to signalling through quantum channels); and\ncompositional structure, expressed in terms of the shape of quantum circuits or\nnetworks. The general existence of causal decompositions remains unknown.\n  This work focusses on unitary causal decompositions, i.e. decompositions in\nterms of unitary circuits in the traditional quantum circuit formalism that do\nnot require the generalisation to `extended' or `routed' quantum circuits\nprompted by earlier research on this topic. We identify a combinatorial\ncondition that characterises precisely those sets of causal no-influence\nconstraints $G$ for which any unitary transformation satisfying $G$ has a\nunitary causal decomposition compositionally representing those constraints.\nOur methods are based on finite-dimensional operator algebra as well as the\nconcept lattice construction, which was recently shown to provide a canonical\nshape $L_G$ for causal decompositions. The combinatorial condition we identify\ncan be formulated in terms of $G$ as the absence of a forbidden substructure\n$C_3$ and in terms of $L_G$ as the existence of no more than one path between\neach input and output.",

Observations by the Event\nHorizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion\nstructures near black holes.

Aims: We investigate how system\nproperties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale\nregion, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*.\nSpecifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT\nto black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic\nfield geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient\naccretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black\nhole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We\nperform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative\ntransfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such\nas disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We\nalso consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations\nand compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited\nimpact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field\ndominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be\ndistinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial\ninflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables.

Both\nsupernovae show broad, blueshifted, and asymmetric UV emission lines with an\ninitial maximum velocity of $\\sim9000\\,km\\,s^{-1}$ and narrow unresolved\nemission in CIV. We compare the optical and UV emission-line profiles, showing\nthat they evolve from two distinct velocity profiles to a single profile\ntracing the UV emission. We interpret this as shock power from interaction with\ncircumstellar material coming to dominate over the radioactive-decay power from\nthe inner ejecta. Comparing our observations to radiative transfer models with\ninjected shock power, we find SN~2024ggi is best matched by $P_{\\mathrm{shock,\nabs}}=1\\times10^{41}\\,erg\\,s^{-1}$ at day 40, SN~2023ixf at day 300 and\nSN~2024ggi at day 200 are best matched by\n$P_{\\mathrm{shock,abs}}=1\\times10^{40}\\,erg\\,s^{-1}$, and SN~2023ixf at day 600\nis best matched by $P_{\\mathrm{shock,abs}}=5\\times10^{39}\\,erg\\,s^{-1}$.

There is no consensus on\nwhich (if any) of various proposed dynamical models is correct, yet it is vital\nto understand exozodis given the risk they pose to direct imaging and\ncharacterisation of Earth-like planets. This article reviews current\ntheoretical understanding of the origin and evolution of exozodi dust. It also\nidentifies key questions pertinent to the potential for exozodis to impact\nexoplanet imaging and summarises current understanding of the answer to them\ninformed by exozodi theory. These address how exozodi dust is delivered, its\nsize and spatial distribution, and the effect of its composition on exozodi\nobservability, as well as the connection between hot and warm exozodis. Also\naddressed are how common different exozodi levels are and how that level can be\npredicted from system properties, as well as the features that planets impart\nin dust distributions and how exozodis affect a planet's physical properties\nand habitability. We conclude that exozodis present both a problem and an\nopportunity, e.g., by introducing noise that makes planets harder to detect,\nbut also identifying systems in which ingredients conducive to life, like water\nand volatiles, are delivered to the habitable zone.",

The combination of enhanced\nspeed and accuracy facilitated by $\\texttt{21cmKAN}$ enables rapid and highly\naccurate physical parameter estimation analyses of multiple 21 cm models, which\nis needed to fully characterize the complex feature space across models and\nproduce robust constraints on the early universe. Rather than using static\nfunctions to model complex relationships like traditional fully-connected\nneural networks do, KANs learn expressive transformations that can perform\nsignificantly better for low-dimensional physical problems. $\\texttt{21cmKAN}$\npredicts a given signal for two well-known models in the community in 3.7 ms on\naverage and trains about 75 times faster than $\\texttt{21cmLSTM}$, when\nutilizing the same typical GPU. $\\texttt{21cmKAN}$ is able to achieve these\nspeeds because of its learnable, data-driven transformations and its relatively\nsmall number of trainable parameters compared to a memory-based emulator. We\nshow that $\\texttt{21cmKAN}$ required less than 30 minutes to train and fit\nthese simulated signals and obtain unbiased posterior distributions. We find\nthat the transparent architecture of $\\texttt{21cmKAN}$ allows us to\nconveniently interpret and further validate its emulation results in terms of\nthe sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to each physical parameter.

We present an holistic framework that we dub `Parametrized\nPost-Newtonian Cosmology' (PPNC), which can be used for obtaining\ntheory-agnostic constraints on deviations from GR using a single unified set of\nparameters that apply on all astrophysical and cosmological scales. Our\napproach is based on the formalism and philosophy of the highly successful\nParametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) framework, but allows us to combine\nobservations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations (BAOs) with Solar System observations of the Cassini probe and\nephemeris of Mars. The full combination of these data sets constrains average\ndeviations from GR over the history of the Universe to be less than $\\sim\n10\\%$, with PPNC parameter values $\\bar{\\alpha}=0.97^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ and\n$\\bar{\\gamma}=0.97^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ at the $68\\%$ confidence level (GR\ncorresponds to $\\bar{\\alpha}=\\bar{\\gamma}=1$). We find that these gravitational\nparameters have a strong mutual degeneracy, and are constrained to be within\n$1\\%$ of each other for all of cosmic history. Our results demonstrate the\nability of the PPNC framework to combine astrophysical, Solar System and\ncosmological tests of gravity into a single set of unified constraints. We\nexpect our approach to be particularly useful for upcoming missions in both\ncosmology and astrophysics, which ultimately seek to constrain the same\nunderlying gravitational interaction.",

Using a three-disk model, we compute spectral energy\ndistributions for four possible accretion configurations and assess their\nobservational signatures, including which frequencies might reflect variability\nat the binary orbital period. The spectral modeling reveals that binary\naccretion can self-consistently account for many of the properties of standard\nAGN, while the variability analysis shows that hydrodynamic modulation at the\nbinary period is most likely in the thermal emission and low-frequency\nsynchrotron components. Doppler boosting of emitting material bound to a single\nbinary component would also induce periodic variability.

    "abstract": "Shadow tomography protocols have recently emerged as powerful tools for\nefficient quantum state learning, aiming to reconstruct expectation values of\nobservables with fewer resources than traditional quantum state tomography. For\nthe particular case of estimating Pauli observables, entangling two-copy\nmeasurement schemes can offer an exponential improvement in sample complexity\nover any single-copy strategy conceivable [1, Huang, Kueng, Preskill,\nPRL(2021)]. A recent refinement of these ideas by King et al. [2, King, Gosset,\nKothari, Babbush, SODA (2025)] does not only achieve polynomial sample\ncomplexity, but also maintains reasonable computational demands and utilizes\njoint measurements on only a small constant number of state copies. This\n`triple efficiency' is achievable for any subset of $n$-qubit Pauli\nobservables, whereas single-copy strategies can only be efficient if the Pauli\nobservables have advantageous structure. In this work, we complement existing\ntheoretical performance guarantees with the empirical evaluation of triply\nefficient shadow tomography using classical, noise-free simulations. Our\nfindings indicate that the empirical sample complexity aligns closely with\ntheoretical predictions for stabilizer states and, notably, demonstrates\nslightly improved scaling for random Gibbs states compared to established\ntheoretical bounds. In addition, we improve a central subroutine in the\ntriply-efficient shadow protocol by leveraging insights from a refined quantum\nand quantum-inspired convex optimization algorithm [3, Henze et al.\narXiv:2502.15426 (2025)]. To summarize, our empirical sample complexity studies\nof triply efficient shadow tomography not only confirm existing theoretical\nscaling behavior, but also showcase that the actual constants involved are\ncomparatively benign. Hence, this protocol has the potential to also be very\nsample-efficient in practice.",

Using galaxy counts to\nvalidate various reddening maps, we find evidence that maps based on\nfar-infrared emission erroneously under-predict reddening compared to stellar\nreddening maps. This underestimation by far-infrared emission based reddening\nmaps -- representing the largest discrepancy between maps of up to\n$E(B-V)=0.08$ mag -- is correlated with the relative brightness of PAH\nemission.

This\nevolution is temporally consistent with 0.3-10 keV X-ray detections of SN\n2023ixf and broad ''boxy'' spectral line emission from reprocessing of shock\nluminosity in a cold dense shell located between forward and reverse shocks.\nUsing the expected absorbed radioactive decay power and the detected X-ray\nluminosity, we quantify the total shock powered emission at the +374 and +620\nday epochs and find that it can be explained by nearly complete thermalization\nof the reverse shock luminosity as SN 2023ixf interacts with a continuous,\n''wind-like'' CSM with a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\\dot M \\approx 10^{-4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w = 20 \\pm 5$ km/s). Additionally, we construct\nmulti-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN,\nwhich contain radioactive decay and shock powers, as well as dust absorption,\nscattering, and emission. We find that models with shock powers of $L_{sh} =\n(0.5-1) \\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(0.5 - 1) \\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$\nof silicate dust in the cold dense shell and/or inner SN ejecta can effectively\nreproduce the global properties of the late-time (>300 days) UV-to-IR spectra\nof SN 2023ixf.",

    "abstract": "Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,\nrecent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the\nreasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning\ntasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently\noffers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform\ndiverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning\ncapabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this\ndirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for\nenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by\nautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and\ncomputational operations via executable code. This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental\nanalysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20\nbenchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,\nparticularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning\ntasks.",

However, existing approaches struggle\nto effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended\nsettings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in\nadvance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for\nmulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is\nmotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains\nproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when\noperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base\nmodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two\nobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,\nwhich nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method\noperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing\ncosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base\nmodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight\nmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain\ndrift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that\nincorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We\nextend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling\ninference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool.

    "abstract": "As computing devices become increasingly integrated into daily life, there is\na growing need for intuitive, always-available interaction methods, even when\nusers' hands are occupied. In this paper, we introduce Grab-n-Go, the first\nwearable device that leverages active acoustic sensing to recognize subtle hand\nmicrogestures while holding various objects. Unlike prior systems that focus\nsolely on free-hand gestures or basic hand-object activity recognition,\nGrab-n-Go simultaneously captures information about hand microgestures,\ngrasping poses, and object geometries using a single wristband, enabling the\nrecognition of fine-grained hand movements occurring within activities\ninvolving occupied hands. A deep learning framework processes these complex\nsignals to identify 30 distinct microgestures, with 6 microgestures for each of\nthe 5 grasping poses. In a user study with 10 participants and 25 everyday\nobjects, Grab-n-Go achieved an average recognition accuracy of 92.0%. A\nfollow-up study further validated Grab-n-Go's robustness against 10 more\nchallenging, deformable objects. These results underscore the potential of\nGrab-n-Go to provide seamless, unobtrusive interactions without requiring\nmodifications to existing objects. The complete dataset, comprising data from\n18 participants performing 30 microgestures with 35 distinct objects, is\npublicly available at https://github.com/cjlisalee/Grab-n-Go_Data with the DOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.7298/7kbd-vv75.",

Jointly fitting the\nS-vine copula with the margins yields an oblique factor rotation without\nresorting to ad hoc restrictions or traditional projection pursuit methods.

    "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects typically involve a diverse array\nof stakeholders or players from public, private, and regulatory sectors, each\nwith different objectives and responsibilities. Given the complexity, scale,\nand long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual\nstakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether\ncollaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for\neffective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often\nimplemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features\nsuch as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive\nbehavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located\nin geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon\nextraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing\ninfrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and\nunrealistic.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively\ninvestigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of\nstakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our\napproach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety\nregulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2\ninto their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To\naddress the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity\nmodels, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control\n(E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage when\nmultiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a novel Lagrangian-based framework to analyze forced\nconvective heat transfer in the unsteady wake of a heated elliptical cylinder\ninclined at angles ranging from $\\theta = 0^\\circ$ to $90^\\circ$, in $15^\\circ$\nincrements with $Pr = 0.71$ at a fixed Reynolds number of $Re = 100$. The\nframework correlates the temporal evolution of the surface-averaged Nusselt\nnumber with the dynamic behavior of Lagrangian saddle points, formed at the\nintersection of repelling and attracting Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs)\nextracted via Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields.The study is carried\nout within a precisely constructed observational domain, a previously\nunreported influential region in the near-wake, where the trajectory analysis\nof the newly defined key saddle points (active saddle points) consistently\naligns with the trends in surface heat transfer. This domain enables predictive\nidentification of key transitional events in the Nusselt number profile,\nincluding local extrema and slope inflections, across all inclination angles.\nThe analysis reveals that oblique displacement of active saddle points enhances\nheat transfer by promoting the shedding of repelling LCSs, while parallel\ndisplacement leads to weakened heat transfer due to the delayed detachment of\nrepelling coherent structures. The proposed framework enables the construction\nof a temporal function that closely replicates the monotonicity and\ntransitional features of the Nusselt number evolution. Furthermore, threshold\ndisplacement metrics are defined for dominant repelling LCSs to correspond with\npeak heat transfer efficiency. The proposed methodology not only generalizes\nacross a wide range of inclination angles but also provides a physically\ninterpretable framework for predicting heat transfer enhancement based on\ncoherent structure evolution in unsteady flows.",

We model vCDM with bulk viscosity $\\zeta =\n\\zeta_0\\,(\\Omega_{vc}/\\Omega_{vc0})^m$, where $m$ determines the viscosity\nevolution and $\\Omega_{vc}$ is the density parameter of vCDM. We explore two\nparticular scenarios: constant viscosity ($m=0$), and variable viscosity ($m$\nfree). Using Bayesian inference, we constrain these models with the latest\ndatasets: the Pantheon+ SN Ia sample (both with SH0ES calibration, PPS, and\nwithout it, PP), $H(z)$ measurements from CC and BAO as separate datasets, and\na Gaussian prior on $H_0$ from 2022 SH0ES baseline, $H_0=73.04 \\pm 1.04$\nkm/s/Mpc (R22 prior). We compare the models via information criteria such as\nAIC, BIC, DIC, and Bayesian evidence. Our results reveal that the Hubble\ntension persists, although it shows partial alleviation ($\\sim 1\\sigma$\ntension) in all investigated scenarios when local measurements are included.\nFor the flat $m=0$ case, the joint analysis yields $H_0 =\n71.05^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ km/s/Mpc. Curved model initially favors $\\Omega_{K0} >\n0$ (at more than $2\\sigma$), but this preference shifts toward flatness once\nthe PPS+R22 prior are included. Notably, the current viscosity is constrained\nto $\\zeta_0 \\sim 10^6$ Pa s in all scenarios, in agreement with the\nthermodynamic requirements. Although model selection via BIC and Bayesian\nevidence favors $\\Lambda$CDM, AIC and DIC show mild support for viscous models\nin some datasets. Bulk viscous models moderately improve fits but neither\nresolve the Hubble tension nor outperform the $\\Lambda$CDM model. To achieve\nmore robust constraints, future analyses should incorporate CMB observations,\nwhich are expected to break parameter degeneracies involving $m$ and\n$\\tilde{\\zeta}_0$.",

The proposed\nmethod transforms the standard trajectory optimization problem into a purely\ngeometric one that involves computing a set of geodesics for a suitable\nRiemannian metric. This transformation is achieved by defining a metric,\nspecifically the Jacobi metric, that embeds the dynamics directly into the\nmetric, so any geodesic of the metric is also a dynamically feasible\ntrajectory. The method finds the fuel-optimal transfer trajectory by sampling\ncandidate energy ($\\Delta V$) changes for different points on the current and\ndesired orbit, and efficiently computing and evaluating each candidate\ngeodesic, which are equivalent to candidate orbit transfer trajectories via the\nJacobi metric. The method bypasses the known issues of optimization-based\nmethods, e.g., sensitivity to the initial guess, and can be applied to more\ncomplex two-body systems. The approach is demonstrated on the minimum-$\\Delta\nV$ two-impulse phase-free orbit transfer problem, first on a Keplerian system\nand second on a system with a modeled $J_2$ perturbation. The proposed method\nis shown to meet or exceed the state-of-the-art methods in the minimum-$\\Delta\nV$ problem in the Keplerian system.

On\nthe other hand, the short-time behaviour of the recoherence and the long-time\ndynamics of the decoherence are closely related: the domain of the ohmicity\nindexes, where the decoherence changes its type (from the complete to\nincomplete one), is, simultaneously, that of the weakest recoherence.

The first week was a summer school consisting of four independent but\nrelated lecture series by Oscar Garc\\'ia Prada, Spiro Karigiannis, Laurent\nManivel, and Ruxandra Moraru. The present document consists of notes for the\nlecture series by Spiro Karigiannis on \"Flows of geometric structures,\nespecially $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures\". Some assistance in the preparation of\nthese notes by the author was provided by several participants of the summer\nschool. See the Comments field for more information.\n  The main theme is short time existence (STE) and uniqueness for geometric\nflows. We first introduce geometric structures on manifolds and geometric flows\nof such structures. We discuss some qualitative features of geometric flows,\nand consider the notions of strong and weak parabolicity. We focus on the Ricci\nflow, explaining carefully the DeTurck trick to establish short-time existence\nand uniqueness, an argument which we then extend to a general class of\ngeometric flows of Riemannian metrics, previewing similar ideas for flows of\n$\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. Finally, we consider geometric flows of\n$\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. We review the basics of $\\mathrm{G}_2$-geometry and\nsurvey several different geometric flows of $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures. In\nparticular, we clarify in what sense STE results for the $\\mathrm{G}_2$\nLaplacian flow differ from STE results for other geometric flows. We conclude\nwith a summary of some recent results by the author with Dwivedi and\nGianniotis, including a classification of all possible heat-type flows of\n$\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures, and a sufficient condition for such a flow to admit\nSTE and uniqueness by a modified DeTurck trick.",

The $p$ complex energy bands in $k$ space are given by a\ncommon $k$-dependent real factor, determined by the bands of the parent model,\nmultiplied by the $p$th roots of unity. When the parent model is the\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the single-particle energy levels are the\nsame as those of free parafermion solutions to Baxter's non-Hermitian clock\nmodel. This construction relies on fully unidirectional hopping to create Bloch\nHamiltonians with the form of generalized permutation matrices, but we also\ndescribe the effect of partial unidirectional hopping. For fully bidirectional\nhopping, the Bloch Hamiltonians are Hermitian and may be separated into even\nand odd parity blocks with respect to inversion of the orbitals within the unit\ncell. Partially unidirectional hopping breaks the inversion symmetry and mixes\nthe even and odd blocks, and the real energy spectrum evolves into a complex\none as the degree of unidirectionality increases, with details determined by\nthe topology of the parent model and the number of orbitals per unit cell, $p$.\nWe describe this process in detail for $p=3$ and $p=4$ with the SSH model. We\nalso apply our approach to graphene, and show that $AA$-stacked bilayer\ngraphene evolves into a square root Hamiltonian of monolayer graphene with the\nintroduction of unidirectional hopping.

Unlike\ntraditional parametric approaches, which assume a known functional form for the\ndrift, our goal here is to learn the entire drift function directly from data\nwithout strong structural assumptions, making it especially relevant in\nscientific disciplines where system dynamics are partially understood or highly\ncomplex. We cast the estimation problem as minimization of the penalized\nnegative log-likelihood functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS). In the sparse observation regime, the presence of unobserved trajectory\nsegments makes the SDE likelihood intractable. To address this, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that employs a novel Sequential Monte\nCarlo (SMC) method to approximate the filtering distribution and generate Monte\nCarlo estimates of the E-step objective. The M-step then reduces to a penalized\nempirical risk minimization problem in the RKHS, whose minimizer is given by a\nfinite linear combination of kernel functions via a generalized representer\ntheorem. To control model complexity across EM iterations, we also develop a\nhybrid Bayesian variant of the algorithm that uses shrinkage priors to identify\nsignificant coefficients in the kernel expansion. We establish important\ntheoretical convergence results for both the exact and approximate EM\nsequences. The resulting EM-SMC-RKHS procedure enables accurate estimation of\nthe drift function of stochastic dynamical systems in low-data regimes and is\nbroadly applicable across domains requiring continuous-time modeling under\nobservational constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method\nthrough a series of numerical experiments.",

    "abstract": "We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution\nvisual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a\nnative-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native,\nvariable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and\npreserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense\ncontent like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to\nmove beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including\nself-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional\n\"thinking mode\" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced\naccuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive\nfive-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins\nwith foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through\nlarge-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning\nenhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ\nmultimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant\nend-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and\nOvis2.5-2B. The latter continues the \"small model, big performance\" philosophy\nof Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the\nOpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a\nsubstantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving\nstate-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter\nrange; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate\nscores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong\ncapabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its\nscale for complex chart analysis.",

Depth maps were first\nestimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a\ngradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly\nfor distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive\nperformance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly\nreducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using\nGPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole\ncamera geometry.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved\ntheir capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy,\nimpairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time\napplications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on\nhuman-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared\ndifficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic\nReasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to\ndynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem\ncomplexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness\nAlignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism.\nThese components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing\nefficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response\ntokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain\nin token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited\nto resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass\ntraditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16%\naccuracy improvement.",

However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying\nevent order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core\nchallenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism\nfor encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or\nmodifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of\ntemporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while\npreserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this\nbehavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal\ninformation is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information\npathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame\nattention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the\nquery tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges\nfrom inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,\nwhich implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we\npropose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a\ntemporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches.

Fully Homomorphic\nEncryption (FHE) presents a compelling solution by enabling computations\ndirectly on encrypted data, maintaining confidentiality across the entire\nmachine learning workflow. However, FHE inherently supports only linear\noperations, making it difficult to implement non-linear activation functions,\nessential components of modern neural networks. This work focuses on designing,\nimplementing, and evaluating activation functions tailored for FHE-based\nmachine learning. We investigate two commonly used functions: the Square\nfunction and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), using LeNet-5 and ResNet-20\narchitectures with the CKKS scheme from the OpenFHE library. For ReLU, we\nassess two methods: a conventional low-degree polynomial approximation and a\nnovel scheme-switching technique that securely evaluates ReLU under FHE\nconstraints. Our findings show that the Square function performs well in\nshallow networks like LeNet-5, achieving 99.4% accuracy with 128 seconds per\nimage. In contrast, deeper models like ResNet-20 benefit more from ReLU. The\npolynomial approximation yields 83.8% accuracy with 1,145 seconds per image,\nwhile our scheme-switching method improves accuracy to 89.8%, albeit with a\nlonger inference time of 1,697 seconds.

    "abstract": "Automatic Section Control (ASC) is a long-standing trend for spraying in\nagriculture. It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to\n(i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii)\nto dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray\nnozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not\npossible without sensors, in particular for accurate positioning data. Spraying\nand the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In\naddition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift,\nboom height, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, and so forth. In view of\nthis complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist.\nTherefore, an Automatic Multi-Sections Control method is compared to a proposed\nsimpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching.\nThe comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is\nintrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic.\nCombinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as\nthree sections-setups are compared. The three sections-setups differ by\ncontrolling 48 sections, 2 sections or controlling all nozzles uniformly with\nthe same control signal as one single section. Methods are evaluated on 10\ndiverse real-world field examples, including non-convex field contours,\nfreeform mainfield lanes and multiple obstacle areas. A preferred method is\nsuggested that (i) minimises area coverage pathlength, (ii) offers intermediate\noverlap, (iii) is suitable for manual driving by following a pre-planned\npredictive spray switching logic for an area coverage path plan, and (iv) and\nin contrast to ASC can be implemented sensor-free and therefore at low cost.",

In this paper, we present TrajSV, a\ntrajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.\nTrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation\nNetwork (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data\npreprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports\nbroadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to\nlearn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet\nlearns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual\nfeatures with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive\nloss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an\nunsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video\ndatasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,\nsoccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,\nsports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results\ndemonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video\nretrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement.

Each element of the\ncut basis corresponds to the positive geometry associated to an independent cut\nof the physical FRW-form and can be labeled by decorating (minors of) the\ntruncated Feynman graph with an acyclic orientation. We provide a\nstraightforward prescription to associate a logarithmic differential form to\neach element of the cut basis by considering its corresponding decorated graph.\nMoreover, we show that the residues of the physical FRW-form are canonical\nforms of certain graphical zonotopes labeled by the same set of decorated\ngraphs. These zonotopes control the cut combinatorics -- flow of cuts -- of the\nphysical FRW-form and the cut basis (by construction). Using the theory of\nrelative twisted cohomology and intersection theory, we derive a closed form\nformula for the differential equations of the cut basis. We also introduce\ncombinatorial rules that compute the kinematic differential of any basis\nelement without explicit calculation. The combinatorics of our differential\nequations is a natural consequence of the flow of cuts and is equivalent (up to\nrescaling) to the kinematic flow for the recently studied time integral basis.\nIn particular, our differential equations decouple into exponentially many\nsectors, one for each way of cutting a subset of edges of the graph.",

    "abstract": "Mental health assessment is crucial for early intervention and effective\ntreatment, yet traditional clinician-based approaches are limited by the\nshortage of qualified professionals. Recent advances in artificial intelligence\nhave sparked growing interest in automated psychological assessment, yet most\nexisting approaches are constrained by their reliance on static text analysis,\nlimiting their ability to capture deeper and more informative insights that\nemerge through dynamic interaction and iterative questioning. Therefore, in\nthis paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluation\nthat simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues, with specialized agents\nassigned to questioning, adequacy evaluation, scoring, and updating. We\nintroduce an adaptive questioning mechanism in which an evaluation agent\nassesses the adequacy of user responses to determine the necessity of\ngenerating targeted follow-up queries to address ambiguity and missing\ninformation. Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the root\nnode encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic and\nstatement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categories\nand interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout the\ninteraction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information\nextraction and contextual tracking capabilities. Experimental results on the\nDAIC-WOZ dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which\nachieves better performance than existing approaches.",

Prior work typically relies on isolated acoustic correlates\n(e.g., pitch, duration) or label prediction, both of which miss the relational\nstructure of emphasis. This paper proposes a residual-based framework, defining\nemphasis as the difference between paired neutral and emphasized word\nrepresentations. Analysis on self-supervised speech models shows that these\nresiduals correlate strongly with duration changes and perform poorly at word\nidentity prediction, indicating a structured, relational encoding of prosodic\nemphasis.

    "abstract": "Feature interaction has long been a cornerstone of ranking models in\nlarge-scale recommender systems due to its proven effectiveness in capturing\ncomplex dependencies among features. However, existing feature interaction\nstrategies face two critical challenges in industrial applications: (1) The\nvast number of categorical and sequential features makes exhaustive interaction\ncomputationally prohibitive, often resulting in optimization difficulties. (2)\nReal-world recommender systems typically involve multiple prediction\nobjectives, yet most current approaches apply feature interaction modules prior\nto the multi-task learning layers. This late-fusion design overlooks\ntask-specific feature dependencies and inherently limits the capacity of\nmulti-task modeling. To address these limitations, we propose the Information\nFlow Network (INFNet), a task-aware architecture designed for large-scale\nrecommendation scenarios. INFNet distinguishes features into three token types,\ncategorical tokens, sequence tokens, and task tokens, and introduces a novel\ndual-flow design comprising heterogeneous and homogeneous alternating\ninformation blocks. For heterogeneous information flow, we employ a\ncross-attention mechanism with proxy that facilitates efficient cross-modal\ntoken interaction with balanced computational cost. For homogeneous flow, we\ndesign type-specific Proxy Gated Units (PGUs) to enable fine-grained intra-type\nfeature processing. Extensive experiments on multiple offline benchmarks\nconfirm that INFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, INFNet has\nbeen successfully deployed in a commercial online advertising system, yielding\nsignificant gains of +1.587% in Revenue (REV) and +1.155% in Click-Through Rate\n(CTR).",

Typical SE constructions often allow\naccess-pattern leakage, revealing which encrypted records are retrieved in the\nserver's responses. All the known generic cryptanalyses assume either that the\nqueries are issued uniformly at random or that the attacker observes the\nsearch-pattern leakage. It remains unclear what can be reconstructed when using\nonly the access-pattern leakage and knowledge of the query distribution. In\nthis work, we focus on the cryptanalytic technique of frequency analysis in the\ncontext of leakage-abuse attacks on schemes that support encrypted range\nqueries. Frequency analysis matches the frequency of retrieval of an encrypted\nrecord with a plaintext value based on its probability of retrieval that\nfollows from the knowledge of the query distribution. We generalize this\nunderexplored cryptanalytic technique and introduce a generic attack framework\ncalled Leakage-Abuse via Matching (LAMA) that works even on high-dimensional\nencrypted data. We identify a parameterization of LAMA that brings frequency\nanalysis to its limit -- that is, we prove that there is no additional\nfrequency matching that an attacker can perform to refine the result.\nFurthermore, we show that our results hold for any class of convex queries, and\nnot just axis-aligned rectangles, which is the assumption in all other attacks\non range schemes. Using these results, we identify query distributions that\nmake frequency analysis challenging for the attacker and, thus, can act as a\nmitigation mechanism.

First,\nSeamlessFlow introduces a data plane that decouples the RL trainer from\ndiverse, complex agent implementations while sustaining high throughput. A\ncentral trajectory manager maintains complete interaction histories and\nsupports partial rollout, allowing rollout to pause for weight updates and\nresume seamlessly, keeping agents unaware of service interruptions. Second, we\npropose a tag driven scheduling paradigm that abstracts hardware into\ncapability tagged resources, unifying colocated and disaggregated\narchitectures. Based on this, SeamlessFlow introduces a spatiotemporal\nmultiplexing pipeline that dynamically reassigns idle training nodes to rollout\nin a train rollout separated setup, eliminating pipeline bubbles and fully\nexploiting heterogeneous cluster resources. By combining these innovations,\nSeamlessFlow delivers both stability and high performance, making it well\nsuited for multi agent, long horizon, and other complex RL tasks.",

In this\nwork, we propose to view the selection of training data mixtures as a black-box\nhyperparameter optimization problem, for which Bayesian Optimization is a\nwell-established class of appropriate algorithms. Firstly, we cast data mixture\nlearning as a sequential decision-making problem, in which we aim to find a\nsuitable trade-off between the computational cost of training exploratory\n(proxy-) models and final mixture performance. Secondly, we systematically\nexplore the properties of transferring mixtures learned at a small scale to\nlarger-scale experiments, providing insights and highlighting opportunities for\nresearch at a modest scale. By proposing Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization\nas a suitable method in this common scenario, we introduce a natural framework\nto balance experiment cost with model fit, avoiding the risks of overfitting to\nsmaller scales while minimizing the number of experiments at high cost.

A growing body of works have\nemerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,\nthese anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be\ntrained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly\ngeneration framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s\nstrong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a\nnormal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and\nnatural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in\nother regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement\n(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion\nbased on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in\nspecific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual\ntokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies\nneed to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose\nSelf-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal\nvisual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies\nare coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA\ndatasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its\nutility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance\nof various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.",

This\nstudy utilizes the XTANT-3 hybrid/multiscale model to investigate the\nmicroscopic response of these materials to ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The\nmodel simultaneously traces intertwined processes of non-equilibrium dynamics\nof both electrons and atoms, nonadiabatic coupling, nonthermal melting, and\nbond breaking due to electronic excitation. Among the materials studied, CdTe\nexhibits the highest radiation resistance, similar to CdS. At the respective\nthreshold doses, the melting is primarily thermal, driven by electron-phonon\ncoupling, which is accompanied by the band gap closure. Additionally, all\nmaterials exhibit nonthermal melting at higher doses. When accounting for\nenergy dissipation pathways and material recrystallization processes, damage\nthresholds increase substantially. In CdTe and PbS, below 1.5 eV/atom, the band\ngap returns to its original value upon recrystallization. As the dose\nincreases, the resulting cooled material becomes increasingly amorphous,\nprogressively reducing the band gap until a stable configuration is reached.\nNotably, in a narrow window of deposited doses, ITO exhibits transient\nsuperionic behavior, with the liquid oxygen but solid In and Sn sublattices. At\n0.6 eV/atom in CdTe and 0.4 eV/atom in PbS and ITO, material ablation from the\nsurface occurs.

    "abstract": "Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs, for short) make up a class of\nproblems with applications in many areas of computer science. The first\nclassification of these problems was given by Schaeffer who showed that every\nCSP over the domain {0,1} is either in P or is NP-complete. More recently this\nwas shown to hold for all CSPs over finite relational structures independently\nby Bulatov and Zhuk. Furthermore, they characterized the complexity based\nsolely on the polymorphism algebra of the associated relational structure,\nbuilding upon the deep connections between universal algebra and complexity\ntheory. In this article we extend this and consider what happens if the\ninstance forms a special type of relational core called a multisorted core. Our\nmain result is that in this case the problem is reducible to computing the\ndeterminant of an integer valued matrix which places it in the complexity class\nDET, which is likely a strict subset of P.",

However, existing works ignore the multimodal nature of parking\nbehavior in lane-free open space, failing to derive multiple plausible\nsolutions under the same situation.

While standard models typically assume a minimal coupling between\nthe detector and the field, physically motivated derivative couplings, which\nare sensitive to field gradients, have been less explored, particularly in the\ncontext of modified gravity theories. In this paper, we develop a general\nframework to analyze the acceleration radiation from a two-level atomic\ndetector with a derivative coupling undergoing a radial geodesic infall into a\ngeneric static, spherically symmetric black hole. We derive a general integral\nexpression for the excitation probability and apply it to two distinct\nspacetimes. For an extended uncertainty principle (EUP) black hole, we\ndemonstrate that the detector radiates with a perfect thermal spectrum at the\nprecise Hawking temperature, reinforcing the universality of this phenomenon.\nFor a black hole solution in a Ricci-coupled Bumblebee gravity model, the\nradiation is also thermal. Still, its temperature is modified in direct\ncorrespondence with the theory's Lorentz-violating parameters, consistent with\nthe modified Hawking temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that derivative\ncoupling results in a significantly enhanced entropy flux compared to minimal\ncoupling models. Our results establish acceleration radiation as a sensitive\nprobe of near-horizon physics and demonstrate that this phenomenon can provide\ndistinct observational signatures to test General Relativity (GR) and\nalternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime.",

Building on research on fairness and\ndiscrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --\ndiscrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human\nanimals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment\nframeworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for\nreducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes\nin AI systems and the societies they influence.",

The experimental results show that LLMs\neffectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where\ninfusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds\nparticular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge\nwithin LLMs.",

Our methodology involves\ntraining an ensemble of convolutional neural network models, using online\nknowledge distillation to transfer insights from the ensemble to its members.\nThis process aims to enhance the performance of each model within the ensemble,\nthereby elevating the overall performance of the ensemble itself.\nPost-training, any individual model within the ensemble can be deployed at test\ntime, as each member is trained to deliver comparable performance to the\nensemble. This is particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-distilled individual model\nperforms better than independently trained models. Our approach demonstrates\nsuperior performance on both the \\emph{International Skin Imaging\nCollaboration} 2018 and 2019 public benchmark datasets, surpassing current\nstate-of-the-art results. By leveraging ensemble learning and online knowledge\ndistillation, our method reduces the need for extensive labeled data while\nproviding a more resource-efficient solution for skin lesion classification in\nreal-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In the subsurface, fractures and the surrounding porous rock can deform in\ninteraction with fluid flow. Advanced mathematical models governing these\ncoupled processes typically combine fluid flow, poroelasticity, and fracture\ncontact mechanics, representing fractures as co-dimension one objects within\nthe porous medium. The resulting system of equations is complex and highly\nnonlinear. As a result, convergence issues with nonlinear solvers are common,\nwhich hinders the practical implementation of such models.\n  One particular source of difficulty for the nonlinear solvers comes from the\nfracture contact mechanics, due to its inherently nonsmooth character. In this\npaper, we investigate solvers based on the augmented Lagrangian formulation of\nthe frictional contact problem. This includes two classical solvers, namely the\ngeneralized Newton method (using complementarity functions) and the return map\nmethod. In addition, we propose a new augmented Lagrangian solver that combines\nthe two approaches.\n  Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to assess the\nperformance of the solvers on problems of mixed-dimensional poromechanics with\nfracture contact mechanics. The experiments indicate that for simpler setups,\nthe solvers behave quite predictably and in accordance with established\nheuristics from the contact mechanics literature. However, as the complexity of\nthe problem increases, the solvers become more unpredictable, and break with\nthese heuristics. In particular, the two classical solvers become highly\nsensitive to the augmentation parameter. The new solver converges across a\nlarger range of this parameter in most cases, but nevertheless also displays\nunpredictable behavior.",

Tree covers provide an important\nsketching tool that has found various applications over the years. The\ncelebrated {Dumbbell Theorem} by Arya et al. [STOC'95] states that any set of\npoints in the Euclidean plane admits a $(1+\\epsilon)$-stretch tree cover with\n$O_\\epsilon(1)$ trees. This result extends to any (constant) dimension and was\nalso generalized for arbitrary doubling metrics by Bartal et al. [ICALP'19].\n  Although the number of trees provided by the Dumbbell Theorem is constant,\nthis constant is not small, even for a stretch significantly larger than\n$1+\\epsilon$. At the other extreme, any single tree on the vertices of a\nregular $n$-polygon must incur a stretch of $\\Omega(n)$. Using known results of\nultrametric embeddings, one can easily get a stretch of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$\nusing two trees. The question of whether a low stretch can be achieved using\ntwo trees has remained illusive, even in the Euclidean plane.\n  In this work, we resolve this fundamental question in the affirmative by\npresenting a constant-stretch cover with a pair of trees, for any set of points\nin the Euclidean plane. Our main technical contribution is a {surprisingly\nsimple} Steiner construction, for which we provide a {tight} stretch analysis\nof $\\sqrt{26}$. The Steiner points can be easily pruned if one is willing to\nincrease the stretch by a small constant. Moreover, we can bound the maximum\ndegree of the construction by a constant.\n  Our result thus provides a simple yet effective reduction tool -- for\nproblems that concern approximate distances -- from the Euclidean plane to a\npair of trees. To demonstrate the potential power of this tool, we present some\napplications [...]",

    "abstract": "To protect privacy for data-collection-based services, local differential\nprivacy (LDP) is widely adopted due to its rigorous theoretical bound on\nprivacy loss. However, mistakes in complex theoretical analysis or subtle\nimplementation errors may undermine its practical guarantee. To address this,\nauditing is crucial to confirm that LDP protocols truly protect user data.\nHowever, existing auditing methods, though, mainly target machine learning and\nfederated learning tasks based on centralized differentially privacy (DP), with\nlimited attention to LDP. Moreover, the few studies on LDP auditing focus\nsolely on simple frequency estimation task for discrete data, leaving\ncorrelated key-value data - which requires both discrete frequency estimation\nfor keys and continuous mean estimation for values - unexplored.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose KV-Auditor, a framework for auditing LDP-based\nkey-value estimation mechanisms by estimating their empirical privacy lower\nbounds. Rather than traditional LDP auditing methods that relies on binary\noutput predictions, KV-Auditor estimates this lower bound by analyzing\nunbounded output distributions, supporting continuous data. Specifically, we\nclassify state-of-the-art LDP key-value mechanisms into interactive and\nnon-interactive types. For non-interactive mechanisms, we propose horizontal\nKV-Auditor for small domains with sufficient samples and vertical KV-Auditor\nfor large domains with limited samples. For interactive mechanisms, we design a\nsegmentation strategy to capture incremental privacy leakage across iterations.\nFinally, we perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our\napproach, offering insights for optimizing LDP-based key-value estimators.",

We further advance this paradigm\nthrough a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into\nthe planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by\nevolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning\nperformance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled\nperception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By\nincorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the\nperception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along\nthese trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning\ntrajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the\nplanning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an\nautoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while\nfocusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step.

The\naforementioned problem is transferred into a Markov Decision Process to model\nthe changing environment with the transmission/ waiting/ retransmission of\nGFUs. In an effort to solve the pertinent problem, firstly, a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) based transmission scheduling approach is proposed\nfor determining the optimal transmission probability based on the available\ntransmission slots and transmission status of GFUs. Secondly, a hierarchical\nlearning algorithm is proposed to analyze the channel state information of GBUs\nand the transmission status of GFUs, and to train an upper-level policy based\non this analysis for beamforming to achieve efficient grant-based transmission,\nwhile a lower-level policy adapts to maximize the utilization of transmission\nslots allocated by the upper-level agent. The two policies interact to improve\nchannel access and avoid collisions. Numerical results reveal that 1) The DRL\nbased transmission scheduling outperforms existing adaptive and state-dependent\nbaselines in AoI reduction, where an average\nthree-time-slots-earlier-transmission can be obtained compared to the\nstate-dependent choice, and five time slots earlier can be achieved when\ncomparing to the adaptive choice; 2) The hierarchical learning algorithm is\nable to achieve approximately a 31.82% gain while maintaining the average AoI\nof GFUs within 1.5 time slots. 3) The effectiveness of the hierarchical\nlearning scheme in NOMA-assisted SGF system is validated across scenarios with\nGFUs counts from 1-5 times of GBUs.",

Due to the lack of fine-grained\nbehavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within\nuser behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false\npositive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and\nanomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior\nsequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels\n(anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to\nenhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning\ndiscriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called\nRobust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to\nrepresent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier\nis constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building on\nthis, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-level\nself-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the framework\nfurther refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weak\nsequence-level labels.

We reformulate the algorithm and\ndata layout of different steps for SVD computation, performing all panel-level\ncomputations and trailing matrix updates entirely on GPU to eliminate CPU-GPU\ndata transfers. Furthermore, we integrate related computations to optimize BLAS\nutilization, thereby increasing arithmetic intensity and fully leveraging the\ncomputational capabilities of GPUs. Additionally, we introduce a newly\ndeveloped GPU-based BDC algorithm that restructures the workflow to eliminate\nmatrix-level CPU-GPU data transfers and enable asynchronous execution between\nthe CPU and GPU. Experimental results on AMD MI210 and NVIDIA V100 GPUs\ndemonstrate that our proposed method achieves speedups of up to 1293.64x/7.47x\nand 14.10x/12.38x compared to rocSOLVER/cuSOLVER and MAGMA, respectively.",

A prime indicator $I(j)$ is encoded through a short $\\gcd$-sum; a\ncumulative counter $S(i)=\\sum_{j\\le i}I(j)$ equals $\\pi(i)$; and a folded step\n$A(i,x)$ counts precisely up to the next prime index without piecewise\nbranching. A corollary shows that for any fixed integer $L\\ge 2$, the integer\n$P^\\star=f_{\\text{Alpay},U}(L)$ is prime and $P^\\star>L$.

Using\nthe asymptotic matching method, we compute superradiant amplification factors,\nwhile quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies are obtained via the asymptotic\niteration method (AIM).

However,\nmost existing methods are trained offline and lack mechanisms to adapt to new\nenvironments during deployment. As a result, their generalization ability\ndiminishes when faced with unseen variations in real-world driving scenarios.\nIn this paper, we break away from the conventional \"train once, deploy forever\"\nparadigm and propose EvoPSF, a novel online Evolution framework for autonomous\ndriving based on Planning-State Feedback. We argue that planning failures are\nprimarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such\nfailures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To\naddress this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,\nusing it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than\nperforming blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to\nidentify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are\nprimarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we\ncompute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints\nfrom the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from\nthe perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then\nbackpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the\nmodel's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion\npredictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors.\nExperiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset\ndemonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under\nchallenging conditions.",

While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU)\nand leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the\ndevelopment of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced\ngeneral-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in\nreal-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion\nArena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected\ndirectly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model\ncomparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect\npractical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the\nBradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,\na cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated\nmodels, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that\nprioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize\ninformation gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and\nsimulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable\nrankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced\ndatasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By\nfostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world\napplications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and\nMLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments.

We show that when monomers have\nexcitation-dependent permanent dipoles, optical transitions between the bright\nand dark states of the dimer are enabled. We investigate how permanent dipoles\nallow for the existence of static driving terms between the ground and excited\nstates of each monomer. In turn, these can cause the excited states of the\nmonomers to couple indirectly to the zero excitation state of the dimer. This\nleads to interference between permanent and transition dipoles and can result\nin the formation of dark states that are entirely localised.

This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly\ntraining a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual\nSimilarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which\nnaive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that\nresolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific\nlearning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce\nCoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR\nand STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key\ninnovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives\npaired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances\nper-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a\ncontrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by\ncross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly\noptimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion\nstrategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by\nanalyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization,\nproving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient,\nsingle-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges\nstably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three\nbase encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the\nframework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves\nthe geometric properties of the embedding space.",

This is challenging for two main reasons. First, the\n(multi-dimensional) SDEs cannot be explicitly solved and are driven by\nmultiplicative and non-commutative noise, requiring the development of advanced\nnumerical schemes for their approximation and simulation. Second, not all\ncomponents of the SDEs are directly observed, as the available discrete-time\ndata are typically incomplete and/or perturbed with measurement error. We\ntackle these issues via three contributions. First, we show that these models\ncan be rewritten as perturbed conditionally Cox-Ingersoll-Ross-type SDEs, i.e.,\neach coordinate, conditioned on all other coordinates being fixed, follows an\nSDE with linear drift and square root diffusion coefficient perturbed by\nadditional Brownian motions. Second, for this class of SDEs, we develop a\nnumerical splitting scheme that preserves structural properties of the model,\nsuch as oscillations, state space and invariant distributions, unlike the\ncommonly used Euler-Maruyama scheme.

However, existing methods for CBT learning\nsuch as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are\nhindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due\nto their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive\nfocus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the\ngenerated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory\nCOgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)\nto learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD\n(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow\nfor tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling\nthe modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By\nintegrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO\ncaptures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process\ninformation and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:\n(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional\nconnectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to\nthe best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity\nstudies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive\nreservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show\nthat our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms\nof centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory\nmemory retention.

Specifically, we first\nextracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs),\nstatic/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion\nentropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a\nmodified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level\nfeature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process.\nThen, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both\nstable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different\nbrain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention\nmodule was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance\nof our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by\ndiscriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ,\nn=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550).

Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet\nunderstudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate\nbehavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this\nintegration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting\naction-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and\nmaintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a\nnovel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based\ndriving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified\nimagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving\ntrajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to\ngenerate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are\nsubsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning\ndecisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in\nthis integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory\nselection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and\nNAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over\nprevious alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.",

Suppose, as is customary, that a deterministic theory is one\nwhose mathematical formulation yields a unique solution to its governing\nequations. Then the question of whether a theory is deterministic is the\nquestion of whether there exists a unique solution to its mathematical model. I\nargue that competing axiom candidates extending standard mathematics can\ndiverge on all dimensions of determinism. First, they may disagree about\nwhether a given physical system is well-posed, and so whether a solution\nexists. Second, even when they agree that a solution exists, they can differ on\nwhether that solution is unique. Finally, even when they agree that a system\nhas a solution, and agree that this solution is unique, they may still dispute\nwhat that solution is. Whether a theory is deterministic - and even which\noutcome it predicts - can depend on choice of set-theoretic metatheory.

Our main result is a theorem that proves that the only way to ensure\nthat two events that take place at different sites are temporally ordered is by\nhaving the execution create an occurs-before chain between the events. By\nstudying the role of fences and $RMW$s in creating occurs-before chains, we are\nthen able to capture cases in which these costly synchronization operations are\nunavoidable. Since proper real-time ordering of events is a fundamental aspect\nof consistency conditions such as Linearizability, our analysis provides a\nsound theoretical understanding of essential aspects of the TSO model. In\nparticular, we are able to generalize prior lower bounds for linearizable\nimplementations of shared memory objects. Our results capture the structure of\ninformation flow and causality in the TSO model by extending the standard\ncommunication-based reasoning from asynchronous systems to the TSO memory\nmodel.",

We then investigate whether\nthe value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value\nsurveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two\nways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey\nquestions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in\nout-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a\ncontextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate\nchanges in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate\nthat our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain\nsurvey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in\nimplicit downstream task behavior.",

We\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions under which a Riemannian warped\nproduct submersion satisfies the Clairaut condition, showing that it holds if\nand only if the girth function defining the Clairaut condition has a horizontal\ngradient, one component of the fibers is totally geodesic, and the other is\ntotally umbilical with mean curvature vector governed by the warping function.\nWe examine the geometric consequences of this structure, study the harmonicity\nconditions and the behavior of the Weyl tensor.

Existing approaches that\nintegrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model\npatterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a\nnovel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy\nversus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable\nHarmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic\nWeighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically\nweighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an\nanalysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular\nlevels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the\nframework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the\ntransition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies\na token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert\ntokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from\noff-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,\nproviding empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient\nlearning process.

This study aims to characterize how the PAH\nionization fraction varies across different H II regions and to search for\nspectroscopic evidence of the processing or destruction of PAH molecules in\nintense radiation fields. Methodology: We utilized mid-infrared integral field\nspectroscopic data from the JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) in its Medium\nResolution Spectroscopy (MRS) mode. One-dimensional spectra were extracted for\neach of the four H II regions. We measured the integrated fluxes of the\nprominent PAH emission features at 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 micron and calculated key\ndiagnostic flux ratios to probe the physical state of the PAH population.\nResults: The four H II regions in NGC 5457 exhibit significant diversity in\ntheir PAH spectral characteristics. The diagnostic F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratio, a\ntracer of PAH ionization, varies from 0.23 to 0.62 across the sample. The\nregion with the highest ionization (highest F(8.6)/F(11.3)) shows the lowest\nF(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (1.13), while the region with the lowest ionization has the\nhighest F(7.7)/F(8.6) ratio (2.38). Conclusion: The observed spectral diversity\nis primarily driven by variations in the PAH ionization state, which is\ngoverned by the local radiation field intensity. The strong anti-correlation\nbetween the F(7.7)/F(8.6) and F(8.6)/F(11.3) ratios provides a new, powerful\ndiagnostic for PAH processing. This trend is interpreted as an evolutionary\nsequence where increasingly harsh radiation fields not only ionize the PAH\npopulation but also alter the surviving cations, consistent with the selective\ndestruction of the carriers of the 7.7 micron feature.",

    "abstract": "The increasing heterogeneity of student populations poses significant\nchallenges for teachers, particularly in mathematics education, where\ncognitive, motivational, and emotional differences strongly influence learning\noutcomes. While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain\nperformance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting\nbroader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a\nteacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to\ngenerate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and\nmotivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three\nspecialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles\nincorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent\nthat adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3)\nan evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the\nsystem using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its\nfeasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and\nb) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten\ninternal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated\nmaterials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted\nstructure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of\nmulti-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware\npersonalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for\nextending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom\ntrials.",

    "abstract": "The study of the charmed baryons is crucial for investigating the strong and\nweak interactions in the Standard Model and for gaining insights into the\ninternal structure of baryons. In an $e^+e^-$ experiment the lightest charmed\nbaryon, $\\Lambda_c^+$, can be produced in pairs through the single photon\nannihilation process. This process can be described by two complex\nelectromagnetic form factors. The presence of a non-zero relative phase between\nthese form factors gives rise to a transverse polarization of the charmed\nbaryon and provides additional constraints on the dynamic parameters in the\ndecays. In this article, we present the first observation of the transverse\npolarization of $\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ in the reaction $e^+e^- \\to\n\\Lambda_c^{+}\\bar{\\Lambda}_c^-$, based on $6.4~\\text{fb}^{-1}$ of $e^{+}e^{-}$\nannihilation data collected at center-of-mass energies between 4600 MeV and\n4951 MeV with the BESIII detector. The decay asymmetry parameters and strong\nphase shift in the decays $\\Lambda_c^+ \\to pK_S^0$, $\\Lambda\\pi^+$,\n$\\Sigma^0\\pi^+$, $\\Sigma^+\\pi^0$ are also simultaneously extracted from the\njoint angular distributions.

Current\napproaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce,\nhighly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire.\nThese methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack\nmulti-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with\nexpert clinical reasoning.

In this work, through a\nmulti-scale theoretical framework combining density functional theory, spin\nHamiltonian modeling, and Wannier-function analysis, we choose monolayer\nCrI$_3$ to unravel how carrier doping affects the isotropic as well as\nanisotropic exchange interactions in this prototypical vdW ferromagnet.

Crucially, we demonstrated that unlike the undoped system - where\nisotropic exchange interactions govern magnetic long-range order - the\nhole-doped CrI$_3$ exhibits anisotropic terms comparable in magnitude to\nisotropic ones. Finally, we show that a high concentration of holes in a\nCrI$_3$ monolayer can increase its Curie temperature above 200 K.

Furthermore, its synthesis is significantly simpler and\nmore efficient compared to other studies on porous MXene composites.

Thereby, the fabrication and comparison\nof pure MXene and composite samples featuring either a compact or a highly\nporous three-dimensional microstructure, reveal unique properties with respect\nto: (i) controllable three-dimensional spatial arrangement of MXene instead of\nthe prevalent stacked-sheet structure, (ii) reduction of oxidation-induced\ndegradation of MXene and substantially enhanced stability over the course of\nthree months, and (iii) tunable electronic states in response to gas\ninteractions. Material characterization is conducted by scanning electron\nmicroscopy and rheology to assess the microstructural and mechanical\nproperties, and in a chemiresistive measurement setup for determination of\nelectrical properties and the evaluation of the composite's potential for VOC\nsensing in a gaseous environment with the test analyte acetone.

    "abstract": "The success of self-attention (SA) in Transformer demonstrates the importance\nof non-local information to image super-resolution (SR), but the huge computing\npower required makes it difficult to implement lightweight models.

Specifically, we increase the\nkernel size to 31 to obtain the larger receptive field as possible, and reduce\nthe parameters and computations by coordinate decomposition. Meanwhile, a\nspatial feature modulation block (SFMB) is designed to enhance the focus of\nfeature information on both spatial and channel dimension.

    "abstract": "Concurrent to the rapid progress in the development of neural-network based\nmodels in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, the need\nfor creating explanations for the predictions of these black-box models has\nrisen steadily. We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for\npredictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the\ninput which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective\nclass. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a\nnew regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and\ncompactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be\ndesirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language\nprocessing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and\nrationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed\nwithout training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained\nclassifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high\nquality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the\nconditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are\nmore broadly applicable to different input types.",

For the process starting from the origin and\nundergoing Poissonian resetting back to the origin, we analytically compute the\npairwise joint distributions of these three times (in the Laplace domain) and\nderive their pairwise correlation coefficients. Our results reveal that these\nglobal times display rich correlations, with a non-trivial dependence on the\nresetting rate $r$. Specifically, we find that (i) While $t_{o}$ and\n$t_{\\ell}^m$ are uncorrelated for any positive integer $m$, $t_{o}^2$ and\n$t_{\\ell}^m$ display anti-correlation; (ii) A positive correlation exists\nbetween $t_{o}$ and $t_{m}$, which decays toward zero following a\nlogarithmically corrected power-law way with an exponent of $-2$ as $r \\to\n\\infty$; (iii) The correlation between $t_{m}$ and $t_{\\ell}$ shifts from\npositive to negative as $r$ increases.

Evaluation against both\nnon-reasoning and general-purpose lean models demonstrates that our\ndomain-specific fine-tuning approach yields substantial gains in answer\naccuracy and consistency, approaching frontier-level performance while\nremaining feasible for local deployment.

In this\nmodel, the system is described by a graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ nodes, and in\neach time step, a scheduler samples uniformly at random a pair of adjacent\nnodes to interact. In the exact majority consensus task, each node is given a\nbinary input, and the goal is to design a protocol that almost surely reaches a\nstable configuration, where all nodes output the majority input value.\n  We give improved upper and lower bounds for the exact majority in general\ngraphs. First, we give asymptotically tight time lower bounds for general\n(unbounded space) protocols. Second, we obtain new upper bounds parameterized\nby the relaxation time $\\tau_{\\mathsf{rel}}$ of the random walk on $G$ induced\nby the scheduler and the degree imbalance $\\Delta/\\delta$ of $G$. Specifically,\nwe give a protocol that stabilizes in $O\\left( \\tfrac{\\Delta}{\\delta}\n\\tau_{\\mathsf{rel}} \\log^2 n \\right)$ steps in expectation and with high\nprobability and uses $O\\left( \\log n \\cdot \\left(\n\\log\\left(\\tfrac{\\Delta}{\\delta}\\right) + \\log\n\\left(\\tfrac{\\tau_{\\mathsf{rel}}}{n}\\right) \\right) \\right)$ states in any\ngraph with minimum degree at least $\\delta$ and maximum degree at most\n$\\Delta$.\n  For regular expander graphs, this matches the optimal space complexity of\n$\\Theta(\\log n)$ for fast protocols in complete graphs [Alistarh et al., SODA\n2016 and Doty et al., FOCS 2022] with a nearly optimal stabilization time of\n$O(n \\log^2 n)$ steps.

Mixing\nefficiencies vary considerably, so carefully selecting the design parameters,\nlike pumping rates, well locations, or operation times, is crucial. While\nnumerous studies investigate the conditions required to achieve chaotic flow,\nsensitivity analyses addressing its impact on mixing have rarely been\nperformed. However, selecting a suitable sensitivity analysis method depends on\nthe underlying system and is often restricted by the computational cost,\nespecially when considering complex, high-dimensional models. Moreover, the\nmost appropriate metric to quantify mixing (e.g., plume area, peak\nconcentration) can also be system-specific. We perform a time-varying\nsensitivity analysis on the mixing enhancement of two chaotic flow fields with\ndifferent complexities. The rotated potential mixing (RPM) flow is parametrized\nusing two or four hyperparameters, while the quadrupole flow utilizes 16\nhyperparameters. We compare three global sensitivity analysis methods: Sobol\nindices, Morris scores, and a modification of the activity scores. We evaluate\nthe temporal evolution of the sensitivity of the design parameters, compare the\nperformance of the three methods, and highlight their potential in analyzing\nparameter interactions. The analysis of the RPM flow shows comparable\nsensitivities for all methods. Additionally, our numerical experiments show\nthat Morris is the cheapest method, needing at most four times fewer model\nevaluations than Sobol to reach convergence. This motivates us to only use the\ncomputationally cheaper but as reliable Morris and activity scores on the\n16-dimensional model, yielding again consistent results.",

Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning\nindividual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy,\nthereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise\nSimilarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise\nsimilarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining\nstrategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level\nalignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading\nto a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face\nrecognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.\nInterestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our\nunified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.",

To address this, we propose AnatoMaskGAN, a novel\nsynthesis framework that embeds slice-related spatial features to precisely\naggregate inter-slice contextual dependencies, introduces diverse\nimage-augmentation strategies, and optimizes deep feature learning to improve\nperformance on complex medical images. Specifically, we design a GNN-based\nstrongly correlated slice-feature fusion module to model spatial relationships\nbetween slices and integrate contextual information from neighboring slices,\nthereby capturing anatomical details more comprehensively; we introduce a\nthree-dimensional spatial noise-injection strategy that weights and fuses\nspatial features with noise to enhance modeling of structural diversity; and we\nincorporate a grayscale-texture classifier to optimize grayscale distribution\nand texture representation during generation. Extensive experiments on the\npublic L2R-OASIS and L2R-Abdomen CT datasets show that AnatoMaskGAN raises PSNR\non L2R-OASIS to 26.50 dB (0.43 dB higher than the current state of the art) and\nachieves an SSIM of 0.8602 on L2R-Abdomen CT--a 0.48 percentage-point gain over\nthe best model, demonstrating its superiority in reconstruction accuracy and\nperceptual quality.

To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent\nuncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user\npreferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates.

Here, we investigate whether these optical resonances lead to true\nexciton-photon hybridization.

While\nreflectance spectra for ultrathin flakes exhibit resonance splitting between\nexcitons and absorption resonances, our photocurrent measurements reveal only\nexcitonic peaks, indicating that no polaritons are formed. In contrast, thicker\nflakes exhibit Fabry-Perot resonances that strongly couple to excitons,\nresulting in clear splitting in both reflectance and photocurrent spectra, and\nproviding evidence of polariton formation. We further show that the polariton\nresonances can be tuned through the reflection phase at the WS$_2$-substrate\ninterface by changing the substrate material. In addition to coupling with the\nstrong A-exciton, we observe polariton formation involving the weaker B-exciton\nat shorter wavelengths, as well as higher-order hybridization where both\nexcitons interact simultaneously with a single Fabry-Perot resonance. These\nfindings clarify the distinction between apparent and true strong coupling in\nexcitonic materials and demonstrate how reflection phase and flake thickness\ncan be used to engineer light-matter interactions.",

A solution of the so called screen problem for this\ncase is also given. We construct the ideal detector model via mathematical\nprobability theory, which in turn suggests an adaption of the Madelung\nequations in this instance.

    "abstract": "Decision-focused learning (DFL) trains a machine learning (ML) model to\npredict parameters of an optimization problem, to directly minimize decision\nregret, i.e., maximize decision quality. Gradient-based DFL requires computing\nthe derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the\npredicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable\noptimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than\nsurrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds\nfor DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs,\nthat computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can\nbe performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes\nthe forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate\nlosses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the\nstate-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin.",

    "abstract": "As autonomous agents become adept at understanding and interacting with\ngraphical user interface (GUI) environments, a new era of automated task\nexecution is emerging. Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic\ninteractive GUI environments. However, these methods face two key limitations:\n(1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI\ntasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the\nagent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse\ntask-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a\nuniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these\nlimitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the\nvarying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy\noptimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based\nsignals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced\nfeedback during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nachieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches,\noutperforming them by 5.6% on public benchmarks Android Control and 10.3% on\nour internal online benchmarks, respectively. These findings empirically\nvalidate the effectiveness of integrating reinforcement learning with\ncurriculum learning in GUI interaction tasks.",

It also reduces the computation complexity in\nestimation. The main estimation methodology is built on the eigenanalysis of\nsample row and column covariance matrices when the nonstationary matrix factors\nare of full rank and the idiosyncratic components are temporally stationary,\nand is further extended to tackle a more flexible setting when the matrix\nfactors are cointegrated and the idiosyncratic components may be nonstationary.\nUnder some mild conditions which allow the existence of weak factors, we derive\nthe convergence theory for the estimated factor loading matrices and\nnonstationary factor matrices.

    "abstract": "Traditional knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods aim to represent entities\nand relations in a low-dimensional space, primarily focusing on static graphs.\nHowever, real-world KGs are dynamically evolving with the constant addition of\nentities, relations and facts. To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several\ncontinual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to\nefficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining\nlearned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world\nscenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of\nupdates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In\nthis paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for\nCKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on\nthe update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic\nDistillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of\nlearned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently\noutperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR,\n1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with\nmethods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal\nperformance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive\nembedding dimensions in CKGE.

A distinctive feature\nof this setup is the emergence of a Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson, arising from\nthe spontaneous breaking of translational invariance in the extra dimension due\nto the localization of SM chiral fermions. This NG boson couples via Yukawa\ninteractions to SM fermions and their Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations. We study\nthe phenomenology of this NG boson and derive constraints from astrophysical\nprocesses (supernova cooling), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and collider\nsearches for KK-mode fermions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The strongest\nlimits arise from LHC data: we reinterpret existing mass bounds on squarks and\nsleptons in simplified supersymmetric models (assuming a massless lightest\nneutralino), as well as limits on exotic hadrons containing long-lived squarks\nor long-lived charged sleptons in the regime of extremely small Yukawa\ncouplings. From this analysis, we obtain a conservative lower bound of 1 TeV on\nthe masses of KK-mode quarks and charged leptons.

    "abstract": "Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification\nthat converts a pretrained model's point prediction into a prediction set, with\nthe set size reflecting the model's confidence. Although existing CP methods\nare guaranteed to achieve marginal coverage, they often exhibit imbalanced\ncoverage across classes under long-tail label distributions, tending to over\ncover the head classes at the expense of under covering the remaining tail\nclasses. This under coverage is particularly concerning, as it undermines the\nreliability of the prediction sets for minority classes, even with coverage\nensured on average. In this paper, we propose the Tail-Aware Conformal\nPrediction (TACP) method to mitigate the under coverage of the tail classes by\nutilizing the long-tail structure and narrowing the head-tail coverage gap.\nTheoretical analysis shows that it consistently achieves a smaller head-tail\ncoverage gap than standard methods. To further improve coverage balance across\nall classes, we introduce an extension of TACP: soft TACP (sTACP) via a\nreweighting mechanism.

By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the\nglobal Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier\nTransform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits\nsignificantly higher spectral energy.

However, implementing distributed tracing in\nlarge-scale applications remains challenging due to the need for extensive\ninstrumentation. To reduce this burden, zero-code instrumentation solutions,\nsuch as those based on eBPF, have emerged, allowing span data to be collected\nwithout modifying application code. Despite this promise, span correlation, the\nprocess of establishing causal relationships between spans, remains a critical\nchallenge in zero-code approaches.

This paper presents CrossTrace, a practical and efficient\ndistributed tracing solution designed to support the debugging of microservice\napplications without requiring source code modifications. CrossTrace employs a\ngreedy algorithm to infer intra-service span relationships from delay patterns,\neliminating reliance on thread identifiers. For inter-service correlation,\nCrossTrace embeds span identifiers into TCP packet headers via eBPF, enabling\nsecure and efficient correlation compromising system security policies.\nEvaluation results show that CrossTrace can correlate thousands of spans within\nseconds with over 90% accuracy, making it suitable for production deployment\nand valuable for microservice observability and diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability\nof a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on\npreviously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to\nperform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning\nthe detection performance on previously learned categories may severely\ndegenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)\nto mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based\ndetection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a\ncorrespondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase\ndetection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched\nqueries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,\nHungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of\nthe current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at\ndifferent iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each\nquery may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of\npreviously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we\npropose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation\n(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD\nestablishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase\nmodels that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned\ndistillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of\nprevious categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic\nand spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new\ncategories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that\nIAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g.,\nCLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image\nclassification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious\nbias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful\ngenerative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable\nimage classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two\nprinciples: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,\nwe propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)\nnoise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a\ndataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly\ninitialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a\nMeta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise\noffset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to\nreplace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the\neffectiveness of NoOp.",

    "abstract": "This paper extends the theory of rough convergence from normed linear spaces\nto the more abstract setting of Riesz spaces. We introduce and systematically\ndevelop the concept of rough $\\mathbb{c}$-convergence ($rc$-convergence) for\nnets. A net $(x_\\alpha)_{\\alpha\\in A}$ in a Riesz space $E$ is said to be rough\n$\\mathbb{c}$-convergent to $x\\in E$ if there exists a net\n$(y_\\alpha)_{\\alpha\\in A}$ in $E$ with $y_\\alpha \\xrightarrow[]{\\mathbb{c}}\n\\theta$ for a given background convergence $\\mathbb{c}$, such that\n$|x_\\alpha-x| \\leq y_\\alpha + \\mathbb{r}$ holds for all $\\alpha\\in A$, where\n$\\mathbb{r}$ is a fixed positive vector in $E$ representing the roughness\ndegree. The study first establishes that this new construction satisfies the\naxioms of a formal convergence structure. Key properties of\n$\\mathbb{rc}$-convergence are then investigated, including its relationship\nwith linearity and the continuity of lattice operations. Since the limit of an\n$\\mathbb{rc}$-convergent net is not necessarily unique, the paper dedicates\nsignificant analysis to the set of rough $\\mathbb{c}$-limit points.\nFurthermore, a crucial connection is established between the order boundedness\nof a net and the non-emptiness of its set of $\\mathbb{rc}$-limit points. This\nwork provides a foundational framework for further exploration of convergence\nin Riesz spaces.",

However, their capacity for logical\nunderstanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical\n''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.\nTo systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories\nand 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical\ndiagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the\nstate-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,\nparticularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,\nhighlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical\nstructures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training\nframework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in\nboth data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes\nlogic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines\ncoarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel\nlogical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nLogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all\nLogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP\nretains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general\nvision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical\nunderstanding does not come at the expense of general alignment.

Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma\nRBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT\nand HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is\nlower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be\nvalidated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the\nTP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when\nreceiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to\nMETH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and\nHC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nsuperior detection capability of NDEWs by proving that any\nnon-positive-transpose (NPT) state beyond the two-qubit and qubit-qutrit\nsystems can be detected by an NDEW.",

    "abstract": "This article explores novel data-driven modeling approaches for analyzing and\napproximating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), a\nphysiologically-based metric integrating multiple atmospheric variables to\nassess thermal comfort. Given the nonlinear, multivariate structure of UTCI, we\ninvestigate symbolic and sparse regression techniques as tools for\ninterpretable and efficient function approximation. In particular, we highlight\nthe benefits of using orthogonal polynomial bases-such as Legendre\npolynomials-in sparse regression frameworks, demonstrating their advantages in\nstability, convergence, and hierarchical interpretability compared to standard\npolynomial expansions. We demonstrate that our models achieve significantly\nlower root-mean squared losses than the widely used sixth-degree polynomial\nbenchmark-while using the same or fewer parameters. By leveraging Legendre\npolynomial bases, we construct models that efficiently populate a Pareto front\nof accuracy versus complexity and exhibit stable, hierarchical coefficient\nstructures across varying model capacities. Training on just 20% of the data,\nour models generalize robustly to the remaining 80%, with consistent\nperformance under bootstrapping. The decomposition effectively approximates the\nUTCI as a Fourier-like expansion in an orthogonal basis, yielding results near\nthe theoretical optimum in the L2 (least squares) sense. We also connect these\nfindings to the broader context of equation discovery in environmental\nmodeling, referencing probabilistic grammar-based methods that enforce domain\nconsistency and compactness in symbolic expressions. Taken together, these\nresults illustrate how combining sparsity, orthogonality, and symbolic\nstructure enables robust, interpretable modeling of complex environmental\nindices like UTCI - and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\napproximation in both accuracy and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and\nplays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring.\nHowever, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead\nto misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging\ndefect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these\nstudies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited\nsources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive\nanalysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising\ngeneralization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related\ntasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely\nunexplored.\n  In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects,\nwhich encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed\nscenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \\dataset, consisting of\n164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated\nframework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual\ninformation to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging\ncode defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to\naccurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code\nonly. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of\ndefect patterns) can lead to 10.9\\% improvement in detection accuracy.

This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that\nrepeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely\non LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation).\nThrough comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse\nresponses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to\nappear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow\ndistinct \"constellation\" patterns in embedding space as representations\ntraverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift\npredictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce\nSafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks\ntask-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal\npathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to\nover-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces\nover-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a\nprincipled approach to mitigating over-refusals.",

To achieve the high-order spatial accuracy, a large number of matrix\ninversions are needed, which affect the efficiency of computation dramatically.\nIn this paper, an efficient and robust high-order compact ALE gas-kinetic\nscheme is developed for the compressible moving grids and moving boundary\nproblems. The memory-reduction reconstruction is used to construct a quadratic\npolynomial on the target cell, where both structured and unstructured meshes\ncan be used. Taking derivatives of the candidate polynomial, the quadratic\nterms can be obtained by the least square method using the average gradient\nvalues of the cell itself and its adjacent cells. Moving the quadratic terms to\nright-hand side of the constrains for cell averaged value, the linear terms of\nthe polynomial can be determined by the least square method as well. The\ngradient compression factor is adopted to suppress the spurious oscillations\nnear discontinuities. Combined with the two-stage fourth-order time\ndiscretization, a high-order compact gas-kinetic scheme is developed for ALE\ncomputation. In the process of mesh movement, the inversions of lower order\nmatrix are needed for the least square method, which makes a 7x speedup and\nimproves the efficiency greatly. In the computation, the grid velocity can be\ngiven by the mesh adaptation method and the cell centered Lagrangian nodal\nsolver. Numerical examples are presented to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency,\nrobustness and the preservation of geometric conservation law of the current\nscheme.",

A key feature of this representation is that it is continuous and\ndifferentiable with respect to task-space coordinates, enabling its direct use\nas constraints in continuous optimization for humanoid motion planning. We\ndescribe a method to learn such differentiable reachability maps from a set of\nend-effector poses generated using a robot's kinematic model, using either a\nneural network or a support vector machine as the learning model. By\nincorporating the learned reachability map as a constraint, we formulate\nhumanoid motion generation as a continuous optimization problem.

Some existing methods attempt to\nuse a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this\noften requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language\nmodels, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual\ninformation into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing\nworks only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve\nsatisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work,\nwe proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with\nTraining-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple\nbut effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching\nModel's understanding of visual information at different granularities.\nInspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT\ndata and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain\nrefined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without\nrelying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive\nexperiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art\nmethods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.",

In quantum\nchemistry, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithm designed to estimate ground-state energies of\nmolecular systems. Despite its promise, VQE faces challenges such as\nscalability issues, high circuit depths, and barren plateaus that make the\noptimization of the variational wavefunction. To mitigate these challenges, the\nQuantum Information Driven Ansatz (QIDA) leverages Quantum Mutual Information\n(QMI) to construct compact, correlation-driven circuits. In this work, we go\nback to the original field of application of QIDA, by applying the already\ndefined Multi-Threshold Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (Multi-QIDA)\nmethodology on Molecular Systems. to systematically construct shallow, layered\nquantum circuits starting from approximate QMI matrices obtained by Quantum\nChemistry calculations. The Multi-QIDA approach combines efficient creation of\nthe QMI map, reduction of the number of correlators required by exploiting\nMinimum/Maximum spanning tress, and an iterative layer-wise VQE optimization\nroutine. These enhancements allow the method to recover missing correlations in\nmolecular systems while maintaining computational efficiency.

This resultant platform, termed\nintegrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), is envisioned to enable a broad spectrum\nof Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, including remote surgery, autonomous\ndriving, and holographic telepresence. Recently, the communication bottleneck\nconfronting the implementation of an ISEA system is overcome by the development\nof over-the-air computing (AirComp) techniques, which facilitate simultaneous\naccess through over-the-air data feature fusion. Despite its advantages,\nAirComp with uncoded transmission remains vulnerable to interference. To tackle\nthis challenge, we propose AirBreath sensing, a spectrum-efficient framework\nthat cascades feature compression and spread spectrum to mitigate interference\nwithout bandwidth expansion. This work reveals a fundamental tradeoff between\nthese two operations under a fixed bandwidth constraint: increasing the\ncompression ratio may reduce sensing accuracy but allows for more aggressive\ninterference suppression via spread spectrum, and vice versa. This tradeoff is\nregulated by a key variable called breathing depth, defined as the feature\nsubspace dimension that matches the processing gain in spread spectrum. To\noptimally control the breathing depth, we mathematically characterize and\noptimize this aforementioned tradeoff by designing a tractable surrogate for\nsensing accuracy, measured by classification discriminant gain (DG).\nExperimental results on real datasets demonstrate that AirBreath sensing\neffectively mitigates interference in ISEA systems, and the proposed control\nalgorithm achieves near-optimal performance as benchmarked with a brute-force\nsearch.",

    "abstract": "Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying\nmodels to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by\naugmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns\nglobal geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level\ndistribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning\nframework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for\ndomain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level\nGeometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric\nproperties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties\nof each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly,\nGeometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D\ndistribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the\nmodel to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve\ngeneralization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the\nstate-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal (ST) fusion framework for\nsatellite images, named Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware ST fusion (TSSTF).\nST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial\nand temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed\nsatellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment\nand environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on\nenhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing\nnoise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure,\nleading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces\ntwo key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and\nTemporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization\nfunction that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural\ndetails, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a\nnearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally\nadjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST\nfusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC,\nand develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual\nsplitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs\ncomparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and\noutperforms them under noisy conditions. Additionally, we provide a\ncomprehensive set of recommended parameter values that consistently yield high\nperformance across diverse target regions and noise conditions, aiming to\nenhance reproducibility and practical utility.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated\nimpressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with\nfine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion\nnaturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the\ndifficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often\nconflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality\ndatasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we\nfirst introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns\nhuman-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy\nmultidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a\nlarge-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K\npreference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert\nPreference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based\nportrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO\ndecouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused\nacross timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained\nenhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments\ndemonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in\naligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial\nimprovements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and\nvisual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations.

We confirm that the category of Heyting\nsemilattices is not algebraically coherent, even though it satisfies a strong\nversion of the so-called Smith is Huq condition (on the equivalence of two\ntypes of commutators).\n  We also prove that Higgins commutators of normal subobjects are normal, as a\nconsequence of the fact that Heyting semilattices form an arithmetical\ncategory. We provide an elementary characterisation of when a pair of\nsubobjects commutes, and use this in the construction of two counterexamples.\n  We further show that centralisers exist, centralisers of normal monomorphisms\nare normal monomorphisms, and normal monomorphisms are closed under\ncomposition. We study the latter condition in detail. On the other hand, we\nshow that the category of Heyting semilattices does not satisfy normality of\nunions. Hence, it is not action accessible and so it does not admit all\nnormalisers.

Traditional\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained\ntextual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed\nknowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods\naddress this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural\nassociations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and\nfine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization\nof textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called\nHGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and\nsemantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity\nhypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained\npassages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared\nentities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates\nfine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via\nhypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which\nfurther refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to\nobtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the\nLLM.

Hourglass-shaped thermoelectric legs - identified as optimal in\nrecent experiments - are found to exhibit the same underlying transport\nmechanisms observed in other constricted profiles, including single and\nmultiple sharp constrictions. The commonly used Geometric Parameter is found to\nbe insufficient for capturing the full influence of geometry on transport,\nwhereas Transmissivity serves as a robust descriptor of constricted geometry,\nindependent of material choice or device operating conditions. A universal\nscaling formalism is derived linking electrical and thermal resistances, along\nwith key thermoelectric performance metrics, to the Transmissivity. A unified\noptimization framework is also developed for composite legs, incorporating both\nconstricted material and contact electrodes. This framework indicates that\npreviously reported performance gains may be largely attributed to contact\nresistance, rather than geometry alone.

    "abstract": "Exciton-polaritons formed inside optical cavities offer a highly tunable\nplatform for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Here, we introduce and\ntheoretically characterize a light-matter moir\\'e effect (LMME) that arises\nwhen a 2D material is tilted inside a planar optical cavity, in contrast to\nstacking multiple layers at a twist angle as is done in forming 2D moir\\'e\nhetero-structures. We show that this geometric tilt produces emergent\nperiodicity in the light-matter coupling, yielding displaced replicas of the\npolariton dispersion and flat bands near the Brillouin-zone center. Through\ntime-dependent quantum dynamical simulations, we demonstrate that LMME enables\ncoherent frequency conversion and remains robust against phonon-induced\ndecoherence. Our findings establish LMME as a new platform for engineering\npolariton band structures, the generation of flat bands and performing coherent\nfrequency conversion relevant for developing polariton-based quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "Realizing embodied artificial intelligence is challenging due to the huge\ncomputation demands of large models (LMs). To support LMs while ensuring\nreal-time inference, embodied edge intelligence (EEI) is a promising paradigm,\nwhich leverages an LM edge to provide computing powers in close proximity to\nembodied robots. Due to embodied data exchange, EEI requires higher spectral\nefficiency, enhanced communication security, and reduced inter-user\ninterference. To meet these requirements, near-field communication (NFC), which\nleverages extremely large antenna arrays as its hardware foundation, is an\nideal solution. Therefore, this paper advocates the integration of EEI and NFC,\nresulting in a near-field EEI (NEEI) paradigm. However, NEEI also introduces\nnew challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by isolated EEI or NFC\ndesigns, creating research opportunities for joint optimization of both\nfunctionalities. To this end, we propose radio-friendly embodied planning for\nEEI-assisted NFC scenarios and view-guided beam-focusing for NFC-assisted EEI\nscenarios.

In this paper, we propose a data-driven\noptimized method to improve the spectral properties of the WENO schemes. By\nanalyzing the approximate dispersion relation (ADR), the spectral error of the\nschemes can be bounded by the reconstructed errors of a series of trigonometric\nfunctions with different wavenumbers. Therefore, we propose the new schemes\nWENO5-JS/Z-NN that introduce a compensation term parameterized by a neural\nnetwork to the weight function of the WENO5-JS/Z schemes. The neural network is\ntrained such that the generated weights can minimize the reconstructed errors\nover a large number of spatial stencils, and furthermore, improve the spectral\naccuracy. Meanwhile, the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) constraint and\nanti-dissipation penalization are incorporated into the loss function to\nenhance the shock-capturing capability and preserve stability in simulating\nhigh-frequency waves. Compared to WENO5-JS/Z, our schemes maintain the ability\nto capture discontinuities while providing higher resolution for fine-scale\nflow features.

These\ntransitions are governed by gap closings at high-symmetry points in the\nBrillouin zone, controlled by the intensity and energy of the incident light.\nIntroducing a weak linear Rashba term displaces Dirac points in momentum space\nwithout modifying the topology, whereas a purely linear Rashba system remains\ntopologically trivial (C = 0). When both linear and cubic Rashba couplings are\nfinite, the linear term confines nonzero-Chern phases to narrow parameter\nwindows. In contrast, incorporating a linear Dresselhaus term into the cubic\nRashba system can trigger topological transitions even at small coupling\nstrengths.

Furthermore,\nORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly\ntransferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal\nrate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets.\nORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a\nvaluable community resource, paving the way for developing more reliable and\ntrustworthy LLM-based software systems.",

This implies that mean fitness should not decline in a constant\nenvironment, thereby positioning it as an indicator of evolutionary\nprogression. However, this theorem has been shown to lack universality. Here,\nwe derive the Fokker-Planck equation that describes the stochastic frequency\ndynamics of two phenotypes in a large population under weak selection and\ngenetic drift, and develop a path integral formulation that characterizes the\nprobability density of phenotypic frequency. Our formulation identifies that,\nunder both selection and genetic drift, the ratio of the probability density of\nadaptive traits (e.g., phenotypic frequency) to that under neutrality\nrepresents a time-invariant evolutionary path characteristic. This ratio\nquantifies the cumulative effect of directional selection on the evolutionary\nprocess compared to genetic drift. Importantly, the expected value of this\nratio does not decline over time. In the presence of fitness variance, the\neffect of directional selection on expected phenotypic changes accumulates over\ntime, diverging progressively from paths shaped solely by genetic drift. The\nexpectation of this time-invariant ratio thus offers a robust and informative\nalternative to mean fitness as a measure of progression in stochastic\nevolutionary dynamics.",

We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where\nthe objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity\nfield, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed\nnoisy velocity data.

The geometry subproblem aims\nto infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping\nthat deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an\nalternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field\nand the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality\nreconstruction of the flow image.

    "abstract": "As the core algorithm in recommendation systems, collaborative filtering (CF)\nalgorithms inevitably face the problem of data sparsity. Since CF captures\nsimilar users and items for recommendations, it is effective to augment the\nlacking user-user and item-item homogeneous linkages. However, existing methods\nare typically limited to connecting through overlapping interacted neighbors or\nthrough similar attributes and contents. These approaches are constrained by\ncoarse-grained, sparse attributes and fail to effectively extract behavioral\ncharacteristics jointly from interaction sequences and attributes. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel two-stage collaborative recommendation\nalgorithm, DQRec: Decomposition-based Quantized Variational AutoEncoder\n(DQ-VAE) for Recommendation. DQRec augments features and homogeneous linkages\nby extracting the behavior characteristics jointly from interaction sequences\nand attributes, namely patterns, such as user multi-aspect interests. Inspired\nby vector quantization (VQ) technology, we propose a new VQ algorithm, DQ-VAE,\nwhich decomposes the pre-trained representation embeddings into distinct\ndimensions, and quantize them to generates semantic IDs. We utilize the\ngenerated semantic IDs as the extracted patterns mentioned above. By\nintegrating these semantic ID patterns into the recommendation process through\nfeature and linkage augmentation, the system enriches both latent and explicit\nuser and item features, identifies pattern-similar neighbors, and thereby\nimproves the efficiency of information diffusion. Experimental comparisons with\nbaselines across multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the\nproposed DQRec method.",

    "abstract": "Thermal light engineering is a field of considerable interest and potential.\nWe study quantum light-matter interactions in a one-dimensional photonic\ncrystal with two-level atoms as the active medium, replacing classical\noscillators in traditional blackbody models. In a thermal bath with pumping,\nthese atoms modulate thermal emission via interactions with photonic modes. The\nmodel with quantum two-level systems enables the processes of spontaneous\nemission, stimulated absorption, and stimulated emission. Equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium regimes depend on competition between pumping and thermal\nrelaxation rates. Strong light-matter interaction and photon decay govern\ndynamics and steady states. In equilibrium, with a high thermal relaxation\nrate, photon numbers are initially determined by spontaneous emission and later\nstabilize due to stimulated absorption, influenced by light-matter interaction\nstrength. In-band-gap photons reach steady states at a time scale of one or two\norders of magnitude longer than outside-band-gap photons. Interestingly, for a\nstrong light-matter interaction, all photons in the equilibrium regimes show\nPlanckian radiation, regardless of their frequencies in or out of the band\ngaps. Band-gap suppression of thermal emission is more pronounced with weaker\nlight-matter interaction or larger photon decay. In the nonequilibrium regime,\nthe dynamics of photon numbers exhibit a multi-time-scale process transitioning\nto steady states due to strong pumping and stimulated processes. Steady-state\nelectron populations of two-level atoms deviate from the Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution, and the steady-state photon numbers exhibit super-Planckian\nemission. These findings enable quantum control of thermal emission spectra,\nwhich is relevant for reducing thermal noise in quantum computing or enhancing\nradiative cooling.",

The\nphysically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive\nalternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers.

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of pretrained models (PTMs) has attracted significant\nattention from both Deep Learning (DL) researchers and downstream application\ndevelopers. However, selecting appropriate PTMs remains challenging because\nexisting methods typically rely on keyword-based searches in which the keywords\nare often derived directly from function descriptions. This often fails to\nfully capture user intent and makes it difficult to identify suitable models\nwhen developers also consider factors such as bias mitigation, hardware\nrequirements, or license compliance. To address the limitations of\nkeyword-based model search, we propose PTMPicker to accurately identify\nsuitable PTMs. We first define a structured template composed of common and\nessential attributes for PTMs and then PTMPicker represents both candidate\nmodels and user-intended features (i.e., model search requests) in this unified\nformat. To determine whether candidate models satisfy user requirements, it\ncomputes embedding similarities for function-related attributes and uses\nwell-crafted prompts to evaluate special constraints such as license compliance\nand hardware requirements. We scraped a total of 543,949 pretrained models from\nHugging Face to prepare valid candidates for selection. PTMPicker then\nrepresented them in the predefined structured format by extracting their\nassociated descriptions. Guided by the extracted metadata, we synthesized a\ntotal of 15,207 model search requests with carefully designed prompts, as no\nsuch search requests are readily available. Experiments on the curated PTM\ndataset and the synthesized model search requests show that PTMPicker can help\nusers effectively identify models,with 85% of the sampled requests successfully\nlocating appropriate PTMs within the top-10 ranked candidates.",

To\naddress these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we\ndevelop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs\non downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to\nexploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it\nto provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process.\nSpecifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts\nas the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories,\nattribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and\nemploys hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of\nthem, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among\ncategories, learnable attributes, and image samples.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge\ndomain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and\ntransmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which\nlimits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection\n(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain\nadaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training\nparadigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse\ncaused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense\nobjects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain\nannotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision\nfoundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised\nframework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision\nFoundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a \"free lunch\" manner,\nleveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise\nwhile improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we\nintroduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's\nsemantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated\npseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from\nlow-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and\nquantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,\nwhich aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and\nimage levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and\nsimilarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further\nenhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in\nsource-free remote sensing detection tasks.",

    "abstract": "Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty,\nespecially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of\nreal-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of\npaired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image\ndehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge\nDiffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first\nstage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired\nhazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then\nmodeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the\nstructural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In\nthe second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired\nhazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.\nAdditionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution\nblock (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the\nmodel's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nEM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to\nstate-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

This evolution necessitates\ndistributed learning paradigms that can efficiently handle such data.\nFurthermore, the continuous nature of data generation and the limited storage\ncapacity of edge devices demand an online learning framework.

This paper\nintroduces a novel discretization method to address these limitations. We\nreformulate the g-function calculation under the uniform borehole wall\ntemperature boundary condition as the solution to spatio-temporal integral\nequations. The SFLS model is identified as a special case using stepwise\napproximation of the heat extraction rate. Our proposed method employs the\nGauss-Legendre quadrature to approximate the spatial integrals with a weighted\nsum of function values at strategically chosen points. This transforms the\ntime-consuming segment-to-segment integral calculations in SFLS model into\nsimpler and analytical point-to-point response factors. Furthermore, we\nidentify that the governing integral equations are of the Fredholm first kind,\nleading to ill-conditioned linear systems that can cause g-function to diverge\nat high discretization orders. To address this, a regularization technique is\nimplemented to ensure stable and convergent solutions. Numerical tests\ndemonstrate that the proposed method is significantly more efficient, achieving\ncomparable or improved accuracy at speeds 20 to 200 times faster than the SFLS\nmodel with optimized nonuniform discretization schemes.",

    "abstract": "We present an approach (the biroot method) for nth root approximation that\nyields closed-form rational functions with coefficients derived from binomial\nstructures, Gaussian functions, or qualifying DAG structures. The method\nemerges from an analysis of Newton's method applied to root extraction,\nrevealing that successive iterations generate coefficients following rows of\nPascal's triangle in an alternating numerator-denominator pattern. After\nfurther exploration of these patterns, we formulate three main conjectures: (1)\nthe Binomial Biroot Conjecture establishing the fundamental alternating\ncoefficient structure to approximate nth roots (for which we prove the square\nroot case and optimal parameter conditions), (2) the Gaussian Biroot\nConjecture, and (3) the General DAG Biroot Conjecture showing a structural\ninvariance to nth root approximation using arbitrary linearly-constructed\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs). Computational evidence demonstrates superior\nconvergence properties when compared to Taylor series and Pad\\'e\napproximations, especially considering the more direct and less computationally\nintensive approach to the biroot function construction. A computational\nframework has been developed to support systematic exploration of the biroot\nmethod's parameter space and to enable extensive numerical and symbolic\nanalysis. The method provides both theoretical insights and computational\nsignificance by connecting combinatorial structures to nth root rational\napproximation theory.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian network classifiers provide a feasible solution to tabular data\nclassification, with a number of merits like high time and memory efficiency,\nand great explainability. However, due to the parameter explosion and data\nsparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order\nfeature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the\noccurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional\nrepresentations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different\nfeatures through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which\nthen serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new\ntest samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence\nBayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,\nNeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn\ndistributional representations of feature values and parameterize the\nconditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic\ngradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model\nefficiently. Extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed NeuralKDB classifier excels in capturing\nhigh-order feature dependencies and significantly outperforms the conventional\nBayesian network classifiers, as well as other competitive classifiers,\nincluding two neural network based classifiers without distributional\nrepresentation learning.",

    "abstract": "Topological quantum materials with kagome lattices have attracted intense\ninterest due to their unconventional electronic structures, which exhibit\nnontrivial topology, anomalous magnetism, and electronic correlations. Among\nthese, Co3Sn2S2 stands out as a prototypical kagome metal, uniquely combining\nintrinsic ferromagnetism with topologically nontrivial electronic states. This\nperspective presents a systematic overview of recent advances in studying\nkagome metal Co3Sn2S2 achieved through scanning tunneling microscopy. We begin\nby introducing different methodologies for surface identification and propose\nusing designer layer-selective chemical markers for conclusive surface\nidentification. We then discuss the Berry curvature induced flat band orbital\nmagnetism and the associated unconventional Zeeman effect. Furthermore, we\nexplore boundary states arising from Weyl topology and analyze challenges in\ndetecting Fermi arcs via quasiparticle interference patterns and in uncovering\nthe topological aspect of the edge states. Finally, we review recent\nobservations of spin-orbit-coupled quantum impurity states through\nspin-polarized tunneling spectroscopy, as well as their connection to Weyl\ntopology and flat band magnetism. We also provide in-depth analysis and\nconstructive comments on the limitations of the current research approach. This\nreview highlights the critical role of scanning tunneling microscopy in\nunraveling the intricate interplay between topology, magnetism, and\ncorrelations at the atomic scale, and the methodology discussed here can be\napplied to study other topological quantum materials in general.",

Although numerous methods have been proposed with the development of\nrumor classification datasets, they focus on identifying whether a post is a\nrumor, lacking the ability to mark the specific rumor content.

    "abstract": "The unification algorithm has long been a target for program synthesis\nresearch, but a fully automatic derivation remains a research goal. In\ndeductive program synthesis, computer programming is phrased as a task in\ntheorem proving; a declarative specification is expressed in logical form and\npresented to an automatic theorem prover, and a program meeting the\nspecification is extracted from the proof. The correctness of the program is\nsupported by the proof, which also provides an explanation of how the program\nworks. The proof is conducted in an appropriate axiomatic subject-domain\ntheory, which defines the concepts in the specification and the constructs in\nthe target programming language and provides the background knowledge necessary\nto connect them.\n  For the unification proof, we generalize and automate the manual proof\npresented in Manna and Waldinger [1981]. The new program unifies two given\nsymbolic expressions (s-expressions) relative to a given \"environment\"\nsubstitution. The proof establishes the existence of an output substitution\nthat is a most-general idempotent unifier of the given expressions and is an\n\"extension\" of the environment substitution. If no such substitution exists and\nthe expressions are not unifiable, the program is to produce a failure\nindicator.\n  Initially the environment substitution is the empty substitution, which makes\nno replacements at all; during execution of recursive calls, the environment\nsubstitution records the replacements that have been found so far. Our own\nunification algorithm employs an environment, and such algorithms appear in the\nliterature [e.g., Luger and Stubblefield, 1997]. We suspect, in addition to\nbeing more efficient, the three-argument algorithm with an environment is\neasier to synthesize automatically than the two-argument version from the\nManna-Waldinger paper.",

Recent work on problems\nin computational redistricting analysis has driven special interest in the\nconditional distribution where all partition classes have the same size\n(balanced partitions). One class of Markov chains in wide use aims to sample\nfrom balanced tree-weighted $k$-partitions using a sampler for balanced\ntree-weighted 2-partitions. Previous implementations of this 2-partition\nsampler would draw a random spanning tree and check whether it contains an edge\nwhose removal produces a balanced 2-component forest; if it does, this\n2-partition is accepted, otherwise the algorithm rejects and repeats. In\npractice, this is a significant computational bottleneck.\n  We show that in fact it is possible to sample from the balanced tree-weighted\n2-partition distribution directly, without first sampling a spanning tree; the\nacceptance and rejection rates are the same as in previous samplers. We prove\nthat on a wide class of planar graphs encompassing network structures typically\narising from the geographic data used in computational redistricting, our\nalgorithm takes expected linear time $O(n)$. Notably, this is asymptotically\nfaster than the best known method to generate random trees, which is $O(n\n\\log^2 n)$ for approximate sampling and $O(n^{1 + \\log \\log \\log n / \\log \\log\nn})$ for exact sampling.

Furthermore, we classify all real quadratic fields\nof extended R-D type (with possibly only one more field) with the P\\'olya index\none. Also, under GRH, we give the complete list of 161 imaginary quadratic\nfields with the P\\'olya index two. Finally, as a byproduct of our results, we\nextend, from narrow R-D types to the extended R-D types, Dohmae's\nclassification of real quadratic fields of narrow R-D type whose narrow genus\nnumbers equal their narrow class numbers.",

    "abstract": "Approaches for estimating preferences from human annotated data typically\ninvolves inducing a distribution over a ranked list of choices such as the\nPlackett-Luce model. Indeed, modern AI alignment tools such as Reward Modelling\nand Direct Preference Optimization are based on the statistical assumptions\nposed by the Plackett-Luce model. In this paper, I will connect the\nPlackett-Luce model to another classical and well known statistical model, the\nCox Proportional Hazards model and attempt to shed some light on the\nimplications of the connection therein.",

    "abstract": "We present new observational evidence supporting the hypothesis that SQ-A, a\nstarburst in the intra-group medium (IGrM) of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), is\ntriggered by a high-speed collision between two gas systems, one associated\nwith the IGrM (v~6900 km/s) and another with the intruder galaxy NGC7318b\n(v~6000 km/s). The new ALMA CO(2-1) dataset has angular resolutions between\n0.2\" and 7.0\" and the new VLA HI datacube an angular resolution of 6.6\" * 7.9\".\nThe CO maps show that the two gas systems are bridged by another system with an\nintermediate velocity of ~6600 km/s, whereas the HI data show that the\ncomponent of v~6600 km/s fits well into a gap in the more extended v~6000 km/s\ncomponent, albeit with a displacement of ~5 kpc. Both the bridge and the\ncomplementary distributions between different gas systems are common features\nof starbursts triggered by cloud-cloud collision. An analysis of clumps (sizes\nof 100--200 pc) reveals very diversified star formation (SF) activity in clumps\nbelonging to different kinematic systems, with the molecular gas depletion time\nof the v~6900 km/s clumps more than 10 times longer than that of the v~6600\nkm/s clumps. The results are consistent with a scenario in which the enhanced\nSF activity (and the starburst) in the system of v~6600 km/s is due to gas\ncompression generated in cloud-cloud collisions, whereas the suppression of SF\nin the v~6900 km/s system is due to vortices (i.e. gas rotation) generated in\nmore complex collisions involving dense clouds and diffuse intercloud gas\naccompanied by blast-wave shocks.",

    "abstract": "We show that if $X$ is a sequentially reflexive Banach space, then its Mackey\ndual $(X^{*},\\tau (X^{*}, X))$ is an angelic space. This builds on a result of\nJ. Howard which says that in the Mackey dual $(X^{*}, \\tau (X^{*}, X))$ of a\nBanach space $X$, relative sequential compactness is, in general, strictly\nstronger than relative compactness and that the two notions of compactness are\nequivalent if $X$ is reflexive or separable. Our main result gives a\ncharacterization of the sequentially reflexive spaces as the Banach spaces $X$\nfor which the the finest locally convex topology on $X^{*}$ with the same\nprecompact sets as the Mackey topology $\\tau (X^{*}, X)$ is the bound extension\nof $\\tau (X^{*}, X)$.",
