    "abstract": "Humans can perform various combinations of physical skills without having to\nrelearn skills from scratch every single time. For example, we can swing a bat\nwhen walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing\nthe individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine\nor compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster\nwith fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional\napproach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning\nfor novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method\nis based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the\nfew-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal\nhere is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented\ntrajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the\nerror between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we\npropose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward\nKinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using\nour few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a\nreduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations.\nMoreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by\nteaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in the development of Applied-Field Magnetoplasmadynamic\nthrusters (AF-MPDTs) present themselves to be an increasingly promising\npropulsion technology for deep space exploration missions. Various entities,\nranging from state-sponsored institutions to privately-owned startups, have\ndeveloped AF-MPDTs across a wide range of power levels. Current developments in\nsuperconducting technologies, namely High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS)\ncoils such as REBCO, have enabled research into the integration of HTS coils\ninto the applied-field module to generate MPD thrust. Developments in space\ncryocoolers have opened the doors for HTS use within a spaceflight design of an\nAF-MPDT, where the applied-field module is at 40 K. A TRL of 4-5 has been\nreached by some AF-MPDT prototypes; venturing beyond this will require higher\ncooling power space cryocoolers to be developed in parallel and appropriately\nintegrated into the thruster. Moreover, bespoke thermal control is required to\nmaintain the thruster's extreme temperature gradient where the cryocooled HTS\nare in close proximity to the thruster cathode. More effective space power\nsupply units with higher power generation is a further limitation to reaching\nTRL 9.

We propose a statistical model that considers a\nmodified logistic regression to classify FRB sources. The classical logistic\nregression model is modified to accommodate the small proportion of repeaters\nin the data, a feature that is likely due to the sampling procedure and\nduration and is not a characteristic of the population of FRB sources. The\nweighted logistic regression hinges on the choice of a tuning parameter that\nrepresents the true proportion $\\tau$ of repeating FRB sources in the entire\npopulation.

Using the CHIME/FRB Collaboration sample of\nrepeating and non-repeating FRBs and numerical experiments, we achieve a\nclassification accuracy for repeaters of nearly 75\\% or higher when $\\tau$ is\nset in the range of $50$ to $60$\\%.

It has been observed that each\ndopamine neuron does not behave uniformly, but each responds to the TD error in\nan optimistic or pessimistic manner, interpreted as a kind of distributional\nRL. To explain such a biological data, a heuristic model has also been designed\nwith learning rates asymmetric for the positive and negative TD errors.\nHowever, this heuristic model is not theoretically-grounded and unknown whether\nit can work as a RL algorithm. This paper therefore introduces a novel\ntheoretically-grounded model with optimism and pessimism, which is derived from\ncontrol as inference. In combination with ensemble learning, a distributional\nvalue function as a critic is estimated from regularly introduced optimism and\npessimism. Based on its central value, a policy in an actor is improved. This\nproposed algorithm, so-called DROP (distributional and regular optimism and\npessimism), is compared on dynamic tasks. Although the heuristic model showed\npoor learning performance, DROP showed excellent one in all tasks with high\ngenerality. In other words, it was suggested that DROP is a new model that can\nelicit the potential contributions of optimism and pessimism.",

    "abstract": "We used interpretable machine learning to combine information from multiple\nheterogeneous spectra: X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) and atomic\npair distribution functions (PDFs) to extract local structural and chemical\nenvironments of transition metal cations in oxides. Random forest models were\ntrained on simulated XANES, PDF, and both combined to extract oxidation state,\ncoordination number, and mean nearest-neighbor bond length. XANES-only models\ngenerally outperformed PDF-only models, even for structural tasks, although\nusing the metal's differential PDFs (dPDFs) instead of total PDFs narrowed this\ngap. When combined with PDFs, information from XANES often dominates the\nprediction. Our results demonstrate that XANES contain rich structural\ninformation and highlight the utility of species-specificity. This\ninterpretable, multimodal approach is quick to implement with suitable\ndatabases and offers valuable insights into the relative strengths of different\nmodalities, guiding researchers in experiment design and identifying when\ncombining complementary techniques adds meaningful information to a scientific\ninvestigation.",

We demonstrate our approach by simulating the\nevolution of very large populations made of heterogeneous co-learning agents,\nunder both naive and advanced learning strategies. In our experiments, 200,000\nPG or LOLA agents evolve in the classic games of Hawk-Dove, Stag-Hunt, and\nRock-Paper-Scissors.

Further, the system $\\boldsymbol\\lambda_{\\upsilon}$ is controlled by\na parameter $\\upsilon$ which allows more options for state types and state\nvariables than is present in Montague and Gallin. A main goal of the paper is\nto establish the basic metatheory of $\\boldsymbol\\lambda_{\\upsilon}$: (i) a\ncompleteness theorem is proven for $\\beta\\eta$-reduction, and (ii) an\nAndrews-like characterization of Henkin models in terms of combinatory logic is\ngiven; and this involves a distanced version of $\\beta$-reduction and a\n$\\mathsf{BCKW}$-like basis rather than $\\mathsf{SKI}$-like basis.

    "abstract": "As AI systems increasingly integrate into critical societal sectors, the\ndemand for robust privacy-preserving methods has escalated. This paper\nintroduces Data Obfuscation through Latent Space Projection (LSP), a novel\ntechnique aimed at enhancing AI governance and ensuring Responsible AI\ncompliance. LSP uses machine learning to project sensitive data into a latent\nspace, effectively obfuscating it while preserving essential features for model\ntraining and inference. Unlike traditional privacy methods like differential\nprivacy or homomorphic encryption, LSP transforms data into an abstract,\nlower-dimensional form, achieving a delicate balance between data utility and\nprivacy. Leveraging autoencoders and adversarial training, LSP separates\nsensitive from non-sensitive information, allowing for precise control over\nprivacy-utility trade-offs. We validate LSP's effectiveness through experiments\non benchmark datasets and two real-world case studies: healthcare cancer\ndiagnosis and financial fraud analysis. Our results show LSP achieves high\nperformance (98.7% accuracy in image classification) while providing strong\nprivacy (97.3% protection against sensitive attribute inference), outperforming\ntraditional anonymization and privacy-preserving methods. The paper also\nexamines LSP's alignment with global AI governance frameworks, such as GDPR,\nCCPA, and HIPAA, highlighting its contribution to fairness, transparency, and\naccountability. By embedding privacy within the machine learning pipeline, LSP\noffers a promising approach to developing AI systems that respect privacy while\ndelivering valuable insights.

    "abstract": "Non-classical and entangled light states are of fundamental interest in\nquantum mechanics and they are a powerful tool for the emergence of new quantum\ntechnologies. The development of methods that can lead to the generation of\nsuch light states is therefore of high importance. Recently, it has been\ndemonstrated that intense laser-matter interactions can serve towards this\ndirection. Specifically, it has been shown how the use of fully quantized\napproaches in intense laser-matter interactions and the process of high\nharmonic generation, can lead to the generation of high photon-number\nnon-classical and entangled states from the far-infrared (IR) to the\nextreme-ultraviolet (XUV). Here, after a brief introduction on the\nfundamentals, we summarize the operation principles of these approaches and\ndiscuss the recent developments and future directions of non-classical light\nengineering using strong light fields with the potential application in\nultrafast and quantum information science. These findings represent an\nimportant step in the development of novel quantum nonlinear spectroscopy\nmethods, based on the interplay between the quantum properties of light and\nthose of quantum matter.",

Using chain-of-thought prompting, we\ninstruct GPT-4 to analyze the data, prior expressions, and the scientific\ncontext (expressed in natural language) for each problem before generating new\nexpressions. We evaluated the workflow in rediscovery of five well-known\nscientific equations from experimental data, and on an additional dataset\nwithout a known equation. GPT-4 successfully rediscovered all five equations,\nand in general, performed better when prompted to use a scratchpad and consider\nscientific context. We demonstrate how strategic prompting improves the model's\nperformance and how the natural language interface simplifies integrating\ntheory with data. We also observe how theory can sometimes offset noisy data\nand, in other cases, data can make up for poor context.

From this operator factorization we develop a\nhigh-order approximate, vector Helmholtz propagator that correctly handles\nforward-arc, high-angle scattering and diffraction from inhomogeneities at all\nresolved length scales, and seamlessly includes evanescent waves.\n  A rational approximation/partial fraction decomposition of the exponential\noperator converts the propagator into a moderate number of large, sparse,\nlinear solves whose results are summed together at each step to advance the\nelectric field in space. We use a new AAA-Lawson rational interpolant for this\napproximation, rather than the more common Pad\\'{e} expansions that have\nappeared in the seismic and ocean acoustics literature previously. GMRES is\nused to solve these large systems. A direct-solve, free space propagation\nmethod proves to be an effective preconditioner for GMRES, but can also serve\nas a standalone propagator in homogeneous media. Scalar computational examples\nshown include plane wave diffraction by a circular aperture and Gaussian beam\npropagation through sine-product and homogeneous refractive index fields. The\nsine-product example compares its results to that of paraxial propagation\nthrough the same media, and demonstrates the substantial differences between\nthese propagator paradigms when the scale of the inhomogeneities is of the\norder of the fundamental wavelength in the Helmholtz equation.

Beyond posted-pricing mechanisms, even\nif the broker uses an arbitrary incentive-compatible (IC) and\nindividually-rational (IR) mechanism that maximizes her expected profit, we\nprove that it induces a $1 / 2$-approximation to the first-best GFT when the\nbuyer and seller's distributions are uniform distributions with arbitrary\nsupport.

Recently, there has been\nincreasing interest in using diverse sensing modalities for beam management.\nHowever, it remains a big challenge to process multi-modal data efficiently and\nextract useful information. On the other hand, the recently emerging\nmulti-modal transformer (MMT) is a promising technique that can process\nmulti-modal data by capturing long-range dependencies. While MMT is highly\neffective in handling multi-modal data and providing robust beam management,\nintegrating reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their adaptability in\ndynamic environments. In this work, we propose a two-step beam management\nmethod by combining MMT with RL for dynamic beam index prediction. In the first\nstep, we divide available beam indices into several groups and leverage MMT to\nprocess diverse data modalities to predict the optimal beam group. In the\nsecond step, we employ RL for fast beam decision-making within each group,\nwhich in return maximizes throughput. Our proposed framework is tested on a 6G\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Multiscale structures are becoming increasingly prevalent in the field of\nmechanical design. The variety of fine-scale structures and their respective\nrepresentations results in an interoperability challenge. To address this, a\nquery-based API was recently proposed which allows different representations to\nbe combined across the scales for multiscale structures modeling. The\nquery-based approach is fully parallelizable and has a low memory footprint;\nhowever, this architecture requires repeated evaluation of the fine-scale\nstructures locally for each individual query. While this overhead is manageable\nfor simpler fine-scale structures such as parametric lattice structures, it is\nproblematic for structures requiring non-trivial computations, such as Voronoi\nfoam structures.\n  In this paper, we develop a set-based query that retains the compatibility\nand usability of the point-based query while leveraging locality between\nmultiple point-based queries to provide a significant speedup and further\ndecrease the memory consumption for common applications, including\nvisualization and slicing for manufacturing planning. We first define the\ngeneral set-based query that consolidates multiple point-based queries at\narbitrary locations. We then implement specialized preprocessing methods for\ndifferent types of fine-scale structures which are otherwise inefficient with\nthe point-based query. Finally, we apply the set-based query to downstream\napplications such as ray-casting and slicing, increasing their performance by\nan order of magnitude. The overall improvements result in the generation and\nrendering of complex fine-scale structures such as Voronoi foams at interactive\nframe rates on the CPU.",

This paper presents\nan investigation into the mechanistic interpretability of these transformers,\nfocusing specifically on their ability to learn and predict affine recurrences\nas an ICL task. To address this, we trained a custom three-layer transformer to\npredict affine recurrences and analyzed the model's internal operations using\nboth empirical and theoretical approaches. Our findings reveal that the model\nforms an initial estimate of the target sequence using a copying mechanism in\nthe zeroth layer, which is subsequently refined through negative similarity\nheads in the second layer.

Trends of reduced transition probabilities or B(E2) values -- which\ndescribe the collective overlap between the wave functions of initial and final\nnuclear states -- are revealed in overall agreement with data.

We consider the problem of \\emph{$f$-moment\nestimation} for which one wants to estimate\n$$f(\\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{v\\in[n]}f(\\mathbf{x}(v))$$ with a small-space sketch.\n  In this work we present a simple and generic scheme to construct sketches\nwith the novel idea of hashing indices to \\emph{L\\'evy processes}, from which\none can estimate the $f$-moment $f(\\mathbf{x})$ where $f$ is the\n\\emph{characteristic exponent} of the L\\'evy process. The fundamental\n\\emph{L\\'evy-Khintchine{} representation theorem} completely characterizes the\nspace of all possible characteristic exponents, which in turn characterizes the\nset of $f$-moments that can be estimated by this generic scheme.\n  The new scheme has strong explanatory power. It unifies the construction of\nmany existing sketches ($F_0$, $L_0$, $L_2$, $L_\\alpha$, $L_{p,q}$, etc.) and\nit implies the tractability of many nearly periodic functions that were\npreviously unclassified. Furthermore, the scheme can be conveniently\ngeneralized to multidimensional cases ($d\\geq 2$) by considering\nmultidimensional L\\'evy processes and can be further generalized to estimate\n\\emph{heterogeneous moments} by projecting different indices with different\nL\\'evy processes. We conjecture that the set of tractable functions can be\ncharacterized using the L\\'evy-Khintchine representation theorem via what we\ncalled the \\emph{Fourier-Hahn-L\\'evy} method.",

    "abstract": "Design of photonic crystals having large bandgaps above a prescribed band is\na well-known physical problem with many applications. A connection to an\ninteresting mathematical construction was pointed out some time ago: it had\nbeen conjectured that optimal structures for gaps between bands n and n+1\ncorrespond, in case of transverse magnetic polarisation, to rods located at the\ngenerators of centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT), and in case of transverse\nelectric polarisation to the walls of this tessellation. We discover another\nmathematical receipt which produces even better solutions: optimal packing of\ndiscs in square and triangular tori. It provides solutions qualitatively\ndifferent from CVT, sometimes increasing the resulting bandgap size in several\ntimes. We therefore introduce two new classes of periodic structures with\nremarkable properties which may find applications in many other areas of modern\nsolid state physics: arrays of particles located at the centers of optimally\npacked discs on tori, and nets corresponding to the walls of their Voronoi\ntessellations.",

The\nmedia plays a crucial role in shaping public perception and acceptance of AI\ntechnologies. However, research into how AI appears in media has primarily\nfocused on anglophone contexts, leaving a gap in understanding how AI is\nrepresented globally. This study addresses this gap by analyzing 3,560 news\narticles from Brazilian media published between July 1, 2023, and February 29,\n2024, from 13 popular online news outlets. Using Computational Grounded Theory\n(CGT), the study applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic, and\nNamed-Entity Recognition to investigate the main topics in AI coverage and the\nentities represented. The findings reveal that Brazilian news coverage of AI is\ndominated by topics related to applications in the workplace and product\nlaunches, with limited space for societal concerns, which mostly focus on\ndeepfakes and electoral integrity. The analysis also highlights a significant\npresence of industry-related entities, indicating a strong influence of\ncorporate agendas in the country's news.

    "abstract": "Many modern radio telescopes employ an observational strategy that involves\nmaximizing the use of their available spaces (cabins), outfitting them with\nvarious receivers at different frequencies to detect incoming signals from the\nsky simultaneously or individually. The Large Latin American Millimeter Array\n(LLAMA), is a joint venture between Argentina and Brazil consisting of the\ninstallation and operation of a 12-meter aperture Cassegrain telescope. It\nfeatures three available cabins for instrumentation and plans to install six\nsingle-pixel heterodyne receivers, covering different bandwidths in the 30 to\n950 GHz window of the electromagnetic spectrum, in its two lateral Nasmyth\ncabins at different phases of the project. Therefore, it is crucial not only to\ndesign a tertiary optical system that couples the antenna beam to those\nreceivers, but also to do it in a scalable way. The primary goal for the design\nis to simultaneously maximize the antenna efficiency while minimizing optical\naberrations for all receivers, both fundamental aspects for the optimal\nfunctioning of cutting-edge astronomical instruments. In this paper, we present\nthe entire design process, starting from the quasi-optical approach based on\nthe propagation of a fundamental Gaussian beam mode, continuing with the\nvalidation of the design based on physical optics simulations, and ending with\na tolerance analysis of the system. As a result of this process, a frequency\nindependent tertiary optical system has been achieved for almost all the\nreceivers, which is expected to provide high optical performance for the radio\ntelescope.",

Host immune\nsystems develop immunity against circulating strains, which in turn avoid\nextinction by exploiting antigenic escape mutations that render new strains\nimmune from existing antibodies in the host population. Infected hosts are also\nmobile, which can spread the virus to regions without developed host immunity,\noffering additional reservoirs for viral growth. While the effects of migration\non long term stability have been investigated, we know little about how\nantigenic escape coupled with migration changes the survival and spread of\nemerging viruses. By considering the two processes on equal footing, we show\nthat on short timescales an intermediate host mobility rate increases the\nsurvival probability of the virus through antigenic escape. We show that more\nstrongly connected migratory networks decrease the survival probability of the\nvirus.

Literature databases such as the Human Metabolome Database provide\nsummaries of metabolite detections and relevance, but it does not focus on\nspecific processes, such as aging. Another database, MetaboAge, focuses\nspecifically on how metabolite concentrations change with age. However, both\ndatabases can only search metabolites individually.

This project aims to\ndesign a database from data extracted from the literature that cover studies\nacross species, include query options, and combine data to get statistically\nsound results. The Aging Metabolite Database summarizes aging-related\ninformation for almost 2,700 non-unique metabolites and was created from 104\npublications. A sub-database was created to focus on metabolite plasma levels\nin human aging and, including metadata from 27 papers.

When criminal court schedules are formed, defendants'\nscheduling preferences often take the least priority, although defendants may\nface significant consequences (including arrest or detention) for missed court\ndates. Additionally, studies indicate that defendants' nonappearances impose\ncosts on the courts and other system stakeholders. To address these issues,\ncourts and commentators have begun to recognize that pretrial outcomes for\ndefendants and for the system would be improved with greater attention to court\nprocesses, including \\emph{court scheduling practices}. There is thus a need\nfor fair criminal court pretrial scheduling systems that account for\ndefendants' preferences and availability, but the collection of such data poses\nlogistical challenges. Furthermore, optimizing schedules fairly across various\nparties' preferences is a complex optimization problem, even when such data is\navailable. In an effort to construct such a fair scheduling system under data\nuncertainty, this paper proposes a joint optimization and learning framework\nthat combines machine learning models trained end-to-end with efficient\nmatching algorithms.

Recent\nhigh-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing\nrepeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown\nintergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic\nmap governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative\ninsights into the transition from the \"conspiracy principle\" regime\n(homeostasis) to the \"catastrophe principle\" regime and then to system\nbreakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be\na one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single\nparameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously\ntuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with\nquantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse\nmonotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this\ntransition to catastrophe.

However, it has been challenging to date to apply these methods\nto the full scale of LLM pretraining. In this paper, we refine existing\ngradient-based methods to work effectively at scale, allowing us to retrieve\ninfluential examples for an 8B-parameter language model from a pretraining\ncorpus of over 160B tokens with no need for subsampling or pre-filtering. Our\nmethod combines several techniques, including optimizer state correction, a\ntask-specific Hessian approximation, and normalized encodings, which we find to\nbe critical for performance at scale. In quantitative evaluations on a fact\ntracing task, our method performs best at identifying examples that influence\nmodel predictions, but classical, model-agnostic retrieval methods such as BM25\nstill perform better at finding passages which explicitly contain relevant\nfacts. These results demonstrate a misalignment between factual *attribution*\nand causal *influence*. With increasing model size and training tokens, we find\nthat influence more closely aligns with factual attribution. Finally, we\nexamine different types of examples identified as influential by our method,\nfinding that while many directly entail a particular fact, others support the\nsame output by reinforcing priors on relation types, common entities, and\nnames. We release our prompt set and model outputs, along with a web-based\nvisualization tool to explore influential examples for factual predictions,\ncommonsense reasoning, arithmetic, and open-ended generation for an\n8B-parameter LLM.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, tools from network science have been leveraged to\ncharacterize the organization of both structural and functional networks of the\nbrain. One such measure of network organization is hub node identification.\nHubs are specialized nodes within a network that link distinct brain units\ncorresponding to specialized functional processes. Conventional methods for\nidentifying hub nodes utilize different types of centrality measures and\nparticipation coefficient to profile various aspects of nodal importance. These\nmethods solely rely on the functional connectivity networks constructed from\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ignoring the structure-function\ncoupling in the brain. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing\n(GSP) based hub detection framework that utilizes both the structural\nconnectivity and the functional activation to identify hub nodes. The proposed\nframework models functional activity as graph signals on the structural\nconnectivity. Hub nodes are then detected based on the premise that hub nodes\nare sparse, have higher level of activity compared to their neighbors, and the\nnon-hub nodes' activity can be modeled as the output of a graph-based filter.\nBased on these assumptions, an optimization framework, GraFHub, is formulated\nto learn the coefficients of the optimal polynomial graph filter and detect the\nhub nodes. The proposed framework is evaluated on both simulated data and\nresting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from Human Connectome Project (HCP).",

We first elucidate the\npotential cause of the anomalous behavior observed in the forward-bias response\nof these devices in recent cryogenic temperature measurements, which deviates\nfrom the theoretical response of a silicon Esaki diode. These anomalous\nbehaviors include current suppression at low voltages in the forward-bias\nresponse and a much lower valley voltage at cryogenic temperatures than\ntheoretically expected for a silicon diode. To investigate the potential causes\nof these anomalies, we studied the effects of a few possible transport\nmechanisms, including band-to-band tunneling, band gap narrowing, potential\nimpact of non-Ohmic contacts, band quantization, impact of leakage, and\ninelastic trap-assisted tunneling, through semi-classical simulations. We find\nthat a combination of two sets of band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) parameters can\nqualitatively approximate the shape of the tunneling current at low bias. This\ncan arise from band quantization and realignment due to the strong potential\nconfinement in $\\delta$-layers. We also find that the\nlower-than-theoretically-expected valley voltage can be attributed to\nmodifications in the electronic band structure within the $\\delta$-layer\nregions, leading to a significant band-gap narrowing induced by the high\ndensity of dopants. Finally, we extend our analyses to room temperature\noperation and predict that trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) facilitated by phonon\ninteractions may become significant, leading to a complex superposition of BTBT\nand TAT transport mechanisms in the electrical measurements.",

This decomposition offers insights into how standard\nregression estimators borrow information across different units and times,\nclarifying and supplementing the notion of forbidden comparison noted in the\nliterature. The proposed approach enables the generalization of treatment\neffect estimates to a target population and offers new diagnostics for event\nstudies, including covariate balance, sign reversal, effective sample size, and\nthe contribution of each observation to the analysis. We also provide\nvisualization tools for event studies and illustrate them in a case study of\nthe impact of divorce reforms on female suicide.",

Although LSTMs have been employed to\neffectively capture the temporal nature of streaming data, they cannot handle\nthe dimension-varying streams in an online learning setting. Therefore, we\npropose a dynamic LSTM-based novel method, called packetLSTM, to model the\ndimension-varying streams. The packetLSTM's dynamic framework consists of an\nevolving packet of LSTMs, each dedicated to processing one input feature. Each\nLSTM retains the local information of its corresponding feature, while a shared\ncommon memory consolidates global information. This configuration facilitates\ncontinuous learning and mitigates the issue of forgetting, even when certain\nfeatures are absent for extended time periods. The idea of utilizing one LSTM\nper feature coupled with a dimension-invariant operator for information\naggregation enhances the dynamic nature of packetLSTM.

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) supports diverse tasks with a\nbroad range of visual content manipulation intentions that can be related to\ndomain, scene, object, and attribute. A key challenge for ZS-CIR is to\naccurately map image representation to a pseudo-word token that captures the\nmanipulation intention relevant image information for generalized CIR. However,\nexisting methods between the retrieval and pre-training stages lead to\nsignificant redundancy in the pseudo-word tokens. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel denoising image-to-word mapping approach, named Denoise-I2W, for mapping\nimages into denoising pseudo-word tokens that, without intention-irrelevant\nvisual information, enhance accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a pseudo triplet\nconstruction module first automatically constructs pseudo triples\n(\\textit{i.e.,} a pseudo-reference image, a pseudo-manipulation text, and a\ntarget image) for pre-training the denoising mapping network. Then, a\npseudo-composed mapping module maps the pseudo-reference image to a pseudo-word\ntoken and combines it with the pseudo-manipulation text with manipulation\nintention. This combination aligns with the target image, facilitating\ndenoising intention-irrelevant visual information for mapping. Our proposed\nDenoise-I2W is a model-agnostic and annotation-free approach. It demonstrates\nstrong generalization capabilities across three state-of-the-art ZS-CIR models\non four benchmark datasets. By integrating Denoise-I2W with existing best\nmodels, we obtain consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from\n1.45\\% to 4.17\\% over the best methods without increasing inference costs. and\nachieve new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

Optimizing last-delivery operations not only creates tremendous cost\nsavings for these companies but also generate broader societal and\nenvironmental benefits in terms of better delivery service and reduced air\npollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Last-mile delivery is readily\nformulated as the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), where a salesperson must\nvisit several cities and return to the origin with the least cost. A solution\nto this problem is a Hamiltonian circuit in an undirected graph. Many methods\nexist for solving the TSP, but they often assume the travel costs are fixed. In\npractice, travel costs between delivery zones are random quantities, as they\nare subject to variation from traffic, weather, and other factors. Innovations\nsuch as truck-drone last-mile delivery creates even more uncertainties due to\nscarce data. A Bayesian D-optimal experimental design in conjunction with a\nregression model are proposed to estimate these unknown travel costs, and\nsubsequently search for a highly efficient solution to the TSP.

Over time, these wastes break down into particles smaller\nthan 5 microns -- or ''microplastics'' -- which can infiltrate human biological\nsystems. Despite decades of research into this emerging source of environmental\npollution, there is a paucity of direct evidence on the health impacts of\nmicroplastics exposure at a population scale. This paper reports the first\nempirical link between in-utero microplastic exposure and adverse birth\noutcomes. Our analysis is based on a compiled dataset of 3 million births that\noccurred in coastal areas of 15 countries spanning four continents, which we\nmerge with a novel remote-sensing measurements of marine microplastic\nconcentrations. We show that in-utero exposure to microplastics, particularly\nduring the third trimester of pregnancy, leads to a significant increase in the\nlikelihood of low birth weight. A doubling of exposure increases low birth\nweight hazard by 0.37 per 1,000 births, which implies over 205,000 cases per\nyear globally can be attributed to microplastic exposure. We further show that\naerosolization -- whereby microplastic particles become airborne and inhalable\ndue to seawater evaporation -- is an important pathway for health impact, a\nchallenge that is likely to escalate as ocean temperatures continue to rise.",

The network accurately recovered structures in a checkerboard\nresistivity model, and demonstrated robustness to noise, outperforming\ntraditional gradient-based methods. Finally, the developed scheme is tested\nusing exemplary field data from a waste site near Roorkee, India.

Each agent encounters a distinct linear bandit\nproblem characterized by its own reward and cost parameters, i.e., local\nparameters. The goal of the agents is to determine the best overall action\ncorresponding to the average of these parameters, or so-called global\nparameters. In each round, an agent is randomly chosen to select an action\nbased on its current knowledge of the system. This chosen action is then\nexecuted by all agents, then they observe their individual rewards and costs.\nWe propose a safe distributed upper confidence bound algorithm, so called\n\\textit{MA-OPLB}, and establish a high probability bound on its $T$-round\nregret. MA-OPLB utilizes an accelerated consensus method, where agents can\ncompute an estimate of the average rewards and costs across the network by\ncommunicating the proper information with their neighbors.

    "abstract": "Understanding cognitive processes in multi-agent interactions is a primary\ngoal in cognitive science. It can guide the direction of artificial\nintelligence (AI) research toward social decision-making in multi-agent\nsystems, which includes uncertainty from character heterogeneity. In this\npaper, we introduce an episodic future thinking (EFT) mechanism for a\nreinforcement learning (RL) agent, inspired by cognitive processes observed in\nanimals. To enable future thinking functionality, we first develop a\nmulti-character policy that captures diverse characters with an ensemble of\nheterogeneous policies. Here, the character of an agent is defined as a\ndifferent weight combination on reward components, representing distinct\nbehavioral preferences. The future thinking agent collects observation-action\ntrajectories of the target agents and uses the pre-trained multi-character\npolicy to infer their characters. Once the character is inferred, the agent\npredicts the upcoming actions of target agents and simulates the potential\nfuture scenario. This capability allows the agent to adaptively select the\noptimal action, considering the predicted future scenario in multi-agent\ninteractions. To evaluate the proposed mechanism, we consider the multi-agent\nautonomous driving scenario with diverse driving traits and multiple particle\nenvironments. Simulation results demonstrate that the EFT mechanism with\naccurate character inference leads to a higher reward than existing multi-agent\nsolutions. We also confirm that the effect of reward improvement remains valid\nacross societies with different levels of character diversity.",

Our main result is the\nconvergence as $t\\to\\infty$ of the particle system to a non-trivial limiting\npopulation, focusing on two cases: (1) all particle lifetimes have finite mean,\nor (2) one type has a lifetime distribution with a heavy tail, while the others\nhave finite mean. This complements previous results on extinction \\cite{Kevei}.\nUsing the Extended Final Value Theorem, we prove the existence of a limiting\ndistribution for the particle system. The non extinction of the limiting\npopulation is demonstrated using a technique inspired in \\cite{Fino}. These\nresults describe the long-term behavior of the particle system, highlighting\nthe interaction between mobility, longevity, and offspring variability.\nAdditionally, the study of a particle system with a finite number of types\nwould follow analogously with the techniques presented here. Our approach\nintroduces new techniques for the asymptotic study of critical multitype\nbranching processes.",

    "abstract": "The recent introduction of geometric partition entropy brought a new\nviewpoint to non-parametric entropy quantification that incorporated the\nimpacts of informative outliers, but its original formulation was limited to\nthe context of a one-dimensional state space. A generalized definition of\ngeometric partition entropy is now provided for samples within a bounded\n(finite measure) region of a d-dimensional vector space. The basic definition\ninvokes the concept of a Voronoi diagram, but the computational complexity and\nreliability of Voronoi diagrams in high dimension make estimation by direct\ntheoretical computation unreasonable. This leads to the development of\napproximation schemes that enable estimation that is faster than current\nmethods by orders of magnitude. The partition intersection ($\\pi$)\napproximation, in particular, enables direct estimates of marginal entropy in\nany context resulting in an efficient and versatile mutual information\nestimator. This new measure-based paradigm for data driven information theory\nallows flexibility in the incorporation of geometry to vary the representation\nof outlier impact, which leads to a significant broadening in the applicability\nof established entropy-based concepts. The incorporation of informative\noutliers is illustrated through analysis of transient dynamics in the\nsynchronization of coupled chaotic dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "Delirium is an acute confusional state that has been shown to affect up to\n31% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Early detection of this\ncondition could lead to more timely interventions and improved health outcomes.\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown great potential for ICU\ndelirium prediction using structured electronic health records (EHR), most of\nthem have not explored the use of state-of-the-art AI models, have been limited\nto single hospitals, or have been developed and validated on small cohorts. The\nuse of large language models (LLM), models with hundreds of millions to\nbillions of parameters, with structured EHR data could potentially lead to\nimproved predictive performance. In this study, we propose DeLLiriuM, a novel\nLLM-based delirium prediction model using EHR data available in the first 24\nhours of ICU admission to predict the probability of a patient developing\ndelirium during the rest of their ICU admission. We develop and validate\nDeLLiriuM on ICU admissions from 104,303 patients pertaining to 195 hospitals\nacross three large databases: the eICU Collaborative Research Database, the\nMedical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV, and the University of\nFlorida Health's Integrated Data Repository. The performance measured by the\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) showed that\nDeLLiriuM outperformed all baselines in two external validation sets, with 0.77\n(95% confidence interval 0.76-0.78) and 0.84 (95% confidence interval\n0.83-0.85) across 77,543 patients spanning 194 hospitals. To the best of our\nknowledge, DeLLiriuM is the first LLM-based delirium prediction tool for the\nICU based on structured EHR data, outperforming deep learning baselines which\nemploy structured features and can provide helpful information to clinicians\nfor timely interventions.",

During its passage through the ice, the plume\nvapor is expected to partially condense on the cold ice walls. Together with\nother effects (water spillage, compression forces, etc.) this mechanism likely\ncontributes to sealing the vent. In this work, we develop a simple\nlumped-parameter model that can quantify how quickly a hypothetical vent of\nprescribed width would be sealed via water-vapor deposition. As an example, we\napply our model to the vent size and density conditions inferred from the 2012\nHubble Space Telescope plume detection, predicting a sealing time of about 30\nminutes. This suggests that the actual ice fracture might have been larger than\noriginally proposed and/or the plume density at the vent might have been lower.\nWhile many other effects could have been present and responsible for sealing\nthe vent, our estimates indicate that vapor deposition might have played a\nmajor role in eventually shutting off the observed plume. A map of sealing\ntimes vs. plume density, mass flow rate and aperture areas is given. Plume\nquantities from the literature are analyzed and compared to our results. For a\ngiven plume density/mass flow rate, small apertures would be sealed quickly by\nvapor deposition and are thus incompatible with observations.",

It is from C-P\ndata that the Cronin effect was first inferred. TCM analysis leads to\nfactorization of collision-energy and target A dependences. Over the energy\nrange of C-P data energy dependence is restricted to model-function shapes on\n$p_t$ whereas A dependence is restricted to particle densities for three hadron\nspecies and their antiparticles. A dependence for soft and hard components\nvarying separately as power laws $A^{\\alpha_s}$ and $A^{\\alpha_h}$ with fixed\nexponents is a central finding of this study. The trends $A^{\\alpha(p_t)}$\ninferred by the C-P collaboration resulted from treating spectra as monolithic\nwhich confuses the distinct $p_t$ (model functions) and A (particle densities)\ndependences. The Cronin effect resulting from that confusion is easily\nexplained in a TCM context. Power-law trends for pions at 25 GeV are\nquantitatively compatible with trends at LHC energies. The relation of\nexponents $a_s$ and $a_h$ to $p$-A centrality is examined in detail. A Glauber\nmodel of $p$-A centrality seems invalid.",

To facilitate\nefficient and generalized learning, we propose a hierarchical Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) architecture that decomposes the cyber defense task into\nspecific sub-tasks like network investigation and host recovery.

The criteria that allow distinguishing the\nhologram and diffraction pattern are outlined. Gabor derived his criterion for\nobjects suitable for holography based on the condition that the background in\nthe reconstructed object's distribution should be nearly flat so that its\nintensity contrast does not exceed 0.05. According to Gabor, an opaque object\nis suitable for holographic reconstruction if it occupies no more than one\npercent of the imaged area, and a phase-shifting object cannot be reconstructed\nin principle. We revisit these criteria and show that both amplitude-only and\nphase-only objects can be reconstructed when the object occupies less than one\npercent of the total illuminated area. In addition, a simplified derivation of\nthe criteria is provided that is based on Parseval's theorem. It is shown that\nfor objects (including amplitude-only and phase-only) reconstructed from their\nholograms and the twin image treated as noise, the signal-to-noise ratio of 10\nor higher can be achieved provided the object occupies less than 0.5 percent of\nthe total illuminated area. When a hologram is reconstructed by applying\niterative algorithms, the requirement for the object size is much more generous\nand identical to that applied in coherent diffraction imaging: any type of\nobject (amplitude-only, phase-only, or amplitude-and-phase mixed properties) is\nsuitable for holography when the object's size in each dimension is less than\nhalf of the probed region's extent (or the field of view).",

Our findings\nunderscore the dominance of jet emission in the continuum during flare-like\nevents. We observed an approximately 80-day delay between the H$\\beta$ and\ncontinuum emissions, which we attribute to the spatial separation between the\noptical emission zone and the broad-line region. Near-zero delays between\noptical and near-infrared emissions suggest that the emitting regions within\nthe jet are co-spatial. Synchrotron self-Compton was identified as the primary\nmechanism for $\\gamma$-ray emission during flares, supported by the minimal\ndelay observed between optical/near-infrared emissions and $\\gamma$-rays.\nAdditionally, we found a delay of about 60 days between the leading\noptical/near-infrared emissions and X-rays, indicating that inverse Compton\nscattering within the jet predominantly drives X-ray emission.

Additionally, since\nmulti-channel EEG can be essentially regarded as the spatio-temporal signal\ndata received by detectors at different locations in the brain, how to\nconstruct spatio-temporal information representations of EEG signals to\nfacilitate future trend prediction for multi-channel EEG becomes an important\nproblem.

Finally, we use our 3D B-field model to infer the initial\nmagnetic field orientation in the solar neighborhood prior to the Local\nBubble's formation, and derive an orientation parallel to the present-day Local\nArm of the galaxy. These findings provide new insights into the co-evolution of\nsuperbubbles and the magnetized interstellar medium.",

There are models with either classical or quantum reference\nframes. Recently, different choices appeared for investigating these\npossibilities at the level of the classical and quantum algebra of observables.\nOne choice is based on the covariant phase space approach, using gravitational\nedge modes. In the canonical approach, there is another choice, relational\nclocks, built from matter or geometry itself. In this work, we extend existing\nresults and show how to relate edge modes and geometrical clocks in linearized\ngravity. We proceed in three steps. First, we introduce an extension of the ADM\n(Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) phase space to account for covariant gauge fixing\nconditions and the explicit time dependence they add to Hamilton's equations.\nSecond, we show how these gauge fixing conditions recover a specific choice of\ngeometrical clocks in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero connection variables. Third, we\nstudy the effect of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter on the generators of\nasymptotic symmetries and the corresponding charges. This parameter, which\ndisappears from metric gravity, affects the generators for angle-dependent\nasymptotic symmetries and the corresponding super-translation charges, while it\nhas no effect on the global charges.",

In this work, we identify a\nhierarchy of discrete structures in the CMZ using column density maps from\nPaper I (Battersby et al., submitted). We calculate the physical ($N$(H$_2$),\n$T_{\\rm{dust}}$, mass, radius) and kinematic (HNCO, HCN, and HC$_3$N moments)\nproperties of each structure as well as their bolometric luminosities and star\nformation rates (SFRs).

    "abstract": "The UV upturn refers to the increase in UV flux at wavelengths shorter than\n3000 {\\AA} observed in quiescent early-type galaxies (ETGs), which still\nremains a puzzle. In this study, we aim to identify ETGs showing the UV upturn\nphenomenon within the Virgo galaxy cluster. We utilized a color-color diagram\nto identify all potential possible UV upturn galaxies. The Spectral Energy\nDistributions (SED) of these galaxies were then analyzed using the CIGALE\nsoftware; we confirmed the presence of UV upturn in galaxies within the Virgo\ncluster. We found that the SED fitting method is the best tool to visualize and\nconfirm the UV upturn phenomenon in ETGs. Our findings reveal that the\npopulation distributions regarding stellar mass and star formation rate\nproperties are similar between UV upturn and red sequence galaxies. We suggest\nthat the UV contribution originates from old stellar populations and can be\nmodeled effectively without a burst model. Moreover, by estimating the\ntemperature of the stellar population responsible for the UV emission, we\ndetermined it to be 13,000 K to 18,000 K. These temperature estimates support\nthe notion that the UV upturn likely arises from the contribution of low mass\nevolved stellar populations (extreme horizontal branch stars). Furthermore, the\nMg2 index, a metallicity indicator, in the confirmed upturn galaxies shows\nhigher strength and follows a similar trend to previous studies. This study\nsheds light on the nature of UV upturn galaxies within the Virgo cluster and\nprovides evidence that low-mass evolved stellar populations are the possible\nmechanisms driving the UV upturn phenomenon.",

We used magnetospheric accretion models to analyze the Ca II emission\nlines and estimate abundances in the accretion flows of the stars, which feed\nfrom the inner disks. We find Ca depletion in disks of all three star-forming\nregions, with 57% of the sample having [Ca/H] < -0.30 relative to the solar\nabundance. All disks with cavities and/or substructures show depletion,\nconsistent with trapping of refractories in pressure bumps. Significant Ca\ndepletion ([Ca/H] < -0.30) is also measured in 60% of full disks, although some\nof those disks may have hidden substructures or cavities. We find no\ncorrelation between Ca abundance and stellar or disk parameters except for the\nmass accretion rate onto the star. This could suggest that the inner and outer\ndisks are decoupled, and that the mass accretion rate is related to a mass\nreservoir in the inner disk, while refractory depletion reflects phenomena in\nthe outer disk related to the presence of structure and forming planets. Our\nresults of refractory depletion and timescales for depletion are qualitatively\nconsistent with expectations of dust growth and radial drift including\npartitioning of elements and constitute direct evidence that radial drift of\nsolids locked in pebbles takes place in disks.",

    "abstract": "Recent works identified a way to recover the time evolution of a galaxy's\ndisk metallicity gradient from the shape of its age--metallicity relation.\nHowever, the success of the method is dependent on how the width of the\nstar-forming region evolves over time, which in turn is dependent on a galaxy's\npresent-day bar strength. In this paper, we account for the time variation in\nthe width of the star-forming region when deriving the interstellar medium\n(ISM) metallicity gradient evolution over time ($\\rm \\nabla [Fe/H](\\tau)$),\nwhich provides more realistic birth radii estimates of Milky Way (MW) disk\nstars. Using MW/Andromeda analogues from the TNG50 simulation, we quantified\nthe disk growth of newly born stars as a function of present-day bar strength\nto provide a correction that improves recovery of $\\rm \\nabla [Fe/H](\\tau)$. In\nTNG50, we find that our correction reduces the median absolute error in\nrecovering $\\rm \\nabla [Fe/H] (\\tau)$ by over 30%. To confirm its universality,\nwe test our correction on two galaxies from NIHAO-UHD and find the median\nabsolute error is over 3 times smaller even in the presence of observational\nuncertainties for the barred, MW-like galaxy. Applying our correction to APOGEE\nDR17 red giant MW disk stars suggests the effects of merger events on $\\rm\n\\nabla [Fe/H](\\tau)$ are less significant than originally found, and the\ncorresponding estimated birth radii expose epochs when different migration\nmechanisms dominated. Our correction to account for the growth of the\nstar-forming region in the disk allows for better recovery of the evolution of\nthe MW disk's ISM metallicity gradient and, thus, more meaningful stellar birth\nradii estimates. With our results, we are able to suggest the evolution of not\nonly the ISM gradient, but also the total stellar disk radial metallicity\ngradient, providing key constraints to select MW analogues across redshift.",

In this paper, we analyse the\nresulting parameter space of scale radius $r_{\\rm s}$, truncation radius\n$r_{\\rm t}$, steepening $\\alpha$, truncation sharpness $\\beta$, infalling\nnormalisation $\\delta_1$, and infalling slope $s$. We show that these\nparameters are non-degenerate in averaged profiles, and that fits to the total\nprofiles generally recover the underlying properties of the orbiting and\ninfalling terms. We study the connection between profile parameters and halo\nproperties such as mass (or peak height) and accretion rate. We find that the\ncommonly cited dependence of $\\alpha$ on peak height is an artefact of fitting\nEinasto profiles to the actual, truncated profiles. In our fits, $\\alpha$ is\nindependent of mass but dependent on accretion rate. When fitting individual\nhalo profiles, the parameters exhibit significant scatter but otherwise follow\nthe same trends. We confirm that the entire profiles are sensitive to the\naccretion history of haloes, and that the two radial scales $r_{\\rm s}$ and\n$r_{\\rm t}$ particularly respond to the formation time and recent accretion\nrate. As a result, $r_{\\rm t}$ is a more accurate measure of the accretion rate\nthan the commonly used radius where the density slope is steepest.",

Consequently, we revise a previously published fit to the\n$Z_{\\rm{crit}}$ curve to account for this updated $Z_{\\rm{crit}}$. Second,\nhigher resolution results in a thicker dust layer, which may result from other\ninstabilities manifesting, such as the vertical shearing streaming instability.\nThird, despite this thicker layer, higher resolution can lead to strong\nclumping even with lower midplane dust-to-gas density ratios (which results\nfrom the thicker particle layer) so long as $Z \\gtrsim Z_{\\rm{crit}}$.

    "abstract": "The structure of stellar envelopes strongly influences the course and outcome\nof binary mass transfer, in particular of common envelope (CE) evolution.\nConvective envelopes can most easily be ejected during CE events, leading to\nshort-period binaries and potentially gravitational wave (GW) sources.\nConversely, radiative envelope are thought to lead to CE mergers and\nThorne-Zytkow objects (TZOs) or quasi-stars (QS). Rapid binary models based on\nHurley et al. (2000) often assume that any CE event with a Hertzsprung gap\ndonor results in a CE merger, in tension with literature. We improve this with\na more self-consistent criterion based on the presence of a convective\nenvelope. Using 1D stellar models (MESA), we systematically investigate the\ndevelopment of convective envelopes in massive stars. We provide fitting\nformulae for rapid binary codes and implement them into the StarTrack\npopulation synthesis code to refine the CE treatment and examine the impact on\nGW sources, TZOs, and QSs. We show that convective envelopes in massive stars\nare highly sensitive to the treatment of superadiabacity and the mixing length.\nOur revised CE model significantly reduces (factor 20) the predicted merger\nrate of binary black hole (BH-BH) mergers with total masses between roughly 20\nand 50 Msun. This leads to a bimodal mass distribution with a strong\nmetallicity dependence. We also predict that the current TZO/QS formation rate\nin the Galaxy (up to roughly 10-4 yr-1), combined with their predicted\nlifetimes, makes their detection unlikely. Our study strongly suggests that the\nrole of CE evolution in the formation of BH-BH mergers has been considerably\noverestimated for BH-BH mergers with Mtot > 20 Msun. We highlight that any\nprediction from the CE channel for massive BH-BH mergers (>50 Msun) heavily\nhinges on our limited understanding of stellar structure and mass loss close to\nthe Eddington limit.",

Phrased differently,\nwe ask whether correlation functions on the boundary of the ball capture all\nthe information of all correlators in the bulk of the ball. In this work, we\nanswer this question in the affirmative within the confines of linearised\nquantum gravity for generic low-energy (free Klein-Gordon) states in flat space\ncreated by the action of unitaries on the vacuum to leading order in a certain\nperturbative parameter.

To facilitate comprehensive culture-aware\nevaluation, JMMMU features two complementary subsets: (i) culture-agnostic (CA)\nsubset, where the culture-independent subjects (e.g., Math) are selected and\ntranslated into Japanese, enabling one-to-one comparison with its English\ncounterpart MMMU; and (ii) culture-specific (CS) subset, comprising newly\ncrafted subjects that reflect Japanese cultural context. Using the CA subset,\nwe observe performance drop in many LMMs when evaluated in Japanese, which is\npurely attributable to language variation. Using the CS subset, we reveal their\ninadequate Japanese cultural understanding. Further, by combining both subsets,\nwe identify that some LMMs perform well on the CA subset but not on the CS\nsubset, exposing a shallow understanding of the Japanese language that lacks\ndepth in cultural understanding.

As the idiom \"A picture is worth a thousand words\"\nimplies, representing a single image in current LVLMs can require hundreds or\neven thousands of tokens. This results in significant computational costs,\nwhich grow quadratically as input image resolution increases, thereby severely\nimpacting the efficiency of both training and inference. Previous approaches\nhave attempted to reduce the number of image tokens either before or within the\nearly layers of LVLMs. However, these strategies inevitably result in the loss\nof crucial image information, ultimately diminishing model performance. To\naddress this challenge, we conduct an empirical study revealing that all visual\ntokens are necessary for LVLMs in the shallow layers, and token redundancy\nprogressively increases in the deeper layers of the model. To this end, we\npropose PyramidDrop, a visual redundancy reduction strategy for LVLMs to boost\ntheir efficiency in both training and inference with neglectable performance\nloss. Specifically, we partition the LVLM into several stages and drop part of\nthe image tokens at the end of each stage with a pre-defined ratio, creating\npyramid-like visual tokens across model layers. The dropping is based on a\nlightweight similarity calculation with a negligible time overhead. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PyramidDrop can achieve a 40% training time and\n55% inference FLOPs acceleration of LLaVA-NeXT with comparable performance.\nBesides, the PyramidDrop could also serve as a plug-and-play strategy for\ninference acceleration without training, with better performance and lower\ninference cost than counterparts.

To address\nthis, we propose a tile-based computation strategy that partitions the\ncontrastive loss calculation into arbitrary small blocks, avoiding full\nmaterialization of the similarity matrix. Furthermore, we introduce a\nmulti-level tiling strategy to leverage the hierarchical structure of\ndistributed systems, employing ring-based communication at the GPU level to\noptimize synchronization and fused kernels at the CUDA core level to reduce I/O\noverhead. Experimental results show that the proposed method scales batch sizes\nto unprecedented levels.

Moreover, this procedure preserves\nthe distance and number of logicals of the original code. The new Floquet code\nrequires additional physical qubits.

    "abstract": "Web agents have emerged as a promising direction to automate Web task\ncompletion based on user instructions, significantly enhancing user experience.\nRecently, Web agents have evolved from traditional agents to Large Language\nModels (LLMs)-based Web agents. Despite their success, existing LLM-based Web\nagents overlook the importance of personalized data (e.g., user profiles and\nhistorical Web behaviors) in assisting the understanding of users' personalized\ninstructions and executing customized actions. To overcome the limitation, we\nfirst formulate the task of LLM-empowered personalized Web agents, which\nintegrate personalized data and user instructions to personalize instruction\ncomprehension and action execution. To address the absence of a comprehensive\nevaluation benchmark, we construct a Personalized Web Agent Benchmark\n(PersonalWAB), featuring user instructions, personalized user data, Web\nfunctions, and two evaluation paradigms across three personalized Web tasks.\nMoreover, we propose a Personalized User Memory-enhanced Alignment (PUMA)\nframework to adapt LLMs to the personalized Web agent task. PUMA utilizes a\nmemory bank with a task-specific retrieval strategy to filter relevant\nhistorical Web behaviors. Based on the behaviors, PUMA then aligns LLMs for\npersonalized action execution through fine-tuning and direct preference\noptimization. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PUMA over\nexisting Web agents on PersonalWAB.",

To analyze the post-bounce phase of a supernova, one can use the\ngeneralized Force Explosion Condition (FEC+), which succinctly formalizes the\ninterplay among these four phenomena in an analytical condition, consistent\nwith realistic simulations. In this paper, we use the FEC+ to study the\npost-bounce phase of 341 spherically symmetric simulations, where convection is\nincluded through a time-dependent mixing length approach. We find that the\naccretion of the Si/O interface through the expanding shock can significantly\nchange the outcome of the supernova by driving the FEC+ above the explosion\nthreshold. We systematically explore this by (i) artificially smoothing the\npre-supernova density profile, and (ii) artificially varying the mixing length.\nIn both cases, we find that large-enough density contrasts at the Si/O\ninterface lead to successful shock revival only if the FEC+ is already close to\nthe explosion threshold. Furthermore, we find that the accretion of the Si/O\ninterface has a substantial effect on the critical condition for supernova\nexplosions, contributing between 5\\% and 15\\%, depending on how pronounced the\ndensity contrast at the interface is. Earlier studies showed that convection\naffects the critical condition by 25--30\\%, which demonstrates that the\naccretion of the Si/O interface through the shock can play a nearly comparable\nrole in influencing shock dynamics.",

We\nconsider a recent contamination model that combines two kinds of corruptions:\n(i) small fraction of arbitrary outliers, as in classical robust statistics,\nand (ii) local perturbations, where samples may undergo bounded shifts on\naverage. While each noise model is well understood individually, the combined\ncontamination model poses new algorithmic challenges, with only partial results\nknown. Existing efficient algorithms are limited in two ways: (i) they work\nonly for a weak notion of local perturbations, and (ii) they obtain suboptimal\nerror for isotropic subgaussian distributions (among others). The latter\nlimitation led [NGS24, COLT'24] to hypothesize that improving the error might,\nin fact, be computationally hard. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that\ninformation theoretically optimal error can indeed be achieved in polynomial\ntime, under an even \\emph{stronger} local perturbation model (the\nsliced-Wasserstein metric as opposed to the Wasserstein metric). Notably, our\nanalysis reveals that the entire family of stability-based robust mean\nestimators continues to work optimally in a black-box manner for the combined\ncontamination model.

A more parameter-efficient approach is Prompt\nTuning (PT), which updates only a few learnable tokens, and differently,\nIn-Context Learning (ICL) adapts the model to a new task by simply including\nexamples in the input without any training. When applying optimization-based\nmethods, such as fine-tuning and PT for few-shot learning, the model is\nspecifically adapted to the small set of training examples, whereas ICL leaves\nthe model unchanged. This distinction makes traditional learning methods more\nprone to overfitting; in contrast, ICL is less sensitive to the few-shot\nscenario. While ICL is not prone to overfitting, it does not fully extract the\ninformation that exists in the training examples. This work introduces\nContext-aware Prompt Tuning (CPT), a method inspired by ICL, PT, and\nadversarial attacks. We build on the ICL strategy of concatenating examples\nbefore the input, but we extend this by PT-like learning, refining the context\nembedding through iterative optimization to extract deeper insights from the\ntraining examples. We carefully modify specific context tokens, considering the\nunique structure of input and output formats. Inspired by adversarial attacks,\nwe adjust the input based on the labels present in the context, focusing on\nminimizing, rather than maximizing, the loss. Moreover, we apply a projected\ngradient descent algorithm to keep token embeddings close to their original\nvalues, under the assumption that the user-provided data is inherently\nvaluable.

In two-DOF case,\none can observe stable beatings attractor with synchronized amplitudes of the\nsymmetric and antisymmetric modes. Current study demonstrates that this unusual\nbehavior is generic and quite ubiquitous, if the system is explored in\nappropriate parametric regime. Indeed, in the absence of the self - excitation\nthe system of coupled linear oscillators possesses a complete set of\nnon-interacting eigenmodes. If the system is symmetric and the coupling is weak\nenough, appropriate initial conditions will result in a continuous\nmulti-parametric family of stationary beatings or beat waves. If the\nself-excitation terms are small enough, i.e. even weaker than the weak\ncoupling, one can expect that, generically, some special stationary or wave\nbeatings will turn into the stable attractors. We demonstrate this phenomenon\nin systems of ring-coupled BVdP oscillators. In particular, we observe simple\ntwo-wave synchronization for $N=2,3,5,6,7$ coupled oscillators; for $N=2$ it\ncorresponds to the \"modal\" synchronization observed previously. The case $N=4$\nis special: due to internal resonances in the slow flow, the two-wave\nsynchronization turns unstable, and more complicated patterns of the multi-wave\nsynchronization are revealed. Analytic models manage to capture the shapes of\nthe observed beat waves. All results are verified by direct numeric\nsimulations.",

In this work, we propose MiniPLM, a KD\nframework for pre-training LMs by refining the training data distribution with\nthe teacher LM's knowledge.

The goal of this paper is to prove paradifferential reducibility\nresults, enabling the reduction of nonlinear equations themselves, rather than\njust their linearizations, to constant coefficient form, modulo smoothing\nterms. As an initial application, we demonstrate the existence of quasiperiodic\nsolutions for certain hyperbolic systems. Despite the small denominator\nproblem, our proof does not rely on traditional Nash-Moser/KAM-type schemes,\nbut instead on the Banach fixed point theorem. To achieve this, we develop two\nkey toolsets. The first focuses on the calculus of paracomposition operators\nintroduced by Alinhac, interpreted as the flow map of a paraproduct vector\nfield. We refine this approach to establish new estimates that precisely\ncapture the dependence on the diffeomorphism in question. The second toolset\naddresses two classical reducibility problems, one for matrix differential\noperators and the other for nearly parallel vector fields on torus.

    "abstract": "We study the optimal scheduling problem for a Markovian multiclass queueing\nnetwork with abandonment in the Halfin--Whitt regime, under the long run\naverage (ergodic) risk sensitive cost criterion. The objective is to prove\nasymptotic optimality for the optimal control arising from the corresponding\nergodic risk sensitive control (ERSC) problem for the limiting diffusion. In\nparticular, we show that the optimal ERSC value associated with the\ndiffusion-scaled queueing process converges to that of the limiting diffusion\nin the asymptotic regime. The challenge that ERSC poses is that one cannot\nexpress the ERSC cost as an expectation over the mean empirical measure\nassociated with the queueing process, unlike in the usual case of a long run\naverage (ergodic) cost. We develop a novel approach by exploiting the\nvariational representations of the limiting diffusion and the Poisson-driven\nqueueing dynamics, which both involve certain auxiliary controls. The ERSC\ncosts for both the diffusion-scaled queueing process and the limiting diffusion\ncan be represented as the integrals of an extended running cost over a mean\nempirical measure associated with the corresponding extended processes using\nthese auxiliary controls. For the lower bound proof, we exploit the connections\nof the ERSC problem for the limiting diffusion with a two-person zero-sum\nstochastic differential game. We also make use of the mean empirical measures\nassociated with the extended limiting diffusion and diffusion-scaled processes\nwith the auxiliary controls. One major technical challenge in both lower and\nupper bound proofs, is to establish the tightness of the aforementioned mean\nempirical measures for the extended processes. We identify nearly optimal\ncontrols appropriately in both cases so that the existing ergodicity properties\nof the limiting diffusion and diffusion-scaled queueing processes can be used.",

    "abstract": "The most rigorous physical description of non-equilibrium gas dynamics is\nrooted in the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation. Yet, the large\nnumber of degrees of freedom and the wide range of both spatial and temporal\nscales render these equations intractable for many relevant problems. This\nstudy constructs a reduced-order model for the Boltzmann equation, by combining\ncoarse-graining modeling framework with the maximum entropy principle. This is\naccomplished by projecting the high-dimensional Boltzmann equation onto a\ncarefully chosen lower-dimensional subspace, resulting from the discretization\nof the velocity space into sub-volumes. Within each sub-volume, the\ndistribution function is reconstructed through the maximum entropy principle,\nensuring compliance with the detailed balance. The resulting set of\nconservation equations comprises mass, momentum, and energy for each\nsub-volume, allowing for flexibility in the description of the velocity\ndistribution function. This new set of governing equations, while retaining\nmany of the mathematical characteristics of the conventional Navier-Stokes\nequations far outperforms them in terms of applicability. The proposed\nmethodology is applied to the Bhatnagar, Gross, and Krook (BGK) formulation of\nthe Boltzmann equation. To validate the model's accuracy, we simulate the\nnon-equilibrium relaxation of a gas under spatially uniform conditions.\nAdditionally, the model is used to analyze the shock structure of a 1-D\nstanding shockwave across an extensive range of Mach numbers. Notably, both the\nnon-equilibrium velocity distribution functions and macroscopic metrics derived\nfrom our model align remarkably with the direct solutions of the Boltzmann\nequation.",

In the FLLN, assuming that the hazard rate function of\nthe infection periods is bounded and the ages at time 0 of the infections of\nthe initially infected individuals are bounded, we obtain a PDE limit for the\nLLN-scaled measure-valued process, for which we characterize its solution\nexplicitly.

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the canonical differential equations dictate the\nbehavior of cosmological wavefunction coefficients for two-site loop-level\nconfigurations in conformally-coupled scalar field theory within a general\npower-law FRW cosmology. Employing the tools of relative twisted cohomology and\nintegration-by-parts techniques, we systematically derive these equations,\nthereby establishing a comprehensive framework for loop-level correlators for\nthe first time. A novel contribution of this work is the extension of kinematic\nflow framework to the loop-level scenarios. Using a graphical approach based on\nfamily trees generated by marked tubing graphs, we efficiently construct the\ndifferential equations while capturing the singularity structure and\nhierarchical relationships within the associated integral families.\nFurthermore, we present new insights into the tadpole systems, uncovering that\ntheir integral families can exhibit multiple parent functions due to distinct,\nnon-overlapping relative hyperplanes, in contrast with the single parent\nfunction of bubble and tree-level systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that\ntadpole wavefunction coefficients selectively probe only a subset of the\ncohomology space, despite the hyperplane arrangement suggesting a\nhigher-dimensional structure. Beyond these findings, we provide a preliminary\ndiscussion on generalization to two-site higher-loop configurations, laying the\ngroundwork for future exploration of more intricate scenarios. This work\nintroduces several first-time methodologies and results, advancing our\nunderstanding of the geometric, topological, and dynamical properties of\nloop-level wavefunction coefficients and offering new insights for probing the\nfundamental mechanisms of the early universe.",

In the\ncurrent work, motivated by the well-known normal boundary intersection (NBI)\nmethod and the SD algorithm, we present SDNBI, a new algorithm for bi-objective\noptimization (BOO) designed to address the theoretical and numerical challenges\nassociated with the reliable solution of general nonconvex and discrete BOO\nproblems. The main improvements in the algorithm are the effective exploration\nof the nonconvex regions of the Pareto front and, uniquely, the early\nidentification of regions where no additional Pareto solutions exist. The\nperformance of the SDNBI algorithm is assessed based on the accuracy of the\napproximation of the Pareto front constructed over the disconnected nonconvex\nobjective domains. The new algorithm is compared with two MOO approaches, the\nmodified NBI method and the SD algorithm, using published benchmark problems.\nThe results indicate that the SDNBI algorithm outperforms the modified NBI and\nSD algorithms in solving convex, nonconvex-continuous, and combinatorial\nproblems, both in terms of computational cost and of the overall quality of the\nPareto-optimal set, suggesting that the SDNBI algorithm is a promising\nalternative for solving BOO problems.",

A decision maker is presented with a number of items,\neach of which contains an unknown price, and can pay an inspection cost to\nobserve the item's price before selecting it. Under single-item selection, the\ndecision maker must select one item; under combinatorial selection, the\ndecision maker must select a set of items that satisfies certain constraints.\nIn our nonobligatory inspection setting, the decision maker can select items\nwithout first inspecting them. It is well-known that search with nonobligatory\ninspection is harder than the well-studied obligatory inspection case, for\nwhich the optimal policy for single-item selection (Weitzman, 1979) and\napproximation algorithms for combinatorial selection (Singla, 2018) are known.\n  We introduce a technique, local hedging, for constructing policies with good\napproximation ratios in the nonobligatory inspection setting. Local hedging\ntransforms policies for the obligatory inspection setting into policies for the\nnonobligatory inspection setting, at the cost of an extra factor in the\napproximation ratio.

While existing temporal logic planning algorithms can synthesize\ncorrect-by-construction plans, they typically lack reactivity to unexpected\nfailures of robot skills, which can compromise mission performance. This paper\naddresses this challenge by proposing a reactive LTL planning algorithm that\nadapts to unexpected failures during deployment. Specifically, the proposed\nalgorithm reassigns sub-tasks to robots based on their functioning skills and\nlocally revises team plans to accommodate these new assignments and ensure\nmission completion. The main novelty of the proposed algorithm is its ability\nto handle cases where mission completion becomes impossible due to limited\nfunctioning robots. Instead of reporting mission failure, the algorithm\nstrategically prioritizes the most crucial sub-tasks and locally revises the\nteam's plans, as per user-specified priorities, to minimize mission violations.\nWe provide theoretical conditions under which the proposed framework computes\nthe minimum-violation task reassignments and team plans.

Lett.'01] given more than twenty\nyears ago have remained the state-of-the-art for directed graphs. An open\nproblem posed by [Bernstein, SODA'12] -- who gave a randomized $m\\cdot\nn^{o(1)}$ time bicriteria $(1+\\varepsilon, 1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithm for undirected graphs -- asks if there is similarly an $o(mn)$ time\napproximation scheme for directed graphs.\n  We show two randomized bicriteria $(1+\\varepsilon,\n1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms that give an affirmative answer to the\nproblem: one suited to dense graphs, and the other that works better for sparse\ngraphs. On directed graphs with a quasi-polynomial weights aspect ratio, our\nalgorithms run in time $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and $\\tilde{O}(mn^{3/5})$ or better,\nrespectively. More specifically, the algorithm for sparse digraphs runs in time\n$\\tilde{O}(mn^{(3 - \\alpha)/5})$ for graphs with $n^{1 + \\alpha}$ edges for any\nreal $\\alpha \\in [0,1/2]$.",

However, the comparison presented\n  is critically flawed, as the Newtonian predictions used refer to wide\nbinaries with mean total masses of 2.0 $M_{\\odot}$. This is larger than\n  the 1.56 $M_{\\odot}$ value which applies to the data used in said paper. In\nthis short note we correct the error mentioned above and show that\n  the data and error bars as given by Cookson are in fact inconsistent with\nNewtonian expectations. Contrary to the assertion in that study,\n  the data presented there actually show a clear anomaly in the low\nacceleration gravitational regime, { with the overall slope of the\n  velocity-separation scaling being inconsistent with Newtonian expectations at\na 3.3$\\sigma$ level.} Based on the data presented in the paper\n  by Cookson, wide binary systems show a clear Milgromian deviation from\nNewtonian dynamics.",

Machine learning based methods for inverse folding typically\nuse recovery of the original sequence as the optimization objective.

Moreover, for many practical applications, it is often\ndesirable to have multiple, diverse sequences that fold into the target\nstructure since it allows for more candidate sequences for downstream\noptimizations.

To address this, we\npresent RL-DIF, a categorical diffusion model for inverse folding that is\npre-trained on sequence recovery and tuned via reinforcement learning on\nstructural consistency. We find that RL-DIF achieves comparable sequence\nrecovery and structural consistency to benchmark models but shows greater\nfoldable diversity: experiments show RL-DIF can achieve an foldable diversity\nof 29% on CATH 4.2, compared to 23% from models trained on the same dataset.\nThe PyTorch model weights and sampling code are available on GitHub.",

    "abstract": "Recent research provides compelling evidence that the decay of short-lived\nradioisotopes (SLRs), such as 26Al, provided the bulk of energy for heating and\ndesiccation of volatile-rich planetesimals in the early Solar System. However,\nit remains unclear whether the early Solar System was highly enriched relative\nto other planetary systems with similar formation characteristics. While the\nSolar System possesses an elevated level of SLR enrichment compared to the\ninterstellar medium, determining SLR enrichment of individual protoplanetary\ndisks observationally has not been performed and is markedly more difficult. We\nuse N-body simulations to estimate enrichment of SLRs in star-forming regions\nthrough two likely important SLR sources, stellar winds from massive stars and\nsupernovae. We vary the number of stars and the radii of the star-forming\nregions and implement two models of stellar wind SLR propagation for the\nradioisotopes 26Al and 60Fe. We find that for 26Al enrichment the Solar System\nis at the upper end of the expected distribution, while for the more supernovae\ndependent isotope 60Fe we find that the Solar System is comparatively very\nhighly enriched. Furthermore, combined with our previous research, these\nresults suggest that the statistical role of 26Al-driven desiccation on\nexoplanet bulk composition may be underestimated in typical interpretations of\nthe low-mass exoplanet census, and that 60Fe is even less influential as a\nsource of heating than previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has been widely studied in recent years.\nHowever, most existing MAPF algorithms assume that an agent occupies only a\nsingle grid in a grid-based map. This assumption limits their applicability in\nmany real-world domains where agents have geometric shapes, rather than being\npoint-like. Such agents, which can occupy multiple cells simultaneously, are\nreferred to as ``large'' agents. When considering the shape and size of agents\nin MAPF, the computational complexity increases significantly as the number of\nagents grows, primarily due to the increased overhead in conflict detection\nbetween geometric agents. In this paper, we propose two types of subproblems\nfor the LA-MAPF (Large-Agent MAPF) problem: \\textbf{cluster} (which has no\nconstraints on the order of solution) and \\textbf{level} (which imposes\nconstraints on the solution order). We introduce \\textbf{Layered LA-MAPF}, a\nmethod that decomposes a MAPF instance involving geometric agents into\nclusters, and then further decomposes each cluster into levels. This approach\naims to reduce time complexity when solving LA-MAPF problems. Our results\ndemonstrate the performance of our method as the number of agents increases\nacross various maps, and how it accelerates LA-MAPF methods, such as LA-CBS and\nLA-LaCAM. Experiments show that our LA-MAPF method with instance decomposition\n\\textbf{halves the time cost (reducing from an average of 40s to 20s) and\ntriples the success rate (from an average of 0.27 to 0.80)} in finding a\nsolution within 60 seconds.

Recent deep time series forecasting models struggle to utilize\nseasonal and trend decomposition to separate the entangled components. Such a\nstrategy only explicitly extracts simple linear patterns like trends, leaving\nthe other linear modes and vast unexplored nonlinear patterns to the residual.\nTheir flawed linear and nonlinear feature extraction models and shallow-level\ndecomposition limit their adaptation to the diverse patterns present in\nreal-world scenarios. Given this, we innovate Recursive Residual Decomposition\nby introducing explicit extraction of both linear and nonlinear patterns. This\ndeeper-level decomposition framework, which is named LiNo, captures linear\npatterns using a Li block which can be a moving average kernel, and models\nnonlinear patterns using a No block which can be a Transformer encoder. The\nextraction of these two patterns is performed alternatively and recursively. To\nachieve the full potential of LiNo, we develop the current simple linear\npattern extractor to a general learnable autoregressive model, and design a\nnovel No block that can handle all essential nonlinear patterns. Remarkably,\nthe proposed LiNo achieves state-of-the-art on thirteen real-world benchmarks\nunder univariate and multivariate forecasting scenarios. Experiments show that\ncurrent forecasting models can deliver more robust and precise results through\nthis advanced Recursive Residual Decomposition.

We construct an explicit list of\npolynomials $g_d^{(1)},\\dots,g_d^{(t_d)}\\in\\mathbb{Z}[A_0,\\dots,A_{d-1}]$ such\nthat the valuations $\\mathrm{ord}(g_{d}^{(i)}(a_0,\\dots,a_{d-1}))$ for\n$i=1,\\dots,t_d$ uniquely determine this set of distances for the polynomial\n$f(x)=c_f(x^d+a_{d-1}x^{d-1}+\\dots+a_0)$, and we describe the process by which\nthey do so. We use this to deduce that if $C:y^2=f(x)$ is a hyperelliptic curve\nover a local field $K$, this list of valuations of polynomials in the\ncoefficients of $f(x)$ uniquely determines the dual graph of the special fibre\nof the minimal strict normal crossings model of $C/K^{\\mathrm{unr}}$, the\ninertia action on the Tate module and the conductor exponent.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained models has become the standard approach to endow them\nwith specialized knowledge, but it poses fundamental challenges. In particular,\n\\textit{(i)} fine-tuning often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where\nimprovements on a target domain degrade generalization on other tasks, and\n\\textit{(ii)} merging fine-tuned checkpoints from disparate tasks can lead to\nsignificant performance loss. To address these challenges, we introduce LiNeS,\nLayer-increasing Network Scaling, a post-training editing technique designed to\npreserve pre-trained generalization while enhancing fine-tuned task\nperformance. LiNeS scales parameter updates linearly based on their layer depth\nwithin the network, maintaining shallow layers close to their pre-trained\nvalues to preserve general features while allowing deeper layers to retain\ntask-specific representations. In multi-task model merging scenarios,\nlayer-wise scaling of merged parameters reduces negative task interference.\nLiNeS demonstrates significant improvements in both single-task and multi-task\nsettings across various benchmarks in vision and natural language processing.\nIt mitigates forgetting, enhances out-of-distribution generalization,\nintegrates seamlessly with existing multi-task model merging baselines\nimproving their performance across benchmarks and model sizes, and can boost\ngeneralization when merging LLM policies aligned with different rewards via\nRLHF.

Grid-forming inverters (GFMs), enabled by various device-level\n(primary) and system-level (secondary) control methods, are poised to play a\nsignificant role in achieving certain operational objectives, such as the\neffective utilization of clean energy resources while maintaining stability.\nHowever, despite the recent advances in GFMs, there is a lack of suitable\ncontrols that can ascertain resilience-constrained operations, like maintaining\ncritical operational safety limits during transients under various\ncyber-physical disruptions. In this work, we develop decentralized autonomous\ncontrollers (DACs) that enforce resilience-constrained operation via local,\nminimally invasive adjustments (e.g., changes in set-points) while co-existing\nwithin the hierarchy of existing (primary and secondary) controls. The DACs\nwork autonomously by sensing only local GFM measurements and act only when\noperational resilience constraints are violated. The proposed DAC scheme is\ncomputationally efficient (only algebraic computations), which enables fast,\nreal-time execution and demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed control\nframework on GridLAB-D-HELICS-based control-grid co-simulations on the IEEE\n123-node networked microgrid.

    "abstract": "Understanding non-human primate behavior is crucial for improving animal\nwelfare, modeling social behavior, and gaining insights into both distinctly\nhuman and shared behaviors. Despite recent advances in computer vision,\nautomated analysis of primate behavior remains challenging due to the\ncomplexity of their social interactions and the lack of specialized algorithms.\nExisting methods often struggle with the nuanced behaviors and frequent\nocclusions characteristic of primate social dynamics. This study aims to\ndevelop an effective method for automated detection, tracking, and recognition\nof chimpanzee behaviors in video footage. Here we show that our proposed\nmethod, AlphaChimp, an end-to-end approach that simultaneously detects\nchimpanzee positions and estimates behavior categories from videos,\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in behavior recognition. AlphaChimp\nachieves approximately 10% higher tracking accuracy and a 20% improvement in\nbehavior recognition compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly\nexcelling in the recognition of social behaviors. This superior performance\nstems from AlphaChimp's innovative architecture, which integrates temporal\nfeature fusion with a Transformer-based self-attention mechanism, enabling more\neffective capture and interpretation of complex social interactions among\nchimpanzees. Our approach bridges the gap between computer vision and\nprimatology, enhancing technical capabilities and deepening our understanding\nof primate communication and sociality. We release our code and models and hope\nthis will facilitate future research in animal social dynamics. This work\ncontributes to ethology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence,\noffering new perspectives on social intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Radio interferometry is an observational technique used to study\nastrophysical phenomena. Data gathered by an interferometer requires\nsubstantial processing before astronomers can extract the scientific\ninformation from it. Data processing consists of a sequence of calibration and\nanalysis procedures where choices must be made about the sequence of procedures\nas well as the specific configuration of the procedure itself. These choices\nare typically based on a combination of measurable data characteristics, an\nunderstanding of the instrument itself, an appreciation of the trade-offs\nbetween compute cost and accuracy, and a learned understanding of what is\nconsidered \"best practice\". A metric of absolute correctness is not always\navailable and validity is often subject to human judgment. The underlying\nprinciples and software configurations to discern a reasonable workflow for a\ngiven dataset is the subject of training workshops for students and scientists.\nOur goal is to use objective metrics that quantify best practice, and\nnumerically map out the decision space with respect to our metrics. With these\nobjective metrics we demonstrate an automated, data-driven, decision system\nthat is capable of sequencing the optimal action(s) for processing\ninterferometric data. This paper introduces a simplified description of the\nprinciples behind interferometry and the procedures required for data\nprocessing. We highlight the issues with current automation approaches and\npropose our ideas for solving these bottlenecks. A prototype is demonstrated\nand the results are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Cohort discovery is a crucial step in clinical research on Electronic Health\nRecord (EHR) data. Temporal queries, which are common in cohort discovery, can\nbe time-consuming and prone to errors when processed on large EHR datasets. In\nthis work, we introduce TELII, a temporal event level inverted indexing method\ndesigned for cohort discovery on large EHR datasets. TELII is engineered to\npre-compute and store the relations along with the time difference between\nevents, thereby providing fast and accurate temporal query capabilities. We\nimplemented TELII for the OPTUM de-identified COVID-19 EHR dataset, which\ncontains data from 8.87 million patients. We demonstrate four common temporal\nquery tasks and their implementation using TELII with a MongoDB backend. Our\nresults show that the temporal query speed for TELII is up to 2000 times faster\nthan that of existing non-temporal inverted indexes. TELII achieves\nmillisecond-level response times, enabling users to quickly explore event\nrelations and find preliminary evidence for their research questions. Not only\nis TELII practical and straightforward to implement, but it also offers easy\nadaptability to other EHR datasets. These advantages underscore TELII's\npotential to serve as the query engine for EHR-based applications, ensuring\nfast, accurate, and user-friendly query responses.",

The fluid flow is\nassumed to be single-phase. The hydraulic behaviour of fractures is represented\nthrough a double-nodes flow element, which allows to efficiently model\nlongitudinal and transversal fracture permeabilities. In addressing the\nmechanical subproblem, fractures are explicitly modelled using cohesive\nelements to account for contact, friction and opening phenomena. The nonlinear\nset of equations is solved implicitly through an iterative partitioned\nconjugate gradient procedure, extending its traditional application to\ncontinuous problems to those involving explicit discontinuities such as faults\nand fractures. The model's accuracy is verified against analytical solutions\nfor different geomechanical problems, notably for the growth of a frictional\nslip rupture along a fault due to fluid injection. Such a particularly\nchallenging benchmark for a critically stressed fault is here reproduced for\nthe first time by a finite-element based scheme.\n  The capabilities of the developed parallel solver are then illustrated\nthrough a scenario involving CO2 injection into a faulted aquifer.

    "abstract": "In an era marked by renewed interest in lunar exploration and the prospect of\nestablishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon, innovative approaches\nsupporting mission preparation and astronaut training are imperative. To this\nend, the advancements in Virtual Reality (VR) technology offer a promising\navenue to simulate and optimize future human missions to the Moon. Through VR\nsimulations, tests can be performed quickly, with different environment\nparameters and a human-centered perspective can be maintained throughout the\nexperiments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework that harnesses VR\nsimulations to replicate the challenges and opportunities of lunar exploration,\naiming to enhance astronaut readiness and mission success. Multiple\nenvironments with physical and visual characteristics that reflect those found\nin interesting Moon regions have been modeled and integrated into simulations\nbased on the Unity graphical engine. We exploit VR to allow the user to fully\nimmerse in the simulations and interact with assets in the same way as in real\ncontexts. Different scenarios have been replicated, from upcoming exploration\nmissions where it is possible to deploy scientific payloads, collect samples,\nand traverse the surrounding environment, to long-term habitation in a\nfuturistic lunar base, performing everyday activities. Moreover, our framework\nallows us to simulate human-robot collaboration and surveillance directly\ndisplaying sensor readings and scheduled tasks of autonomous agents which will\nbe part of future hybrid missions, leveraging the ROS2-Unity bridge. Thus, the\nentire project can be summarized as a desire to define cornerstones for\nhuman-machine design and interaction, astronaut training, and learning of\npotential weak points in the context of future lunar missions, through targeted\noperations in a variety of contexts as close to reality as possible.",

    "abstract": "The key to effective alignment lies in high-quality preference data. Recent\nresearch has focused on automated alignment, which involves developing\nalignment systems with minimal human intervention. However, prior research has\npredominantly focused on developing data generation methods, while insufficient\nattention has been paid to quality control mechanisms, which often produce\ninaccurate and unhelpful data, leading to unpredictable benefits during\niterative optimization. In this paper, we present Self-Steering Optimization\n($SSO$), an algorithm that autonomously generates high-quality preference data,\neliminating manual annotation requirements. $SSO$ employs a specialized\noptimization objective to build a data generator from the policy model itself,\nwhich is used to produce accurate and on-policy data. We demonstrate $SSO$'s\neffectiveness through comprehensive experiments on two series of models: Llama\n3 and Qwen 2. Our evaluation across diverse benchmarks shows that $SSO$\nconsistently outperforms baselines in human preference alignment and reward\noptimization. Further analysis validates $SSO$ as a scalable framework for\npreference optimization, benefiting the advancement in automated alignment\ntechniques.",

With newly found text versions of the guest star in 77 BCE, we\nnarrowed down the position given therein. Combined with a new analysis of\naccompanying divination text leads to the conclusion that this guest star was\nactually a comet.

We focus on tasks expressed through formal languages, such as\nmathematics and programming, where explicit reward functions can be programmed\nto automatically assess the quality of generated outputs.

    "abstract": "The growing use of naturalistic stimuli, such as feature films, brings\nresearch on emotions closer to ecologically valid settings within brain\nscanners, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Music is\nanother cultural artifact known to evoke emotions, and film soundtracks are\noften designed to enhance the emotional impact of the narrative. However, the\nneural basis of shared emotional perception during movie-watching, and its\nrelationship to the soundtrack, remains unclear. In this study, participants\nwatched Forrest Gump in a 3T fMRI scanner. The reported shared arousal and\nvalence (positive and negative) was correlated with the spectrogram and tempo\ninformation extracted from the soundtrack. For neuroimaging, four regions of\ninterest (ROIs) related to audiovisual input and narrative content were\nexamined: the superior temporal sulcus (STS), amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus,\nand precuneus. Results: Strong correlations between spectral and tempo, and\nemotional features (Bonferroni corr). BOLD responses associated with shared\npositive and negative valence and high-arousal moments were compared to film\nevents with low emotional agreement. Significant activations were found in the\nSTS and precuneus (pFWE < 0.05 peak level). No significant responses were\nobserved in the amygdala or inferior frontal gyrus, but whole-brain analysis\n(pFWE < 0.05 cluster extent) revealed frontal activity linked to negative\nvalence, alongside expected occipito-temporal lobe responses to the audiovisual\nstimuli. The STS and precuneus were particularly active during shared emotional\nperception of valenced and high-arousal events, with the precuneus encoding\nvalence from auditory information. Naturalistic stimuli show promise as\ndiagnostic and therapeutic tools for emotion regulation deficits although\nchallenges may arise when crafting an experimental control.",

There are several markers of CVD that are visible on brain\nimaging, including: white matter hyperintensities (WMH), acute and chronic\nischaemic stroke lesions (ISL), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS),\nacute and chronic haemorrhagic lesions, and cerebral microbleeds (CMB). Brain\natrophy also occurs in CVD. These markers are important for patient management\nand intervention, since they indicate elevated risk of future stroke and\ndementia. We systematically reviewed automated systems designed to support\nradiologists reporting on these CVD imaging findings. We considered\ncommercially available software and research publications which identify at\nleast two CVD markers. In total, we included 29 commercial products and 13\nresearch publications. Two distinct types of commercial support system were\navailable: those which identify acute stroke lesions (haemorrhagic and\nischaemic) from computed tomography (CT) scans, mainly for the purpose of\npatient triage; and those which measure WMH and atrophy regionally and\nlongitudinally. In research, WMH and ISL were the markers most frequently\nanalysed together, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; lacunes and PVS\nwere each targeted only twice and CMB only once. For stroke, commercially\navailable systems largely support the emergency setting, whilst research\nsystems consider also follow-up and routine scans. The systems to quantify WMH\nand atrophy are focused on neurodegenerative disease support, where these CVD\nmarkers are also of significance. There are currently no openly validated\nsystems, commercially, or in research, performing a comprehensive joint\nanalysis of all CVD markers (WMH, ISL, lacunes, PVS, haemorrhagic lesions, CMB,\nand atrophy).",

In vivo, $\\Delta$LW was approximately 1% in GM/WM, 5-20% for\ndifferent tumor types, and 40% in CSF. The resulting DS-DGE AUC maps clearly\noutlined lesion areas. Conclusions: DS-DGE MRI is highly promising for\nassessing D-glucose uptake. Initial results in brain tumor patients show\nhigh-quality AUC maps of glucose-induced line broadening and DGE-based lesion\nenhancement similar and/or complementary to PWI.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are a\npromising paradigm of heterogeneous network (HetNet), attributed to the\ncomplementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency.\nHowever, the current development of such HetNets is mostly bottlenecked by the\nexisting transmission control protocol (TCP), which restricts the user\nequipment (UE) to connecting one access point (AP) at a time. While the ongoing\ninvestigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, it\ncomplicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing\n(LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neural\nnetwork (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets,\nwhich results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a\ngraph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded as\nnode features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared to\nthe conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based model\nexhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network\ntopology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a single\ntrained model. Simulation results show that against the traditional\noptimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal\nthroughput within a gap of 11.5%, while reducing the inference time by 4 orders\nof magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, the new method can improve the\nnetwork throughput by up to 21.7%, at a similar inference time level.",

We find that it is only well\nconverged for simulation volumes in excess of $200^3$ Mpc$^3$. We report\nresults for simulations of varying feedback intensity, which either match the\nX-ray inferred gas fractions in clusters and the $z=0$ stellar mass function,\nor shifted versions of the data, as well as for different implementations of\nAGN feedback. We package our results in the form of a Gaussian process emulator\nwhich can rapidly reproduce all the simulations' predictions to better than one\nper cent up to the comoving wavenumber $k = 10~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and up to $z=3$\nfor all the feedback models present in the FLAMINGO suite. We find that the\nresponse becomes stronger, the range of scales affected increases, and the\nposition of the minimum of the response moves to smaller scales as the redshift\ndecreases. We find that lower gas fractions in groups and clusters lead to a\nstronger response and that the use of collimated jets instead of thermally\ndriven winds for AGN feedback enhances the effect. Lowering the stellar masses\nat fixed cluster gas fractions also increases the magnitude of the response. We\nfind only a small (1% at $k<10~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$) dependence of our results on the\nbackground cosmology, but a wider range of cosmology variations will be needed\nto confirm this result. The response we obtain for our strongest feedback\nmodels is compatible with some of the recent analyses combining weak lensing\nwith external data.

    "abstract": "Simulation is vital for engineering disciplines, as it enables the prediction\nand design of physical systems. However, the computational challenges inherent\nto large-scale simulations often arise from complex device models featuring\nhigh degrees of nonlinearities or hidden physical behaviors not captured by\nfirst principles. Gray-box models combine deep neural networks (DNNs) with\nphysics-based models to address the computational challenges in modeling\nphysical systems. A well-crafted gray box model capitalizes on the\ninterpretability and accuracy of a physical model while incorporating DNNs to\ncapture hidden physical behaviors and mitigate computational load associated\nwith highly nonlinear components. Previously, gray box models have been\nconstructed by defining an explicit combination of physics-based and DNN models\nto represent the behavior of sub-systems; however this cannot represent the\ncoupled interactions within physical systems. We explore an implicit gray box\nmodel, where both DNNs and physical equations share a common set of\nstate-variables. While this approach captures coupled interactions at the\nboundary of DNN and physics-based models, simulating the implicit gray box\nmodel remains an open-ended problem. In this work, we introduce a new hybrid\nsimulation that integrates DNNs into the numerical solvers of simulation\nengines to fully simulate implicit gray box models of large physical systems.\nThis is accomplished by backpropagating through the DNN to calculate Jacobian\nvalues during each iteration of the numerical method. The hybrid simulation\nimproves the accuracy and runtime compared to physics-based simulation and\nenables reusable DNN models with lower data requirements. We explore the\nadvantages of this approach as compared to physics-based, black box, and other\ngray box methods for simulating the steady-state and transient behavior of\npower systems.",

Using this black hole mass distribution we are then, with no\nfurther free parameters of the theory, able to reproduce exactly the peak X-ray\nluminosity distribution of the tidal disruption event population.

    "abstract": "How to incentivize self-interested agents to explore when they prefer to\nexploit? Consider a population of self-interested agents that make decisions\nunder uncertainty. They \"explore\" to acquire new information and \"exploit\" this\ninformation to make good decisions. Collectively they need to balance these two\nobjectives, but their incentives are skewed toward exploitation. This is\nbecause exploration is costly, but its benefits are spread over many agents in\nthe future.\n  \"Incentivized Exploration\" addresses this issue via strategic communication.\nConsider a benign ``principal\" which can communicate with the agents and make\nrecommendations, but cannot force the agents to comply. Moreover, suppose the\nprincipal can observe the agents' decisions and the outcomes of these\ndecisions. The goal is to design a communication and recommendation policy\nwhich (i) achieves a desirable balance between exploration and exploitation,\nand (ii) incentivizes the agents to follow recommendations. What makes it\nfeasible is \"information asymmetry\": the principal knows more than any one\nagent, as it collects information from many. It is essential that the principal\ndoes not fully reveal all its knowledge to the agents.\n  Incentivized exploration combines two important problems in, resp., machine\nlearning and theoretical economics. First, if agents always follow\nrecommendations, the principal faces a multi-armed bandit problem: essentially,\ndesign an algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation. Second,\ninteraction with a single agent corresponds to \"Bayesian persuasion\", where a\nprincipal leverages information asymmetry to convince an agent to take a\nparticular action. We provide a brief but self-contained introduction to each\nproblem through the lens of incentivized exploration, solving a key special\ncase of the former as a sub-problem of the latter.",

With a warming\nclimate, their impacts potentially intensify globally, but the Indian\nsubcontinent appears to be particularly vulnerable to such extreme events. In\nthis study, we use reanalysis and the adjoint of the atmospheric model, PlaSim,\nto identify drivers of heatwaves occurring April and May over north-central\nIndia. Reanalysis results suggest that the existence of high temperatures in\nthe study region is highly sensitive to the low local soil moisture which is\nobserved weeks before a heatwave commences. Soil moisture variability in\nnorthern India is influenced by moisture transport from the west during\nwinter--spring. Preceding dry soil moisture conditions can be associated with a\n`persistent jet' conditions linked to atmospheric dynamical changes in the\nNorth Atlantic region. An associated northward shift in the upper tropospheric\nzonal wind occurs approximately a month prior to the heatwaves, influencing the\narea and intensity of western disturbances embedded in the jet stream. This\nweakens the moisture flow from the north of the Arabian Sea, further reducing\nsoil moisture levels and creating conditions conducive to heatwaves. An adjoint\nsensitivity analysis and forward model perturbation experiments confirm the\ncausal relationships for the proposed heatwave development mechanism over\nnorth-central India, identifying the remote influence of North Atlantic sea\nsurface temperature variability on extreme temperatures in India. Our findings\nhighlight the complex interplay of local and remote factors in heatwave\ndevelopment over India.",

This study indicates that observational phantom dark energy also\nrequires an extended uncertainty principle (EUP) parameter with the opposite\nsign. Altering the signs of the GUP and EUP parameters without a physical\nrationale is questionable. We demonstrate that incorporating cosmological\nconstant in a modified uncertainty principle (MUP) can address the sign change\nin GUP and EUP within a unified framework. The main advantage of MUP is that\nthe sign change of the cosmological constant is acceptable and geometrically\nmeaningful. To achieve this, we first derive a modified equation of state from\nthe MUP framework and second test it with observational data for dark matter\nand dark energy. Importantly, the proposed MUP parameter, which is proportional\nto the cosmological constant with positive and negative signs, aligns with dark\nenergy observations and restores the Chandrasekhar limit for stars. Finally, we\nwill show that the Chandrasekhar mass limit provides an upper bound of \\(\\leq\n10^{-32}{\\rm m^{-2}}\\) for the cosmological constant, consistent with the\nobservational value of \\(\\Lambda_{\\rm obs}=10^{-52}{\\rm m^{-2}}\\).",

We find the\nminimum radius of the helium droplet that can host a given number of ions using\na model whose physical ingredients are the solvation energy of the cations,\ncalculated within the He-DFT approach, and their mutual Coulomb repulsion\nenergy. Our model goes beyond the often used liquid drop model, where charges\nare smeared out either within the droplet or on its surface, and which neglects\nthe solid-like helium shell around the ions. We find that below a threshold\ndroplet radius R_0, the total energy of the system becomes higher than that of\nthe separated system of the pristine helium droplet and the charges embedded in\ntheir solvation microcluster (\"snowball\"). However, the ions are still kept\nwithin the droplet by the presence of energy barriers which hinder Coulomb\nexplosion. A further reduction of the droplet radius below a value R_expl\neventually results in the disappearance of such barrier, leading to Coulomb\nexplosion. Surprisingly, our results are rather insensitive to the ion atomic\nspecies. This makes room to discuss them in the context of intrinsic\nmulticharged helium droplets, where the charges are triatomic He3+ ions.

Our study covers CLogB with reward functions satisfying two smoothness\nconditions, capturing application scenarios such as online content delivery,\nonline learning to rank, and dynamic channel allocation. We first propose a\nsimple yet efficient algorithm, CLogUCB, utilizing a variance-agnostic\nexploration bonus.

Consequently, density and surface tension gradients emerge within the\ndroplet and at the droplet-gas interface, giving rise to competing flows from,\nrespectively, the apex towards the contact line (thermal-buoyancy-driven flow)\nand the other way around (thermal Marangoni flow). In small droplets with a\ndiameter below the capillary length, the thermal Marangoni effects are expected\nto dominate over thermal buoyancy (\"thermal Rayleigh\") effects. However,\ncontrary to these theoretical predictions, our experiments mostly show a\ndominant circulation from the apex towards the contact line, indicating a\nprevailing of thermal Rayleigh convection. Furthermore, our experiments often\nshow an unexpected asymmetric flow that persisted for several minutes. We\nhypothesise that a tiny amount of contaminants, commonly encountered in\nexperiments with water/air interfaces, act as surfactants and counteract the\nthermal surface tension gradients at the interface and thereby promote the\ndominance of Rayleigh convection. Our finite element numerical simulations\ndemonstrate that, under our specified experimental conditions, a mere 0.5%\nreduction in the static surface tension caused by surfactants leads to a\nreversal in the flow direction, compared to the theoretical prediction without\ncontaminants. Additionally, we investigate the linear stability of the\naxisymmetric solutions, revealing that the presence of surfactants also affects\nthe axial symmetry of the flow.",

    "abstract": "Text sanitization, which employs differential privacy to replace sensitive\ntokens with new ones, represents a significant technique for privacy\nprotection. Typically, its performance in preserving privacy is evaluated by\nmeasuring the attack success rate (ASR) of reconstruction attacks, where\nattackers attempt to recover the original tokens from the sanitized ones.\nHowever, current reconstruction attacks on text sanitization are developed\nempirically, making it challenging to accurately assess the effectiveness of\nsanitization. In this paper, we aim to provide a more accurate evaluation of\nsanitization effectiveness. Inspired by the works of Palamidessi et al., we\nimplement theoretically optimal reconstruction attacks targeting text\nsanitization. We derive their bounds on ASR as benchmarks for evaluating\nsanitization performance. For real-world applications, we propose two practical\nreconstruction attacks based on these theoretical findings. Our experimental\nresults underscore the necessity of reassessing these overlooked risks.\nNotably, one of our attacks achieves a 46.4% improvement in ASR over the\nstate-of-the-art baseline, with a privacy budget of epsilon=4.0 on the SST-2\ndataset.

Follow-up optical\nobservations with the MMT Observatory ($i\\gtrsim 25.7$ mag (AB)) found no\nvisible host at the FRB position. Subsequent deeper observations with the GTC,\nhowever, revealed an extremely faint galaxy ($r=27.32 \\pm0.16$ mag), very\nlikely ($99.95 \\%$) associated with FRB 20190208A.

    "abstract": "The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding\ntheir safety. While many studies have focused on English, the safety of LLMs in\nArabic, with its linguistic and cultural complexities, remains under-explored.\nHere, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we present an\nArab-region-specific safety evaluation dataset consisting of 5,799 questions,\nincluding direct attacks, indirect attacks, and harmless requests with\nsensitive words, adapted to reflect the socio-cultural context of the Arab\nworld. To uncover the impact of different stances in handling sensitive and\ncontroversial topics, we propose a dual-perspective evaluation framework. It\nassesses the LLM responses from both governmental and opposition viewpoints.\nExperiments over five leading Arabic-centric and multilingual LLMs reveal\nsubstantial disparities in their safety performance. This reinforces the need\nfor culturally specific datasets to ensure the responsible deployment of LLMs.",

Given a fixed\ntree $T$ on $n$ vertices and an edge-colouring of the complete graph $K_n$, for\nevery colour, we find a copy of $T$ in $K_n$ where the number of edges in that\ncolour significantly exceeds its expected count in a uniformly random\nembedding. This resolves a problem posed by Erd\\H{o}s, F\\\"{u}redi, Loebl and\nS\\'{o}s by generalising their work from two to many colours. Furthermore, if\n$T$ has maximum degree $\\Delta\\leq\\epsilon n$ for sufficiently small $\\epsilon\n> 0$ and the edge-colouring of $K_n$ is both balanced and ``not too close'' to\none particular instance, we show that, for every colour, there is a copy of $T$\nin $K_n$ where that colour appears on linearly more edges than any other\ncolour. Several related examples are provided to demonstrate the necessity of\nthe introduced structural restrictions. Our proofs combine saturation arguments\nfor the existence of particular coloured substructures and analysis of\nconveniently defined local exchanges.\n  Using similar methods, we investigate the existence of copies of a graph $H$\nwith prescribed number of edges in each colour in $2$-edge-coloured dense host\ngraphs. In particular, for a graph $H$ with bounded maximum degree and balanced\n$2$-edge-colourings $\\mathbf{c}$ of a host graph $G$ with minimum degree at\nleast $(1-\\epsilon)n$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$, we show that, for any\nsufficiently large $n$ and sufficiently small $\\epsilon$, there exists a copy\nof $H$ where the number of edges in the two colours differ by at most $2$.\nMoreover, we completely characterise the pairs $(H,\\mathbf{c})$ for which the\ndifference of $2$ cannot be improved, refuting a conjecture by Mohr, Pardey,\nand Rautenbach.",

To address this challenge,\nresearchers commonly use feature distribution matching-based methods in\nunsupervised domain adaptation scenarios where some unlabeled target domain\ndata is available. However, these methods often have limited performance\nimprovement and lack generalization in various mismatch situations. In this\npaper, we propose Prototype and Instance Contrastive Learning (PICL), a novel\nmethod for unsupervised domain adaptation in speaker verification through\ndual-level contrastive learning. For prototype contrastive learning, we\ngenerate pseudo labels via clustering to create dynamically updated prototype\nrepresentations, aligning instances with their corresponding class or cluster\nprototypes. For instance contrastive learning, we minimize the distance between\ndifferent views or augmentations of the same instance, ensuring robust and\ninvariant representations resilient to variations like noise. This dual-level\napproach provides both high-level and low-level supervision, leading to\nimproved generalization and robustness of the speaker verification model.\nUnlike previous studies that only evaluated mismatches in one situation, we\nhave conducted relevant explorations on various datasets and achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance currently, which also proves the generalization of\nour method.",

    "abstract": "AI systems crucially rely on human ratings, but these ratings are often\naggregated, obscuring the inherent diversity of perspectives in real-world\nphenomenon. This is particularly concerning when evaluating the safety of\ngenerative AI, where perceptions and associated harms can vary significantly\nacross socio-cultural contexts. While recent research has studied the impact of\ndemographic differences on annotating text, there is limited understanding of\nhow these subjective variations affect multimodal safety in generative AI. To\naddress this, we conduct a large-scale study employing highly-parallel safety\nratings of about 1000 text-to-image (T2I) generations from a demographically\ndiverse rater pool of 630 raters balanced across 30 intersectional groups\nacross age, gender, and ethnicity. Our study shows that (1) there are\nsignificant differences across demographic groups (including intersectional\ngroups) on how severe they assess the harm to be, and that these differences\nvary across different types of safety violations, (2) the diverse rater pool\ncaptures annotation patterns that are substantially different from expert\nraters trained on specific set of safety policies, and (3) the differences we\nobserve in T2I safety are distinct from previously documented group level\ndifferences in text-based safety tasks. To further understand these varying\nperspectives, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the open-ended explanations\nprovided by raters. This analysis reveals core differences into the reasons why\ndifferent groups perceive harms in T2I generations. Our findings underscore the\ncritical need for incorporating diverse perspectives into safety evaluation of\ngenerative AI ensuring these systems are truly inclusive and reflect the values\nof all users.",

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\npotential in code generation tasks, they often encounter issues such as refusal\nto code or hallucination in geospatial code generation due to a lack of\ndomain-specific knowledge and code corpora. To address these challenges, this\npaper presents and open-sources the GeoCode-PT and GeoCode-SFT corpora, along\nwith the GeoCode-Eval evaluation dataset. Additionally, by leveraging QLoRA and\nLoRA for pretraining and fine-tuning, we introduce GeoCode-GPT-7B, the first\nLLM focused on geospatial code generation, fine-tuned from Code Llama-7B.\nFurthermore, we establish a comprehensive geospatial code evaluation framework,\nincorporating option matching, expert validation, and prompt engineering\nscoring for LLMs, and systematically evaluate GeoCode-GPT-7B using the\nGeoCode-Eval dataset. Experimental results show that GeoCode-GPT outperforms\nother models in multiple-choice accuracy by 9.1% to 32.1%, in code\nsummarization ability by 1.7% to 25.4%, and in code generation capability by\n1.2% to 25.1%.

The study of social creak has\nbeen previously conducted by combining perceptual evaluation of speech with\nconventional acoustical parameters such as the harmonic-to-noise ratio and\ncepstral peak prominence. In the current study, machine learning (ML) was used\nto automatically distinguish speech of low amount of social creak from speech\nof high amount of social creak.\n  Methods: The amount of creak in continuous speech samples produced in Finnish\nby 90 female speakers was first perceptually assessed by two voice specialists.\nBased on their assessments, the speech samples were divided into two categories\n(low $vs$. high amount of creak). Using the speech signals and their creak\nlabels, seven different ML models were trained. Three spectral representations\nwere used as feature for each model.\n  Results: The results show that the best performance (accuracy of 71.1\\%) was\nobtained by the following two systems: an Adaboost classifier using the\nmel-spectrogram feature and a decision tree classifier using the mel-frequency\ncepstral coefficient feature.\n  Conclusions: The study of social creak is becoming increasingly popular in\nsociolinguistic and vocological research. The conventional human perceptual\nassessment of the amount of creak is laborious and therefore ML technology\ncould be used to assist researchers studying social creak.

The Allen-Cahn system naturally arises in phase separation\nmodels, where solutions represent the distribution of distinct phases in a\nmulti-component mixture. As the temperature parameter approaches zero, the\nsystem's energy approximates the multi-isoperimetric profile, leading to\nsolutions concentrating in regions resembling isoperimetric clusters.

An additional challenge is that\nthe performance of consumer systems is often highly dependent on specific\nmonitor settings and firmware behavior. Here, we evaluate the performance of\nfour display systems: a consumer LCD gaming monitor, a consumer OLED gaming\nmonitor, a consumer OLED TV, and a VPixx PROPixx projector system. To allow the\nreader to assess the suitability of these systems for different experiments, we\npresent a range of different metrics: luminance behavior, luminance uniformity\nacross display surface, estimated gamma values and linearity, channel\nadditivity, channel dependency, color gamut, pixel response time, and pixel\nwaveform. In addition, we exhaustively report the monitor firmware settings\nused. Our analyses show that current consumer-level OLED display systems are\npromising, and adequate to fulfill the requirements of some critical vision\nscience experiments, allowing laboratories to run their experiments even\nwithout investing in high-quality professional display systems. For example,\nthe tested Asus OLED gaming monitor shows excellent response time, a sharp\nsquare waveform even at 240 Hz, a color gamut that covers 94% of DCI-P3 color\nspace, and the best luminance uniformity among all four tested systems, making\nit a favorable option on price-to-performance ratio.",

Unlike\nurban contexts, horticultural environments, characterized by their permeability\nto laser beams, result in sparse and overlapping LiDAR scans with suboptimal\ngeometries. This phenomenon leads to intra- and inter-row descriptor ambiguity.\nIn this work, we address this challenge by introducing SPVSoAP3D, a novel\nmodeling approach that combines a voxel-based feature extraction network with\nan aggregation technique based on a second-order average pooling operator,\ncomplemented by a descriptor enhancement stage. Furthermore, we augment the\nexisting HORTO-3DLM dataset by introducing two new sequences derived from\nhorticultural environments. We evaluate the performance of SPVSoAP3D against\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models, including OverlapTransformer, PointNetVLAD, and\nLOGG3D-Net, utilizing a cross-validation protocol on both the newly introduced\nsequences and the existing HORTO-3DLM dataset.

However, current studies on optical DCNs neglect the fundamental need\nfor accurate time synchronization. In this paper, we bridge the gap by\ndeveloping Nanosecond Optical Synchronization (NOS), the first\nnanosecond-precision synchronization solution for optical DCNs general to\nvarious optical hardware. NOS builds clock propagation trees on top of the\ndynamically reconfigured circuits in optical DCNs, allowing switches to seek\nbetter sync parents throughout time. It predicts drifts in the tree-building\nprocess, which enables minimization of sync errors. We also tailor today's sync\nprotocols to the needs of optical DCNs, including reducing the number of sync\nmessages to fit into short circuit durations and correcting timestamp errors\nfor higher sync accuracy.

Leveraging the\nhigh spatial resolution and sparsity of multi-path channels, DAM mitigates\ninter-symbol interference (ISI) effectively, by aligning all multi-path\ncomponents through a combination of delay pre/post-compensation and path-based\nbeamforming. As such, ISI is eliminated while preserving multi-path power\ngains. In this paper, we explore multi-user double-side DAM with both delay\npre-compensation at the transmitter and post-compensation at the receiver,\ncontrasting with prior one-side DAM that primarily focuses on delay\npre-compensation only. Firstly, we reveal the constraint for the introduced\ndelays and the delay pre/post-compensation vectors tailored for multi-user\ndouble-side DAM, given a specific number of delay pre/post-compensations.\nFurthermore, we show that as long as the number of base station (BS)/user\nequipment (UE) antennas is sufficiently large, single-side DAM, where delay\ncompensation is only performed at the BS/UE, is preferred than double-side DAM\nsince the former results in less ISI to be spatially eliminated. Next, we\npropose two low-complexity path-based beamforming strategies based on the\neigen-beamforming transmission and ISI-zero forcing (ZF) principles,\nrespectively, based on which the achievable sum rates are studied. Simulation\nresults verify that with sufficiently large BS/UE antennas, single-side DAM is\nsufficient.

The goal\nis to find a fair, i.e., envy-free up to any item (EFX) allocation. This model\nhas recently been introduced by Christodoulou et al. (EC'23) where they show\nthat EFX allocations always exist on simple graphs for monotone valuations,\ni.e., where any two agents can share at most one edge (item). A natural\nquestion arises as to what happens when we go beyond simple graphs and study\nvarious classes of multi-graphs?\n  We answer the above question affirmatively for the valuation class of\nbipartite multi-graphs and multi-cycles. Our main positive result is that EFX\nallocations on bipartite multi-graphs (and multi-cycles) always exist and can\nbe computed in polynomial time for additive valuations. We, therefore, push the\nfrontiers of our understanding of EFX allocations and expand the scenarios\nwhere they are known to exist for an arbitrary number of agents. Next, we study\nEFX orientations (i.e., allocations where every item is allocated to one of its\ntwo endpoint agents) and give a complete picture of when they exist for\nbipartite multi-graphs dependent on two parameters -- the number of edges\nshared between any two agents and the diameter of the graph. Finally, we prove\nthat it is NP-complete to determine whether a given fair division instance on a\nbipartite multi-graph admits an EFX orientation.",

    "abstract": "Road ponding, a prevalent traffic hazard, poses a serious threat to road\nsafety by causing vehicles to lose control and leading to accidents ranging\nfrom minor fender benders to severe collisions. Existing technologies struggle\nto accurately identify road ponding due to complex road textures and variable\nponding coloration influenced by reflection characteristics. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel approach called Self-Attention-based Global\nSaliency-Enhanced Network (AGSENet) for proactive road ponding detection and\ntraffic safety improvement. AGSENet incorporates saliency detection techniques\nthrough the Channel Saliency Information Focus (CSIF) and Spatial Saliency\nInformation Enhancement (SSIE) modules. The CSIF module, integrated into the\nencoder, employs self-attention to highlight similar features by fusing spatial\nand channel information. The SSIE module, embedded in the decoder, refines edge\nfeatures and reduces noise by leveraging correlations across different feature\nlevels. To ensure accurate and reliable evaluation, we corrected significant\nmislabeling and missing annotations in the Puddle-1000 dataset. Additionally,\nwe constructed the Foggy-Puddle and Night-Puddle datasets for road ponding\ndetection in low-light and foggy conditions, respectively. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that AGSENet outperforms existing methods, achieving IoU\nimprovements of 2.03\\%, 0.62\\%, and 1.06\\% on the Puddle-1000, Foggy-Puddle,\nand Night-Puddle datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art in this\nfield.

    "abstract": "The observed dust rings and gaps in protoplanetary disks could be imprints of\nforming planets. Even low-mass planets in the one-to-ten Earth-mass regime,\nthat do not yet carve deep gas gaps, can generate such dust rings and gaps by\ndriving a radially-outwards gas flow, as shown in previous work. However,\nunderstanding the creation and evolution of these dust structures is\nchallenging due to dust drift and diffusion, requiring an approach beyond\nprevious steady state models. Here we investigate the time evolution of the\ndust surface density influenced by the planet-induced gas flow, based on\npost-processing three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We find that\nplanets larger than a dimensionless thermal mass of $m=0.05$, corresponding to\n0.3 Earth mass at 1 au or 1.7 Earth masses at 10 au, generate dust rings and\ngaps, provided that solids have small Stokes numbers} (${\\rm\nSt}\\lesssim10^{-2}$) and that the disk midplane is weakly turbulent\n($\\alpha_{\\rm diff}\\lesssim10^{-4}$). As dust particles pile up outside the\norbit of the planet, the interior gap expands with time, when the advective\nflux dominates over diffusion. Dust gap depths range from a factor a few, to\nseveral orders of magnitude, depending on planet mass and the level of midplane\nparticle diffusion. We construct a semi-analytic model describing the width of\nthe dust ring and gap, and then compare it with the observational data. We find\nthat up to 65\\% of the observed wide-orbit gaps could be explained as resulting\nfrom the presence of a low-mass planet, assuming $\\alpha_{\\rm diff}=10^{-5}$\nand ${\\rm St}=10^{-3}$. However, it is more challenging to explain the observed\nwide rings, which in our model would require the presence of a population of\nsmall particles (${\\rm St=10^{-4}}$). Further work is needed to explore the\nrole of pebble fragmentation, planet migration, and the effect of multiple\nplanets.",

However, in\nreal-world scenarios, challenges such as motion blur and insufficient\nillumination often limit the performance of standard frame-based cameras in\ndelivering high-quality images. To address these limitations, we incorporate a\ntransmittance adjustment device at the hardware level, enabling event cameras\nto capture both motion and exposure events for diverse 3D reconstruction\nscenarios. Motion events (triggered by camera or object movement) are collected\nin fast-motion scenarios when the device is inactive, while exposure events\n(generated through controlled camera exposure) are captured during slower\nmotion to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and\noptimization of event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our framework\nsupports three modes: High-Quality Reconstruction using exposure events, Fast\nReconstruction relying on motion events, and Balanced Hybrid optimizing with\ninitial exposure events followed by high-speed motion events. On the EventNeRF\ndataset, we demonstrate that exposure events significantly improve fine detail\nreconstruction compared to motion events and outperform frame-based cameras\nunder challenging conditions such as low illumination and overexposure.\nFurthermore, we introduce EME-3D, a real-world 3D dataset with exposure events,\nmotion events, camera calibration parameters, and sparse point clouds. Our\nmethod achieves faster and higher-quality reconstruction than event-based NeRF\nand is more cost-effective than methods combining event and RGB data. E-3DGS\nsets a new benchmark for event-based 3D reconstruction with robust performance\nin challenging conditions and lower hardware demands.

    "abstract": "Wrinkling is the phenomenon of out-of-plane deformation patterns in thin\nwalled structures, as a result of a local compressive (internal) loads in\ncombination with a large membrane stiffness and a small but non-zero bending\nstiffness. Numerical modelling typically involves thin shell formulations. As\nthe mesh resolution depends on the wrinkle wave lengths, the analysis can\nbecome computationally expensive for shorter ones. Implicitly modeling the\nwrinkles using a modified kinematic or constitutive relationship based on a\ntaut, slack or wrinkled state derived from a so-called tension field, a\nsimplification is introduced in order to reduce computational efforts. However,\nthis model was restricted to linear elastic material models in previous works.\nAiming to develop an implicit isogeometric wrinkling model for large strain and\nhyperelastic material applications, a modified deformation gradient has been\nassumed, which can be used for any strain energy density formulation. The model\nis an extension of a previously published model for linear elastic material\nbehaviour and is generalized to other types of discretisation as well. The\nextension for hyperelastic materials requires the derivative of the material\ntensor, which can be computed numerically or derived analytically. The\npresented model relies on a combination of dynamic relaxation and a\nNewton-Raphson solver, because of divergence in early Newton-Raphson iterations\nas a result of a changing tension field, which is not included in the stress\ntensor variation. Using four benchmarks, the model performance is evaluated.\nConvergence with the expected order for Newton-Raphson iterations has been\nobserved, provided a fixed tension field. The model accurately approximates the\nmean surface of a wrinkled membrane with a reduced number of degrees of freedom\nin comparison to a shell solution.",

As a natural supercontinuum source of light,\nfree electrons couple with phonons, plasmons, electron-hole pairs, inter- and\nintra-band transitions, and inner-shell ionization. The multiple excitations,\nintertwined with the intricate nature of nanostructured samples, present\nsignificant challenges in isolating specific spectral characteristics amidst\ncomplex experimental backgrounds. Here we introduce the approach of synthetic\ncomplex frequency waves to mitigate these challenges in free-electron--light\ninteraction. The complex frequency waves, created through causality-informed\ncoherent superposition of real-frequency waves induced by free electrons, offer\nvirtual gain to offset material losses. This amplifies and enhances spectral\nfeatures, as confirmed by our electron energy loss and cathodoluminescence\nmeasurements on multi-layer membranes, suspended nanoparticles, and\nfilm-coupled nanostructures. Strikingly, we reveal that our approach can\nretrieve resonance excitation completely buried underneath the zero-loss peak,\nsubstantially enhance the quality of hyperspectral imaging, and resolve\nentangled multiple-photon-electron events in their quantum interaction. Our\nfindings indicate the versatile utility of complex frequency waves in various\nelectron-beam spectroscopy and their promising diagnostic capabilities in\nfree-electron quantum optics.",

Transient sky astronomy is entering a new era with the advent of the\nSVOM mission (Space Variable Objects Monitor), which was successfully launched\non the 26th of June, 2024.

Mounted on the\nrobotic telescope COLIBRI, it will be a unique instrument, able to perform fast\nfollow-up of GRB afterglows in J and H bands, an ideal combination to catch\nhigh-redshift (z>6) and/or obscured GRBs.\n  Aims. This paper aims at estimating the performances of CAGIRE for GRB\nnear-infrared afterglow detection based on the characteristics of the detector\nand the specificities of the COLIBRI telescope. Quickly fading GRB afterglows\npose challenges that should be addressed by adapting observing strategies to\nthe capabilities of CAGIRE.\n  Methods. We use an end-to-end image simulator to produce realistic CAGIRE\nimages, taking into account results from the characterization of the ALFA\ndetector used by CAGIRE. We implemented a GRB afterglow generator that\nsimulates infrared lightcurves and spectra based on published observation of\ndistant GRBs (z>6).\n  Results. We retrieved the photometry of 9 GRB afterglows in various scenarios\ncovered by CAGIRE. Catching afterglows as early as two minutes after burst\nallows the identification of a nIR counterpart in the brightest 4 events. When\nartificially redshifted even further away, these events remain detectable by\nCAGIRE up to z=9.6 in J band, and z=13.3 in H band, indicating the potential of\nCAGIRE to be a pioneer in the identification of the most distant GRBs to date.",

We introduce a layered GS\nrepresentation, incrementally including different anatomical structures while\nminimizing overlap and extending the GS training to remove inactive Gaussians.\nWe further compress the created model with clustering across layers.\n  Our approach achieves interactive frame rates while preserving anatomical\nstructures, with quality adjustable to the target hardware. Compared to\nstandard GS, our representation retains some of the explorative qualities\ninitially enabled by immersive path tracing. Selective activation and clipping\nof layers are possible at rendering time, adding a degree of interactivity to\notherwise static GS models. This could enable scenarios where high\ncomputational demands would otherwise prohibit using path-traced medical\nvolumes.",

    "abstract": "Unlike professional Business-to-Consumer (B2C) e-commerce platforms (e.g.,\nAmazon), Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) platforms (e.g., Facebook marketplace) are\nmainly targeting individual sellers who usually lack sufficient experience in\ne-commerce. Individual sellers often struggle to compose proper descriptions\nfor selling products. With the recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs), we attempt to integrate such state-of-the-art generative AI\ntechnologies into the product listing process. To this end, we develop IPL, an\nIntelligent Product Listing tool tailored to generate descriptions using\nvarious product attributes such as category, brand, color, condition, etc. IPL\nenables users to compose product descriptions by merely uploading photos of the\nselling product. More importantly, it can imitate the content style of our C2C\nplatform Xianyu. This is achieved by employing domain-specific instruction\ntuning on MLLMs and adopting the multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) process. A comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that the\nunderlying model of IPL significantly outperforms the base model in\ndomain-specific tasks while producing less hallucination. IPL has been\nsuccessfully deployed in our production system, where 72% of users have their\npublished product listings based on the generated content, and those product\nlistings are shown to have a quality score 5.6% higher than those without AI\nassistance.",

This is based on the hypothesis that\nthe ancient clumps were able to retain iron-enriched supernova ejecta, later\ngiving rise to younger and more metal-rich populations. Aims. A way to\ninvestigate this scenario is reconstructing their star formation histories\n(SFHs) and proving a prolonged and multi-episode star formation activity.\nMethods. Leveraging ground- and space-based high-resolution images, we derived\nthe SFH of Terzan 5 by employing the color-magnitude diagram fitting routine\nSFERA. Results. The best-fit solution predicts an old, main peak occurred\nbetween 12 and 13 Gyr ago that generated 70 % of the current stellar mass,\nfollowed by a lower-rate star formation activity with two main additional\nbursts. Conclusions. These results indicate that Terzan 5, similarly to Liller\n1, experienced a prolonged, multiepisode star formation activity, fueled by\nmetal-enriched gas deposited in its central regions, in agreement with the\nexpectations of a self-enrichment scenario in a primordial massive clump.",

Treatment outcomes are\ntherefore significantly impacted by the optimization of therapeutic scheduling.\nPrevious preclinical research has suggested scheduling bevacizumab in sequence\nwith combination antiproliferatives could significantly improve clinical\noutcomes. Mathematical modeling is a well-suited tool for investigating this\nproposed scheduling modification. To address this critical need, individual\npatient tumor data from 11 clinical trials in NSCLC has been collated and used\nto develop a semi-mechanistic model of NSCLC growth and response to the various\ntherapeutics represented in those trials. Precise estimates of clinical\nparameters fundamental to cancer modeling have been produced - such as the rate\nof acquired resistance to various pharmaceuticals, the relationship between\ndrug concentration and cancer cell death, as well as the fine temporal dynamics\nof vascular remodeling in response to bevacizumab. In a reserved portion of the\ndataset, this model was used to predict the efficacy of individual treatment\ntime courses with a mean error rate of 59.7% after a single tumor measurement\nand 11.7% after three successive tumor measurements. A delay of 9.6 hours\nbetween pemetrexed-cisplatin and bevacizumab administration is predicted to\noptimize the benefit of sequential administration. At this gap, approximately\n93.5% of simulated patients benefited from a gap in sequential administration\ncompared with concomitant administration. Of those simulated patients, the mean\nimprovement in tumor reduction was 20.7%. This result suggests that scheduling\na modest gap between the administration of bevacizumab and its partner\nantiproliferatives could meaningfully improve patient outcomes in NSCLC.",

For this study, a new theoretical approach is developed on the\nbasis of the Glauber model modified for taking into account the energy and\nmomentum conservation laws. In this approach, the longitudinal momentum of the\nmost neutron rich nuclei, $^{10}$Be, $^9$Li, $^8$He, produced in a few neutron\nremoval reactions in the $^{11}$B fragmentation in the Be target at a beam\nenergy of 35 $A\\cdot$MeV are calculated. The region of applicability of the new\napproach is discussed. This approach gives the asymmetric longitudinal momentum\ndistributions at low energies, and the asymmetry is defined by the kinematical\nlocus and geometry of the reaction (central of peripheral reactions). We\nanalyze the changes of the phase volume and the longitudinal momentum\ndistributions with the beam energy and number of the removed nucleons. The\nresults of the calculations are compared to the parametrizations widely used\nfor estimates of nuclear production in fragmentation for planning of nuclear\nexperiments.",

Successive bursting events produce next\ngenerations of daughter droplets, gradually diminishing in size until the\nentire volume of oil rests atop the water-air interface. In this work, we\ndemonstrate two different ways to modulate this process by modifying the\nconstitution of the drop. Firstly, we introduce hydrophilic clay particles\ninside the parent oil drop and show that it arrests the cascade of daughter\ndroplet generation preventing it from floating over the water-air interface.\nSecondly, we show that bursting behavior can be modified by a compound\nwater-oil-air interface made of a film of oil with finite thickness and design\na regime map which displays each of these outcomes. We underpin both of these\ndemonstrations by theoretical arguments providing criteria to predict outcomes\nresulting therein. Lastly, all our scenarios have a direct relation to control\nof oil-water separation and stability of emulsified solutions in a wide variety\nof applications which include drug delivery, enhanced oil recovery, oil spills\nand food processing where a dispersed oil phase tries to separate from a\ncontinuous phase.",

However, reaching a desired approximation accuracy without prior\ninformation about the behavior of the nonlinear systems remains a challenge in\nthe function approximation and control literature. As the name suggests, PWA\napproximation aims at approximating a nonlinear function or system by dividing\nthe domain into multiple subregions where the nonlinear function or dynamics is\napproximated locally by an affine function also called local mode. Without\nprior knowledge of the form of the nonlinearity, the required number of modes,\nthe locations of the subregions, and the local approximations need to be\noptimized simultaneously, which becomes highly complex for large-scale systems\nwith multi-dimensional nonlinear functions. This paper introduces a novel\napproach for PWA approximation of multi-dimensional nonlinear systems,\nutilizing a hinging hyperplane formalism for cut-based partitioning of the\ndomain. The complexity of the PWA approximation is iteratively increased until\nreaching the desired accuracy level. Further, the tractable cut definitions\nallow for different forms of subregions, as well as the ability to impose\ncontinuity constraints on the PWA approximation. The methodology is explained\nvia multiple examples and its performance is compared to two existing\napproaches through case studies, showcasing its efficacy.",

In this paper, a physical law embedded generative cloud\nsynthesis method (PGCS) is proposed to generate diverse realistic cloud images\nto enhance real data and promote the development of algorithms for subsequent\ntasks, such as cloud correction, cloud detection, and data augmentation for\nclassification, recognition, and segmentation.

In the spectral synthesis phase, the atmospheric scattering law is\nembedded through a local statistics and global fitting method, converting the\nsingle-channel clouds into multi-spectral clouds. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that PGCS achieves a high accuracy in both phases and performs\nbetter than three other existing cloud synthesis methods. Two cloud correction\nmethods are developed from PGCS and exhibits a superior performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods in the cloud correction task.

However, most of the existing advanced methods use\nLoRA to fine-tune Transformer, and there are few studies on using LoRA to\nfine-tune CNN. The CNN model is widely deployed on IoT devices for application\ndue to its advantages in comprehensive resource occupancy and performance.\nMoreover, IoT devices are widely deployed outdoors and usually process data\naffected by the environment (such as fog, snow, rain, etc.). The goal of this\npaper is to use LoRA technology to efficiently improve the robustness of the\nCNN model. To this end, this paper first proposes a strong, robust CNN\nfine-tuning method for IoT devices, LoRA-C, which performs low-rank\ndecomposition in convolutional layers rather than kernel units to reduce the\nnumber of fine-tuning parameters. Then, this paper analyzes two different rank\nsettings in detail and observes that the best performance is usually achieved\nwhen ${\\alpha}/{r}$ is a constant in either standard data or corrupted data.\nThis discovery provides experience for the widespread application of LoRA-C.\nFinally, this paper conducts many experiments based on pre-trained models.\nExperimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10-C, and Icons50 datasets\nshow that the proposed LoRA-Cs outperforms standard ResNets. Specifically, on\nthe CIFAR-10-C dataset, the accuracy of LoRA-C-ResNet-101 achieves 83.44%\naccuracy, surpassing the standard ResNet-101 result by +9.5%.",

Addressing the core question, \"Can COS be effectively achieved in a\nzero-shot manner without manual annotations for any camouflaged object?\" we\naffirmatively respond and introduce a robust zero-shot COS framework. This\nframework leverages the inherent local pattern bias of COS and employs a broad\nsemantic feature space derived from salient object segmentation (SOS) for\nefficient zero-shot transfer. We incorporate an Masked Image Modeling (MIM)\nbased image encoder optimized for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (M-LLM), and a Multi-scale Fine-grained\nAlignment (MFA) mechanism. The MIM pre-trained image encoder focuses on\ncapturing essential low-level features, while the M-LLM generates caption\nembeddings processed alongside these visual cues. These embeddings are\nprecisely aligned using MFA, enabling our framework to accurately interpret and\nnavigate complex semantic contexts. To optimize operational efficiency, we\nintroduce a learnable codebook that represents the M-LLM during inference,\nsignificantly reducing computational overhead. Our framework demonstrates its\nversatility and efficacy through rigorous experimentation, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in zero-shot COS with $F_{\\beta}^w$ scores of\n72.9\\% on CAMO and 71.7\\% on COD10K.

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that spatial information can be used to learn\ninterpretable representations in medical images using Self-Supervised Learning\n(SSL). Our proposed method, ISImed, is based on the observation that medical\nimages exhibit a much lower variability among different images compared to\nclassic data vision benchmarks. By leveraging this resemblance of human body\nstructures across multiple images, we establish a self-supervised objective\nthat creates a latent representation capable of capturing its location in the\nphysical realm. More specifically, our method involves sampling image crops and\ncreating a distance matrix that compares the learned representation vectors of\nall possible combinations of these crops to the true distance between them. The\nintuition is, that the learned latent space is a positional encoding for a\ngiven image crop. We hypothesize, that by learning these positional encodings,\ncomprehensive image representations have to be generated. To test this\nhypothesis and evaluate our method, we compare our learned representation with\ntwo state-of-the-art SSL benchmarking methods on two publicly available medical\nimaging datasets. We show that our method can efficiently learn representations\nthat capture the underlying structure of the data and can be used to transfer\nto a downstream classification task.",

However, these models require\nsubstantial computing resources because of the multi-step denoising process\nduring inference. While traditional pruning methods have been employed to\noptimize these models, the retraining process necessitates large-scale training\ndatasets and extensive computational costs to maintain generalization ability,\nmaking it neither convenient nor efficient. Recent studies attempt to utilize\nthe similarity of features across adjacent denoising stages to reduce\ncomputational costs through simple and static strategies. However, these\nstrategies cannot fully harness the potential of the similar feature patterns\nacross adjacent timesteps. In this work, we propose a novel pruning method that\nderives an efficient diffusion model via a more intelligent and differentiable\npruner. At the core of our approach is casting the model pruning process into a\nSubNet search process. Specifically, we first introduce a SuperNet based on\nstandard diffusion via adding some backup connections built upon the similar\nfeatures. We then construct a plugin pruner network and design optimization\nlosses to identify redundant computation. Finally, our method can identify an\noptimal SubNet through few-step gradient optimization and a simple\npost-processing procedure.

    "abstract": "In business process simulation, resource availability is typically modeled by\nassigning a calendar to each resource, e.g., Monday-Friday, 9:00-18:00.\nResources are assumed to be always available during each time slot in their\navailability calendar. This assumption often becomes invalid due to\ninterruptions, breaks, or time-sharing across processes. In other words,\nexisting approaches fail to capture intermittent availability. Another\nlimitation of existing approaches is that they either do not consider\nmultitasking behavior, or if they do, they assume that resources always\nmultitask (up to a maximum capacity) whenever available. However, studies have\nshown that the multitasking patterns vary across days. This paper introduces a\nprobabilistic approach to model resource availability and multitasking behavior\nfor business process simulation. In this approach, each time slot in a resource\ncalendar has an associated availability probability and a multitasking\nprobability per multitasking level. For example, a resource may be available on\nFridays between 14:00-15:00 with 90\\% probability, and given that they are\nperforming one task during this slot, they may take on a second concurrent task\nwith 60\\% probability. We propose algorithms to discover probabilistic\ncalendars and probabilistic multitasking capacities from event logs. An\nevaluation shows that, with these enhancements, simulation models discovered\nfrom event logs better replicate the distribution of activities and cycle\ntimes, relative to approaches with crisp calendars and monotasking assumptions.",

Within these models, however, there is a notable gap\nin the study of social hysteresis, a concept crucial to understanding the\ndelayed responses of societies to the rapid changes of the modern world. This\nresearch aims to fill this gap by examining the impact of cognitive dissonance\non social hysteresis through an updated model of expressed and private opinions\n(EPOs). We study the model both analytically and through Monte Carlo\nsimulations. To facilitate understanding and replication of our model, and to\nprovide a resource for further exploration to a diverse interdisciplinary\naudience, we have made the special NetLogo implementation of the model publicly\navailable at GitHub. By incorporating a cognitive dissonance mitigation\nmechanism into an agent-based q-voter-type model of Expressed and Private\nOpinions (EPOs), we demonstrate that this mechanism induces social hysteresis.\nConsequently, we argue that refraining from rationalizing publicly expressed\nopinions could mitigate social hysteresis and facilitate consensus, offering\ninsights into potential strategies for managing societal responses to change.",

Scaling the identified parameters by a\nsmall constant improves a pretrained or instruction-tuned LLM's performance by\n4-17% on GSM8K and 5-35% on MATH while leaving non-math behavior unaltered.\nMathNeuro is also data efficient: most of its effectiveness holds when\nidentifying math-specific parameters using a single sample.

However, they are notoriously inefficient to update. As analytical\napplications are increasingly fused with transactional applications, leading to\nthe emergence of hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP), it is\ndesirable that bitmap indexes support efficient concurrent real-time updates.\nIn this paper, we propose Concurrent Updatable Bitmap indexing (CUBIT) that\noffers efficient real-time updates that scale with the number of CPU cores used\nand do not interfere with queries. Our design relies on three principles.\nFirst, we employ a horizontal bitwise representation of updated bits, which\nenables efficient atomic updates without locking entire bitvectors. Second, we\npropose a lightweight snapshotting mechanism that allows queries (including\nrange queries) to run on separate snapshots and provides a wait-free progress\nguarantee. Third, we consolidate updates in a latch-free manner, providing a\nstrong progress guarantee. Our evaluation shows that CUBIT offers 3x - 16x\nhigher throughput and 3x - 220x lower latency than state-of-the-art updatable\nbitmap indexes.\n  CUBIT's update-friendly nature widens the applicability of bitmap indexing.\nExperimenting with OLAP workloads with standard, batched updates shows that\nCUBIT overcomes the maintenance downtime and outperforms DuckDB by 1.2x - 2.7x\non TPC-H.

This demonstratively improves the ability to quantize by\nincreasing the mathematical notion of coherence, resulting in fewer weight\noutliers without affecting the network output. In this work, we aim to further\nexploit this spherical geometry of the weights when performing quantization by\nconsidering Pyramid Vector Quantization (PVQ) for large language models.\nArranging points evenly on the sphere is notoriously difficult, especially in\nhigh dimensions, and in case approximate solutions exists, representing points\nexplicitly in a codebook is typically not feasible due to its additional memory\ncost. Instead, PVQ uses a fixed integer lattice on the sphere by projecting\npoints onto the 1-sphere, which allows for efficient encoding and decoding\nwithout requiring an explicit codebook in memory. To obtain a practical\nalgorithm, we propose to combine PVQ with scale quantization for which we\nderive theoretically optimal quantizations, under empirically verified\nassumptions. Further, we extend pyramid vector quantization to use Hessian\ninformation to minimize quantization error under expected feature activations,\ninstead of only relying on weight magnitudes. Experimentally, we achieves\nstate-of-the-art quantization performance with pareto-optimal trade-off between\nperformance and bits per weight and bits per activation, compared to compared\nmethods.

A common\napproach to managing hierarchical tasks is Hierarchical Quadratic Programming\n(HQP), which, however, cannot be directly applied to human interaction due to\nits allowance of arbitrary velocity direction adjustments. To resolve this\nlimitation, we introduce the concept of directional constraints and develop a\ndirection-constrained optimization algorithm to handle the nonlinearities\ninduced by these constraints. The algorithm solves two sub-problems, minimizing\nthe error and minimizing the deviation angle, in parallel, and combines the\nresults of the two sub-problems to produce a final optimal outcome. The mutual\ninfluence between these two sub-problems is analyzed to determine the best\nparameter for combination. Additionally, the velocity objective in our control\nframework is computed using a variable admittance controller. Traditional\nadmittance control does not account for constraints. To address this issue, we\npropose a variable admittance control method to adjust control objectives\ndynamically. The method helps reduce the deviation between robot velocity and\nhuman intention at the constraint boundaries, thereby enhancing interaction\nefficiency. We evaluate the proposed method in scenarios where a human operator\nphysically interacts with a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic arm. The results\nhighlight the importance of incorporating directional constraints in pHRI for\nhierarchical tasks.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high\nreasoning capabilities, drawing attention for their applications as agents in\nvarious decision-making processes. One notably promising application of LLM\nagents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can\ngenerate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial\nflexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face\nchallenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different\nenvironments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches\ntypically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific\npolicy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating\ncode actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when\nconfronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the\ngeneralizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves\nthe retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source\nenvironments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's\nadaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights\nfrom multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental\nconstraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic\nmanipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic\nmanipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources\nto solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the\nadaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across\ndiverse environments.",

    "abstract": "There are already many DNA large language models, but most of them still\nfollow traditional uses, such as extracting sequence features for\nclassification tasks. More innovative applications of large language models,\nsuch as prompt engineering, RAG, and zero-shot or few-shot prediction, remain\nchallenging for DNA-based models. The key issue lies in the fact that DNA\nmodels and human natural language models are entirely separate; however,\ntechniques like prompt engineering require the use of natural language, thereby\nsignificantly limiting the application of DNA large language models. This paper\nintroduces a pre-trained model trained on the GPT-2 network, combining DNA\nsequences and English text, and uses a unified BPE tokenization method. We then\nconvert classification and other downstream tasks into Alpaca format\ninstruction data, and perform instruction fine-tuning on this pre-trained model\nto create a fine-tuned model capable of handling multiple tasks. The model has\ndemonstrated its effectiveness in DNA related zero-shot prediction and\nmultitask application. This research provides a highly promising direction for\nbuilding a unified DNA sequence task framework.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a weak ergodicity-breaking\nphenomenon that defies the common scenario of thermalization in closed quantum\nsystems. They are often regarded as a many-body analog of quantum scars (QS) --\na single-particle phenomenon in quantum chaos -- due to their superficial\nsimilarities. However, unlike QS, a clear connection between QMBS and classical\nchaos has remained elusive. It has nevertheless been speculated that in an\nappropriate semiclassical limit, QMBS should have a correspondence to weakly\nunstable periodic orbits. In this paper, I present a counterexample to this\nconjecture by studying a bosonic model with a large number of flavors. The\ndynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) suggest that QMBS do not\ndisplay chaotic behavior in the semiclassical limit. In contrast, chaotic\ndynamics are expected for initial states not associated with QMBS.\nInterestingly, the anomalous OTOC dynamics persist even under weak\nperturbations that eliminate the scarred eigenstates, suggesting a certain\nrobustness in the phenomenon.",

However, the severe intrinsic variations of stochastic P-Bit\ndevices hinder the large-scale expansion of the P-Bit array, significantly\nlimiting the practical usage of Ising computation. In this work, a behavioral\nmodel which attributes P-Bit variations to two parameters {\\alpha} and\n{\\Delta}V is proposed. Then the weight compensation method is introduced, which\ncan mitigate {\\alpha} and {\\Delta}V of P-Bits device variations by rederiving\nthe weight matrix, enabling them to compute as ideal identical PBits without\nthe need for weights retraining. Accurately extracting the {\\alpha} and\n{\\Delta}V simultaneously from a large P-Bit array which is prerequisite for the\nweight compensation method is a crucial and challenging task. To solve this\nobstacle, we present the novel automatic variation extraction algorithm which\ncan extract device variations of each P-Bit in a large array based on Boltzmann\nmachine learning. In order for the accurate extraction of variations from an\nextendable P-Bit array, an Ising Hamiltonian based on 3D ferromagnetic model is\nconstructed, achieving precise and scalable array variation extraction. The\nproposed Automatic Extraction and Compensation algorithm is utilized to solve\nboth 16-city traveling salesman problem(TSP) and 21-bit integer factorization\non a large P-Bit array with variation, demonstrating its accuracy,\ntransferability, and scalability.",

Here, we propose a\nswitchable NHSE in a topolectrical (TE) set-up which can be turned on or off\nsimply by varying the driving frequency without any modification to the\nphysical circuit. Specifically, we consider a coupled system consisting of two\nnon-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson chains where each node of one chain is connected to\nneighboring node of the other chain via resistive couplings with opposite signs\nfor the two coupling directions. Interestingly, the NHSE is switched on only if\nthe driving frequency is greater than a certain critical frequency. Conversely,\nthe NHSE in the coupled system is switched off when the frequency falls below\nthe critical value, even though the individual uncoupled chains still exhibit\nthe NHSE. This frequency-controlled NHSE may pave the way for many possible\napplications including non-Hermitian sensors where the driving frequency can\nmanipulate the current and voltage localization.",

    "abstract": "Finding clusters of data points with similar characteristics and generating\nnew cluster-specific samples can significantly enhance our understanding of\ncomplex data distributions. While clustering has been widely explored using\nVariational Autoencoders, these models often lack generation quality in\nreal-world datasets. This paper addresses this gap by introducing\nTreeDiffusion, a deep generative model that conditions Diffusion Models on\nhierarchical clusters to obtain high-quality, cluster-specific generations. The\nproposed pipeline consists of two steps: a VAE-based clustering model that\nlearns the hierarchical structure of the data, and a conditional diffusion\nmodel that generates realistic images for each cluster. We propose this\ntwo-stage process to ensure that the generated samples remain representative of\ntheir respective clusters and enhance image fidelity to the level of diffusion\nmodels. A key strength of our method is its ability to create images for each\ncluster, providing better visualization of the learned representations by the\nclustering model, as demonstrated through qualitative results. This method\neffectively addresses the generative limitations of VAE-based approaches while\npreserving their clustering performance. Empirically, we demonstrate that\nconditioning diffusion models on hierarchical clusters significantly enhances\ngenerative performance, thereby advancing the state of generative clustering\nmodels.",

Antiferromagnets offer a\npromising platform for seeking such approaches due to their exceptional\nfeatures: low power consumption and possible high integration density are\ndesirable for information storage and processing or applications in\nunconventional computing. Among antiferromagnets, CuMnAs stands out for\natomic-level scalable magnetic textures, analogue multilevel storage\ncapability, and the magnetic state's control by a single electrical or\nfemtosecond laser pulse. Using a pair of excitation laser pulses, this work\nexamines synaptic and neuronal functionalities of CuMnAs for information\nprocessing, readily incorporating two principles of distinct characteristic\ntimescales. Laser-induced transient heat dynamics at sub-nanosecond times\nrepresents the short-term memory and causes resistance switching due to\nquenching into a magnetically fragmented state. This quench switching,\ndetectable electrically from ultrashort times to hours after writing,\nreminisces the long-term memory. The versatility of the principles' combination\nis demonstrated by operations commonly used in neural networks. Temporal\nlatency coding, fundamental to spiking neural networks, is utilized to encode\ndata from a grayscale image into sub-nanosecond pulse delays. Applying input\nlaser pulses with distinct amplitudes then allows for pulse-pattern\nrecognition. The results open pathways for designing novel computing\narchitectures.",

    "abstract": "Capsule Networks outperform Convolutional Neural Networks in learning the\npart-whole relationships with viewpoint invariance, and the credit goes to\ntheir multidimensional capsules. It was assumed that increasing the number of\ncapsule layers in the capsule networks would enhance the model performance.\nHowever, recent studies found that Capsule Networks lack scalability due to\nvanishing activations in the capsules of deeper layers. This paper thoroughly\ninvestigates the vanishing activation problem in deep Capsule Networks. To\nanalyze this issue and understand how increasing capsule dimensions can\nfacilitate deeper networks, various Capsule Network models are constructed and\nevaluated with different numbers of capsules, capsule dimensions, and\nintermediate layers for this paper. Unlike traditional model pruning, which\nreduces the number of model parameters and expedites model training, this study\nuses pruning to mitigate the vanishing activations in the deeper capsule\nlayers. In addition, the backbone network and capsule layers are pruned with\ndifferent pruning ratios to reduce the number of inactive capsules and achieve\nbetter model accuracy than the unpruned models.",

    "abstract": "Quantum maps are fundamental to quantum information theory and open quantum\nsystems. Covariant or weakly symmetric quantum maps, in particular, play a key\nrole in defining quantum evolutions that respect thermodynamics, establish free\noperations in resource theories, and are consistent with transformations of\nquantum reference frames. To implement quantum maps in the lab, one typically\nengineers a physical dilation, which corresponds to a unitary evolution\nentangling the system with an environment. This work systematically explores\nhow weak symmetries of quantum maps manifest in their dilations. We demonstrate\nthat for various classes of physical dilations, including Hamiltonian-driven\ndilations and short-time collision models that simulate Markovian open quantum\ndynamics, weak symmetries always lead to strong symmetries in the dilated\nevolution, resulting in conserved quantities in the system-environment space.\nWe also characterize the subspace where these symmetries arise using Krylov\nsubspaces. Moreover, we show that some different types of physical dilations\nhave no constraints on the dilated evolution, requiring no strong symmetry.\nFinally, we complement our findings with a variety of illustrative and\npedagogical examples. Our results provide essential guidelines for constructing\nphysical dilations of quantum maps, offering a comprehensive understanding of\nhow symmetries shape their implementations in a laboratory or on a quantum\ncomputer.",

In two and three dimensions, there is a similar formulation of\nstationary scattering where the scattering properties of the scatterer are\nextracted from the evolution operator for a corresponding effective quantum\nsystem.

    "abstract": "RAG systems consist of multiple modules to work together. However, these\nmodules are usually separately trained. We argue that a system like RAG that\nincorporates multiple modules should be jointly optimized to achieve optimal\nperformance. To demonstrate this, we design a specific pipeline called\n\\textbf{SmartRAG} that includes a policy network and a retriever. The policy\nnetwork can serve as 1) a decision maker that decides when to retrieve, 2) a\nquery rewriter to generate a query most suited to the retriever, and 3) an\nanswer generator that produces the final response with/without the\nobservations. We then propose to jointly optimize the whole system using a\nreinforcement learning algorithm, with the reward designed to encourage the\nsystem to achieve the best performance with minimal retrieval cost. When\njointly optimized, all the modules can be aware of how other modules are\nworking and thus find the best way to work together as a complete system.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that the jointly optimized SmartRAG can achieve\nbetter performance than separately optimized counterparts.",

In terms of the quark-quark\npotential, the mass of the charmed spin-$1$ diquark is predicted $\\sim 3500$\nMeV. The masses of the light ``good'' and ``bad'' antidiquark are calculated\nwith $\\sim 670$ MeV and $\\sim 840$ MeV, respectively. The mass difference\nbetween light ``good'' and ``bad'' diquarks is $\\sim 170$ MeV, which is\nconsistent with previous phenomenological analyses. The interaction between the\ncharmed diquark and the light antidiquark is then modulated by the\nquark-antiquark potential in the model, and the mass spectra of doubly charmed\ntetraquarks from $1S$ to $2P$ excitations are calculated with the calculated\nmasses of diquarks/antidiquarks and refitted parameters from $T_{cc}(3875)^+$\nand $X(3872)$. The $1S-1P$ and $1S-2S$ mass splittings of doubly charmed\ntetraquarks are about $410-430$ MeV and $610-650$ MeV, respectively, and this\nmass splittings pattern is similar to that for ordinary $D$ mesons.

Denoising is especially relevant in dMRI since noise can have a\ndeleterious impact on both quantification accuracy and image preprocessing. The\nmost successful methods proposed to date, like Marchenko-Pastur Principal\nComponent Analysis (MPPCA) denoising, are tailored to diffusion-weighting\nrepeated for many encoding directions. They exploit high redundancy of the\ndataset that oversamples the diffusion-encoding direction space, since many\ndirections have collinear components.\n  However, there are many dMRI techniques that do not entail a large number of\nencoding directions or repetitions, and are therefore less suited to this\napproach. For example, clinical dMRI exams may include as few as three encoding\ndirections, with low or negligible data redundancy across directions. Moreover,\npromising new dMRI approaches, like spherical b-tensor encoding (STE), benefit\nfrom high b-values while sensitizing the signal to diffusion along all\ndirections in just a single shot.\n  We introduce a convolutional neural network approach that we call\nmulti-b-value-based denoising (MBD). MBD exploits the similarity in\ndiffusion-weighted images (DWI) across different b-values but along the same\ndiffusion encoding direction. It allows denoising of diffusion images with high\nnoise variance while avoiding blurring, and using just a small number input\nimages.",

Recent diffusion models enable generating\nhigh-quality novel-view images from a single-view input image. Most existing\nmethods only concentrate on building the consistency between the input image\nand the generated images while losing the consistency between the generated\nimages. VistaDream addresses this problem by a two-stage pipeline. In the first\nstage, VistaDream begins with building a global coarse 3D scaffold by zooming\nout a little step with inpainted boundaries and an estimated depth map. Then,\non this global scaffold, we use iterative diffusion-based RGB-D inpainting to\ngenerate novel-view images to inpaint the holes of the scaffold. In the second\nstage, we further enhance the consistency between the generated novel-view\nimages by a novel training-free Multiview Consistency Sampling (MCS) that\nintroduces multi-view consistency constraints in the reverse sampling process\nof diffusion models. Experimental results demonstrate that without training or\nfine-tuning existing diffusion models, VistaDream achieves consistent and\nhigh-quality novel view synthesis using just single-view images and outperforms\nbaseline methods by a large margin.

In applications, such as\nbearings, gears, biological joints, etc., where the height-to-length ratio is\nsmall ($H_0 / \\ell_x$) and the shear due to the wall velocity ($U_0$) is high,\na simplified two-dimensional computational analysis across the channel length\nand height reveals a finite increase in the load carrying capacity of the film\npurely due to polymer elasticity. In channels with a finite length-to-width\nratio, $a$, the spanwise effects can be significant, but the resulting\nmathematical model is computationally intensive. In this work, we propose\nsimpler reduced-order models, namely via a (i) first-order perturbation in the\nDeborah number ($\\lambda U_0 / H_0$), and the (ii) viscoelastic Reynolds\napproach extended from \\textit{Ahmed, H., \\& Biancofiore, L.

Interestingly, for\na fixed $De$, this force varies strongly between the two limiting cases (i) $a\n<< 1$; an infinitely wide, and (ii) $a >> 1$; an infinitely short channel\nchannel, implying a change in the polymers response. Furthermore, we observe a\ndifferent trend (i) for a spanwise varying channel, in which a peak is observed\nbetween the two limits, and (ii) for a spanwise uniform channel, where the\nlargest load value is for $a << 1$.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a series\nof interviews with clinicians in the UK. Our study: (i) explores the potential\nfor AI, specifically future 'human-like' computing approaches, to facilitate\nECG interpretation and support clinical decision making, and (ii) elicits their\nopinions about the importance of explainability and trustworthiness of AI\nalgorithms. Results: We performed inductive thematic analysis on interview\ntranscriptions from 23 clinicians and identified the following themes: (i) a\nlack of trust in current systems, (ii) positive attitudes towards future AI\napplications and requirements for these, (iii) the relationship between the\naccuracy and explainability of algorithms, and (iv) opinions on education,\npossible deskilling, and the impact of AI on clinical competencies. Discussion:\nClinicians do not trust current computerised methods, but welcome future 'AI'\ntechnologies. Where clinicians trust future AI interpretation to be accurate,\nthey are less concerned that it is explainable. They also preferred ECG\ninterpretation that demonstrated the results of the algorithm visually. Whilst\nclinicians do not fear job losses, they are concerned about deskilling and the\nneed to educate the workforce to use AI responsibly. Conclusion: Clinicians are\npositive about the future application of AI in clinical decision-making.\nAccuracy is a key factor of uptake and visualisations are preferred over\ncurrent computerised methods. This is viewed as a potential means of training\nand upskilling, in contrast to the deskilling that automation might be\nperceived to bring.",

Due to excellent capacity-achieving performance,\nspatially-coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes are considered a\npromising candidate for next-generation channel coding. In this paper, we\npropose an SC-LDPC code family called edge-spreading Raptor-like (ESRL) codes.\nUnlike other SC-LDPC codes that adopt the structure of existing rate-compatible\nLDPC block codes before coupling, ESRL codes maximize the possible locations of\nedge placement and focus on constructing an optimal coupled matrix.

This graph\noffers a global perspective on ESRL codes and identifies the optimal edge\nreallocation to optimize the spreading strategy. We conduct comprehensive\ncomparisons of ESRL codes and 5G-NR LDPC codes. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat when all decoding parameters and complexity are the same, ESRL codes have\nobvious advantages in error rate performance and throughput compared to 5G-NR\nLDPC codes in some specific scenarios (low and high number of iterations),\nmaking them a promising solution towards next-generation channel coding.",

These currents\nin solution have associated non-local electric fields. Particle motion driven\nby these non-local fields has recently been observed in experiment by Williams\net al. [Phys. Rev.

Here we use a magnetostatic analogy to\nshow that in the far-field limit, these non-local currents and electric fields\nboth have the functional form of the magnetic field of a magnetic dipole,\ndecaying as r^(-d) in d = 2 and d = 3 dimensions. These long-ranged electric\nfields are generated entirely within solutions and have potential practical\napplications since they can drive both electrophoretic motion of particles, and\nelectro-osmotic flows.

To solve the problem,\nexisting approaches invariably use color and/or shape information but in many\nreal-world scenarios, such as in archaeological fresco reconstruction, this\nkind of clues is often unreliable due to severe physical and pictorial\ndeterioration of the individual fragments. This makes state-of-the-art\napproaches entirely unusable in practice. On the other hand, in such cases,\nsimple geometrical patterns such as lines or curves offer a powerful yet\nunexplored clue. In an attempt to fill in this gap, in this paper we introduce\na new challenging version of the puzzle solving problem in which one\ndeliberately ignores conventional color and shape features and relies solely on\nthe presence of linear geometrical patterns. The reconstruction process is then\nonly driven by one of the most fundamental principles of Gestalt perceptual\norganization, namely Wertheimer's {\\em law of good continuation}. In order to\ntackle this problem, we formulate the puzzle solving problem as the problem of\nfinding a Nash equilibrium of a (noncooperative) multiplayer game and use\nclassical multi-population replicator dynamics to solve it. The proposed\napproach is general and allows us to deal with pieces of arbitrary shape, size\nand orientation. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world data\nand compare it with state-of-the-art algorithms. The results show the intrinsic\ncomplexity of our purely line-based puzzle problem as well as the relative\neffectiveness of our game-theoretic formulation.",

Directly interacting such embeddings lacks rationality and may\ncapture inaccurate correlation. Therefore, we propose a novel method called\nDIAS to bridge the modality gap from two aspects: (1) We align the information\nrepresentation of embeddings from different modalities in corresponding\ndimension to ensure the correlation calculation is based on interactions of\nsimilar information.

The approach builds on the Probabilistic Angle Interpolation (PAI)\ntechnique and we prove that it simulates time evolution without discretisation\nor algorithmic error while achieving shallow circuit depths with optimal\nscaling that saturates the Lieb-Robinson bound. Another significant advantage\nof TE-PAI is that it only requires executing random circuits that consist of\nPauli rotation gates of only two kinds of rotation angles $\\pm\\Delta$ and\n$\\pi$, along with measurements.

    "abstract": "High performance, reliability and safety are crucial properties of any\nSoftware-Defined-Networking (SDN) system. Although the use of Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms has been widely studied to improve\nperformance, their practical applications are still limited as they fail to\nensure safe operations in exploration and decision-making. To fill this gap, we\nexplore the design of a Control Barrier Function (CBF) on top of Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms for load-balancing. We show that our\nDRL-CBF approach is capable of meeting safety requirements during training and\ntesting while achieving near-optimal performance in testing. We provide results\nusing two simulators: a flow-based simulator, which is used for\nproof-of-concept and benchmarking, and a packet-based simulator that implements\nreal protocols and scheduling. Thanks to the flow-based simulator, we compared\nthe performance against the optimal policy, solving a Non Linear Programming\n(NLP) problem with the SCIP solver. Furthermore, we showed that pre-trained\nmodels in the flow-based simulator, which is faster, can be transferred to the\npacket simulator, which is slower but more accurate, with some fine-tuning.\nOverall, the results suggest that near-optimal Quality-of-Service (QoS)\nperformance in terms of end-to-end delay can be achieved while safety\nrequirements related to link capacity constraints are guaranteed. In the\npacket-based simulator, we also show that our DRL-CBF algorithms outperform\nnon-RL baseline algorithms. When the models are fine-tuned over a few episodes,\nwe achieved smoother QoS and safety in training, and similar performance in\ntesting compared to the case where models have been trained from scratch.",

However, GNNs perform poorly in the Few-Shot Node\nClassification (FSNC) task that requires robust generalization to make accurate\npredictions for unseen classes with limited labels. To tackle the challenge, we\npropose the integration of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)--a technique\ndesigned to enhance model generalization by finding a flat minimum of the loss\nlandscape--into GNN training. The standard SAM approach, however, consists of\ntwo forward-backward steps in each training iteration, doubling the\ncomputational cost compared to the base optimizer (e.g., Adam). To mitigate\nthis drawback, we introduce a novel algorithm, Fast Graph Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (FGSAM), that integrates the rapid training of Multi-Layer\nPerceptrons (MLPs) with the superior performance of GNNs. Specifically, we\nutilize GNNs for parameter perturbation while employing MLPs to minimize the\nperturbed loss so that we can find a flat minimum with good generalization more\nefficiently. Moreover, our method reutilizes the gradient from the perturbation\nphase to incorporate graph topology into the minimization process at almost\nzero additional cost. To further enhance training efficiency, we develop FGSAM+\nthat executes exact perturbations periodically. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the standard SAM with lower\ncomputational costs in FSNC tasks. In particular, our FGSAM+ as a SAM variant\noffers a faster optimization than the base optimizer in most cases. In addition\nto FSNC, our proposed methods also demonstrate competitive performance in the\nstandard node classification task for heterophilic graphs, highlighting the\nbroad applicability.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to solve the\nproblem of finding obstacle-free paths for autonomous agents operating in\nstochastic and uncertain environments. However, when the underlying stochastic\ndynamics of the environment experiences drastic distribution shifts, the\noptimal policy obtained in the trained environment may be sub-optimal or may\nentirely fail in helping find goal-reaching paths for the agent. Approaches\nlike domain randomization and robust RL can provide robust policies, but\ntypically assume minor (bounded) distribution shifts. For substantial\ndistribution shifts, retraining (either with a warm-start policy or from\nscratch) is an alternative approach. In this paper, we develop a novel approach\ncalled {\\em Evolutionary Robust Policy Optimization} (ERPO), an adaptive\nre-training algorithm inspired by evolutionary game theory (EGT). ERPO learns\nan optimal policy for the shifted environment iteratively using a temperature\nparameter that controls the trade off between exploration and adherence to the\nold optimal policy. The policy update itself is an instantiation of the\nreplicator dynamics used in EGT. We show that under fairly common sparsity\nassumptions on rewards in such environments, ERPO converges to the optimal\npolicy in the shifted environment. We empirically demonstrate that for path\nfinding tasks in a number of environments, ERPO outperforms several popular RL\nand deep RL algorithms (PPO, A3C, DQN) in many scenarios and popular\nenvironments. This includes scenarios where the RL algorithms are allowed to\ntrain from scratch in the new environment, when they are retrained on the new\nenvironment, or when they are used in conjunction with domain randomization.\nERPO shows faster policy adaptation, higher average rewards, and reduced\ncomputational costs in policy adaptation.",

The primary issue\nlies in the absence of specialized poster datasets for targeted model training.\nIn this work, we propose a Movie Posters DataSet (MPDS), tailored for\ntext-to-image generation models to revolutionize poster production.

To bolster poster\ndescriptions as well as reduce differences from movie synopsis, further, we\nleverage a large-scale vision-language model to automatically produce\nvision-perceptive prompts for each poster, then perform manual rectification\nand integration with movie-synopsis prompt. In addition, we introduce a prompt\nof poster captions to exhibit text elements in posters like actor names and\nmovie titles.

Therefore, this\npaper analyzes 12 common correlation measures using a large amount of\nreal-world data from six widely-used NLG evaluation datasets and 32 evaluation\nmetrics, revealing that different measures indeed impact the meta-evaluation\nresults. Furthermore, we propose three perspectives that reflect the capability\nof meta-evaluation: discriminative power, ranking consistency, and sensitivity\nto score granularity. We find that the measure using global grouping and\nPearson correlation coefficient exhibits the best performance in both\ndiscriminative power and ranking consistency. Besides, the measures using\nsystem-level grouping or Kendall correlation are the least sensitive to score\ngranularity.",

    "abstract": "Density-equalizing map is a shape deformation technique originally developed\nfor cartogram creation and sociological data visualization on planar\ngeographical maps. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in\ndeveloping density-equalizing mapping methods for surface and volumetric\ndomains and applying them to various problems in geometry processing and\nimaging science. However, the existing surface density-equalizing mapping\nmethods are only applicable to surfaces with relatively simple topologies but\nnot surfaces with topological holes. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm\nfor computing density-equalizing maps for toroidal surfaces. In particular,\ndifferent shape deformation effects can be easily achieved by prescribing\ndifferent population functions on the torus and performing diffusion-based\ndeformations on a planar domain with periodic boundary conditions. Furthermore,\nthe proposed toroidal density-equalizing mapping method naturally leads to an\neffective method for computing toroidal parameterizations of genus-one surfaces\nwith controllable shape changes, with the toroidal area-preserving\nparameterization being a prime example. Experimental results are presented to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.",

Our goal is to detect low-temperature ($<2$ keV) X-ray emitting\ngas, potentially associated to a cooling flow that connects the hot ICM\nreservoir to the cold gas phase responsible for star formation and supermassive\nblack hole feeding. We use new deep XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS data, combined with\narchival Chandra data, to perform a spectral analysis for the core region. We\nfind 1$\\sigma$ upper limits to the cooling gas fraction of $\\sim$40 $\\rm\nM_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$ and $\\sim$50-60 $\\rm M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$ in the temperature\nranges 0.5-1 keV and 1-2 keV, respectively. The lack of OVII, FeXXI-FeXXII, and\nFeXVII emission lines in the RGS spectra suggest that the fraction of gas\ncooling below 1 keV is limited to a few tens of $\\rm M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$ at most.\nHowever, we detect several lines (e.g. SiXIV, MgXII, FeXXIII/FeXXIV, NeX,\nOVIII$\\alpha$) that allow us to estimate a 1$\\sigma$ upper limit for turbulent\nbroadening of $\\sim$320 km $\\rm s^{-1}$, higher that other cool-core clusters\nsuch as Abell 1835, implying mechanisms that boost turbulence in Abell 2667's\natmosphere. Imaging analysis of Chandra data suggests the presence of a cold\nfront, possibly lined to sloshing or ICM cavities. However, current data do not\nclearly identify the physical mechanism driving turbulence. These finding\nindicate that Abell 2667 is similar to other low-redshift cool-core clusters,\nthough the large upper limit on turbulence hints at significant ICM heating,\nwhich may suppress cooling for extended periods and contribute to future\ncondensation events.",

    "abstract": "The pursuit-evasion problem is widespread in nature, engineering, and\nsocietal applications. It is commonly observed in nature that predators often\nexhibit faster speeds than their prey but have less agile maneuverability. Over\nmillions of years of evolution, animals have developed effective and efficient\nstrategies for both pursuit and evasion. In this paper, we provide a dynamic\nframework for the pursuit-evasion problem of unicycle systems, drawing\ninspiration from nature. First, we address the scenario involving one pursuer\nand one evader by proposing an Alert-Turn control strategy, which consists of\ntwo efficient ingredients: a sudden turning maneuver and an alert condition for\nstarting and maintaining the maneuver. We present and analyze the escape and\ncapture results at two levels: a lower level of a single run and a higher level\nwith respect to parameters' changes. In addition, we provide a theorem with\nsufficient conditions for capture. The Alert-Turn strategy is then extended to\nmore complex scenarios involving multiple pursuers and evaders by integrating\naggregation control laws and a target-changing mechanism. By adjusting a\n'selfish parameter', the aggregation control commands produce various escape\npatterns of evaders: cooperative mode, selfish mode, as well as their\ncombinations. The influence of the selfish parameter is quantified, and the\neffects of the number of pursuers and the target-changing mechanism are\nexplored from a statistical perspective. Our findings align closely with\nobservations in nature. Finally, the proposed control strategies are validated\nthrough numerical simulations that replicate some chasing behaviors of animals\nin nature.",

Instead, generative\nmodels directly associate inputs with item IDs. Given the breakthroughs of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), these generative systems can play a crucial role\nin centralizing a variety of Information Retrieval (IR) tasks in a single model\nthat performs tasks such as query understanding, retrieval, recommendation,\nexplanation, re-ranking, and response generation. Despite the growing interest\nin such a unified generative approach for IR systems, the advantages of using a\nsingle, multi-task model over multiple specialized models are not well\nestablished in the literature. This paper investigates whether and when such a\nunified approach can outperform task-specific models in the IR tasks of search\nand recommendation, broadly co-existing in multiple industrial online\nplatforms, such as Spotify, YouTube, and Netflix. Previous work shows that (1)\nthe latent representations of items learned by generative recommenders are\nbiased towards popularity, and (2) content-based and\ncollaborative-filtering-based information can improve an item's\nrepresentations. Motivated by this, our study is guided by two hypotheses: [H1]\nthe joint training regularizes the estimation of each item's popularity, and\n[H2] the joint training regularizes the item's latent representations, where\nsearch captures content-based aspects of an item and recommendation captures\ncollaborative-filtering aspects.

Specifically, we propose\nan innovative auto-prompting pipeline, named AttriPrompter, comprising\nattribute generation, attribute augmentation, and relevance sorting, to avoid\nsubjective manual prompt design. AttriPrompter utilizes VLPMs' text-to-image\nalignment to create semantically rich text prompts, which are then fed into\nGLIP for initial zero-shot nuclei detection. Additionally, we propose a\nself-trained knowledge distillation framework, where GLIP serves as the teacher\nwith its initial predictions used as pseudo labels, to address the challenges\nposed by high nuclei density, including missed detections, false positives, and\noverlapping instances. Our method exhibits remarkable performance in label-free\nnuclei detection, outperforming all existing unsupervised methods and\ndemonstrating excellent generality. Notably, this work highlights the\nastonishing potential of VLPMs pre-trained on natural image-text pairs for\ndownstream tasks in the medical field as well. Code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/wuyongjianCODE/AttriPrompter.",

    "abstract": "The development of machine-learning (ML) potentials offers significant\naccuracy improvements compared to molecular mechanics (MM) because of the\ninclusion of quantum-mechanical effects in molecular interactions. However, ML\nsimulations are several times more computationally demanding than MM\nsimulations, so there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. One possible\ncompromise are hybrid machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) approaches\nwith mechanical embedding that treat the intramolecular interactions of the\nligand at the ML level and the protein-ligand interactions at the MM level.\nRecent studies have reported improved protein-ligand binding free energy\nresults based on ML/MM with mechanical embedding, arguing that intramolecular\ninteractions like torsion potentials of the ligand are often the limiting\nfactor for accuracy. This claim is evaluated based on 108 relative binding free\nenergy calculations for four different benchmark systems. As an alternative\nstrategy, we also tested a tool that fits the MM dihedral potentials to the ML\nlevel of theory. Overall, the relative binding free energy results from MM with\nOpen Force Field 2.2.0, MM with ML-fitted torsion potentials, and the\ncorresponding ML/MM end-state corrected simulations show no statistically\nsignificant differences in the mean absolute errors (between 0.8 and 0.9\nkcal/mol). Therefore, a well-parameterized force field is on a par with simple\nmechanical embedding ML/MM simulations for protein-ligand binding. In terms of\ncomputational costs, the reparametrization of poor torsional potentials is\npreferable over employing computationally intensive ML/MM simulations of\nprotein-ligand complexes with mechanical embedding. Also, the refitting\nstrategy leads to lower variances of the protein-ligand binding free energy\nresults than the ML/MM end-state corrections.",

We evaluated this deep learning-based synthetic MP-RAGE\n(DL-Syn-MPR) on 31 non-artifact and 11 metal-artifact subjects. The\nsegmentation results, measured by the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC),\nconsistently achieved high agreement (DSC values above 0.83), indicating a\nstrong correlation with reference segmentations, with lower input requirements.\nAlso, no significant difference in segmentation performance was observed\nbetween the artifact and non-artifact groups.",

The radio flux decreases by 2 to 3\norders of magnitude within a rapid time scale of about 20 minutes.

    "abstract": "Lifestyle support through robotics is an increasingly promising field, with\nexpectations for robots to take over or assist with chores like floor cleaning,\ntable setting and clearing, and fetching items. The growth of AI, particularly\nfoundation models, such as large language models (LLMs) and visual language\nmodels (VLMs), is significantly shaping this sector. LLMs, by facilitating\nnatural interactions and providing vast general knowledge, are proving\ninvaluable for robotic tasks. This paper zeroes in on the benefits of LLMs for\n\"bring-me\" tasks, where robots fetch specific items for users, often based on\nvague instructions. Our previous efforts utilized an ontology extended to\nhandle environmental data to decipher such vagueness, but faced limitations\nwhen unresolvable ambiguities required user intervention for clarity.

Both types of excitons occur at different resonance energies and\nexhibit a qualitatively different coupling with localized plasmons. We find a\nstrong coupling between the plasmon and momentum-dark excitons, while a weakly\ncoupled bright exciton manifests as an additional, third peak in the spectrum.\nConsequently, we propose a realistic modeling of the primary spectral features\nin experiments incorporating three harmonic oscillator equations instead of the\nconventional two.

This has motivated the community to develop effective methods to\ndistill pre-trained diffusion models into more efficient models, but these\nmethods still typically require few-step inference or perform substantially\nworse than the underlying model. In this paper, we present Score Implicit\nMatching (SIM) a new approach to distilling pre-trained diffusion models into\nsingle-step generator models, while maintaining almost the same sample\ngeneration ability as the original model as well as being data-free with no\nneed of training samples for distillation. The method rests upon the fact that,\nalthough the traditional score-based loss is intractable to minimize for\ngenerator models, under certain conditions we can efficiently compute the\ngradients for a wide class of score-based divergences between a diffusion model\nand a generator. SIM shows strong empirical performances for one-step\ngenerators: on the CIFAR10 dataset, it achieves an FID of 2.06 for\nunconditional generation and 1.96 for class-conditional generation. Moreover,\nby applying SIM to a leading transformer-based diffusion model, we distill a\nsingle-step generator for text-to-image (T2I) generation that attains an\naesthetic score of 6.42 with no performance decline over the original\nmulti-step counterpart, clearly outperforming the other one-step generators\nincluding SDXL-TURBO of 5.33, SDXL-LIGHTNING of 5.34 and HYPER-SDXL of 5.85.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling\ncontrol problems, but its practical application is often hindered by the\ncomplexity arising from intricate reward functions with multiple terms. The\nreward hypothesis posits that any objective can be encapsulated in a scalar\nreward function, yet balancing individual, potentially adversarial, reward\nterms without exploitation remains challenging. To overcome the limitations of\ntraditional RL methods, which often require precise balancing of competing\nreward terms, we propose a two-stage reward curriculum that first maximizes a\nsimple reward function and then transitions to the full, complex reward. We\nprovide a method based on how well an actor fits a critic to automatically\ndetermine the transition point between the two stages. Additionally, we\nintroduce a flexible replay buffer that enables efficient phase transfer by\nreusing samples from one stage in the next. We evaluate our method on the\nDeepMind control suite, modified to include an additional constraint term in\nthe reward definitions. We further evaluate our method in a mobile robot\nscenario with even more competing reward terms. In both settings, our two-stage\nreward curriculum achieves a substantial improvement in performance compared to\na baseline trained without curriculum. Instead of exploiting the constraint\nterm in the reward, it is able to learn policies that balance task completion\nand constraint satisfaction.

For these reasons, we introduce a novel infiltration\nmodel to simulate water infiltration under fractional wettable conditions. We\nconceptualize the soil surface as a composite of two distinct portions: a\nwater-repellent fraction, where hydrophobic effects impede water infiltration,\nand a wettable fraction, where capillarity and gravity are the dominant forces\ncontrolling the process. The new model was validated using a dataset comprising\ninfiltration data from 60 field measurements. Additionally, validation was\nperformed using 660 analytically generated infiltration curves from six\nsynthetic soils with varying textures. This innovative approach enabled us to\naccount for the combined influence of these two fractions and to enhance the\ninterpretation of infiltration curves with mixed shapes, which other common\nmethods are unable to reproduce.",

The object underwent an\nenergetic event around 1990 that suddenly increased its brightness which has\nbeen fading since then. A comparison with a published spectrum from 1988 shows\nan increase of the H$\\beta$ flux in 2021 by factor of $\\simeq$6 and the [O III]\nemission lines that were absent in 1988. Between 2021 and 2023 the H$\\beta$\nflux decreased by a factor of $\\simeq$1.7, and the [O III] emission lines\nalmost vanished. These results and the variability observed in other emission\nlines indicate that IRAS 22568+6141 is recombining and cooling down between\n2021 and 2023, and probably since 2005, as suggested by archival radio\ncontinuum and mid-IR observations. The intermediate- and high-resolution\nspectra show that the excitation of the emission lines is dominated by shocks\nin 2021 and 2023, and, probably, also in 1988, which may be related to the\nnon-thermal radio continuum emission from the object. Although the variability\nmight be due to changes in the physical conditions in the shocks or in a\nnova-like eruption, it accommodates better to that expected from a late thermal\npulse, which is further suggested by a comparison with other similar objects.\nNew observations and monitoring in the coming years are crucial to corroborate\nthe origin of the variability.",

The proposed quantum system comprises a composite structure of an AF\nring coupled to an AAH chain. Utilizing a tight-binding model and operator\nmethod to calculate charge and spin circular currents, we uncover a range of\nintriguing phenomena. An interesting finding is that while the\nantiferromagnetic ring alone does not exhibit spin channel separation due to\nthe symmetry between the up and down spin sub-Hamiltonians, the introduction of\na dangling bond or chain can break this symmetry, leading to a spin separation\neffect. The AAH potential in the chain disrupts energy level symmetry,\nsignificantly impacting transport behavior. The charge circular current\nexhibits periodic oscillations with the AB flux, and its polarity changes with\nvariations in $\\mu$. The AAH phase affects the charge current through the\nshifting of energy levels. Furthermore, the spin current displays oscillatory\nbehavior as the AAH potential strength changes, with peaks emerging due to\ninterference phenomena caused by disorder-induced localization. A possible\nexperimental realization of our proposed quantum setup is also discussed, for\nthe sake of completeness.

REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with\nGEnerative Narratives) extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset with rich\nuser narratives, including personalized explanations of product preferences,\nproduct endorsements for recommended items, and summaries of user purchase\nhistory. REGEN is made publicly available to facilitate further research.\nFurthermore, we establish benchmarks using well-known generative metrics, and\nperform an automated evaluation of the new dataset using a rater LLM. Second,\nthe paper introduces a fusion architecture (CF model with an LLM) which serves\nas a baseline for REGEN. And to the best of our knowledge, represents the first\nattempt to analyze the capabilities of LLMs in understanding recommender\nsignals and generating rich narratives. We demonstrate that LLMs can\neffectively learn from simple fusion architectures utilizing interaction-based\nCF embeddings, and this can be further enhanced using the metadata and\npersonalization data associated with items. Our experiments show that combining\nCF and content embeddings leads to improvements of 4-12% in key language\nmetrics compared to using either type of embedding individually.

    "abstract": "Since the launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in 2010 and\nthroughout the solar cycle 24, the Sun has produced few tens of xclass flares,\nwhich are the most energetic solar events. Those flares are produced in regions\nwhere the magnetic flux/energy is large and the magnetic configurations are\ncomplex. To provide more insights into the flaring process, we investigate the\nproperties of magnetic null points (MNPs) and their correlation with the energy\nrelease sites. During solar cycle 24, we identify 17 xclass flares satisfying\nselection criteria. From SDO/HMI magnetograms, we perform potential\nextrapolations around the peak time of the flare to access the 3D coronal\nmagnetic field and thus investigate the existence of coronal MNPs. We then\ncorrelate the flaring sites with the existing MNPs using SDO/AIA 171A EUV\nobservations, and deduce their properties (sign, spine, fan). Six active\nregions out of 10 possess at least one MNP, which is stable and with large\nmagnetic field gradients: this implies that 35% of xclass flares are associated\nwith a MNP; of which 87.5% of MNPs are of positive type. The MNPs associated\nwith the flare sites are predominantly located ata height between 05 and 2 Mm,\nand with a vertical/radial spine field line. We also find a slight correlation\nbetween the MNPs not associated with a flare and negative-type MNPs (55%)\nwithin the active region. Regarding the physics of flares, the association\nbetween the enhanced intensity at the flaring site and a MNP represents about a\nthird of the possible scenarios for triggering xclass flares.",

This is a paradigmatic example of an\ninteracting many-body system, which is integrable in the uniform limit and\nnear-integrable otherwise. We first investigate a quantum thermodynamic Otto\ncycle driven by a quench of interaction strength of a 1D Bose gas. For the case\nof a sudden quench in a uniform 1D Bose gas, we demonstrate how the performance\nof this highly nonequilibrium quantum thermal machine may be expressed in terms\nof atom-atom correlations. Further, we derive a new Maxwell relation which\nallows one to express entropy, which is generally difficult to ascertain in\nquantum systems, in terms of Glauber's local second-order correlation function,\nwhich are experimentally measurable. We next perform benchmarks of GHD in order\nto ascertain the regimes where such a theory may be applied, and then utilize\nit to investigate the interaction strength-driven quantum Otto cycle in a\nharmonically trapped 1D Bose gas. However, to realise such an engine in an\nexperimentally realistic manner would require modelling thermalisation with\nexternal reservoirs, which is currently beyond the scope of GHD. Yet, the\nclassical $c$-field stochastic-projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE)\nmethod is capable of simulating tunnel-coupling pairs of 1D Bose gases in the\nweakly interacting regime. We therefore utilise this numerical method to\nsimulate the \\emph{full} quantum Otto engine cycle, realised through a single\nworking fluid tunnel-coupled to two 1D Bose gases, which constitute the\nexternal (hot and cold) reservoirs.",

However, the detection of small objects, which is crucial\nfor many of these applications, remains an underexplored area in current\ncomputer vision research, particularly for low-power embedded devices that host\nresource-constrained processors. To address said gap, this paper proposes an\nadaptive tiling method for lightweight and energy-efficient object detection\nnetworks, including YOLO-based models and the popular FOMO network. The\nproposed tiling enables object detection on low-power MCUs with no compromise\non accuracy compared to large-scale detection models. The benefit of the\nproposed method is demonstrated by applying it to FOMO and TinyissimoYOLO\nnetworks on a novel RISC-V-based MCU with built-in ML accelerators. Extensive\nexperimental results show that the proposed tiling method boosts the F1-score\nby up to 225% for both FOMO and TinyissimoYOLO networks while reducing the\naverage object count error by up to 76% with FOMO and up to 89% for\nTinyissimoYOLO. Furthermore, the findings of this work indicate that using a\nsoft F1 loss over the popular binary cross-entropy loss can serve as an\nimplicit non-maximum suppression for the FOMO network. To evaluate the\nreal-world performance, the networks are deployed on the RISC-V based GAP9\nmicrocontroller from GreenWaves Technologies, showcasing the proposed method's\nability to strike a balance between detection performance ($58% - 95%$ F1\nscore), low latency (0.6 ms/Inference - 16.2 ms/Inference}), and energy\nefficiency (31 uJ/Inference} - 1.27 mJ/Inference) while performing multiple\npredictions using high-resolution images on a MCU.",

Additionally, we quantify the\nperformance trade-offs and losses of the resulting generalized IMC hardware\ncompared to workload-specific IMC designs.",

Currently, there are multiple non-personalized modules\nin the video recommendation pipeline that urgently need personalized modeling\ntechniques for improvement. Inspired by the success of uplift modeling in\nonline marketing, we attempt to implement uplift modeling in the video\nrecommendation scenario. However, we face two main challenges: 1) Design and\nutilization of treatments, and 2) Capture of user real-time interest. To\naddress them, we design adjusting the distribution of videos with varying\ndurations as the treatment and propose Coarse-to-fine Dynamic Uplift Modeling\n(CDUM) for real-time video recommendation. CDUM consists of two modules, CPM\nand FIC. The former module fully utilizes the offline features of users to\nmodel their long-term preferences, while the latter module leverages online\nreal-time contextual features and request-level candidates to model users'\nreal-time interests. These two modules work together to dynamically identify\nand targeting specific user groups and applying treatments effectively.\nFurther, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the offline public and\nindustrial datasets and online A/B test, demonstrating the superiority and\neffectiveness of our proposed CDUM.

    "abstract": "This study presents an efficient algebraic scheme known as MULES for sharp\ninterface advection, verified against various schemes including first-order\nupwind, second-order central, van Leer flux limiter, and Geometric\nVolume-of-Fluid (VOF). Two problems involving a droplet in a two-dimensional\n(2D) vortex and a stationary droplet were examined. The model assessed the\neffects of the Interface Compression (IC) coefficient, ranging from 0 to 2,\nanalyzing parameters such as Interface Advection Error (IAE) and Mass\nConservation Error (MCE). Results indicated that increasing IC values enhanced\ninterface tracking accuracy but introduced non-physical instabilities at higher\nvalues, compromising mass conservation. Specifically, the IAE decreased from\n4.8% to 3.95% as IC increased from 0 to 2, showing a favorable effect until IC\nsurpassed 1.4, where IAE fluctuated around 4%. Conversely, the MCE rose steeply\nfrom 0% to 23.19%, driven by parasitic currents and numerical instabilities.\nAdditionally, MULES and van Leer flux limiter schemes evaluated volume fraction\nsmoothing effects. Initial filtering reduced Dimensionless Pressure Difference\n(DPD) and Capillary Number (Ca), stabilizing the solution, but excessive\nfiltering reintroduced numerical errors and instabilities. With one filtering\nstep, DPD reduced by 0.23 and Ca dropped significantly by 73.31%, improving\nsolution stability. However, further filtering increased DPD and Ca, reflecting\nthe reintroduction of numerical errors. The maximum velocity of parasitic flow\naround the droplet initially decreased by almost 75% but increased by 30.92%\nwith excessive filtering. IAE increased from 0.7 to 0.9 with initial filtering,\nthen decreased to 0.63 with additional steps, indicating improved solver\nperformance on smoother interfaces.",

    "abstract": "The study of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) in turbulent flows continues to be\na critical area of research, particularly in understanding the behavior of\nsmall-scale turbulence structures and their impact on resolved scales. In this\nstudy, we focus on the LES of turbulent flows, particularly the one-dimensional\nStochastic Burgers Equation (SBE), using fully conservative higher-order\nschemes. The interaction between spatial discretization and SubGrid-Scale (SGS)\nmodeling is explored rigorously by validating these schemes against analytical\nsolutions for both the Linear Advection-Diffusion (LAD) equation and the\nNon-Linear Burgers (NLB) equation under laminar conditions. This ensures\nrobustness before applying the approach to LES of stochastic turbulence. The\nstudy investigates how second-order and fourth-order discretization schemes\ninfluence the dynamic coefficients of various SGS models, including Constant\nSmagorinsky (CS), Dynamic Smagorinsky (DS), Dynamic Wong-Lilly (DWL), 1.5-order\nTurbulent Kinetic Energy Deardorff (TKED), Equilibrium Heinz (EH), and Dynamic\nHeinz (DH) models. The second-order scheme was found to amplify fluctuations in\ndynamic SGS coefficients due to its higher numerical dissipation, contrasting\nwith the more stable behavior observed with the fourth order scheme, which\nbetter captures resolved scales and results in smaller dynamic coefficients.\nDespite inherent differences in SGS models and discretization schemes, the\nfinal velocity distributions in one dimensional turbulence simulations were\nremarkably consistent, suggesting a limited influence of SGS modeling on\nlarge-scale structures in simplified turbulence scenarios. However, notable\nvariations in resolved-scale kinetic energy were uncovered, emphasizing the\nimportance of accurately capturing small-scale turbulence structures for\nprecise energy dissipation predictions in LES.",

Moreover, event\ncameras have high dynamic ranges that can effectively handle scenarios with\ncomplex lighting conditions, such as low light or high contrast environments.\nHowever, using event cameras introduces challenges in modeling the spatially\nsparse and high temporal resolution event data for HAR. To address these\nissues, we propose the SpikMamba framework, which combines the energy\nefficiency of spiking neural networks and the long sequence modeling capability\nof Mamba to efficiently capture global features from spatially sparse and high\na temporal resolution event data. Additionally, to improve the locality of\nmodeling, a spiking window-based linear attention mechanism is used. Extensive\nexperiments show that SpikMamba achieves remarkable recognition performance,\nsurpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 1.45%, 7.22%, 0.15%, and 3.92% on\nthe PAF, HARDVS, DVS128, and E-FAction datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "We consider a housing market model with limited externalities where agents\ncare both about their own consumption via demand preferences and about the\nagent who receives their endowment via supply preferences (we extend the\nassociated lexicographic preference domains introduced in Klaus and Meo, 2023).\nIf preferences are demand lexicographic, then our model extends the classical\nShapley-Scarf housing market (Shapley and Scarf, 1974) with strict preferences\nmodel. Our main result is a characterization of the corresponding top trading\ncycles (TTC) rule by individual rationality, pair efficiency, and\nstrategy-proofness (Theorem 1), which extends that of Ekici (2024) from\nclassical Shapley-Scarf housing markets with strict preferences to our model.\nTwo further characterizations are immediately obtained by strengthening pair\nefficiency to either Pareto efficiency or pairwise stability (Corollaries 1 and\n2). Finally, we show that as soon as we extend the preference domain to include\ndemand lexicographic as well as supply lexicographic preferences (e.g., when\npreferences are separable), no rule satisfying individual rationality, pair\nefficiency, and strategy-proofness exists (Theorem 2).",

This paper argues\nthat current European product legislation, which aims to protect consumers of,\ninter alia, IoT devices, has a blind spot for an increasing problem in the\ncompetitive IoT market: manufacturer cessation. Without the manufacturer's\ncloud servers, many IoT devices cannot perform core functions such as data\nanalysis.

    "abstract": "The light curves and spectra of many Type I and Type II supernovae (SNe) are\nheavily influenced by the interaction of the SN ejecta with circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. The observed diversity shows\nthat many progenitors have undergone some level of stripping and polluted their\nCSM shortly before the explosion. The presence of a binary companion and the\nmass transfer that can ensue offers a mechanism that can give rise to this\ndiversity. We present a set of detailed massive evolutionary models in which\nthe donor star, a Red Supergiant (RSG) is in a wide orbit around a\nmain-sequence companion, and undergoes stable or unstable mass transfer in the\nlater stages of evolution, up to the moment of core collapse. We also discuss\nsome significant physics of these systems that may impact our results, from the\npresence of pulsations and extended atmospheres in RSGs, to the initial\neccentricity of the orbit. The resulting SN types range from Type IIP to\nH-deficient IIb and H-free Ib. In models undergoing stable mass transfer, the\nmaterial lost during this process is expected to form a dense CSM surrounding\nthe system by the time of core collapse and give rise to significant\ninteraction effects in the SN light curve and spectra. In the systems with\nunstable mass transfer mass transfer, the SN may occur during common-envelope\nevolution. In this case, the progenitor may show significant variability in the\nlast few thousand years before core collapse, and the following SN will likely\nexhibit strong interaction effects.",

    "abstract": "This booklet on Active Assisted Living (AAL) technologies has been created as\npart of the GoodBrother COST Action, which has run from 2020 to 2024. COST\nActions are European research programs that promote collaboration across\nborders, uniting researchers, professionals, and institutions to address key\nsocietal challenges. GoodBrother focused on ethical and privacy concerns\nsurrounding video and audio monitoring in care settings. The aim was to ensure\nthat while AAL technologies help older adults and vulnerable individuals, their\nprivacy and data protection rights remain a top priority.\n  This booklet is designed to guide you through the role that AAL technologies\nplay in improving the quality of life for older adults, caregivers, and people\nwith disabilities. AAL technologies offer tools for those facing cognitive or\nphysical challenges. They can enhance independence, assist with daily routines,\nand promote a safer living environment. However, the rise of these technologies\nalso brings important questions about data protection and user autonomy.\n  This resource is intended for a wide audience, including end users,\ncaregivers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers. It provides practical\nguidance on integrating AAL technologies into care settings while safeguarding\nprivacy and ensuring ethical use. The insights offered here aim to empower\nusers and caregivers to make informed choices that enhance both the quality of\ncare and respect for personal autonomy.",

In daily clinical practice, clinicians exhibit robustness in\nidentifying polyps with both location and size variations. It is uncertain if\ndeep segmentation models can achieve comparable robustness in automated\ncolonoscopic analysis. To benchmark the model robustness, we focus on\nevaluating the robustness of segmentation models on the polyps with various\nattributes (e.g. location and size) and healthy samples. Based on the Latent\nDiffusion Model, we perform attribute editing on real polyps and build a new\ndataset named Polyp-E. Our synthetic dataset boasts exceptional realism, to the\nextent that clinical experts find it challenging to discern them from real\ndata. We evaluate several existing polyp segmentation models on the proposed\nbenchmark. The results reveal most of the models are highly sensitive to\nattribute variations. As a novel data augmentation technique, the proposed\nediting pipeline can improve both in-distribution and out-of-distribution\ngeneralization ability. The code and datasets will be released.",

    "abstract": "A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication system is considered in this\npaper wherein the transmitter, Alice modulates secret keys, by using a\ncontinuous variable quantum key distribution technique to be transmitted to the\nreceiver, Bob, which employs homodyne detection for data decoding. The data is\ntransmitted over two paths, namely a direct path between Alice and Bob and the\nwireless path between them via the RIS. Transmit and receive beamsplitters are\nemployed in the system to transform the MIMO terahertz channels into parallel\nsingle-input single-output channels. Considering an eavesdropper, Eve, to\nattack all the three wireless channels in the system (i.e., the direct channel,\nthe channel between Alice and RIS, and between the RIS and Bob) but having\nrestricted quantum memory limiting it to store the ancilla modes from either of\nthese three wireless channels, novel expressions for the secret key rate (SKR)\nof the system are derived. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the\ndependency of the system's performance on various system parameters. It is\nobserved that the RIS plays a key role in increasing the SKR of the system and\nthe transmission distance, ensuring secure communications between Alice and\nBob. The significance of employing RIS is observed specifically for the case\nwhen Eve measures the ancilla modes of the channel between the RIS and Bob.\nFurthermore, for all such measurement scenarios, optimal angles are obtained\nfor the phase shifts of the RIS elements to maximize the SKR for various MIMO\nconfigurations and transmission distance between Alice and Bob.",

In this\nwork, we present an empirical sample of 5105 M-type star spectra with\nhomogeneous atmospheric parameter labels through stellar-label transfer and\nsample cleaning. We addressed systematic discrepancies in spectroscopic\nparameter estimates by adopting recent results for Gaia EDR3 stars as a\nreference standard. Then, we used a density-based spatial clustering of\napplications with noise to remove unreliable samples in each subgrid of\nparameters. To confirm the reliability of the stellar labels, a 5-layer neural\nnetwork was utilized, randomly partitioning the samples into training and\ntesting sets. The standard deviations between the predicted and actual values\nin the testing set are 14 K for Teff , 0.06 dex for log g, and 0.05 dex for\n[M/H], respectively. In addition, we conducted an internal cross-validation to\nenhance validation and obtained precisions of 11 K, 0.05 dex, and 0.05 dex for\nTeff , log g, and [M/H], respectively. A grid of 1365 high Signal-to-Noise\nratio (S/N) spectra and their labels, selected from the empirical sample, was\nutilized in the stellar parameter pipeline for M-Type stars (LASPM) of the\nLarge Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), producing\nan almost seamless Kiel distribution diagram for LAMOST DR10 and DR11 data.

One such\nsetting is collision-free motion optimization for robot manipulation, where\noptimization converges quickly on easy problems but struggle in obstacle dense\nenvironments (e.g., a cluttered cabinet or table). In these situations,\ngraph-based planning algorithms are used to obtain seeds, resulting in\nsignificant slowdowns. We propose DiffusionSeeder, a diffusion based approach\nthat generates trajectories to seed motion optimization for rapid robot motion\nplanning. DiffusionSeeder takes the initial depth image observation of the\nscene and generates high quality, multi-modal trajectories that are then\nfine-tuned with a few iterations of motion optimization. We integrate\nDiffusionSeeder to generate the seed trajectories for cuRobo, a GPU-accelerated\nmotion optimization method, which results in 12x speed up on average, and 36x\nspeed up for more complicated problems, while achieving 10% higher success rate\nin partially observed simulation environments. Our results show the\neffectiveness of using diverse solutions from a learned diffusion model.\nPhysical experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate the sim2real transfer of\nDiffusionSeeder to the real robot, with an average success rate of 86% and\nplanning time of 26ms, improving on cuRobo by 51% higher success rate while\nalso being 2.5x faster.",

    "abstract": "Partial graph matching extends traditional graph matching by allowing some\nnodes to remain unmatched, enabling applications in more complex scenarios.\nHowever, this flexibility introduces additional complexity, as both the subset\nof nodes to match and the optimal mapping must be determined. While recent\nstudies have explored deep learning techniques for partial graph matching, a\nsignificant limitation remains: the absence of an optimization objective that\nfully captures the problem's intrinsic nature while enabling efficient\nsolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework for partial\ngraph matching, inspired by optimal partial transport. Our approach formulates\nan objective that enables partial assignments while incorporating matching\nbiases, using weighted total variation as the divergence function to guarantee\noptimal partial assignments. Our method can achieve efficient, exact solutions\nwithin cubic worst case time complexity. Our contributions are threefold: (i)\nwe introduce a novel optimization objective that balances matched and unmatched\nnodes; (ii) we establish a connection between partial graph matching and linear\nsum assignment problem, enabling efficient solutions; (iii) we propose a deep\ngraph matching architecture with a novel partial matching loss, providing an\nend-to-end solution. The empirical evaluations on standard graph matching\nbenchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Paradoxically, while the assumptions of second-order stationarity and\nisotropy appear outdated in light of modern spatial data, they remain\nremarkably robust in practice, as nonstationary methods often provide marginal\nimprovements in predictive performance. This limitation reflects a fundamental\ntrade-off: nonparametric approaches, while offering extreme flexibility,\nrequire substantial tuning to avoid overfitting and numerical challenges in\npractice, while parametric approaches are more robust against overfitting but\nare constrained in flexibility, often facing considerable numerical challenges\nas flexibility increases. In this article we introduce a parametric class of\ncovariance functions that extends the use of parametric nonstationary spatial\nmodels, aiming to compete with the flexibility and local adaptability of\nnonparametric approaches. The covariance function is modular in the sense that\nallows for separate parametric structures for different sources of\nnonstationarity, such as marginal standard deviation, geometric anisotropy, and\nsmoothness. The proposed covariance function retains the practical\nidentifiability and computational stability of parametric forms while closing\nthe performance gap with fully nonparametric methods. A Mat\\'ern stationary\nisotropic model is nested within the complex model and can be adapted such that\nit is computationally feasible for handling thousands of observations. A\ntwo-stage approach can be employed for model selection. We explore the\nstatistical properties of the presented approach, demonstrate its compatibility\nwith the frequentist paradigm, and highlight the interpretability of its\nparameters.

In this paper, we report\nexperiments on three ways of using data (training-workflows), across three\ngenerative model task-settings (multivariate Gaussian estimation, kernel\ndensity estimation, and language-model fine-tuning) to further confirm the\npossibility of containment: (a) we confirm that the training-workflow of {\\it\nreplacing} all real data by successive generations of purely synthetic data\nindeed suffers model collapse in all task-settings studied; (b) we consider the\ntraining-workflow of {\\it accumulating} synthetic data alongside real data and\ntraining on all data combined and confirming that, although the proportion of\nreal data eventually becomes zero, models remain stable and their test losses\ndo not diverge under this training-workflow; (c) we consider a\ntraining-workflow where real and synthetic data accumulate together but\nsuccessive generations of pretraining are constrained to use fixed-size data\nsubsets each generation. In this workflow, we observe slow and gradual rather\nthan explosive degradation of test loss performance across generations.

The results show that the increase of quantum parameter $\\lambda$\ncauses the shadow to shrink, while increases the deviation from circularity.\nAnd, the shadow's angular diameter of M87* impose stronger constraints on the\nobserved properties of the no-singulgar rotating black holes by comparing with\nSgrA*. For a celestial light source, the parameter $\\lambda$ indeed influences\nthe distortion of light around black hole shadow, but this effect is relatively\nsmall and only becomes noticeable when extremely close to the shadow. When a\nthin accretion disk around black hole, it turns out that for an observer at any\nposition, the parameter $\\lambda$ has little effect on the shape of the inner\nshadow. However, it decreases the size of the inner shadow, reduces the\nobserved light intensity, and narrows the redshifted shadow images, regardless\nof whether the accretion disk is prograde or retrograde. Meanwhile, it is true\nthat the thin disk images of black hole cannot effectively reflect the internal\nstructure of black hole. Finally, we can conclude that a key observational\nfeature of these non-singular rotating black holes is that the larger the black\nhole's spin parameter, the smaller the upper limit of $\\lambda'$s effect. And,\nthe parameter $\\lambda$ decreases the gravitational field's strength, thereby\nweakens the observed images. This could provide a possible way to constraining\nblack hole parameters, identifying quantum gravity effects, and distinguishing\nloop quantum gravity black holes, even if it cannot be used to distinguish the\nnon-singular properties of black hole.",

In this work, we introduce a novel\nframework DENOASR, which is a selective denoising technique to reduce the\ndisparity in the word error rates between the two gender groups, male and\nfemale. We find that a combination of two popular speech denoising techniques,\nviz. DEMUCS and LE, can be effectively used to mitigate ASR disparity without\ncompromising their overall performance.

For a given dataset, the denoising is selectively applied on speech\nsamples having speech intelligibility below a certain threshold, estimated\nusing a small validation sample, thus ameliorating the need for large-scale\nhuman-written ground-truth transcripts.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown\nremarkable proficiency, prompting growing interest in AQA among researchers.\nHowever, RTR-based AQA often suffers from irrelevant knowledge and rapidly\nchanging information, even when LLMs are adopted, while post-hoc\nretrieval-based AQA struggles with comprehending long-form answers with complex\nlogic, and precisely identifying the content needing revision and preserving\nthe original intent. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes an Atomic\nfact decomposition-based Retrieval and Editing (ARE) framework, which\ndecomposes the generated long-form answers into molecular clauses and atomic\nfacts by the instruction-tuned LLMs. Notably, the instruction-tuned LLMs are\nfine-tuned using a well-constructed dataset, generated from large scale\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs). This process involves extracting one-hop neighbors from\na given set of entities and transforming the result into coherent long-form\ntext. Subsequently, ARE leverages a search engine to retrieve evidences related\nto atomic facts, inputting these evidences into an LLM-based verifier to\ndetermine whether the facts require expansion for re-retrieval or editing.\nFurthermore, the edited facts are backtracked into the original answer, with\nevidence aggregated based on the relationship between molecular clauses and\natomic facts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our\nproposed method over the state-of-the-arts on several datasets, with an\nadditionally proposed new metric $Attr_{p}$ for evaluating the precision of\nevidence attribution.",

    "abstract": "In ports, a variety of tasks are carried out, and scheduling these tasks is\ncrucial due to its significant impact on productivity, making the generation of\nprecise plans essential. This study proposes a method to solve the Quay Crane\nScheduling Problem (QCSP), a representative task scheduling problem in ports\nknown to be NP-Hard, more quickly and accurately. First, the study suggests a\nmethod to create more accurate work plans for Quay Cranes (QCs) by learning\nfrom actual port data to accurately predict the working speed of QCs. Next, a\nSurrogate Model is proposed by combining a Machine Learning (ML) model with a\nGenetic Algorithm (GA), which is widely used to solve complex optimization\nproblems, enabling faster and more precise exploration of solutions. Unlike\nmethods that use fixed-dimensional chromosome encoding, the proposed\nmethodology can provide solutions for encodings of various dimensions. To\nvalidate the performance of the newly proposed methodology, comparative\nexperiments were conducted, demonstrating faster search speeds and improved\nfitness scores. The method proposed in this study can be applied not only to\nQCSP but also to various NP-Hard problems, and it opens up possibilities for\nthe further development of advanced search algorithms by combining heuristic\nalgorithms with ML models.",

Under $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm variations,\nour bounds are found to be close to an existing upper bound (Hong et al.,\n2023). Under RKHS norm variations, the upper and lower bounds are still\nreasonably close but with more of a gap, raising the interesting open question\nof whether non-minor improvements in the upper bound are possible.",

However, superfluids can also emerge from particles\npossessing distinct electromagnetic properties. In particular, there has been\ngrowing interest in superfluids composed of charge-neutral particles with\nmagnetic or electric dipole moments, such as Bose-Einstein condensates of\nmagnons or excitons. Despite this interest, the electromagnetic response of\ndipole superfluids, including potential analogs or contrasts to the Meissner\neffect, remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a Ginzburg-Landau\nphenomenological theory to describe magnetic and electric dipole superfluids\nsubjected to pseudo-magnetic fields induced by geometric phases. For magnetic\ndipole superfluids interacting with the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase, we find\nthat they form vortex lattices with sharply localized pseudo-magnetic fields\nalong hexagonal domain walls, leading to singular and discontinuous change of\nphysical variables at these boundaries. For electric dipole superfluids\ninfluenced by the He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) phase, in contrast, we identify\nvortex lattices where the pseudo-magnetic field and supercurrent are\nconcentrated at vortex cores, resembling superconductors.

Reproducing training instabilities can be costly, so we use a small\nlanguage model with 830M parameters and experiment with higher learning rates\nto force models to diverge. One of the sources of training instability is the\ngrowth of logits in attention layers. We extend the focus of the previous work\nand look not only at the magnitude of the logits but at all outputs of linear\nlayers in the Transformer block. We observe that with a high learning rate the\nL2 norm of all linear layer outputs can grow with each training step and the\nmodel diverges. Specifically we observe that QKV, Proj and FC2 layers have the\nlargest growth of the output magnitude. This prompts us to explore several\noptions: 1) apply layer normalization not only after QK layers but also after\nProj and FC2 layers too; 2) apply layer normalization after the QKV layer (and\nremove pre normalization). 3) apply QK layer normalization together with\nsoftmax capping. We show that with the last two methods we can increase\nlearning rate by 1.5x (without model divergence) in comparison to an approach\nbased on QK layer normalization only. Also we observe significant perplexity\nimprovements for all three methods in comparison to the baseline model.",

Finally, we present insights from current studies and highlight\npromising directions for future research. We aim for this work to serve as a\ncomprehensive resource, fostering further advancements in causal reasoning with\nLMs.",

However, like the classical OT problem, GW\nimposes an equal mass constraint between measures, which restricts its\napplication in many machine learning tasks. To address this limitation, the\npartial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW) problem has been introduced. It relaxes the\nequal mass constraint, allowing the comparison of general positive Radon\nmeasures. Despite this, both GW and PGW face significant computational\nchallenges due to their non-convex nature. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose the linear partial Gromov-Wasserstein (LPGW) embedding, a linearized\nembedding technique for the PGW problem. For $K$ different metric measure\nspaces, the pairwise computation of the PGW distance requires solving the PGW\nproblem ${O}(K^2)$ times. In contrast, the proposed linearization technique\nreduces this to ${O}(K)$ times. Similar to the linearization technique for the\nclassical OT problem, we prove that LPGW defines a valid metric for metric\nmeasure spaces. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPGW in practical\napplications such as shape retrieval and learning with transport-based\nembeddings, showing that LPGW preserves the advantages of PGW in partial\nmatching while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.

This\nreview article explores the recent advancements and future prospects of VQA in\nophthalmology from both theoretical and practical perspectives, aiming to\nprovide eye care professionals with a deeper understanding and tools for\nleveraging the underlying models. Additionally, we discuss the promising trend\nof large language models (LLM) in enhancing various components of the VQA\nframework to adapt to multimodal ophthalmic tasks. Despite the promising\noutlook, ophthalmic VQA still faces several challenges, including the scarcity\nof annotated multimodal image datasets, the necessity of comprehensive and\nunified evaluation methods, and the obstacles to achieving effective real-world\napplications. This article highlights these challenges and clarifies future\ndirections for advancing ophthalmic VQA with LLMs. The development of LLM-based\nophthalmic VQA systems calls for collaborative efforts between medical\nprofessionals and AI experts to overcome existing obstacles and advance the\ndiagnosis and care of eye diseases.",

This paper introduces two\nnovel and efficient approaches (DualMD and DistillMD) to protect diffusion\nmodels against MIAs while maintaining high utility. Both methods are based on\ntraining two separate diffusion models on disjoint subsets of the original\ndataset. DualMD then employs a private inference pipeline that utilizes both\nmodels. This strategy significantly reduces the risk of black-box MIAs by\nlimiting the information any single model contains about individual training\nsamples. The dual models can also generate \"soft targets\" to train a private\nstudent model in DistillMD, enhancing privacy guarantees against all types of\nMIAs. Extensive evaluations of DualMD and DistillMD against state-of-the-art\nMIAs across various datasets in white-box and black-box settings demonstrate\ntheir effectiveness in substantially reducing MIA success rates while\npreserving competitive image generation performance. Notably, our experiments\nreveal that DistillMD not only defends against MIAs but also mitigates model\nmemorization, indicating that both vulnerabilities stem from overfitting and\ncan be addressed simultaneously with our unified approach.",

Seemingly simple solutions to reduce memory consumption are\n(1) to quantize LLM models, i.e., converting the weights of a LLM from\nhigh-precision values to lower-precision ones. and (2) to make beam search\nsequential, i.e., forwarding each beam through the model sequentially and then\nconcatenate them back into a single model output. However, we show that these\napproaches still do not work via both theoretical analysis and experiments. To\naddress this, we introduce FLAMES, a novel LLM-based APR technique that employs\nsemantic-guided patch generation to enhance repair effectiveness and memory\nefficiency. Unlike conventional methods that rely on beam search, FLAMES\nutilizes greedy decoding to enhance memory efficiency while steering the search\nto more potentially good repair candidates via a semantic-guided best-first\nsearch algorithm. At each decoding step, FLAMES uses semantic feedback from\ntest validation such as the number of passing and failing test cases to select\nthe most promising token to explore further. Our empirical evaluation on the\nDefects4J and HumanEval-Java datasets shows that FLAMES not only substantially\nreduces memory consumption by up to 83% compared to conventional LLM-based APR,\nbut also accelerates the repair process. Remarkably, FLAMES successfully\ngenerated 133 and 103 correct fixes for 333 and 163 bugs in the Defects4J and\nHumanEval-Java datasets, respectively. This suggests that FLAMES is not only\nmore efficient but also outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, fixing at\nleast 10 and 11 more bugs than SOTA baselines in the Defects4J and\nHumanEval-Java datasets, respectively.",

Compact galaxies typically exhibit lower\nHI gas fractions, higher dust extinction, higher metallicity, greater mass\nconcentration, and lower angular momentum on a global scale. Radial profiles of\nstellar mass surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\ast}$) and star formation rate surface\ndensity ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$), as functions of the effective radius ($R/$$R_{\\rm\ne}$), reveal that compact galaxies display steeper gradients and higher values,\nresulting in elevated specific star formation rates (sSFR) in their inner\nregions compared to their outskirts. At a given $\\Sigma_{\\ast}$, compact\ngalaxies have higher sSFR than extended galaxies, particularly in low-mass\ngalaxies (log($M_{\\ast}$/$M_{\\odot}$)$\\,\\leq\\,$10$^{10}$). Additionally, their\nmetallicity profiles differ significantly: extended galaxies have steeper\nmetallicity gradients, while compact galaxies exhibit flatter slopes and higher\nmetallicity at a given $R/$$R_{\\rm e}$. After accounting for the dependence of\nmetallicity on $M_{\\ast}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\ast}$, no further correlation with SFR\nis observed. The combination of higher sSFR and potentially higher star\nformation efficiency in compact galaxies suggests that their central gas is\nbeing rapidly consumed, leading to older stellar populations, as indicated by\nD$_{n}$(4000) and EW(H$\\delta_A$), and resulting in faster central growth.

Specifically, enrollment utterances\nare separated and grouped by keywords from the training batch and their\nembedding centroids are compared to all other test utterance embeddings to\ncompute the loss. This simulates runtime enrollment and verification stages,\nand improves convergence stability and training speed by optimizing matrix\noperations compared to SOTA triplet loss approaches. To benchmark different\nmodels reliably, we propose an evaluation process that mimics the production\nenvironment and compute metrics that directly measure keyword matching\naccuracy. Trained with GE2E loss, our 419KB quantized conformer model beats a\n7.5GB ASR encoder by 23.6% relative AUC, and beats a same size triplet loss\nmodel by 60.7% AUC. Our KWS models are natively streamable with low memory\nfootprints, and designed to continuously run on-device with no retraining\nneeded for new keywords (zero-shot).",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models excel at creating visually impressive images but often\nstruggle to generate images with a specified topology. The Betti number, which\nrepresents the number of structures in an image, is a fundamental measure in\ntopology. Yet, diffusion models fail to satisfy even this basic constraint.\nThis limitation restricts their utility in applications requiring exact\ncontrol, like robotics and environmental modeling. To address this, we propose\nTopoDiffusionNet (TDN), a novel approach that enforces diffusion models to\nmaintain the desired topology. We leverage tools from topological data\nanalysis, particularly persistent homology, to extract the topological\nstructures within an image. We then design a topology-based objective function\nto guide the denoising process, preserving intended structures while\nsuppressing noisy ones. Our experiments across four datasets demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in topological accuracy. TDN is the first to integrate\ntopology with diffusion models, opening new avenues of research in this area.\nCode available at https://github.com/Saumya-Gupta-26/TopoDiffusionNet",

We provide some motivation for TCA, arguing that it ought to be\ntaken seriously and not simply dismissed. We also review recent objections to\nTCA, arguing that these objections are weighty. We thus confront the following\ndilemma: how can we do justice to both the considerations for and against TCA?\nWe consider two influential responses to this dilemma - the first appeals to\nthe notion of proxy-assertion; the second appeals to fictionalism - and argue\nthat neither is satisfactory. Instead, reflecting on the ontogenesis of\nassertion, we argue that we need to make space for a category of\nproto-assertion.

However, current deep learning-based AAR models are trained\nsolely on datasets of individual animal species, constraining their\napplicability in practice and performing poorly when training data are limited.\nIn this study, we propose a one-for-many framework, dubbed Cross-species\nKnowledge Sharing and Preserving (CKSP), based on sensor data of diverse animal\nspecies. Given the coexistence of generic and species-specific behavioural\npatterns among different species, we design a Shared-Preserved Convolution\n(SPConv) module. This module assigns an individual low-rank convolutional layer\nto each species for extracting species-specific features and employs a shared\nfull-rank convolutional layer to learn generic features, enabling the CKSP\nframework to learn inter-species complementarity and alleviating data\nlimitations via increasing data diversity. Considering the training conflict\narising from discrepancies in data distributions among species, we devise a\nSpecies-specific Batch Normalization (SBN) module, that involves multiple BN\nlayers to separately fit the distributions of different species. To validate\nCKSP's effectiveness, experiments are performed on three public datasets from\nhorses, sheep, and cattle, respectively. The results show that our approach\nremarkably boosts the classification performance compared to the baseline\nmethod (one-for-one framework) solely trained on individual-species data, with\nincrements of 6.04%, 2.06%, and 3.66% in accuracy, and 10.33%, 3.67%, and 7.90%\nin F1-score for the horse, sheep, and cattle datasets, respectively.

The generality of the p-SWAP gate is proposed for quantum Phase\noracles requiring a desirable p for a set of swapped qubits, as well as for\nquantum Boolean oracles when p is ignored.

It is known that nonlinear conductivities\nare sensitive to the strength and type of SOI, however, many calculations of\nnonlinear transport coefficients are based on the semiclassical Boltzmann\ntheory and make simplifying assumptions about scattering effects due to\ndisorder. In this paper we develop and employ a microscopic theory based on the\nKeldysh formalism that goes beyond simple semiclassical approximations. This\napproach, for instance, naturally takes into account the effects of interband\ntransitions, Berry curvature, and allows for a more precise treatment of\nimpurity scattering. As a test of this formalism, we consider the nonlinear\ntransport properties in an effective two-band model of one-dimensional\nnanowires (1DNWs) and two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) in the presence of a\nmagnetic field causing Zeeman splittings of the spin states. We find that the\nsmall energy scales in nanostructures mean that interband contributions can be\nrelevant, especially in the dirty limit, and therefore could modify qualitative\nfeatures found using a purely semiclassical approach. Nonetheless, we find that\ndifferent types of SOI (linear or cubic) still result in remarkably pronounced\ndifferent in-plane field angle dependences, which survive even when interband\neffects are relevant. Our results provide a detailed understanding of when\ninterband effects become important for nonlinear transport and can serve as the\nbasis for a microscopic description to predict other nonlinear transport\neffects in materials and devices.",

The instrument takes a comprehensive approach to obtain\nglobal coronal spatial and spectral information, improve the detected cadence\nand avoid overlapping.

The spectral resolving power of the optical system\nwith an aperture diameter of 150 mm are optimized to be greater than 1461. The\nspatial resolution along the slits direction and the scanning direction are\nabout 4.4''and 6.86'', respectively.

We\npresent benchmarks in terms of policy performance and control smoothness on\ntraditional RL environments from the Gymnasium and a complex manipulation task,\nas well as three robotics locomotion tasks that include deployment and\nevaluation with real-world hardware. Finally, we also propose hybrid methods\nthat combine elements from both loss regularization and architectural methods.\nWe find that the best-performing hybrid outperforms other methods, and improves\ncontrol smoothness by 26.8% over the baseline, with a worst-case performance\ndegradation of just 2.8%.",

However, conventional\nbeamforming codebook design based on array response vectors for narrowband\ncommunications may suffer from severe performance loss in wideband systems due\nto the ``beam squint\" effect over frequency. To tackle this issue, we propose\nin this paper a new codebook design method for analog beamforming in wideband\nTHz systems. In particular, to characterize the analog beamforming performance\nin wideband systems, we propose a new metric termed wideband beam gain, which\nis given by the minimum beamforming gain over the entire frequency band given a\ntarget angle. Based on this metric, a wideband analog beamforming codebook\ndesign problem is formulated for optimally balancing the beamforming gains in\nboth the spatial and frequency domains, and the performance loss of\nconventional narrowband beamforming in wideband systems is analyzed. To solve\nthe new wideband beamforming codebook design problem, we divide the spatial\ndomain into orthogonal angular zones each associated with one beam, thereby\ndecoupling the codebook design into a zone division sub-problem and a set of\nbeamforming optimization sub-problems each for one zone. For the zone division\nsub-problem, we propose a bisection method to obtain the optimal boundaries for\nseparating adjacent zones. While for each of the per-zone-based beamforming\noptimization sub-problems, we further propose an efficient augmented Lagrange\nmethod (ALM) to solve it. Numerical results demonstrate the performance\nsuperiority of our proposed codebook design for wideband analog beamforming to\nthe narrowband beamforming codebook and also validate our performance analysis.",

Despite the availability of\nvarious offline-feature-extractors that offer diverse information from\ndifferent perspectives, they have several limitations due to fixed parameters.\nConcretely, these extractors are solely pre-trained on image/video\ncomprehension tasks, making them less adaptable to video caption datasets.\nAdditionally, most of these extractors only capture features prior to the\nclassifier of the pre-training task, ignoring a significant amount of valuable\nshallow information. Furthermore, employing multiple offline-features may\nintroduce redundant information. To address these issues, we propose an\nend-to-end encoder-decoder-based network (EVC-MF) for video captioning, which\nefficiently utilizes multi-scale visual and textual features to generate video\ndescriptions. Specifically, EVC-MF consists of three modules. Firstly, instead\nof relying on multiple feature extractors, we directly feed video frames into a\ntransformer-based network to obtain multi-scale visual features and update\nfeature extractor parameters. Secondly, we fuse the multi-scale features and\ninput them into a masked encoder to reduce redundancy and encourage learning\nuseful features. Finally, we utilize an enhanced transformer-based decoder,\nwhich can efficiently leverage shallow textual information, to generate video\ndescriptions. To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments\non benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the weak gravitational lensing phenomenon for a recently\nproposed rotating regular black hole with an asymptotically Minkowski core\ncharacterized by a sub-Planckian curvature was investigated. Using the\nGauss-Bonnet Theorem, the deflection of light in the weak limit was computed by\ntaking the black hole as a lens at a finite distance from both the source and\nthe observer. It was shown that the weak deflection angle slightly differs\nbetween the prograde and retrograde motion but both eventually converge to $0$\nas $b$ increases. Moreover, the deflection angle correction for Kerr classical\nblack hole and this sort of rotating regular black hole is a decreasing\nfunction for large values of $b$. It was also shown that the weak deflection\nangle for this sort of regular black hole is similar to Bardeen and Hayward\nblack hole given its corresponding values for the parameters $x$ and $n$",

To construct\na real-time and reliable online log anomaly detection model, we propose OMLog,\na semi-supervised online meta-learning method, to effectively tackle the\ndistribution shift issue caused by changes in log event types and frequencies.\nSpecifically, we introduce a maximum mean discrepancy-based distribution shift\ndetection method to identify distribution changes in unseen log sequences.\nDepending on the identified distribution gap, the method can automatically\ntrigger online fine-grained detection or offline fast inference.

Existing approaches predominantly focus on Euclidean data, such\nas images and videos, while the exploration of non-Euclidean graph data remains\nscarce. Recent graph neural network (GNN) approaches can suffer from serious\nperformance decline due to domain shift and label scarcity in source-free\nadaptation scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel method named Graph\nDiffusion-based Alignment with Jigsaw (GALA), tailored for source-free graph\ndomain adaptation. To achieve domain alignment, GALA employs a graph diffusion\nmodel to reconstruct source-style graphs from target data. Specifically, a\nscore-based graph diffusion model is trained using source graphs to learn the\ngenerative source styles. Then, we introduce perturbations to target graphs via\na stochastic differential equation instead of sampling from a prior, followed\nby the reverse process to reconstruct source-style graphs. We feed the\nsource-style graphs into an off-the-shelf GNN and introduce class-specific\nthresholds with curriculum learning, which can generate accurate and unbiased\npseudo-labels for target graphs.

When modeling environmental phenomena with a robot, gathering high\nresolution information can be resource intensive. Actively gathering data and\nmodeling flows with the data is a more efficient alternative. However, in such\nscenarios, data is often sparse and thus requires flow modeling techniques that\nare effective at capturing the relevant dynamical features of the flow to\nensure high prediction accuracy of the resulting models. To accomplish this\neffectively, regions with high informative value must be identified. We propose\nEnKode, an active sampling approach based on Koopman Operator theory and\nensemble methods that can build high quality flow models and effectively\nestimate model uncertainty. For modeling complex flows, EnKode provides\ncomparable or better estimates of unsampled flow regions than Gaussian Process\nRegression models with hyperparameter optimization. Additionally, our active\nsensing scheme provides more accurate flow estimates than comparable strategies\nthat rely on uniform sampling. We evaluate EnKode using three common\nbenchmarking systems: the Bickley Jet, Lid-Driven Cavity flow with an obstacle,\nand real ocean currents from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA).",

This problem\nfinds important applications including viral marketing, infection detection,\nand misinformation containment. The conventional IM problem is typically\nstudied with the oversimplified goal of selecting a single seed set. Many\nreal-world scenarios call for multiple sets of seeds, particularly on social\nmedia platforms where various viral marketing campaigns need different sets of\nseeds to propagate effectively. To this end, previous works have formulated\nvarious IM variants, central to which is the requirement of multiple seed sets,\nnaturally modeled as a matroid constraint. However, the current best-known\nsolutions for these variants either offer a weak\n$(1/2-\\epsilon)$-approximation, or offer a $(1-1/e-\\epsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithm that is very expensive. We propose an efficient seed selection method\ncalled AMP, an algorithm with a $(1-1/e-\\epsilon)$-approximation guarantee for\nthis family of IM variants. To further improve efficiency, we also devise a\nfast implementation, called RAMP. We extensively evaluate the performance of\nour proposal against 6 competitors across 4 IM variants and on 7 real-world\nnetworks, demonstrating that our proposal outperforms all competitors in terms\nof result quality, running time, and memory usage.

Charring ablative\nmaterials, when subjected to aerodynamic heating from hypersonic flows, undergo\ncomplex processes such as ablation and pyrolysis, involving heterogeneous and\nhomogeneous chemical reactions. These multi-physical phenomena are simulated by\na multicomponent material thermal response (MTR) solver that takes into account\nthe complexity of component of pyrolysis gases. The species concentrations are\ncalculated to improve the accuracy of transport and thermophysical parameters\nof pyrolysis gases. The MTR solver implements implicit time integration on\nfinite difference discretization form to achieve higher efficiency. The\nnumerical solutions of hypersonic flows and material thermal response are\ncoupled through a gas-surface interaction interface based on surface mass and\nenergy balance on the ablating surface. The coupled simulation employs the dual\ntime-step technique, which introduces pseudo time step to improve temporal\naccuracy. The explicit coupling mechanism updates the interfacial quantities at\nphysical time steps, which achieves higher computational efficiency, but\nintroduces time discretization errors and numerical oscillations of interfacial\nquantities. In contrast, the implicit coupling mechanism updates the\ninterfacial quantities at pseudo time steps, which reduces the temporal\ndiscretization error and suppresses numerical oscillations, but is less\nefficient. In addition, a simplified ablation boundary based on steady-state\nablation assumption or radiation-equilibrium assumption is proposed to\napproximate solid heat conduction without coupling the MTR solution, providing\nquasi-steady flow solutions in the presence of ablation.",

The variable scalar coefficient $a>0$ and source term $f$ may exhibit\ndiscontinuities across $\\Gamma$. By utilizing a biorthogonal wavelet basis\nderived from bilinear finite elements, which serves as a Riesz basis for\n$H^1_0(\\Omega)$, we devise a strategy that achieves nearly optimal convergence\nrates: $O(h^2 |\\log(h)|^2)$ in the $L_2(\\Omega)$-norm and $O(h |\\log(h)|)$ in\nthe $H^1(\\Omega)$-norm with respect to the approximation order. To handle the\ngeometry of $\\Gamma$ and the singularities of the solution $u$, which has a\ndiscontinuous gradient across $\\Gamma$, additional wavelet elements are\nintroduced along the interface. The dual part of the biorthogonal wavelet basis\nplays a crucial role in proving these convergence rates. We develop weighted\nBessel properties for wavelets, derive various inequalities in fractional\nSobolev spaces, and employ finite element arguments to establish the\ntheoretical convergence results. To achieve higher accuracy and effectively\nhandle high-contrast coefficients $a$, our method, much like meshfree\napproaches, relies on augmenting the number of wavelet elements throughout the\ndomain and near the interface, eliminating the need for re-meshing as in finite\nelement methods. Unlike all other methods for solving elliptic interface\nproblems, the use of a wavelet Riesz basis for $H^1_0(\\Omega)$ ensures that the\ncondition numbers of the coefficient matrices remain small and uniformly\nbounded, regardless of the matrix size.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach through the design and implementation of\nCycloidal Quasi-Direct Drive actuators for legged robotics. The cycloidal gear\nmechanism, with its inherent high torque density and mechanical robustness,\noffers significant advantages over conventional designs. By integrating\ncycloidal gears into the Quasi-Direct Drive framework, we aim to enhance the\nperformance of legged robots, particularly in tasks demanding high torque and\ndynamic loads, while still keeping them lightweight. Additionally, we develop a\ntorque estimation framework for the actuator using an Actuator Network, which\neffectively reduces the sim-to-real gap introduced by the cycloidal drive's\ncomplex dynamics. This integration is crucial for capturing the complex\ndynamics of a cycloidal drive, which contributes to improved learning\nefficiency, agility, and adaptability for reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "The \\emph{sensor placement problem} for stochastic linear inverse problems\nconsists of determining the optimal manner in which sensors can be employed to\ncollect data. Specifically, one wishes to place a limited number of sensors\nover a large number of candidate locations, quantifying and optimising over the\neffect this data collection strategy has on the solution of the inverse\nproblem. In this article, we provide a global optimality condition for the\nsensor placement problem via a subgradient argument, obtaining sufficient and\nnecessary conditions for optimality\\revix{, and marking certain sensors as\n\\emph{dominant} or \\emph{redundant}, i.e.~always on or always off}. We\ndemonstrate how to take advantage of this optimality criterion to find\napproximately optimal binary designs, i.e.~designs where no fractions of\nsensors are placed. Leveraging our optimality criteria, we derive a powerful\nlow-rank formulation of the A-optimal design objective for finite\nelement-discretised function space settings, demonstrating its high\ncomputational efficiency, particularly in terms of derivatives, and study\nglobally optimal designs for a Helmholtz-type source problem and extensions\ntowards optimal binary designs.",

    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis has become increasingly important for assessing public\nopinion and informing decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have\nrevolutionized this field by capturing nuanced language patterns. However,\nadapting LLMs to domain-specific sentiment analysis tasks remains challenging\ndue to computational constraints and the need for optimal fine-tuning. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Adaptive Rank Space\nExploration (DARSE) framework for efficient and effective sentiment analysis\nusing LLMs. DARSE consists of a coarse-grained greedy algorithm to identify the\noptimal rank range, a fine-grained exploration algorithm to refine rank\nselection, and a dynamic rank allocation method to determine the optimal rank\ncombination for each LLM layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARSE\nsignificantly improves sentiment analysis accuracy, achieving a 15.1%\nimprovement in MSE and a 4.3% improvement in accuracy compared to previous\nwork. Our framework strikes a balance between computational efficiency and\nmodel performance, making it a promising approach for sentiment analysis with\nLLMs.",

    "abstract": "We present a model for the power spectrum of the density field of galaxies\nweighted by their star formation rate. This weighting is relevant in\nline-intensity mapping (LIM) when the observed line luminosity is strongly\ncorrelated with star formation, as is the case for the H$\\alpha$ line. Our\nmodel reproduces the measured power spectrum in the IllustrisTNG simulation to\nwithin a few per cent across all scales, with fitting parameters that have\nclear physical interpretations. On scales of tens of megaparsecs, the model\naccounts for the weighted non-linear bias of galaxies as well as halo exclusion\n(2-halo term). On smaller scales, it incorporates the weighted distribution of\nsatellite galaxies within haloes (1-halo term). The random sampling of\nsatellite galaxies introduces a galaxy shot noise term to the power spectrum on\nsmall scales, and their confinement to haloes introduces a halo shot noise term\non large scales. Omitting satellite galaxies from the analysis results in an\nunderestimation of both the large-scale bias and the mean intensity by\napproximately 30 per cent each at redshift 1.5. Assigning the intensity of\nsatellites to the centre of their respective haloes affects the power spectrum\non scales $k > 0.3$ h Mpc$^{-1}$. Our fitting function provides a\nwell-motivated parametrisation that can be used to interpret data from upcoming\nLIM surveys.",

    "abstract": "Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect provides dissipationless chiral channels\nfor spin transport, expected as an outstanding candidate in future low-power\nquantum computation. The spin-splitting band structure is vital for obtaining\nQAH effect in topological systems, with ferromagnetism indispensable to\nmanipulate the Chern number. Herein, we challenge this wisdom by proposing\ntunable QAH effect in spin-splitting antiferromagnets with zero magnetization.\nSince the spin splitting of these unique magnets originates from the alternate\ncrystal environment, the Chern number can be modulated not only by the\nconventional magnetic order, but also by the crystal order, opening an\nadditional dimension for tuning QAH effect. Our concept is illustrated based on\ntwo-dimensional (2D) MnBi2Te4 (MBT) with even septuple layers (SLs), a typical\naxion insulator with fully magnetic compensation. By interlayer rotation and\ntranslation operations, sublattices of MBT with opposite magnetizations are no\nlonger connected by inversion or mirror symmetries, leading to the transition\nto the QAH insulator. The flexible stacking of 2D materials enables the\nreversible Chern number by crystal design. Our work fundamentally reveals the\ncrystal-order-dependent QAH effect in spin-splitting antiferromagnets, which\nwould advance QAH effect-based devices towards high controllability,\nintegration density and operation speed.",

    "abstract": "Aligning the output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences\n(e.g., by means of reinforcement learning with human feedback, or RLHF) is\nessential for ensuring their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Despite\nsignificant advancements in LLM alignment techniques, the impact of different\ntype of preference data on model performance has yet to be systematically\nexplored. In this study, we investigate the scalability, data efficiency, and\neffectiveness of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in fine-tuning\npre-trained LLMs, aiming to reduce their dependency on extensive amounts of\npreference data, which is expensive to collect. We (1) systematically compare\nthe performance of models fine-tuned with varying percentages of a combined\npreference judgement dataset to define the improvement curve of DPO and assess\nits effectiveness in data-constrained environments; and (2) provide insights\nfor the development of an optimal approach for selective preference data usage.\nOur study reveals that increasing the amount of data used for training\ngenerally enhances and stabilizes model performance.
