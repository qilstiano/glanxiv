That is, engaging in informal physics education (IPE) is\npart of what it means to ''do physics.'' In June 2024, we hosted a summit with\nforty-two members of the Joint Network for Informal Physics Education and\nResearch (JNIPER) to discuss concrete steps for fostering this cultural shift\nin physics. We present key findings from the Summit to motivate this culture\nchange: IPE makes the work of physicists relevant; fosters trust and supports a\nsociety where everyone benefits from science and technology advances; serves as\na gateway for entering into the physics discipline, and for staying once there;\nand improves physicists' skills and research. We identify three levers for\npromoting the culture change: structures supporting IPE; engagement of\ninterested, influential, and/or impacted parties; and integration of\nresearch-based IPE practices. Each lever is accompanied by associated\nrecommendations for action directed at individuals, departments and\ninstitutions, topical groups such as JNIPER, and funders and (inter)national\norganizations. Our clarion call is for members and supporters of the IPE\ncommunity to choose one recommendation per lever to prioritize and to set forth\na roadmap for implementation.

In this study, we apply reinforcement learning to a\nswimmer at zero Reynolds number and investigate whether the learning algorithm\nselects this metachronal rhythm, or if other coordination patterns emerge. We\ndesign the swimmer agent with an elongated body and pairs of straight,\ninflexible paddles placed along the body for various fixed paddle spacings.\nBased on paddle spacing, the swimmer agent learns qualitatively different\ncoordination patterns. At tight spacings, a back-to-front metachronal wave-like\nstroke emerges which resembles the commonly observed biological rhythm, but at\nwide spacings, different limb coordinations are selected.

Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation --\ni.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a\nnovel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are\nequivariant to 90{\\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two\nplanes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by\na new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of\ndeformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.\nThis allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while\npreserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations\nof two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically,\nwe derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism\nand propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow\nmatching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed\nequivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated\nand real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed\nprojection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory\ncosts.

The running time is $O(n^{2.84})$ on $n$-node\ngraphs, thus separating the task of detecting induced $4$-cycles from detecting\ntriangles, which requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ time combinatorially under the popular\nBMM hypothesis.\n  Significant work has gone into characterizing the exact time complexity of\ninduced $H$-detection, relative to the complexity of detecting cliques of\nvarious sizes. Prior work identified the question of whether induced $4$-cycle\ndetection is triangle-hard as the only remaining case towards completing the\nlowest level of the classification, dubbing it a \"curious\" case [Dalirrooyfard,\nVassilevska W., FOCS 2022].

We perform a systematic QFI analysis of QAOA for Max-Cut on\ncyclic and complete graphs with $N = 4 - 10$ qubits. Two mixer families are\nstudied, RX-only and hybrid RX-RY, with depths $p = 2, 4, 6$ and $p = 3, 6, 9$,\nrespectively, and with up to three entanglement stages implemented through\ncyclic- or complete-entangling patterns. Complete graphs consistently yield\nlarger QFI eigenvalues than cyclic graphs; none of the settings reaches the\nHeisenberg limit ($4N^2$), but several exceed the linear bound ($4N$).\nIntroducing entanglement primarily redistributes QFI from diagonal to\noff-diagonal entries: non-entangled circuits maximize per-parameter (diagonal)\nsensitivity, whereas entangling layers increase the covariance fraction and\nthus cross-parameter correlations, with diminishing returns beyond the first\nstage. Leveraging these observations, we propose, as a proof of concept, a\nQFI-Informed Mutation (QIm) heuristic that sets mutation probabilities and step\nsizes from the normalized diagonal QFI. On 7- and 10-qubit instances, QIm\nattains higher mean energies and lower variance than equal-probability and\nrandom-restart baselines over 100 runs, underscoring QFI as a lightweight,\nproblem-aware preconditioner for QAOA and other variational quantum algorithms.",

While\nprevious studies have examined spatial visualizations in data stories, this\nresearch seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the map design process\nemployed by news outlets. To achieve this, we strive to answer two specific\nresearch questions: what is the design space of journalistic maps? and how do\neditorial teams produce journalistic map articles? To answer the first one, we\ncollected and analyzed a large corpus of 462 journalistic maps used in news\narticles from five major news outlets published over three months. As a result,\nwe created a design space comprised of eight dimensions that involved both\nproperties describing the articles' aspects and the visual/interactive features\nof maps.

    "abstract": "The dynamics of small bodies perturbed by an eccentric planet was done mostly\nunder the assumption of well separated orbits using analytical approximations\nappropriate for the hierarchical case. In this work we study the dynamics of\nsmall bodies in a wide range of eccentricities and inclinations perturbed by a\ngiant planet with e_p=0.4, in the non-hierarchical case. We consider small\nbodies both interior and exterior to the planet. We apply semi-analytical\nmodels for the study of resonances and the properties of the secular disturbing\nfunction. We perform a frequency analysis of numerical integration of the exact\nequations of motion to obtain the proper frequencies and corresponding\ndynamical secular paths. We study the dependence of proper frequencies with the\ninitial mutual inclination and we find a critical inclination around 30 degrees\nfor which the pericenter proper frequency vanishes giving rise to the increase\nof small bodies eccentricities followed by unstable dynamics. This happens for\nboth interior and exterior small bodies and constitutes a stability barrier in\nthe inclination. For greater inclinations the ZLK mechanism dominates both\npopulations. By means of numerical integration of thousands of small bodies we\nreproduce the well known pericenter shepherding, but for the exterior\npopulations we also find concentrations of the longitude of the ascending node\nin the direction of the planetary line of apsides.",

We collected and analysed over 2.6 million\nBluesky posts referencing 532,302 scholarly articles from January 2023 to July\n2025, integrating metadata from the OpenAlex database. Temporal trends,\ndisciplinary coverage, language use, textual characteristics, and user\nengagement were examined. A sharp increase in scholarly activity on Bluesky was\nobserved from November 2024 to January 2025, coinciding with broader academic\nshifts away from X. As on X, Bluesky posts primarily concern the health,\nsocial, and environmental sciences and are predominantly written in English.\nNevertheless, Bluesky posts demonstrate substantially higher levels of\ninteraction (likes, reposts, replies, and quotes) and greater textual\noriginality than previously reported for X, suggesting both stronger\ninteractive and more interpretive engagement. These findings highlight\nBluesky's emerging role as a credible platform for science communication and a\npromising source for altmetrics.

Building on the\nmethodology of Jung et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 2025, vol. 0, A1), we extend the\napproach to the more complex regime of a turbulent wake, which involves three\nprimary challenges: (1) globally unstable modes in the linearized Navier-Stokes\noperator, (2) multi-scale turbulent structures, and (3) high-dimensional\ndatasets. To address these challenges, we employ a data-driven approach that\nconstructs causal resolvent-based estimation kernels from cross-spectral\ndensities obtained via large-eddy simulations. These kernels are derived using\nthe Wiener-Hopf method, which optimally enforces causality, thereby enhancing\nreal-time estimation accuracy. The framework captures the spectral signatures\nof coherent structures and incorporates the colored statistics of nonlinear\nforcing terms acting on the linear system. To handle the computational demands\nof the high-dimensional estimation problem, we utilize parallel algorithms\ndeveloped within the same framework. We further investigate sensor placement by\nanalyzing single-sensor estimation error and coherence with target flow\nquantities. Results demonstrate accurate causal estimation of streamwise\nvelocity for the spanwise-averaged, spanwise-Fourier-transformed, and mid-span\nflow using limited shear-stress measurements on the surface of the airfoil.\nThis study underscores the potential of the resolvent-based framework for\nefficient estimation in compressible, turbulent environments.",

Through a within-subject VR experiment (N=26), we evaluated these\napproaches in a crossing scenario, assessing interface qualities (visibility\nand intuitiveness), how well the information conveyed the vehicle's level of\nconfidence, and their impact on participants' perceived safety, trust, and user\nexperience.

Traditional prognostic methods based on clinicopathological\nvariables alone do not fully capture the biological complexity of the disease.\nThis study aims to develop a risk scoring system based on genes associated with\ntumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIC-associated genes) to improve prognostic\nassessment in CRC.\n  Methods: RNA-seq gene expression and clinicopathological data from TCGA-CRC\n(647 tumor samples, 51 normal tissues) were analyzed to identify differentially\nexpressed TIIC-associated genes through comparison with the CIBERSORTx\ndatabase. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to screen for\nprognostic markers. A Gaussian mixture model was applied to cluster prognostic\nmodels and select the model with the most robust gene combination. The\nresulting risk scoring system was validated in an external cohort (GSE39582)\nand integrated with clinicopathological variables to develop a prognostic\nnomogram.\n  Results: From 128 TIIC-associated genes, an optimal prognostic model\ncomprising CCL8 and TYR was identified. The risk score was calculated as\n0.152*Exp(CCL8) - 0.516*Exp(TYR). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed significant\nsurvival differences between high-risk and low-risk groups in both TCGA-CRC (p\n< 0.05) and GSE39582 (p < 0.05). Time-dependent ROC analysis showed AUC values\nranging from 0.605 to 0.696 for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival in TCGA-CRC\nand GSE39582. Multivariate Cox analysis identified TNM_T, TNM_N, and risk score\nas independent prognostic factors.\n  Conclusion: Our risk scoring system based on CCL8 and TYR effectively\nstratifies CRC patients into distinct prognostic groups and could guide\ntreatment decisions, particularly when integrated with TNM staging in a\nnomogram.",

Using a quantum\nannealing device, we uncover a wealth of abrupt magnetic transitions between\nspin manifolds driven by increasing external magnetic fields within a simple\nyet effective Ising-model framework. In contrast to periodic systems, where DS\narises from long-range competing interactions, our findings reveal that\nshort-range, purely antiferromagnetic couplings in aperiodic geometries produce\nequally rich ground-state magnetization patterns. We demonstrate that while\nmagnetic textures are determined by the lattice size, their formation remains\nremarkably robust and independent of scale, with commensurability emerging\nlocally.

Previous ML\nmodels typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a\ntrained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed\nReynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more\nconcretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters\nand the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to\nrepresent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given\ndomain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a\nscale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a\ngiven domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.\nSince neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the\nnatural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of\nneural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the\nscale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,\nHelmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations.

Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or\nself-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to\naccumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts.\n  To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework\nthat enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past\nfixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores\nsuccessful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor\nAgent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and\nrefining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that\nguides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public\nbenchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem\ncomplexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms\nboth zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging\nfrom 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating\nits effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.",

This approach achieves state-of-the-art simulation\nfidelity for both neutron (ZN) and proton (ZP) detectors, while offering\nsubstantial reductions in computational costs compared to existing methods. Our\nFM model achieves a Wasserstein distance of 1.27 for the ZN simulation with an\ninference time of 0.46 ms per sample, compared to the current best of 1.20 with\nan inference time of approximately 109 ms. The latent FM model further improves\nthe inference speed, reducing the sampling time to 0.026 ms per sample, with a\nminimal trade-off in accuracy.

A key goal for\npolicy-makers is to evaluate the costs and benefits of such reforms. The main\nchallenge lies in that the outcome of interest, children welfare, is\nunobservable. To address this issue, I consider a collective labor supply model\nwith children where adult members have preferences over their own leisure,\nexpenditures, and children welfare. I show that the model nonparametrically\npartially identifies the impacts of parental inputs on children welfare in\npanel data. I then propose a novel estimation strategy that accommodates\nmeasurement error and can be used to efficiently construct valid confidence\nsets. Using Dutch data on couples with children, I investigate the structure of\nthe expected production technology and how it varies with household\ncharacteristics. I find that the production of children welfare is\ncharacterized by decreasing returns to scale and large heterogeneity across\nhousehold types. In particular, I find that children from disadvantaged\nhouseholds, whose parents have low education levels and are not homeowners, are\nsignificantly worse off.

While existing research on GNN\nrobustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced\nfaults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress\ntoward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency\ndemands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can\ncause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major\ntechnology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a\ncomprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to\nreveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and\nefficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and\nlightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.\nSpecifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out\noutliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these\nprotective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any\nmessage-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively\nenhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error\npatterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of\n$3\\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction\naccuracy by at least 20\\% when errors present in model weights or node\nembeddings, and by at least 10\\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices.

This\ndifficulty arises because the operand of a call instruction (e.g., call rax)\nremains unknown until runtime, resulting in an incomplete inter-procedural\ncontrol flow graph (CFG). Previous approaches have struggled with low accuracy\nand limited scalability. To address these limitations, recent work has\nincreasingly turned to machine learning (ML) to enhance analysis. However, this\nML-driven approach faces two significant obstacles: low-quality callsite-callee\ntraining pairs and inadequate binary code representation, both of which\nundermine the accuracy of ML models. In this paper, we introduce NeuCall, a\nnovel approach for resolving indirect calls using graph neural networks.\nExisting ML models in this area often overlook key elements such as data and\ncode cross-references, which are essential for understanding a program's\ncontrol flow. In contrast, NeuCall augments CFGs with cross-references,\npreserving rich semantic information. Additionally, we leverage advanced\ncompiler-level type analysis to generate high-quality callsite-callee training\npairs, enhancing model precision and reliability. We further design a graph\nneural model that leverages augmented CFGs and relational graph convolutions\nfor accurate target prediction. Evaluated against real-world binaries from\nGitHub and the Arch User Repository on x86_64 architecture, NeuCall achieves an\nF1 score of 95.2%, outperforming state-of-the-art ML-based approaches.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the steady and time-dependent nonlinear\nconvection-diffusion (advection-diffusion) equations with the Dirichlet\nboundary condition. For the steady nonlinear equation, we use an iteration\nmethod to reformulate the nonlinear equation into its linear counterpart, and\nderive a fourth-order compact 9-point finite difference method (FDM) to solve\nthe reformulated equation on a uniform Cartesian grid. To increase the\naccuracy, we modify the FDM to reduce the pollution effect. The linear system\nof the FDM generates an M-matrix, provided the mesh size $h$ is sufficiently\nsmall. For the time dependent nonlinear equation, we discrete the temporal\ndomain using the Crank-Nicolson (CN), BDF3, BDF4 time stepping methods, and\napply a similar iterative method to rewrite the nonlinear equation as the same\nlinear convection-diffusion equation. Then we propose the second-order to\nfourth-order compact 9-point FDMs with the reduced pollution effects on a\nuniform Cartesian grid. We prove that all FDMs satisfy the discrete maximum\nprinciple for sufficiently small $h$. Several examples with the variable and\ntime-dependent diffusion coefficients and challenging nonlinear terms (not\nlimited to the Burgers equation) are provided to verify the accuracy and the\ndesired convergence rates in the $l_2$ and $l_{\\infty}$ norms in space and\ntime. We also compare our second-order CN method with the third-order BDF3\nmethod and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, and the numerical results\ndemonstrate that our FDM with the coarse time step generates the small error.\nEspecially, if the same BDF3 scheme is applied, our error is 1.6\\% of that\nobtained from the DG method. The proposed methods can be easily extended to a\n3D spatial domain and more general nonlinear convection-diffusion-reaction\nequations.",

    ],
    "abstract": "This paper introduces higher-order Kripke models, a generalization of\nstandard Kripke models that is remarkably close to Kripke's original idea -\nboth mathematically and conceptually. Standard Kripke models are now considered\n$0$-ary models, whereas an $n$-ary model for $n > 0$ is a model whose set of\nobjects (''possible worlds'') contains only $(n-1)$-ary Kripke models. Models\nwith infinitely many layers are also considered. This framework is obtained by\npromoting a radical change of perspective in how modal semantics for\nnon-classical logics are defined: just like classical modalities are obtained\nthrough use of an accessibility relation between classical propositional\nmodels, non-classical modalities are now obtained through use of an\naccessibility relation between non-classical propositional models (even when\nthey are Kripke models already). The paper introduces the new models after\ndealing specifically with the case of intuitionistic modal logic. It is shown\nthat, depending on which intuitionistic $0$-ary propositional models are\nallowed, we may obtain $1$-ary models equivalent to either birelational models\nfor $IK$ or for a new logic called $MK$. Those $1$-ary models have an intuitive\nreading that adds to the interpretation of intuitionistic models in terms of\n''timelines'' the concept of ''alternative timelines''. More generally, the\n$1$-ary models can be read as defining a concept of ''alternative'' for any\nsubstantive interpretation of the $0$-ary models. The semantic clauses for\nnecessity and possibility of $MK$ are also modular and can be used to obtain\nsimilar modal semantics for every non-classical logic, each of which can be\nprovided with a similar intuitive reading. After intuitionistic modal logic is\ndealt with, the general structure of High-order Kripke Models and some of its\nvariants are defined, and a series of conjectures about their properties are\nstated.",

For instance, in healthcare\napplications, we might like to learn features that contain information about\npathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic\nvariability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable\nacross all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with\nAnti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement\nframework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)\ncharacteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during\ntraining, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift\nat test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be\nsemantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain\ninformation relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,\nwhich encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet\nmay degrade performance due to associations with content present in training\ndata that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,\nwhich we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the\nstyle attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the\nlatent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to\nquantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several\nimage datasets.

This is the first in a series of papers examining the\nevolution of SN 2023ixf with JWST spanning the initial 1000 days after\nexplosion, monitoring the formation and growth of molecules and dust in ejecta\nand surrounding environment. The JWST infrared spectra are overwhelmingly\ndominated by H lines, whose profiles reveal ejecta structures unseen in optical\nspectra. We characterize the nature of these structures, concluding that they\nlikely result from a combination of ejecta geometry, viewing angle, and opacity\neffects. We find no evidence for the formation of dust precursor molecules such\nas carbon-monoxide (CO), nor do we observe an infrared excess attributable to\ndust. These observations imply that any future signatures of molecules or dust\nin SN 2023ixf will arise either from freshly synthesized material within the\nejecta or circumstellar material at radii not yet heated by the supernova at\nthis epoch.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\na wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.\nHowever, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.\nGiven the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial\nanalysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading\nLLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the\n'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific\nprompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human\nannotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,\nJaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and\nacross-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,\nsemantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and\nPerplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and\nless agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from\ncompany to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how\nprompts are written and what source material is used.",

    "abstract": "The majority of energetic long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought\nto arise from the collapse of massive stars, making them powerful tracers of\nstar formation across cosmic time. Evidence for this origin comes from the\npresence of supernovae in the aftermath of the GRB event, whose properties in\nturn link back to those of the collapsing star. In principle, with GRBs we can\nstudy the properties of individual stars in the distant universe. Here, we\npresent JWST/NIRCAM observations that detect both the host galaxy and likely\nsupernova in the SVOM GRB 250314A with a spectroscopically measured redshift of\nz $\\simeq$ 7.3, deep in the era of reionisation. The data are well described by\na combination of faint blue host, similar to many z $\\sim$ 7 galaxies, with a\nsupernova of similar luminosity to the proto-type GRB supernova, SN 1998bw.\nAlthough larger galaxy contributions cannot be robustly excluded, given the\nevidence from the blue afterglow colours of low dust extinction, supernovae\nmuch brighter than SN 1998bw can be. These observations suggest that, despite\ndisparate physical conditions, the star that created GRB 250314A was similar to\nGRB progenitors in the local universe.",

Shift-equivariant systems typically admit\ntraveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the\nsolution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a\nrelatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator\ninference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data,\nwithout knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms\nto ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially\nfrozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a\nfunction of that profile. We validate our approach using the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation\nthat exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos.

We argue that LRMs\naddress the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while\nLAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,\neach paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action\ncapabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an\nintegrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for\nadvancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service\nrequirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus\nbridging the gap between intention and execution.

Our architecture\nsupports end-to-end observability through custom EC2 scripts leveraging Web3.py\nand JSON-RPC, collecting over 1,000 real-time data points-including gas\nutilization, transaction inclusion latency, and mempool dynamics. These metrics\nare visualized and monitored through AWS CloudWatch, enabling service-level\nperformance tracking and anomaly detection. This cloud-native framework\nrestores low-level observability lost in managed environments while maintaining\nthe operational simplicity of managed services. By bridging the simplicity of\nAMB with the transparency required for protocol research and enterprise\nmonitoring, this work delivers one of the first reproducible,\nperformance-instrumented Ethereum deployments on AMB. The proposed hybrid\narchitecture enables secure, observable, and reproducible Ethereum node\noperations in cloud environments, suitable for both research and production\nuse.",

    "abstract": "In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) clinical trials, tumor burden (TB) is a\nkey longitudinal biomarker for assessing treatment effects. Typically,\nstandard-of-care (SOC) therapies and some novel interventions initially\ndecrease TB; however, many patients subsequently experience an\nincrease-indicating disease progression-while others show a continuous decline.\nIn patients with an eventual TB increase, the change point marks the onset of\nprogression and must occur before the time of the event. To capture these\ndistinct dynamics, we propose a novel joint model that integrates time-to-event\nand longitudinal TB data, classifying patients into a change-point group or a\nstable group. For the change-point group, our approach flexibly estimates an\nindividualized change point by leveraging time-to-event information. We use a\nMonte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithm for efficient parameter\nestimation. Simulation studies demonstrate that our model outperforms\ntraditional approaches by accurately capturing diverse disease progression\npatterns and handling censoring complexities, leading to robust marginal TB\noutcome estimates. When applied to a Phase 3 NSCLC trial comparing cemiplimab\nmonotherapy to SOC, the treatment group shows prolonged TB reduction and\nconsistently lower TB over time, highlighting the clinical utility of our\napproach.

    "abstract": "In evolutionary biology, phylogenetic networks are graphs that provide a\nflexible framework for representing complex evolutionary histories that involve\nreticulate evolutionary events. Recently phylogenetic studies have started to\nfocus on a special class of such networks called semi-directed networks. These\ngraphs are defined as mixed graphs that can be obtained by de-orienting some of\nthe arcs in some rooted phylogenetic network, that is, a directed acyclic graph\nwhose leaves correspond to a collection of species and that has a single source\nor root vertex. However, this definition of semi-directed networks is implicit\nin nature since it is not clear when a mixed-graph enjoys this property or not.\nIn this paper, we introduce novel, explicit mathematical characterizations of\nsemi-directed networks, and also multi-semi-directed networks, that is mixed\ngraphs that can be obtained from directed phylogenetic networks that may have\nmore than one root. In addition, through extending foundational tools from the\ntheory of rooted networks into the semi-directed setting - such as cherry\npicking sequences, omnians, and path partitions - we characterize when a\n(multi-)semi-directed network can be obtained by de-orienting some rooted\nnetwork that is contained in one of the well-known classes of tree-child,\norchard, tree-based or forest-based networks. These results address structural\naspects of (multi-)semi-directed networks and pave the way to improved\ntheoretical and computational analyses of such networks, for example, within\nthe development of algebraic evolutionary models that are based on such\nnetworks.",

    "abstract": "Since 2011, rafts of floating \\emph{Sargassum} seaweed have frequently\nobstructed the coasts of the Intra-Americas Seas. The motion of the rafts is\nrepresented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as\nthe eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating\ninteractions between clumps of \\emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects\nof Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of\nmass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and\ncontrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and\nSparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a\nphysics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB.\nSpecifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB\nvariables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities.\nThe SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB\nvariables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects\nof the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in\nconditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising\ncomplexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected\nclumps. The LSTM model delivered the best results when designs were\nstraightforward, with fewer neurons and hidden layers. While LSTM model serves\nas an opaque black-box model lacking interpretability, the SINDy model brings\ntransparency by discerning explicit functional relationships through the\nfunction libraries.

In two-dimensional\nflatband systems, charge responses have been intensively investigated, yet\nneutral excitations remain largely unexplored. In particular, intervalley\ncoherent state (IVC) features a neutral Goldstone mode due to spontaneously\nbroken valley U(1) symmetry. While IVC state has been proposed as a unifying\ntheme across graphene- and semiconductor-based systems, its defining feature -\nthe neutral Goldstone mode - remains elusive in experiment. Here we investigate\nspace-and-time-resolved transport of neutral modes in twisted WSe2 moir\\'e\nsuperlattices through a novel ultrafast imaging technique. We uncover two new\npropagating collective modes with very different velocities, which emerge near\nthe van Hove singularity (VHS) in both intermediate- (3.5~4 degree) and\nlarge-angle (~5 degree) twisted WSe2. The fast-propagating mode has a\nsurprisingly large speed of ~3 km/s and is consistent with a Goldstone mode for\nan IVC state, while the slow-moving mode is likely a gapped amplitude mode.\nThey can be understood as the spin-valley analogues of collective modes of a\nsuperfluid, whose propagation are imaged for the first time in a condensed\nmatter system.

Previous studies have added mortality of immature\nindividuals to the maturation delay in discrete population models, finding that\nincreasing the delay results in a decreased population level at equilibrium.\nFurthermore, increasing the maturation delay beyond a critical threshold\nultimately leads to the extinction of the modeled species. Because maturation\ndelays beyond one breeding cycle are often found in nature, clearly, maturation\ndelays must also have a positive benefit leading to a trade-off. We explore\nsuch a trade-off by deriving a class of discrete single species models with a\nmaturation delay and the realistic assumption of a reproductive trade-off. In\nthis reproductive trade-off, although a prolonged maturation delay decreases\nthe total probability of survival, the delay results in larger body sizes which\nwe assume, based on some fish species, to result in higher fecundity. We\nexamine two scenarios: density independent survival and cohort density\ndependent survival of immature individuals. For the mature and immature\nindividuals, we consider two different, but popular, survival functions: the\nBeverton-Holt model and the Ricker model. Overall, we identify a positive\nmaturation delay that maximizes the population size, which we refer to as\n\"optimal maturation delay\".",

Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a\nBEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame\ndrivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using\nonly monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several\nchallenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space\ncorridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel\nself-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future\nego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual\ncorridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion\nprocess to model the distribution of such segments in the image.

When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa\nvariants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An\nablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these\ngains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits\nand domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value\nof script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and\nsupport further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language\nspecificity.",

Therefore, a precise and rigorous numerical modeling of the NV\nsystem is indispensable for the continued advancement of the field. Within this\ncontext, this work develops a Python software for simulating the NV spin\ndynamics in pulsed sequences under general experimental conditions, i.e. a\ndigital twin. The library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other\nenvironmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time-evolution\ndynamics, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum mechanical\nobservable given by the fluorescence. The simulations framework is based on a\nnon-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, solved in the laboratory\nframe. Whereby eliminating oversimplifications such as the assumption of\ninstantaneous $\\delta$-pulses and rotating wave approximations, our simulations\nreveal subtle dynamics from the realistic pulse constraints that impact quantum\nsystems. Three use-case examples illustrate the use of the software and\nvalidate it by comparing the simulation results with well-established\nexperimental works, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (two-qubit\nconditional logic gates), sensing (noise resilient dynamical decoupling\nsequences between NV and couples spins) and networks (teleportation of a\nquantum state between entangled NVs).

To address this, we propose Human Gaussian\nGraph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,\nso that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable\nhuman representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual\nlayers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the\nsecond layer nodes.

The restriction on $F$ allowed them, among\nother things, to reduce the case of irreducible polynomials of the form\n$x^3-a$. Pleso (2009) began the work of removing the restriction on $F$ by\nexpressing the integral as a sum of $16$ integrals for the cubic polynomial\n$x^3 - b x - c$ with $b,c\\in F$, and computing nine of them. In this work, we\ncompute $15$ of Pleso's integrals, and reduce the last to an elementary\nassertion about the number of points on a surface over a finite field, in the\nspecial case when $F$ is the $p$-adic numbers, $F=\\mathbb{Q}_p$, and $p$ is\nequivalent to $5$ mod $6$.

A core aspect of MABs is the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to\nbe enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear\nbandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the\nsame linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration\nstrategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is\nincreasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration\nbehavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of\nseveral linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy\nlinear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier\nperformance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This\nobservation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which\nconsistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that\npure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.\nOur results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for\nbandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory\nefficacy.

In this work, we develop an\nEngineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale\nacross diverse software offerings internally.\n  Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an\nagent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test\nfailure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason\nand run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We\nprovide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it\ncan refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch\nconforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes.\n  Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator,\nthe Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we\nfound that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger\nbut vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness\n(neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis\ntools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the\nsolve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of\n42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations.\n  Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were\nreviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated\nfixes).\n  Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes\nfrom engineers' feedback.

However, their application\nto CFD models including large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical\nsimulaton (DNS) is limited due to the highly chaotic and multi-scale nature of\nresolved turbulent flow. Due to the large amounts of noise present in\nsmall-scale turbulent structures, error propagation becomes a major issue,\nmaking long-term prediction of unsteady flow infeasible. While linear subspace\nmethods like dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) can be used to pre-process\nturbulent flow data to remove small-scale structures, this often requires a\nvery large number of modes and a non-trivial mode selection process. In this\nwork, a ROM framework using Koopman $\\beta$-variational autoencoders\n($\\beta$-VAEs) is introduced for reduced-order modeling of large-scale\nturbulence. The Koopman operator captures the variation of a non-linear\ndynamical system through a linear representation of state observables. By\nconstraining the latent space of a $\\beta$-VAE to grow linearly using a Koopman\nloss function, small-scale turbulent structures are filtered out in\nreconstructions of input data and latent variables are denoised in an\nunsupervised manner so that they can be sufficiently modeled over time.\nCombined with an LSTM ensemble for time series prediction of latent variables,\nthe model is tested on LES flow past a Windsor body at multiple yaw angles,\nshowing that the Koopman $\\beta$-VAE can effectively denoise latent variables\nand remove small-scale structures from reconstructions while acting globally\nover multiple cases.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid innovation of GPUs, heterogeneous GPU clusters in both public\nclouds and on-premise data centers have become increasingly commonplace. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate how pipeline parallelism, a technique wellstudied\nfor throughput-oriented deep learning model training, can be used effectively\nfor serving latency-bound model inference, e.g., in video analytics systems, on\nheterogeneous GPU clusters. Our work exploits the synergy between diversity in\nmodel layers and diversity in GPU architectures, which results in comparable\ninference latency for many layers when running on low-class and high-class\nGPUs. We explore how such overlooked capability of low-class GPUs can be\nexploited using pipeline parallelism and present a novel inference serving\nsystem, PPipe, that employs pool-based pipeline parallelism via an MILP-based\ncontrol plane and a data plane that performs resource reservation-based\nadaptive batching. Evaluation results on diverse workloads (18 CNN models) show\nthat PPipe achieves 41.1% - 65.5% higher utilization of low-class GPUs while\nmaintaining high utilization of high-class GPUs, leading to 32.2% - 75.1%\nhigher serving throughput compared to various baselines.",

Under this setup, an optimization problem is formulated\nto maximize the minimum rate of users across all groups, subject to the maximum\navailable power of each RIS unit. Due to the nondifferentiable nature of the\nobjective function, the max-min rate problem is challenging to solve. To tackle\nthis difficult problem, we develop an iterative solution by leveraging the\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) and the penalty function method. However,\nthe above approach has high computational complexity and may lead to\ncompromised performance. To overcome these drawbacks, we design an efficient\nsecond-order cone programming (SOCP)-based method using the weighted minimum\nmean squared error (WMMSE) framework to reduce computational complexity.\nFurthermore, to further reduce the computational complexity, we also propose a\nlow-complexity and solver-free algorithm that analytically updates all\nvariables by combining the smooth approximation theory and the\nmajorization-minimization (MM) method. Numerical results are provided to verify\nthe convergence and effectiveness of our proposed three algorithms. It is also\ndemonstrated that the SOCP-based method outperforms the penalty-based algorithm\nin terms of both the achieved min rate and the computational complexity. In\ncontrast, the lowcomplexity design achieves significantly lower complexity with\nonly slightly degraded performance.",

By decomposing the network-level\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) into individual asset-level MDPs while using a\nunified neural network architecture, the proposed framework reduces\ncomputational complexity, improves learning efficiency, and enhances\nscalability. The framework directly incorporates annual budget constraints\nthrough a budget allocation mechanism, ensuring maintenance plans are both\noptimal and cost-effective. Through a case study on a large-scale pavement\nnetwork of 68,800 segments, the proposed DRL framework demonstrates significant\nimprovements over traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and\ngenetic algorithms, both in efficiency and network performance.

We find that many of the protostars with current dynamical\nmass estimates track the empirical mass-luminosity \"birthline\" reasonably\nclosely, suggesting that their accretion luminosities may be at most comparable\nto their photospheric radiation.

Motivated by the\nobservation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology\n``un-pruning\" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we\npropose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by\nretained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be\nintegrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is\nupper-bounded in theory.

In the experiment, we\nfurther find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for\nassessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the\namount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results.

Application to previous models that assume either a\npower-law or exponential mass deposition allows a direct comparison of their\nvelocity solutions. We then obtain solutions for new models that have mass\ndepositions with a gaussian or the empirically motivated forms derived by\nPlummer and Elson. Comparisons show that, when cast in terms of the radius\nscaled by the critical radius, the overall velocity laws are all quite similar,\nasymptotically approaching the energy-averaged stellar wind speed $V_w$, and\nanchored to passing through a common critical/sonic speed $v_c = V_w/2$. By\nderiving associated variations in outflow density and temperature, we obtain\nscaling forms for the expected X-ray emission, and show that radiative cooling\ngenerally represents only a small correction to the assumed cooling from\nadiabatic expansion. An initial analysis of incomplete wind thermalization\nsuggests this should likewise have modest effect on the overall outflow in\ndense clusters.

    "abstract": "We propose a new way to relate the black hole thermodynamics and geometry by\ngeneralizing the Euclidean formalism to include \"virtual geometries\", which do\nnot necessarily satisfy Einstein equations. This provides a physically well\nmotivated route to study black hole criticality and obtain the Landau Ginzburg\npotential. We compute the \"virtual thermodynamic potential\" and show that it\nsatisfies a modified quantum statistical relation that is compatible with the\nfirst law of black hole thermodynamics supplemented with an extra term,\ninterpreted as virtual work in previous literature. The novelty is that, within\nour formalism, we can explicitly compute this term as the first derivative of\nthe virtual thermodynamic potential with respect to the horizon radius that is\nconsidered as the order parameter. Imposing the physical condition that the\nfirst derivative vanishes is at the basis of the matching between the first law\nof black hole thermodynamics and (one of the) Einstein equations evaluated at\nthe horizon. Interestingly, imposing the physical conditions that the second\nand third derivatives vanish, we can concretely study the criticality and\nexistence of swallow tails. As a specific example, we apply this formalism to\nan exact four dimensional asymptotically flat hairy black hole, namely the\ngeneralized Kaluza Klein (KK) black hole when the dilaton potential is\nincluded, and show that it is thermodynamically stable and has a non-trivial\ncritical behaviour corresponding to an inverted swallowtail.",

For instance, the widely used Ehrenfeucht-Fra\\\"iss\\'e (EF)\ngame captures the syntactic measure of quantifier rank of first-order formulas.\nFor every such game, there is an associated natural decision problem: \"given an\ninstance of the game, does Spoiler win the game on that instance?\" For EF\ngames, this problem was shown to be PSPACE-complete by Pezzoli in 1998. In this\npresent paper, we show that the same problem for the *multi-structural* (MS)\ngames of recent interest is PSPACE-hard, but contained in NEXPTIME. In the\nprocess, we also resolve an open problem posed by Pezzoli about the dependence\nof the hardness results for EF games on the arity of the schema under\nconsideration.

One is the defining string equation of\nthe model and the other is the Gel'fand-Dikii equation satisfied by the\ndiagonal resolvent of an auxiliary Hamiltonian used to compute correlators of\nmacroscopic loops. In concert, when applied to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, the\nrecursive expansion of these two ODEs efficiently define, order by order in\ngenus, the Weil-Petersson volumes $V_{g,1}(b)$ for bordered hyperbolic Riemann\nsurfaces with one geodesic boundary (length $b$) and genus $g$. The method\nworks equally well for both ordinary and ${ N}{=}1$ supersymmetric JT gravity\ncases. This paper explores the method to higher genus, verifying some\nconjectures of ref.[1], and deriving several useful recursive formulae for\ngeneral use. The method is then applied to the new examples furnished by recent\nmatrix model definitions of JT supergravity with extended supersymmetry, and\nseveral example expressions for the volumes are derived, confirming and\nextending ${ N}{=}2$ examples of Turiaci and Witten, and furnishing new\nformulae for the cases with small and large ${ N}{=}4$ supersymmetry.

Neural radiance\nfield (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting\nof implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving\nscenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through\nrasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,\npreventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both\nNeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit\nnetworks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing\ninteroperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present\nSparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports\nrasterization and raytracing.

SaLF has fast\ntraining (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS\nLiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,\nand can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs.

Near the acceleration\nregion, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes\nobservable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot\npropagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy\n(~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for >Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before\nlosing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray\nenergies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will\nappear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In\nlower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as\nhot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray\nobservations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton\ninjection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray\nsurface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been\noverestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC\ncontribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight\ncorrelation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power,\nbecause the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source.\nComparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\\ll 100$\nkpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears\nto favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that\nX-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs,\npotentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV\n(super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs.

Here we revisit a recent variant of the Newman-Janis-Azreg-Ainou\nalgorithm, restricted to asymptotically-flat spacetimes, and demonstrate that\nthis method exclusively generates Konoplya-Stuchlik-Zhidenko spacetimes.\nTherefore, the equations for geodesic motion and scalar-wave propagation are\nboth separable. We call these \"doubly separable\" spacetimes. We identify a\nsubclass of the spacetimes that might admit a separable Dirac equation by\nexplicitly obtaining the Killing-Yano tensor. The high degree of symmetry in\nthese spacetimes suggests that the self-gravitating matter must also be in\nspecialized field configurations. For this reason, we investigate whether these\nspacetimes can even be sourced by arbitrary types of matter. We show that\ndoubly separable spacetimes cannot be sourced by massless real scalar fields or\nperfect fluids, and that electromagnetic fields lead only to the Kerr-Newman\nfamily. Notably, this rules out the elusive spinning counterpart of the\nJanis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity spacetime, which contains a scalar\nfield, as a member of this metric class.

Spectral fitting with $\\tt\nBagpipes$ suggests the Cosmic Gems galaxy is in a post-starburst phase, making\nit the highest-redshift system currently observed in a mini-quenched state.\nSpatially resolved spectroscopy at tens pc scales shows relatively uniform\nfeatures across subcomponents of the arc.

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of five massive stellar clusters at z=9.625 in the\nCosmic Gems has raised the question about the formation mechanism of star\nclusters in the first half Gyr after the Big-Bang. We infer the total stellar\nmass in clusters by normalizing and integrating the stellar cluster mass\nfunction (SCMF, dn(M)/dM ~ (n$_0$) $M^\\beta$), assuming three different slopes\n$\\beta$ = -1.5, -2.0 and -2.5 and different lower-mass limits between $10^2$\nand $10^5$ Msun. The total integrated cluster stellar mass is compared to the\nstellar mass inferred from the counter-image of the Cosmic Gems, which provides\nthe best, modestly magnified ($\\mu$ = 1.84$\\pm$0.05) representation of the\nentire galaxy. The delensed stellar mass of the Cosmic Gems galaxy is estimated\nas 3.5$_{-1.8}^{+3.3}$ x$10^7$ Msun, with an effective radius of Reff =\n103$_{-15}^{+13}$ parsec and a stellar surface mass density of $\\Sigma$mass =\n520$_{-225}^{+340}$ Msun pc$^{-2}$. Accounting for normalization uncertainties\n- including different lensing magnification scenarios for the arc - a modified\nSCMF, combined with a significantly high star cluster formation efficiency\n(approaching 100%), appears to be a necessary condition to explain the\nrelatively short formation timescale of both the star clusters and the\ncounter-image, without exceeding the galaxy's stellar mass. By extrapolating\nthe physical properties at the peak of the burst we find that in its recent\npast (<~ 30 Myr) the Cosmic Gems galaxy has likely experienced a specific star\nformation rate (sSFR) exceeding 25 Gyr$^{-1}$ and luminosity approaching the\n``blue monster'' regime (M$_{UV}$ < -20). Our study provides insights into the\nextreme clustered nature of star formation in early galaxies and shed light\ninto the formation of bound star clusters that might survive to z = 0 as\nglobular clusters, older than 13 Gyr.",

The\nstars in a subcluster are evolved as if they are the fragmentation products of\na single isolated prestellar core from which most of the natal gas has already\nbeen dispersed, and there are no correlations between the stars' initial\npositions and velocities. Two parameters are particularly important: the number\nof stars in the subcluster, $N$, and the fraction of kinetic energy in ordered\nrotation, $\\alpha_{\\rm rot}$. Increasing $N$ has the effect of systematically\ndecreasing the semi-major axes of the tighter orbits, but has very little\neffect on the semi-major axes of the wider orbits. The main effect of\n$\\alpha_{\\rm rot}$ is to regulate the distribution of mutual orbital\ninclinations, with $\\alpha_{\\rm rot}\\!\\sim\\!0.5$ producing a distribution of\norbital inclinations for triple systems which is consistent with observed\nvalues. Triples frequently form in high-inclination orbits without the\nassistance of von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles. Our previous work demonstrated\nthat subclusters with mass segregation, moderate rotation, and typically $N=4$\nor 5 stars produced the best fit to the multiplicity statistics (proportions of\nsingles, binaries, triples, etc.).

The particles in the medium accelerate\nthrough the shock and produce afterglow emission. Recently, a few GRB\nafterglows have been observed in TeV $\\gamma$-rays by Cherenkov Telescopes.\nThis provides access to broadband spectra of GRB afterglows containing rich\ninformation about the microphysics of relativistic shocks and the profile of\nthe circumburst medium. Since the transition from synchrotron to inverse\nCompton regime in afterglow spectra occurs between hard X-rays and the\nvery-high-energy (VHE) $\\gamma$-rays, detection in one of these bands is\nrequired to identify the two spectral components. The early afterglow data in\nthe hard X-rays, along with the GeV emission, could accurately constrain the\nspectral shape and help in capturing the spectral turnover to distinguish the\ntwo components. We present the multiwavelength spectral and temporal study,\nfocused on the keV-VHE domain, of GRB 230812B, one of the brightest GRBs\ndetected by Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM), along with the detection of a\n72 GeV photon in Large Area Telescope (LAT) during the early afterglow phase.\nThrough a detailed modelling of the emission within the afterglow external\nforward shock in a wind-like scenario, we predict optical to high-energy\nobservations up to ~1 day. We emphasize the importance of following up poorly\nlocalised GRBs by demonstrating that even without prompt sub-degree\nlocalisation, such as in GRB 230812B, it is possible to recover the emission\nusing imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, thanks to their relatively\nwider field of view. Moreover, we show that the low energy threshold of\nLarge-Sized Telescope is essential in discovering the VHE component at much\nhigher redshifts, typical of long GRBs.",

These events, named as GRB 250702D, B, and E\n(collectively referred to as DBE), triggered the detector with delays of\napproximately 1-2 hours between each burst. Follow-up observations of this\nunusually long MeV transient (lasting >3 hours) by the Neil Gehrels Swift\nObservatory and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array over a period of 10\ndays revealed a steep temporal decline in soft X-rays ($\\propto t^{-1.9 \\pm\n0.1}$). These characteristics are consistent with the scenario in which DBE\narises from a relativistic jet launched after the tidal disruption of a star by\na compact object. In the relativistic Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) scenario,\nDBE is the first one with detected MeV $\\gamma$-ray emission. We show that the\ntime-resolved MeV spectra during the outbursts are best described by a single\npower-law, $dN_{\\gamma}/dE \\propto E^{-1.5}$, extending from 10 keV to 40 MeV.\nThe upper limits at higher energies ($>$ 100 MeV) indicate that the spectrum\nbreaks at $10-100$ MeV. From standard MeV $\\gamma$-ray transparency arguments,\nwe derive a lower limit on the jet bulk Lorentz factor. These constraints place\nDBE in the same category as four previously reported relativistic TDEs in terms\nof outburst luminosity and energetics.

    "abstract": "Galactic high-velocity clouds (HVCs) are known to be complex, multiphase\nsystems consisting of neutral and/or ionized gas moving at high velocities\nrelative to the rotation of the disk. In this work, we investigate Milky\nWay-like galaxies from the TNG50 simulation to characterize the properties,\nmorphology, and accretion rates of the warm and hot ionized material comoving\nwith neutral HVCs visible in HI. We find that the ionized gas forms an envelope\naround the neutral material, and in most cases (73% of the HVCs) it is prolate\nin morphology. We also find that the ionized mass is ~6 times greater than the\nneutral mass, which leads to significantly more accretion possible from the\nionized gas ($\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{ion}$) than the neutral gas\n($\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{neut}$), consistent with estimates made from observations of\nour own Galaxy. We investigate the accretion rates from both phases of HVCs\naround 47 Milky Way-like galaxies and find that $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{ion}$ scales\nwith $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{neut}$, and both scale with the star formation rate of\nthe galaxy. Finally, we find that, on average, $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{ion}$ could\naccount for 81% of the galactic star formation rate (assuming the material can\nsufficiently cool and condense), while $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{neut}$ can only balance\n11%. Thus, the diffuse, ionized, high-velocity circumgalactic medium plays a\ndefining role in the evolution and growth of galaxies at low redshift.",

In this work, I present\nthe ice color excess method, which parametrizes the peak optical depth\n($\\tau_{3.0}^{\\mathrm{max}}$) of the prominent 3$\\mu$m absorption feature,\nwhich is predominantly caused by the presence of solid H$_2$O. The method\nbuilds on well-established near-infrared color excess techniques and uses\nwidely available infrared broadband photometry. Through detailed evaluation of\npassband combinations and a comprehensive error analysis, I construct the ice\ncolor excess metric $\\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$. This parameter emerges as the optimal\nchoice that minimizes systematic errors while leveraging high-quality, widely\navailable photometry from Spitzer and WISE data archives. To calibrate the\nmethod, I compile from the literature a sample of stars located in the\nbackground of nearby molecular clouds, for which spectroscopically measured\noptical depths are available. The empirical calibration yields a remarkably\ntight correlation between $\\tau_{3.0}^{\\mathrm{max}}$ and $\\Lambda(W_1 - I_1)$.\nThis photometric technique opens a new avenue for tracing the icy component of\nthe interstellar medium on Galactic scales, providing a powerful complement to\nspectroscopic surveys and enabling new insights into the environmental\ndependence of the formation and evolution of icy dust grains.",

JWST has\nreopened our window to the mid-infrared with unprecedented sensitivity,\nbringing the characterization of silicates into focus again. Using JWST, we\ncharacterize the planetary-mass brown dwarf PSO J318.5338-22.8603,\nconcentrating on any silicate cloud absorption the object may exhibit. PSO\nJ318's spectrum is extremely red, and its flux is variable, both of which are\nlikely hallmarks of cloud absorption. We present JWST NIRSpec PRISM, G395H, and\nMIRI MRS observations from 1-18 micron. We introduce a method based on PSO\nJ318's brightness temperature to generate a list of cloud species that are\nlikely present in its atmosphere. We then test for their presence with\npetitRADTRANS retrievals. Using retrievals and grids from various climate\nmodels, we derive bulk parameters from PSO J318's spectra, which are mutually\ncompatible. Our retrieval results point to a solar to slightly super-solar\natmospheric C/O, a slightly super-solar metallicity, and a 12C/13C below ISM\nvalues. The atmospheric gravity proves difficult to constrain for both\nretrievals and grid models. Retrievals describing the flux of PSO J318 by\nmixing two 1-D models (``two-column models'') appear favored over single-column\nmodels; this is consistent with PSO J318's variability. The JWST spectra also\nreveal a pronounced absorption feature at 10 micron. This absorption is best\nreproduced by introducing a high-altitude cloud layer of small (<0.1 micron),\namorphous SiO grains. The retrieved particle size and location of the cloud is\nconsistent with SiO condensing as cloud seeding nuclei. High-altitude clouds\ncomprised of small SiO particles have been suggested in previous studies,\ntherefore the SiO nucleation we potentially observe in PSO J318 could be a more\nwide-spread phenomenon.",

To enable adaptation without\ntarget images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text\ndescription to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous\nachievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven\nmethods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly\nincrease adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on\ntext descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides\ndiverse and more fine-grained style cues.

To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like\nimages and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.\nWe then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the\ntarget domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style\nTransfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In\nparticular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain\nrepresentations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to\nindividual patches.

The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test\ndataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively.\nAdditionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the\nrobustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power\noperation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.",

While existing work\nhas made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as\nHTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software\nstill remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation\nusually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control\nspecific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to\nhandle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.\nTo address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel\nrequirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal\ntraceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis\nis built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a\ngranular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural\nlanguage requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a\ncomprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of\n3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification\nlanguage capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D\nsoftware synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis\nenables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic\nconstraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis\naccurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%\nof hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.\nFurthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual\nevaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.",

Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by\ninitially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We\nthen apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best\nimage by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via\nimage-to-text retrieval.

    "abstract": "How much current does a sliding electron crystal carry? The answer to this\nsimple question has important implications for the dynamic properties of the\ncrystal, such as the frequency of its cyclotron motion, and its phonon\nspectrum. In this work we introduce a precise definition of a sliding crystal\nand compute the corresponding current $\\mathbf{j}_c$ for topological electron\ncrystals in the presence of magnetic field. Our result is fully\nnon-perturbative, does not rely on Galilean invariance, and applies equally to\nWigner crystals and (anomalous) Hall crystals. In terms of the electron density\n$\\rho$ and magnetic flux density $\\phi$, we find that $\\mathbf{j}_c =\ne(\\rho-C\\phi)\\mathbf{v}$. Surprisingly, the current receives a contribution\nfrom the many-body Chern number $C$ of the crystal. When $\\rho = C\\phi$,\nsliding crystals therefore carry zero current. The crystalline current fixes\nthe Lorentz force felt by the sliding crystal and the dispersion of low-energy\nphonons of such crystals. This gives us a simple counting rule for the number\nof gapless phonons: if a sliding crystal carries nonzero current in a magnetic\nfield, there is a single gapless mode, while otherwise there are two gapless\nmodes. This result can also be understood from anomaly-matching of emanant\ndiscrete translation symmetries -- an idea that is also applicable to the\ndispersion of skyrmion crystals. Our results lead to novel experimental\nimplications and invite further conceptual developments for electron crystals.",

    "abstract": "The Vast Polar Structure (VPOS) is a thin, planar arrangement of co-orbiting\ndwarf galaxies, nearly perpendicular to the Milky Way (MW) disc. In this work\nwe investigate the persistence and stability of the VPOS over time. We identify\nVPOS member galaxies and integrate their orbits over the past 5 Gyr using time\nevolving gravitational potentials that account for the mutual interaction\nbetween the MW and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The reconstructed\ntrajectories allow us to examine the long-term evolution of the VPOS. We\nidentify 15 galaxies as members of the VPOS, including 9 MW and 6 LMC\nsatellites. We find that the VPOS has remained a stable structure, maintaining\na roughly constant thickness ($\\sim$ 15 kpc), flattening ($c/a \\sim$ 0.2), and\norientation over time. The VPOS is not a transient alignment, but a long-lived\nplanar structure in the MW system, that has persisted for at least the last 5\nGyrs and predates the recent LMC infall. While the LMC exerts a strong\ngravitational influence on the MW satellites, its impact on the VPOS is\nlimited, leading only to mild perturbations. The structural properties of the\nVPOS remain almost unchanged, whether or not LMC satellites are included in the\nanalysis, indicating a smooth dynamical integration with the rest of VPOS\nmembers upon entering the MW virial radius. This minimal dynamical impact on\nthe VPOS results from the remarkable alignment between the LMC's orbit and the\nplane's orientation. We conclude that the VPOS is a stable, long-lived\nstructure that predates the recent infall of the LMC and retains nearly\nconstant structural properties over the last 5 Gyrs. Our findings suggest a\nstrong connection between the VPOS and the LMC, consistent with a scenario in\nwhich the LMC is on its second pericentre and the VPOS originated primarily\nfrom satellites stripped during the first passage.",

Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via\nmapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.\nSpecifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the\nembedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood\n(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their\ncorresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these\nembedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable\nhuman effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for\nsemi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the\nexploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a\nmapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The\nannotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable\nLLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated\nanalysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of\nmapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We\ninstantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate\nits effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings\nfrom prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its\narchitecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of\ntopological neighborhoods.",

Using the hidden integrability of the self-dual\nsector, we can solve the linearised Einstein equations on these self-dual black\nhole backgrounds exactly in terms of simple, explicit quasi-momentum\neigenstates. Using a description of the self-dual Taub-NUT metric and its\ngravitons in terms of twistor theory, we obtain an explicit formula, exact in\nthe background, for the tree-level maximal helicity violating graviton\nscattering amplitude at arbitrary multiplicity, with and without spin. This is\nobtained from the description of the MHV amplitudes in terms of the\nperturbation theory of a chiral sigma model whose target is the twistor space\nof the background. The incorporation of spin effects on these backgrounds is a\nstraightforward application of the Newman-Janis shift.

    "abstract": "Research on silicon nitride (SiN) nanomechanical resonators produces an\nexceptionally rich variety of resonator geometries, for which there is\ncurrently no available rapid prototyping solution. Experimental advances in\nnanobeam, trampoline, phononic bandgap, and soft-clamping structures all rely\non conventional nanofabrication involving e-beam or photolithography, followed\nby various etching steps. These techniques are typically time-consuming,\nrelatively inflexible, and often result in spurious residual SiN overhang that\ncan degrade mechanical quality factors. In contrast, recent work has shown that\nsimple resonant structures, such as nanobeams, can be prototyped by direct\nlaser ablation of free-standing SiN membranes using a spatially distributed\nsequence of microholes that limits stress concentration. However, these early\ndemonstrations were restricted to basic shapes, created by manually combining\nablation routines for circles and straight lines. Here, we demonstrate the\nfabrication of arbitrarily complex geometries using an open-source software\ntoolset--released with this publication--that automatically generates\nlaser-ablated hole sequences directly from standard semiconductor layout files\n(i.e., GDSII). The software includes a layout alignment tool that compensates\nfor the membrane orientation and dimensional variations, limiting material\noverhang to ~2 um. Using this toolset, we fabricate several resonator\ngeometries, each in under 1 hour, two of which are exhaustively characterized\nas candidate structures for high-performance radiation sensing. The measured\nquality factors of these structures closely match finite element simulations\nand reach values up to 3.7 x 10^6. From these measurements, we extract material\nquality factors above 3700, which is on par with low-stress SiN unablated plain\nmembranes and with comparable structures produced using conventional\nfabrication methods.",

We then introduce an ensemble-based approach that\nleverages statistical distributions of recurrence quantifiers, computed from\nnumerous independent realisations, allowing us to identify dynamical outliers\nas significant deviations from typical system behaviour. Through detailed\nnumerical analyses, we demonstrate that these outliers correspond to divergent\necological regimes associated with specific mobility values, providing also a\nrobust manner to infer the mobility parameter from observed numerical data.

The precision\nand scale of astrometric datasets make them well-suited for searching for a\nstochastic gravitational wave background, whose signature appears in the\ntwo-point correlation function of the deflection field across the sky. Although\nGaia achieves high accuracy in measuring angular separations in its focal\nplane, systematic uncertainties in the satellite's absolute orientation limit\nthe precision of absolute position measurements. These orientation errors can\nbe mitigated by focusing on relative angles between star pairs, which\neffectively cancel out common-mode orientation noise. In this work, we compute\nthe astrometric response and the overlap reduction functions for this relative\nastrometry approach, correcting previous expressions presented in the\nliterature. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to compare the sensitivity of\nrelative astrometry to that of conventional absolute astrometry. Our analysis\nshows that while the relative method is theoretically sound, its sensitivity is\nlimited for closely spaced star pairs within a single Gaia field of view. Pairs\nwith large angular separations could provide competitive sensitivity, but are\npractically inaccessible due to Gaia's scanning law.

At equal energy\nconsumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model\nsignificantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean\nsquared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation\nin data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds\ntraining samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine\nsimilarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work\nenables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing\nchallenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability\nto dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher\nlevel resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over\nenergy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.",

Furthermore, incorporating the running of the scalar spectral\nindex reinforces the models consistency with observational bounds. We also\nexplore the parameter space of the EGB couplings and identify the range of free\nparameters for which the results of $n_s$ and $r$ values remain within the $1\n\\sigma$ region of the ACT constraints.

    "abstract": "Understanding the structure of our universe and the distribution of matter is\nan area of active research. As cosmological surveys grow in complexity, the\ndevelopment of emulators to efficiently and effectively predict matter power\nspectra is essential. We are particularly motivated by the Mira-Titan Universe\nsimulation suite that, for a specified cosmological parameterization (termed a\n\"cosmology\"), provides multiple response curves of various fidelities,\nincluding correlated functional realizations. Our objective is two-fold. First,\nwe estimate the underlying true matter power spectra, with appropriate\nuncertainty quantification (UQ), from all of the provided curves. To this end,\nwe propose a novel Bayesian deep Gaussian process (DGP) hierarchical model\nwhich synthesizes all the simulation information to estimate the underlying\nmatter power spectra while providing effective UQ. Our model extends previous\nwork on Bayesian DGPs from scalar responses to correlated functional outputs.\nSecond, we leverage our predicted power spectra from various cosmologies in\norder to accurately predict the entire matter power spectra for an unobserved\ncosmology. For this task, we use basis function representations of the\nfunctional spectra to train a separate Gaussian process emulator. Our method\nperforms well in synthetic exercises and against the benchmark cosmological\nemulator (Cosmic Emu).",

These states are characterized by a pronounced negative\nvolume in the Wigner quasi-probability distribution and enhanced quantum Fisher\ninformation, indicative of their quantum utility.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the\nperformance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with\nByte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at\ncapturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including\nuneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence\ncontext. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens\nwith optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This\nhybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the\nmodel to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences\nsimultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was\nevaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating\nsignificantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of\n10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER.

To circumvent this inherent\ndrawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework\nthat leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions\nbetween real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial\nmanner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we\nfurther improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with\nhybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean\nsquared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the\ndistributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus\nproviding a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the\nnext stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM\nfine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves\nsuperior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU\ntime.

First, a catalog of quality criteria for these\nsubdivision algorithms is developed, serving as a guideline for the\nconstruction process.\n  The construction begins by generating the desired subdominant eigenvectors as\nthe vertices of regular convex 3-polytopes for volumes using circle packings.\nSubsequently, these polytopes are utilized to construct a\nColin-de-Verdiere-matrix for the generalized quadratic and a\nColin-de-Verdiere-like matrix for the generalized cubic B-spline subdivision.\nThese matrices are then adjusted using the matrix exponential to obtain\nsubdivision matrices with the desired properties.\n  All subdivision algorithms introduced in this paper empirically exhibit a\nsubdominant eigenvalue of 1/2 with the desired algebraic and geometric\nmultiplicity. For the quadratic case, this property can even be formally\nproven. Moreover, the corresponding eigenvectors form a convex polytope in the\ncentral region for the generalized quadratic B-spline subdivision algorithms,\nwhile for the generalized cubic B-spline subdivision algorithms, they represent\nthe refinement of a convex polytope. Additionally, the constructed subdivision\nalgorithms fulfill various other quality criteria, such as affine invariance\nand convex hull preservation and respecting all symmetries. Furthermore, it is\ndemonstrated that the original Catmull-Clark algorithm is not suitable for\ngeneralization to volumetric subdivision and that the established subdivision\nalgorithms [Baj+02] and [JM99] do not exhibit a suitable spectrum for several\ncombinatorial configurations. Additionally, research approaches for the\nvolumetric case are proposed, aiming to generalize from hexahedral to arbitrary\nstructures.",

    "abstract": "On heterogeneous memory (HM) where fast memory (i.e., CPU-attached DRAM) and\nslow memory (e.g., remote NUMA memory, RDMA-connected memory, Persistent Memory\n(PM)) coexist, optimizing the placement of tree-structure indexes (e.g.,\nB+tree) is crucial to achieving high performance while enjoying memory\nexpansion. Nowadays, CXL-based heterogeneous memory (CXL-HM) is emerging due to\nits high efficiency and memory semantics. Prior tree-structure index placement\nschemes for HM cannot effectively boost performance on CXL-HM, as they fail to\nadapt to the changes in hardware characteristics and semantics. Additionally,\nexisting CXL-HM page-level data placement schemes are not efficient for\ntree-structure indexes due to the granularity mismatch between the tree nodes\nand the page.\n  In this paper, we argue for a CXL native, tree-structure aware data placement\nscheme to optimize tree-structure indexes on CXL-HM. Our key insight is that\nthe placement of tree-structure indexes on CXL-HM should match the tree's\ninherent characteristics with CXL-HM features. We present SINLK, a\ntree-structure aware, node-grained data placement scheme for tree-structure\nindexes on CXL-HM. With SINLK, developers can easily adapt existing\ntree-structure indexes to CXL-HM. We have integrated the B+tree and radix tree\nwith SINLK to demonstrate its effectiveness. Evaluations show that SINLK\nimproves throughput by up to 71% and reduces P99 latency by up to 81% compared\nwith state-of-the-art data placement schemes (e.g., MEMTIS) and HM-optimized\ntree-structure indexes in YCSB and real-world workloads.",

Recognizing that English linguistic hegemony in science\nlimits participation and productivity, the document proposes multilingual\npresentation formats, academic writing training, a Virtual Writing Center,\nlanguage support programs, and writing retreats. Each recommendation is\ngrounded in both pedagogical theory and empirical evidence, with an emphasis on\ncollaborative, socially embedded approaches to scientific writing. The proposed\nacademic writing training integrates constructivist and socio-cultural\nperspectives, emphasizing genre awareness, rhetorical competence, and\nreflective practices. The Virtual Writing Center would serve as a permanent\ninfrastructure offering personalized tutoring and peer review support, while\nthe language support programs address ongoing needs through workshops,\nconsultations, and access to language tools. Writing retreats provide immersive\nenvironments for focused work and mentorship. The recommendations also\nencourage ethical use of AI tools for translation and writing assistance,\nfostering digital literacy alongside linguistic proficiency. Collectively,\nthese initiatives aim to transform language from a barrier into a resource,\nrecognizing multilingualism as an asset in global research collaboration.\nRather than offering a one-size-fits-all solution, the document advocates for\nadaptable, community-driven strategies that can evolve within the diverse\ninstitutional and disciplinary contexts of the Rubin Research Ecosystem.

Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing\nliquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,\ncompetition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then\naddresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary\napproaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the\nlatter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing\nobjectives.\n  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,\na novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This\nmethod allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,\nenabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.\n  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches\nsignificantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across\nvarious performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new\nmethodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive\nmarket making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic\ntrading in complex financial systems.",

    "abstract": "Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection\nshare a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here\nI show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation\nreveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\\Delta\\mathbf{\\theta} =\n\\mathbf{M}\\,\\mathbf{f} + \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{\\xi}$. The force $\\mathbf{f}$\ndrives improvement in parameters, $\\Delta\\mathbf{\\theta}$, in proportion to the\nslope of performance with respect to the parameters. The metric $\\mathbf{M}$\nrescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or\nchanges in the frame of reference. The noise $\\mathbf{\\xi}$ enables\nexploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,\nNewton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,\nAdam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same\nunderlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,\nKullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in\nlearning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a\nprincipled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning\nalgorithms across disciplines.",

By comparing the electronic transmission in nanoribbons with edges\nalong the crystallographic y and x directions, our analysis reveals a\npronounced anisotropy in the magnetic field response. The y-edge ribbon\nexhibits significant spin splitting of edge-state bands in both energy and\nmomentum space, along with a strong angular dependence of the conductance. The\nobserved magnetotransport response indicates a spin quantization axis that\naligns with the out-of-plane spin quantization axis reported in previous\nexperimental studies. In contrast, the x edge ribbon shows negligible spin\nsplitting under magnetic fields, which is attributed to nonsymmorphic\nsymmetries such as glide mirror and screw rotation, that protects degeneracies\nalong the Gamma X direction, even when time-reversal symmetry is broken. The\nenergy-resolved current density and angular transmission analyses confirm that\nthis anisotropy originates from edge states, while bulk states remain largely\ninsensitive to the field orientation.

However, in unposed reconstruction task from\nhundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits\nand lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that\nintegrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping\nstrategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a\nglobal space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,\nwe formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic\nProcrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing\nprobabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain\ncorrespondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within\nminutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization\nframework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from\nconfidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering\nwith an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling\naccurate reconstruction and pose estimation.

In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the\nfirst general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)\nmodels, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To\ndynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we\nfirst introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the\ncausal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical\ncoarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key\ncomponents: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for\nevaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or\nrejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain\nsufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity\nsearch. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,\nenabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,\nresampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using\npotential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating\nmulti-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity\nshow a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75).

We find that the first issue\narises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue\nstems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and\nnext-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To\naddress these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we\npropose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition\nof reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient.

Since current VDB service providers predominantly use\nproprietary black-box models, users are forced to expose raw query text to them\nvia API in exchange for the vector retrieval services. Consequently, if query\ntext involves confidential records from finance or healthcare domains, this\nmechanism inevitably leads to critical leakage of user's sensitive information.\nTo address this issue, we introduce STEER (\\textbf{S}ecure \\textbf{T}ransformed\n\\textbf{E}mbedding v\\textbf{E}ctor\\textbf{ R}etrieval), a private vector\nretrieval framework that leverages the alignment relationship between the\nsemantic spaces of different embedding models to derive approximate embeddings\nfor the query text. STEER performs the retrieval using the approximate\nembeddings within the original VDB and requires no modifications to the server\nside. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that STEER\neffectively safeguards query text privacy while maintaining the retrieval\naccuracy. Even though approximate embeddings are approximations of the\nembeddings from proprietary models, they still prevent the providers from\nrecovering the query text through Embedding Inversion Attacks (EIAs). Extensive\nexperimental results show that Recall@100 of STEER can basically achieve a\ndecrease of less than 5\\%. Furthermore, even when searching within a text\ncorpus of millions of entries, STEER achieves a Recall@20 accuracy 20\\% higher\nthan current baselines.",

In recent years, the rise of\nlanguages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions\nof coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most\nnotably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive\nreasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a\nprogram congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the\nlanguage. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as\n\\emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific\nlanguage and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a\nuniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal\ndimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled\nby an \\emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very\ngeneral categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of\nbehavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via\nfibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental\ncongruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the\ncategorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an\nAHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a\ncongruence.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data\ngeneration by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data\ninherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature\ninteractions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental\nmismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across\nall pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in\ndatasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To\naddress this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a\nnovel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'\nattention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module\nguided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key\nfeature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across\ndiverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing\nLLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving\ncompetitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.\nOur method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution\nfor structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.",

Modern research on bio-inspired computational\nattention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by\nutilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In\nthis work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based\nBayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework\ndesigned for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.\nSemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic\nfusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained\ndetectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve\nfixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18\nbenchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction\nmodels. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human\nground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down\napproaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models.

    "abstract": "Environmental processes often exhibit complex, non-linear patterns and\ndiscontinuities across space and time, posing significant challenges for\ntraditional geostatistical modeling approaches. In this paper, we propose a\nhybrid spatio-temporal modeling framework that combines the interpretability\nand uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models -- estimated using the\nINLA-SPDE approach -- with the predictive power and flexibility of Random\nForest (RF). Specifically, we introduce two novel algorithms, collectively\nnamed INLA-RF, which integrate a statistical spatio-temporal model with RF in\nan iterative two-stage framework. The first algorithm (INLA-RF1) incorporates\nRF predictions as an offset in the INLA-SPDE model, while the second (INLA-RF2)\nuses RF to directly correct selected latent field nodes. Both hybrid strategies\nenable uncertainty propagation between modeling stages, an aspect often\noverlooked in existing hybrid approaches. In addition, we propose a\nKullback-Leibler divergence-based stopping criterion. We evaluate the\npredictive performance and uncertainty quantification capabilities of the\nproposed algorithms through two simulation studies. Results suggest that our\nhybrid approach enhances spatio-temporal prediction while maintaining\ninterpretability and coherence in uncertainty estimates.",

A\nstudy of Joule losses demonstrates that the best switching strategy minimizing\nthese losses depends on the fractional derivative's order and the power\nexponent in the equation of motion. It is found that when the order of the\nfractional derivative exceeds half of the power exponent, the best approach is\nto employ a wide pulse. Conversely, when this condition is not met, Joule\nlosses are minimized by applying a zero current followed by a narrow current\npulse of the highest allowable amplitude. These findings are explored further\nin the context of multi-pulse control.

The uniqueness of the Fisher--Rao metric and the\nduality of these connections is at the heart of classical information geometry.\nHowever, these features do not carry over straightforwardly to quantum systems,\nwhere a Hermitian inner product structure on the Hilbert space induces a metric\non the complex projective space of pure states -- the Fubini-Study tensor,\nwhich is preserved under the unitary evolution. In this work, we explore how\nmodifying the Hermitian tensor structure on the projective space may affect the\ngeometry of pure quantum states, and whether such generalisations can be used\nto define dual connections with a direct correspondence to classical\nprobability distribution functions, modified by the presence of a non-trivial\nphase. We show that it is indeed possible to construct a family of connections\nthat are dual to each other in a generalised sense with respect to the\nreal-valued sector of the Fubini--Study tensor. Using this biorthogonal\nformalism, we systematically classify the four types of tensors that can arise\nwhen the dynamics of a quantum system are governed by a non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian, identifying both the complex-valued metric and the Berry\ncurvature.

Yet fundamental\nquestions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across\ndisciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves\ntogether functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent\nneuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we\nprove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together\nwith global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property\n(geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate\nactivation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds,\ncovering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a\nStone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with\npolynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of\ncausal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to\nstochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via\nmemory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute\ndelay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the\n\\textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical\nsystems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive\nconditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical\ncriticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input\ngain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and\nneuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully\ntrained recurrent networks in practice.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical\nresearch area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While\nmany digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack\nphysical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial\nobject attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to\ninconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a\ndevice-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical\nadversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source\ncode with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our\nframework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by\nsuccessfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond\nthe framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and\nadvance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.",

    "abstract": "In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on\nprecedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively\nover time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case\nretrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to\nautomatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from\na large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several\nparadigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods\ncontinue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art\ndeep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key\nchallenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful\nBERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which\ninevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss\nof legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data\nprivacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it\ndifficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we\naddress these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.\nLLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an\nunsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both\nchallenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art\nLLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they\noutperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.",

We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,\nGoogle Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating\nsynthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant\narticles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given\nto the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main\npurpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,\ncorpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of\nevaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where\nutility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic\nmedical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a\nmoderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream\nNLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the\nreal documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming\nsparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind\ngenerating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to\ncheck for the existence of any sensitive information.

Safety and driver assistance\nsystems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly\nenhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in\ndescribing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual\nevidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed\nunderstanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal\nModels (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists\nof two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'\nunderstanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid\nvisual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from\nthe internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we\npropose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM\ninstruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like\nMLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'\ngeneralizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on\nfine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap\nbetween MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on\nquestion-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs\nfine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition\ntasks.

However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical\nimages remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse\nfinite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are\ncomputationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep\nlearning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape\ndirectly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating\nbiophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with\nphysiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and\nfiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts\na graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to\nenable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial\nself-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training\ndatasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV\ngeometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter\naccuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing\ninference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and\nsignificantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation\nstudies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the\ncycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as\nfew as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate\nsurrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in\nthe future.",

    "abstract": "The unitary dynamics of quantum systems can be modeled as a trajectory on a\nRiemannian manifold. This theoretical framework naturally yields a purely\ngeometric interpretation of computational complexity for quantum algorithms, a\nnotion originally developed by Michael Nielsen (Circa, 2007). However, for\nnonunitary dynamics, it is unclear how one can recover a completely geometric\ncharacterization of Nielsen-like geometric complexity. The main obstacle to\novercome is that nonunitary dynamics cannot be characterized by Lie groups\n(which are Riemannian manifolds), as is the case for unitary dynamics. Building\non Nielsen's work, we present a definition of geometric complexity for a fairly\ngeneric family of quantum channels. These channels are useful for modeling\nnoise in quantum circuits, among other things, and analyze the geometric\ncomplexity of these quantum channels.",

The accuracy of these approximations is measured\nthrough the behaviour in the diagonal, where the usual univariate Eulerian\npolynomials sit. In particular, in this sense, the accuracy of the global\nspectrahedral approximation produced by the spectrahedral relaxation can be\nmeasured in terms of bounds for the extreme roots of univariate Eulerian\npolynomials. The bounds thus obtained beat the previous bounds found in the\nliterature. However, the bound explicitly studied and obtained before beat the\npreviously known bounds by a quantity going to $0$ when $n$ goes to infinity.\nHere we use numerical experiments to construct a sequence of vectors providing\na (linearized) bound whose difference with the previous known bounds is a\ngrowing exponential function (going therefore fast to infinity when $n$ grows).\nThis allows us to establish a better (diagonal) measure of accuracy for the\nspectrahedral relaxation of the Eulerian rigidly convex sets.

This\nmethod is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker\ndecomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional\nclassification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as\na regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation\nof pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each\nEuler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension\nof the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.\nAlmost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.\nHence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our\ntraining set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering\nthe corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited\ntraining data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an\nobject from facial landmarks.

    "abstract": "In structure-based virtual screening, it is often necessary to evaluate the\nbinding free energy of protein-ligand complexes by considering not only\nmolecular conformations but also how these structures shift and rotate in\nspace. The number of possible combinations grows rapidly and can become\noverwhelming. While classical computing has limitations in this context,\nquantum computing offers a promising alternative due to its inherent\nparallelism. In this study, we introduce a quantum machine learning approach\nthat encodes molecular information into quantum states and processes them using\nparameterized quantum gates. The model is implemented and trained using\nPyTorch, and its performance is evaluated under three settings: ideal\nsimulation, limited-shot sampling, and simulations with quantum noise. With six\nquantum circuit units, the model achieves an RMSD of 2.37 kcal/mol and a\nPearson correlation of 0.650. Even when using 100,000 shots, the predictions\nremain consistent, indicating that the model is compatible with near-term\nquantum hardware. Although noise slightly reduces accuracy, the ranking of\nligand affinities remains largely unchanged. These findings point to a\npractical and scalable strategy that balances robustness and predictive power,\noffering a viable path to accelerate virtual screening through moderately deep\nquantum circuits.",

    "abstract": "Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging\ndue to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process\nrequires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning\n(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful\nrepresentations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data\nis limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include\nV-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level\nreconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited\nto ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail\nwhile effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.\nSimilar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is\nwell-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small\nmedical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and\nabsence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we\npropose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT\nrepresentations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our\nauxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various\nfrozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\\% using 100\\% and up to\n8.35\\% using only 10\\% of the training data.",

    "abstract": "Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,\nmany regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill\nof rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine\nlearning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and\ncomputational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major\nchallenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological\nPrediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that\nleverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first\napplies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 \"uncalibrated\" catchment-based\nconceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear\nregression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that\nensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the\nrequired BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged\nbasins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from\n87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta\nEfficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)\nbut required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%\nof basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower\nuncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).\nThese results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not\nnecessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is\nassembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER\nprovides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge\nprediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide\nrange of regions.",

Accordingly, standardized\ndesign and operation guidelines are essential to improve energy efficiency and\nlower costs. This study analyzes the production performance and energy\nconsumption of a vertical farming system, assessing its efficiency,\nsustainability, and economic viability. A total of 162 scenarios were evaluated\nby combining three levels of temperature, photosynthetic photon flux density\n(PPFD), and CO2 concentration across three distinct climatic zones, namely\nNorway, China, and Dubai, which also differ from a socio-environmental\nviewpoint. Two insulation thicknesses were also tested in each scenario.\nResults indicate that due to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and\ndehumidification (HVACD) system, neither the insulation layer nor the external\nclimate significantly influences crop productivity. PPFD proved to be the\ndominant factor in crop growth (correlation: 0.85), followed by CO2 (0.36) and\nindoor temperature (0.22). PPFD also emerged as the primary driver of overall\nenergy consumption (correlation: 0.73), as it affects both lighting and HVACD\nloads. Notably, the lowest specific energy consumption (SEC) coincided with the\nlowest crop productivity (55 kg/m2). The levelized cost of lettuce (LCoL),\nbalancing productivity and energy use, identified the most cost-effective setup\nas 24C, 250 PPFD, 1400 ppm CO2, with insulation, consistent across all\nclimates.

We give three applications, where $S$ is the Smyth, Hoare or Plotkin\nhyperspace monad, $T$ is a monad of continuous valuations, and $U$ is a monad\nof previsions or of forks, depending on the case. As a byproduct, this allows\nus to describe the algebras of monads of superlinear, resp. sublinear\nprevisions.

With the rapid development of\nGenerative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)\nhave become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,\nthe SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails\nto generalize to unseen samples.

To this end, we introduce FinDPO,\nthe first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human\npreference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed\nFinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment\nclassification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models\nby 11% on the average.

Our results suggest that\nafter dissolution, environmental policies improve in several dimensions: the\ncapital expenditure for sustainable development and the environment increases;\nthe current expenditure on integrated water system increases; the percentage of\nsorted waste increases because, as we show, public expenditure is reallocated\ntoward sorted waste at the expenses of unsorted waste. These results are robust\nto different specifications of the control group. In addition, we find\nsignificant spillover effects: the dissolution of infiltrated city councils\nimplies an improvement in environmental policies in adjacent municipalities.\nOur results have a straightforward policy implication, the need to combat\norganized crime as a way to improve the environmental conditions of the\nterritories plagued by its pervasive presence.",

To date, research has focused on\naltermagnetic phases in periodic crystals, where the order is linked to\nspecific crystallographic rotation symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat quasicrystals, which possess rotational symmetries forbidden in periodic\nlattices, can host exotic altermagnetic orders.

In this regime,\nshorter TDI time spans with minimal null frequencies facilitate more accurate\nwaveform modeling and parameter recovery in frequency domain. In contrast,\nconfigurations with longer time spans and more null frequencies, such as the\nMichelson, are more susceptible to frequency aliasing and waveform modulation\neffects, which degrade inference accuracy. However, if signal modeling and\nanalysis are performed in the time domain, all TDI configurations become\neffectively equivalent.

Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control\nactions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its\ncontrol performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling.\nTraditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between\ncapturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often\nresulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework.\nThis method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a\nLinear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input\nbased on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC\ncalculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by\nadding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and\ninterpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance\noptimization through residual modeling. This method has been validated on the\nCarsim-Matlab joint simulation platform and a physical 1:10 scale F1TENTH\nracing car.

We conducted a system evaluation to assess PALM's effectiveness in\ntwo key areas: (1) its impact on students' awareness of their learning\nbehaviors, and (2) its comparative performance against existing systems. The\nresults indicate that PALM enhances learners' awareness of study planning and\nreflection, particularly by improving perceived behavioral control through the\nvisual presentation of individual learning histories and statistical trends,\nwhich clarify the links between learning actions and outcomes. Although PALM\nrequires ongoing refinement as a system, it received significantly higher\nevaluations than existing systems in terms of visual appeal and usability.

While traditional\nmodels like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle\nto generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in\nvision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer\npromising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In\nthis work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze\nits performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and\nshape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to\nsuppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only\nclass-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent\nbehavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual\ncues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating\nclass-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce\nattention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification\naccuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a\ndiscussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and\noutline directions for future work to improve generalizability across\ndomain-independent healthcare scenarios.",

Specifically, it is known that at the foam\nlevel, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the\nparticular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective\ndynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the\nlatter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can\nimmediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of\nthe topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this\nTDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic\nevolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We\nconfront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with\nPantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations\n(BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets.

This task requires estimating multiple material\nmaps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of\nconstraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.\nPrevious works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for\ntraining, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to\nrendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further\nalleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)\nbased on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the\nnormal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and\nsubsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially\nfor the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using\nan end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance\namong various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we\ndesign a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full\nuse of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the\nperformance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial\nmaterial results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a\nfinetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map\nhas different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled\nPBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be\noptimized during the training of prior models.

This fundamental\nlimitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose\ngeneration where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel\none-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate\nspace from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while\nmaintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key\ninnovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or\ntoken-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a\nrelative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,\nand a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation\nwith identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive\nexperiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)\ndatasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing\nquantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term\ngeneration scenarios.",

While LAM uses\nlateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global\ndomain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences\nin model design impact relative performance and potential applications.\nSpecifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are\nidentified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using\nthe Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a\nshared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a\nnear-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to\nexplore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show\nthat both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally\naccurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain.\nVarious differences were identified in the performance of the models across\napplications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary\nforcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in\ncontexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained\nfor easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and\nsignificantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability.

In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel\nframework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by\ncombining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,\nMVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and\nspatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for\ndownstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to\noptimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal\ndomain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances\ntemporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key\nchallenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior\n4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate\nthat MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and\ntime efficiency.

We discuss all\nrelevant noise sources, the modeled influence of the interferometric sensor\ndamping and the current limitations and necessary improvements of our testing\nfacility in terms of seismic pre-isolation to achieve a shadow sensor limited\nnoise at around 5 Hz, where, according to our simulations, we can demonstrate\nsuperior performance for COBRIs in the longitudinal degree of freedom.",

Specifically,\nwe distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple\nforward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but\nfine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

From the respective of the algorithm, the\nobjective function is approximated by the so-called local model function and\nsubproblems aim to exploit the proximal point(s) of such model function, which\nhelp to achieve the sufficiently decreasing functional sequence along with the\nbacktracking line search principle. Under mild assumptions in terms of the\nfirst-order information of the model function, every accumulation point of the\ngenerated sequence is stationary and the sequence of the variable metric is\nproved not to be bounded. Additionally, if the function has the\nKurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz property at the corresponding accumulation point, we\nfind that the whole sequence is convergent to the stationary point, and the\nsequence of the variable metric is proved to be uniformly bounded. Through the\nabove results, we think that the boundedness of the sequence of the variable\nmetric should depend on the regularity of objectives, rather than being assumed\nas a prior for nonsmooth optimization problems. Numerical experiments on\npolytope feasibility problems and (sparse) quadratic inverse problems\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model-based proximal quasi-Newton\nmethod, in comparison with the associated model-based proximal gradient method.",

    "abstract": "The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is widely used to describe\nrarefied gas flows. The DSMC method accounts for the transport and collisions\nof computational particles, resulting in higher computational costs in the\ncontinuum regime. The Fokker-Planck (FP) model approximates particle collisions\nas Brownian motion to reduce computational cost. Advanced FP models have been\ndeveloped to enhance physical fidelity, ensuring the correct Prandtl number and\nthe H-theorem. The FP model has further been extended to handle diatomic gases,\nsuch as the Fokker-Planck-Master (FPM) model. Alongside these developments in\nmodeling, computational efficiency has also been improved by achieving\nsecond-order spatial and temporal accuracy, as demonstrated in the unified\nstochastic particle FP (USP-FP) method. However, these accuracy improvements\nhave not yet been extended to diatomic gases, which are essential for\nengineering applications such as atmospheric reentry. This study proposes a\nunified stochastic particle Fokker-Planck-Master (USP-FPM) method for diatomic\ngases that achieves second-order accuracy in both time and space. Temporal\naccuracy is enhanced by reproducing second-order energy, viscous stress, and\nheat flux relaxations. Spatial accuracy is improved by employing a first-order\npolynomial reconstruction method. Three test cases are investigated:\nhomogeneous relaxation, Poiseuille flow, and hypersonic flow around a cylinder.\nThe results show that the USP-FPM method provides accurate solutions even with\ncoarser cell sizes and larger time steps compared to the DSMC and FPM methods.\nIn particular, for the hypersonic flow around a cylinder, the USP-FPM method\nachieves a speed-up factor of 28 compared to the DSMC method, while maintaining\naccuracy.",

Here, a lesser-explored\nfeature of incompressible shear flows-the absorbing zone-is investigated. This\nregion in the infinite dimensional state space is shown to act as an attractor\nfor all trajectories: any solution initialised outside eventually enters and\nremains inside. Consequently, the absorbing zone must contain all possible\nattractors, both chaotic and non-chaotic.\n  Existence is established through the Reynolds-Orr identity, which indicates\nthat nonlinear terms do not directly influence the temporal evolution of\nkinetic energy. The zone is constructed around a so-called shift flow, and\nmultiple such regions may exist, even when the laminar state is linearly\nunstable. Gradient based optimisation is employed to identify the absorbing\nzone of minimal radius. Assuming a chaotic trajectory explores state space\nrandomly, it is hypothesised that the centroid of this minimal zone\napproximates the turbulent mean flow. This central state is computed for plane\nPoiseuille and Couette flows and compared with established turbulent mean\nprofiles.\n  Although the proposed hypothesis is found to be an\noversimplification-yielding profiles that qualitatively resemble but do not\nquantitatively reproduce the turbulent means-the methodology provides novel\ninsights into shear flow dynamics. Furthermore, it offers a promising\nfoundation for refining estimates of global stability thresholds.

    "abstract": "Galaxy interactions can disturb gas in galactic discs, compress it, excite\nit, and enhance star formation. An intriguing system likely consisting of two\ninteracting galaxies overlapping on the line-of-sight was previously studied\nthrough ionised gas observations from the integral-field spectrograph Mapping\nNearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA). A decomposition into two components using MaNGA\nspectra, together with a multi-wavelength study, allowed to characterise the\nsystem as a minor-merger with interaction-induced star-formation, and maybe AGN\nactivity. We use new interferometric observations of the CO(1-0) gas of this\nsystem from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) to confront and\ncombine the spatially-resolved ionised and molecular gas observations. Mock\nNOEMA and MaNGA data are computed from simulated systems of two discs and\ncompared to the observations. The NOEMA observations of the molecular gas,\ndynamically colder than the ionised gas, help to precise the configuration of\nthe system, which we revisit as being a major merger. Combination of ionised\nand molecular gas data allow us to study the star-formation efficiency of the\nsystem.",

We propose a novel\nplug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and\nfeedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can\ncapture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing\ndeformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement\nfield and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than\ndirectly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative\ndeformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation\nand the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the\nfundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep\nlearning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the\nproposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same\nconfiguration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the\nart performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated\nthat the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly\nlearn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model\nrepresentation and generalization capabilities. The proposed module is similar\nto the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more\nmachine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.",

To overcome the lack of such a dataset,\nrecent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to\nvariations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model\nto generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the\nresulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves\nonly to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore\non-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game\ndevelopment. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge\ndistillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a\nhigh-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast\nto the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of\nconvolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention\ncontext or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can\nreduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context\nto up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations.

Coupling classical or\nquantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general\nrelativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to\nnon-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse.

However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality\nexamples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)\nDifficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and\nfeedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR\ndecouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval\nmodule to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task\ndataset.

    "abstract": "As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual\nprototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed\nto cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the\nenvironment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface\n(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.\n  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a\nSystem-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software\nfrom a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software\nwithout requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the\nso-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized\nframework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and\nconcepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks\nnative FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation\nenvironments.\n  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with\nSystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a\nsimulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature\nvalues from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified\ntarget software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data\nsuch as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,\nextensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready\nand the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,\ncertifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.",

In\npractice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function\napproximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial\ninformation. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of\nthese methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to\nlearning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.\nThrough a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn\nbrittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.\nCrucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design\nnecessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of\nthe learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also\nsuggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core\nassumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative\nenvironments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in\nobservations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring\nsuccess requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.",

To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible\nCamera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded\nwith a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is\nindividually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its\nlifecycle.

The code builds upon the foundational frameworks of\nthe PEST and IPREQ codes, introducing several enhancements and new\ncapabilities. Notably, pyIPREQ supports the specification of limiter boundaries\nand enables the computation of key physical quantities. The code has also been\nextended to compute equilibria constrained by a prescribed magnetic axis\nposition, which is particularly useful when such information is available from\ndiagnostics like Sine-Cosine coils. In addition, pyIPREQ includes functionality\nto address vertical instabilities, a requirement for accurately modeling\nelongated plasma configurations. Benchmarking has been carried out against\npublished results and the original IPREQ code. Applications are demonstrated\nfor ADITYA-U Tokamak experiments, where magnetic axis measurements are\navailable, and predictions are also made for SST-1 and ADITYA-U Tokamaks under\nvarious operational scenarios.",

Accurate estimation of a State of Health\n(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability\nand safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,\ntransformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from\ndischarge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities\ninherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at\nnon-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.\nTo address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences\nrather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and\ncompromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\narchitecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).\nTIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent\nirregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention\nmechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence\ninformation. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show\nthat TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%\nreduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below\n0.58%.

However, their application\nto scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly\nused in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce\nFieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'\nunderstanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a\nfield-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model\ntuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a\nspecial-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from\nfield data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.\nThis information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that\nserve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on\nLVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to\nreduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative\nvalues.

The defining\ncharacteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\ncapabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector\nagainst LRMs, which we term \"overthinking backdoors\". We advance this concept\nby proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks\nto one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's\nreasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning\nmethodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals\nthe desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These\nresponses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject\na controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning\nprocess. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and\nestablishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive\nempirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably\ntrigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning\nprocess, without degrading the final answer's correctness.

We learn that both observations can generically be\nexplained within an ultraviolet completion of the Standard Model with gravity.\nWe find that certain relations between CKM matrix elements should hold\napproximately because of asymptotically safe regimes, including\n$|V_{ud}|^2+|V_{us}|^2 \\approx 1$ and $|V_{cd}|^2+|V_{cs}|^2\\approx 1$.\nTheoretically, the accuracies of these relations determine the length of the\nasymptotically safe regimes. Experimental data confirms these relations with an\naccuracy of $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$, respectively. This difference in\naccuracies is also expected, because the ultraviolet completion consists in a\nfixed-point cascade during which one relation is established already much\ndeeper in the ultraviolet. This results in $|V_{ub}|^2 < |V_{cb}|^2$ and\ntranslates into measurable properties of $B$-mesons.\n  Similar results would hold for the PMNS matrix, if neutrino Yukawa couplings\nwere large. The ultraviolet complete theory therefore must -- and in fact can\n-- avoid such an outcome. It contains a mechanism that dynamically limits the\nsize of neutrino Yukawa couplings. Below an upper bound on the sum of Dirac\nneutrino masses, this allows the PMNS matrix to avoid a near-diagonal structure\nlike the CKM matrix. Thus, large neutrino mixing is intimately tied to small\nDirac neutrino masses, $\\sum m_{\\nu} \\lesssim {\\mathcal{O}} (1)\\, \\rm eV$ and a\nmass gap in the Standard Model fermion masses.",

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most\nwidespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and\nremarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is\nrelatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA\nfine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).\nHowever, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more\ninformation leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we\nintroduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the\nfine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership\ninference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that\nleverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply\nLoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language\nprocessing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still\nvulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).\nWe also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the\nresulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only\ndropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively\nmitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the\n\"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model\nmakes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can\nprovide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.",

In this paper, we present updated exclusion limits\non various vLQ species, accounting for all the relevant production mechanisms\nat the LHC. In particular, we highlight the critical role of indirect\nproduction and its interference with the Standard Model Drell-Yan process. This\ninterference can be constructive or destructive, depending on the specific\nquantum numbers of the vLQ, and significantly impacts the sensitivity of\ncurrent searches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that including QCD-QED mixed pair\nproduction channels leads to a noticeable shift in model-independent mass\nlimits. Additionally, we examine the validity of the full theory with vLQs and\ncorresponding effective operators in the high mass regime. Overall, our\nanalysis yields a substantial improvement in the exclusion limits on vLQs\ncompared to the existing results in the literature.",

Therefore, many\ntechniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However,\nthey fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to\nproper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after\nbeing opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques\nunconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers\nthat waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and\ngenerating false positive bug reports.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing\ntechnique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs\nto understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination\nconstraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling\nframework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz\ndrivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing\ncampaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,\nmultiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while\nsimultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or\nsuspension.\n  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared\nto baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead\nand outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries.

The algorithm, based on the\nrecently developed WaveHoltz scheme, solves a related time-dependent wave\nequation as part of an iteration. At each iteration, the solution to the wave\nequation is filtered in time. As the iteration progresses, the filtered\nsolution generally contains relatively larger and larger proportions of\neigenmodes whose eigenvalues are near a chosen target frequency (target\neigenvalue). The ability to choose an arbitrary target frequency enables the\ncomputation of eigenvalues anywhere in the spectrum, without the need to invert\nan indefinite matrix, as is common with other approaches. Furthermore, the\niteration can be embedded within a matrix-free Arnoldi algorithm, which enables\nthe efficient computation of multiple eigenpairs near the target frequency. For\nefficiency, the time-dependent wave equation can be solved with implicit\ntime-stepping and only about $10$ time-steps per-period are needed, independent\nof the mesh spacing. When the (definite) implicit time-stepping equations are\nsolved with a multigrid algorithm, the cost of the resulting EigenWave scheme\nscales linearly with the number of grid points $N$ as the mesh is refined,\ngiving an optimal $O(N)$ algorithm.

Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we\ninvestigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but\neffective -- due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and\nnon-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing\nquintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\\rm\nde}$.

The intrinsic equation of\nstate of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A\nnonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\\sigma$ at $z\\sim0.3$.

The method helps correct challenging\nNyquist ghosts, particularly on scanners with high-performance gradients or\nultra-high fields. Methods: A method for multishot EPI ghost correction, called\nmultishot dual-polarity GRAPPA (msDPG), is developed by extending the DPG\nconcept to multishot readouts. msDPG employs tailored DPG kernels to address\nhigh-order phase differences between two EPI readout polarities, which cannot\nbe fully addressed using linear phase correction (LPC). Advanced regularizers\ncan be readily employed with the proposed msDPG for physiologic inter-shot\nphase variation correction during reconstruction. Additionally, a calibration\nrefinement method is proposed to improve the quality of the DPG calibration\ndata and enhance reconstruction performance. Results: Phantom and in vivo\nexperiments on scanners with high-performance gradients and ultra-high fields\ndemonstrated that msDPG achieved superior ghost correction performance than\nLPC, reducing the ghost-to-signal ratio (GSR) by over 50%. Compared to\nconventional DPG, msDPG provided images with lower noise amplification,\nparticularly for acquisitions with large in-plane acceleration. Consequently,\nhigh-fidelity, submillimeter diffusion images were obtained using msDPG with\nregularized reconstruction. Conclusion: The proposed msDPG provides a robust\nNyquist ghost correction method for multishot EPI, enabling submillimeter\nimaging with improved fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Optimization-based PDE solvers that minimize scalar loss functions have\ngained increasing attention in recent years. These methods either define the\nloss directly over discrete variables, as in Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL),\nor indirectly through a neural network surrogate, as in Physics-Informed Neural\nNetworks (PINNs). However, despite their promise, such methods often converge\nmuch more slowly than classical iterative solvers and are commonly regarded as\ninefficient. This work provides a theoretical insight, attributing the\ninefficiency to the use of the mean squared error (MSE) loss, which implicitly\nforms the normal equations, squares the condition number, and severely impairs\noptimization. To address this, we propose a novel Stabilized Gradient Residual\n(SGR) loss. By tuning a weight parameter, it flexibly modulates the condition\nnumber between the original system and its normal equations, while reducing to\nthe MSE loss in the limiting case. We systematically benchmark the convergence\nbehavior and optimization stability of the SGR loss within both the ODIL\nframework and PINNs-employing either numerical or automatic differentiation-and\ncompare its performance against classical iterative solvers. Numerical\nexperiments on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that, within the ODIL\nframework, the proposed SGR loss achieves orders-of-magnitude faster\nconvergence than the MSE loss. Further validation within the PINNs framework\nshows that, despite the high nonlinearity of neural networks, SGR consistently\noutperforms the MSE loss. These theoretical and empirical findings help bridge\nthe performance gap between classical iterative solvers and optimization-based\nsolvers, highlighting the central role of loss conditioning, and provide key\ninsights for the design of more efficient PDE solvers.",

However, much of the\nmobility data-driven research on evacuation and displacement destination choice\nbehavior has often underemphasized the role of social factors, including\nindividual preferences and social connections. To this end, we use large-scale\ndata of anonymized GPS traces and online social connections from the Marshall\nFires in Colorado, USA, to unravel the associations between social and\nbehavioral factors and evacuation destinations and long-term displacement\ndecisions. We find that behavioral characteristics and social homophily play a\nsignificant role in post-disaster mobility decisions.

However, a general and in-depth\nunderstanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the\ndevelopment of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs.\n  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR\nsystem bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their\nsymptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes\nconsiderable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15\ndistinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new\ninteresting findings and implications which help shed light on future research\non tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified\nsymptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is\ncharacterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards.\nSecond, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the\nmajority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and\ndecision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction,\ndetection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and\nthe modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to\nfocus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.",

To\ninvestigate this response, we model the impact of an icy cometary body with an\nEarth-analogue exoplanet (i.e. an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star\nwith a diurnal cycle) using a cometary impact and breakup model coupled with\nthe 3D Earth-System-Model WACCM6/CESM2. To quantify the role that the\natmospheric dynamics play in setting the response to a cometary impact, we\ncompare our results with a previous study investigating an impact with a\ntidally-locked terrestrial exoplanet. We find that the circulation regime of\nthe planet plays a key role in shaping the response of the atmosphere to an icy\ncometary impact. The weak, multi-celled circulation structure that forms on\nEarth-like planets is efficient at mixing material horizontally but not\nvertically, limiting the transport of water from the deep break-up site to\nhigher altitudes. In turn, this limits the rate of water photodissociation at\nlow pressures, reducing the magnitude of post-impact changes to composition. It\nalso reduces the potential observability of an impact due to weakened cloud ice\nformation, and hence scattering, at low pressures. Despite this, small changes\nto the overall composition of the planet persist to quasi-steady-state,\nreinforcing the idea that ongoing bombardment may help to shape the\ncomposition/habitability of terrestrial worlds.",

    "abstract": "Of growing concern in privacy scholarship is artificial intelligence (AI), as\na powerful producer of inferences. Taken to its limits, AI may be presumed\ncapable of inferring \"everything from everything,\" thereby making untenable any\nnormative scheme, including privacy theory and privacy regulation, which rests\non protecting privacy based on categories of data - sensitive versus\nnon-sensitive, private versus public. Discarding data categories as a normative\nanchoring in privacy and data protection as a result of an unconditional\nacceptance of AI's inferential capacities is what we call privacy nihilism. An\nethically reasoned response to AI inferences requires a sober consideration of\nAI capabilities rather than issuing an epistemic carte blanche. We introduce\nthe notion of conceptual overfitting to expose how privacy nihilism turns a\nblind eye toward flawed epistemic practices in AI development. Conceptual\noverfitting refers to the adoption of norms of convenience that simplify the\ndevelopment of AI models by forcing complex constructs to fit data that are\nconceptually under-representative or even irrelevant. While conceptual\noverfitting serves as a helpful device to counter normative suggestions\ngrounded in hyperbolic AI capability claims, AI inferences shake any privacy\nregulation that hinges protections based on restrictions around data\ncategories. We propose moving away from privacy frameworks that focus solely on\ndata type, neglecting all other factors. Theories like contextual integrity\nevaluate the normative value of privacy across several parameters, including\nthe type of data, the actors involved in sharing it, and the purposes for which\nthe information is used.",

Specifically, each agent\n$i$ assigns one of two positive values $a_i > b_i > 0$ to each good, indicating\nthat agent $i$'s valuation of any good is either $a_i$ or $b_i$. For\nconvenience, we denote the value ratio of agent $i$ as $r_i = a_i / b_i$.\n  We give a characterization to all the Pareto-optimal allocations. Our\ncharacterization implies a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if a given\nallocation is Pareto-optimal in the case each $r_i$ is an integer. For the\ngeneral case (where $r_i$ may be fractional), we show that this decision\nproblem is coNP-complete. Our result complements the existing results: this\ndecision problem is coNP-complete for tri-valued utilities (where each agent's\nvalue for each good belongs to $\\{a,b,c\\}$ for some prescribed $a>b>c\\geq0$),\nand this decision problem belongs to P for bi-valued utilities (where $r_i$ in\nour model is the same for each agent).\n  We further show that an EFX allocation always exists and can be computed in\npolynomial time under the personalized bi-valued utilities setting, which\nextends the previous result on bi-valued utilities.

Our main\nresult is an extension of the duality between sober spaces and spatial frames\nto a duality between two categories, each equipped with a self-duality. On the\nspatial side, the self-duality extends de Groot self-duality for stably compact\nspaces, which swaps open sets with complements of compact saturated sets; this\nself-duality is made possible using structures reminiscent of bitopological\nspaces. On the pointfree side, the self-duality is an extension of Lawson\nself-duality for continuous domains and is achieved via a framework analogous\nto that of d-frames.\n  We show how to derive from our main result the well-known duality between\nlocally compact sober spaces and locally compact frames.

In this study, we investigate the Taylor$\\unicode{x2013}$Aris\ndispersion of active particles in laminar oscillatory flows between parallel\nplates. Two complementary approaches are employed: a two-time-variable\nexpansion of the Smoluchowski equation is used to facilitate Aris' method of\nmoments for the preasymptotic dispersion, while the generalised Taylor\ndispersion theory is extended to capture phase-dependent periodic drift and\ndispersivity in the long-time asymptotic limit. Applying both frameworks, we\nfind that spherical non-gyrotactic swimmers can exhibit greater or lesser\ndiffusivity than passive solutes in purely oscillatory flows, depending on the\noscillation frequency. This behaviour arise primarily from the disruption of\ncross-streamline migration governed by Jeffery orbits. When a steady component\nis superimposed, oscillation induces a non-monotonic dual effect on\ndiffusivity. We further examine two well-studied shear-related accumulation\nmechanisms, arising from gyrotaxis and elongation. Although these accumulation\neffects are less pronounced than in steady flows due to flow unsteadiness,\ngyrotactic swimmers respond more effectively to the unsteady shear profile,\nsignificantly altering their drift and dispersivity. This work offers new\ninsights into the dispersion of active particles in oscillatory flows and also\nprovides a foundation for studying periodic active dispersion beyond the\noscillatory flow, such as periodic variations in shape and swimming speed.",

    "abstract": "In this talk, I revisit and present a more comprehensive estimate of the\nlowest order Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution\n$a_\\mu\\vert_{hvp}^{lo}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon anomaly)\nfrom $e^+e^-\\to$ Hadrons obtained recently in Ref.[1]. New CMD-3 data on\n$e^+e^-\\to 2\\pi$ [2] and precise BABAR [3] and recent BELLE2 [4] $e^+e^-\\to\n3\\pi$ data are usedto update the estimate of the $I=0$ isoscalar channel below\nthe $\\phi$-meson mass. Adding the data compiled by PDG22 [5] above 1 GeV and\nthe QCD improved continuum used in Ref. [1], one deduces:\n$a_\\mu\\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(7043\\pm 37)\\times 10^{-11} $.A comparison with previous\ndata driven ($e^+e^-$ and $\\tau$-decays) estimates is done.Including the Higher\nOrder $a_\\mu\\vert_{hvp}^{ho}$ corrections, the phenomenological estimate of the\nHadronic Light by Light scattering up to NLO and the QED and Electroweak (EW)\ncontributions, one obtains: $\\Delta a_\\mu^{pheno}\\equiv\na_\\mu^{exp}-a_{\\mu}^{pheno}= (81\\pm 41)\\times 10^{-11}$ where the recent\nexperimental value $a_\\mu^{exp}$ [6] has been used. This result consolidates\nthe previous one in Ref.[1], after adding the $\\pi^0\\gamma,\\eta\\gamma$\ncontributions, and can be compared with the one from the most precise Lattice\nresult $\\Delta a_\\mu^{lattice}= (90\\pm 56)\\times 10^{-11}$. Then, we deduce the\n(tentative) SM prediction average : $\\Delta a_\\mu^{SM} = (87\\pm 33)\\times\n10^{-11}$. We complete the paper by revising our predictions on the LO HVP\ncontributions in adding the $\\pi^0\\gamma,\\eta\\gamma$ contributions to the ones\nin Ref.[1]. Then, we obtain: $a_\\tau\\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(3516\\pm 25)\\times\n10^{-11} $ and $\\Delta \\alpha^{(5)}_{had}(M_Z^2)=(2770.7\\pm 4.5)\\times 10^{-5}$\nfor 5 flavours.",

    "abstract": "Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through\nbalanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its\neffectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of\nhigh-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment\nconditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These\nchallenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the\ncollaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment\n(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing\ntheir semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a\nConsistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps\nthrough proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained\ndiscriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module\n(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and\ntwo-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused\nFeature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness\nwith severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/ChengchangTian/DATA.",

While canonical economic models assume\natomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive\nsingle-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of\nits environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a\nsearch-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL\nagent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify\na parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and\nRL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a\ncalibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a\nrepresentative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost\nfunction to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm\nconverges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with\nthe competitive equilibrium.

A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which\nis a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not\ntrivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study\nproposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a\ncombination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy\nof the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.\nThe SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the\ninner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear\ncombination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the\nbasis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term\n(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the\noptimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model\nhas good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the\nparsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces\nuser burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting\nmodel compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the\none-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is\ndemonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a\nwell-known complex industrial system.",

    "abstract": "Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that\nenables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple\nlocal systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous\ncommunication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in\nreal-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning\n(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image\nclassification and natural language processing, without accounting for the\nunique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to\ngraph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational\ninconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both\ninter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological\ncharacteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.\nWe evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain\nand Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and\noutstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with\nthe Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.",

Building on this finding, this paper not\nonly thoroughly analyzes the damping reason in this pressure-driven channel\nflow, but also relates this problem with the excessive numerical dissipation in\nthe gravity-driven free-surface flow. The common root cause of the non-physical\nnumerical damping in the two typical flow scenarios, the zero-order gradient\nconsistency residue, is exposed. The adverse influence of the background\npressure on the residue for the two scenarios is revealed and discussed. To\ncomprehensively understand the behavior of the residue and mitigate its\npotential adverse effects, we conduct both theoretical analysis and numerical\nexperiments focusing on the key sensitive factors. For studying the\nresidue-induced non-physical energy dissipation in the gravity-driven\nfree-surface flow, the water depth and input dynamic pressure in the inviscid\nstanding wave case are tested. To investigate the velocity loss in the\npressure-driven channel flow, we examine the effects of the channel length,\nresolution, and outlet pressure. The state-of-the-art reverse kernel gradient\ncorrection technique is introduced for the two typical flows, and proved to be\neffective in reducing the residue effect, but we find its correction capability\nis fundamentally limited.

This study aims to optimize system design using a multi-criteria\napproach that considers techno-economic and environmental (CO2) factors. A\nMixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed, incorporating\ntemperature discretization for problem linearization and capturing key dynamic\ncharacteristics of heat generators. The model improves convergence, reducing a\n19% MIP gap in 26 hours to 10% in 12 hours by dissipating 6% excess solar heat.\nA multi-scenario analysis under two carbon taxation levels and different CO2\nemission cases revealed solar integration up to 11,932 m${}^2$ but increased\ngas reliance (50%) and TES losses (49%). Wood boiler inclusion reduced solar\ndependency, covering 45% of heat, lowered LCOH, but limited renewable\npenetration. Higher carbon taxes boosted solar adoption but faced storage\ninefficiencies, while biomass enhanced cost efficiency and system stability.",

Existing studies primarily highlight that\nLLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric\nknowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of\ninstruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact\nof instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis\nreveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept\nmisinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models\nshows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,\nshifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,\nwe explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such\nas the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the\npresence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for\nsystematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning\nand enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.",

However,\nthis reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject\npoisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process\ntoward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based\nMasked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter\nout adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact\ntokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key\ntokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked\nLanguage Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low\nmasked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious\ndocuments and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that\nGMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant\ndocuments, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across\ndiverse datasets and adversarial settings.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel, fast method to compute thermal interactions in solids,\nuseful for time-dependent problems involving several sources and several time\nand space scales such as the ones encountered in the physics of fields of\nclosed loop borehole heat exchangers. The new method is based on the\nnon-history temporal superposition acceleration algorithm, but presents better\nperformance compared to the originally proposed scheme. The main idea behind it\nis to leverage the propagation properties of the heat wave. Despite the basic\nphysical solutions of heat transfer being non-causal, it is possible to\nestablish an influence region by fixing an acceptable error tolerance. This\nallows to reduce the necessary integration regions in such a way that numerical\nintegration is favored. The better behaviour of the integrand arising from this\napproach allows us to replace the use of Bakhalov-Vasil'eva method in favor of\nthe asymptotic method for the computation of highly oscillatory integrals that\nhas better properties from a computational perspective in the present\napplication. Extensive testing is presented to evaluate the robustness of the\nnew method and to compare its performance against the originally proposed\nnon-history method and the convolution using the FFT algorithm for a range of\nerror tolerances. The results show that the computational cost is highly\nreduced for the precomputation, which includes all the computations done before\nstarting the time-stepping scheme. The reduction is of several orders of\nmagnitude, depending on the specific case. This cost was the bottleneck of the\noriginal non-history implementation, and reducing it in this way makes the\nmethod suitable for simulations involving hundreds of sources and hundreds of\nthousands of time steps that can arise in simulations of borehole fields.",

We present our analysis of 16.3 years of Fermi-LAT measurements,\nwhich - combined with newly-published VERITAS data - constitute the deepest,\nmost extensive currently available gamma-ray dataset on M82. We model the NT\nradio to gamma-ray emission of the CSB as due to relativistic particles (CR).\nKey features of our models are the identification of the >50 GeV emission as\npionic and the use of X-ray and radio emission to calibrate the CRe spectrum.\nThis enables determination of the zero-point and slope of the CRp (and\nsecondary CRe) spectrum, and meaningful estimates of the energy densities of CR\nand magnetic fields. We consider all relevant radiative processes involving CR,\nand use published detailed descriptions of the soft radiation fields in the CSB\nregion - the most important of which is the FIR field, modeled as a graybody.\nOur SED modeling indicates that 1) the >10 GeV emission is mostly pionic, 2)\nthe 0.1 < E/GeV < 10 emission is a combination of pionic and Compton/starlight\n(and subdominant NT bremss), 3) the <0.1 GeV gamma-ray emission is leptonic,\nand 4) the radio spectrum arises from primary and secondary CRe synchrotron at\ncomparable levels: the corresponding CRe populations are described by a PL and\na curved spectrum, respectively. Averaged over the FIR graybody models, the CRp\nspectral index and energy density are 2.3 and 385 eV/cm3 (for n(H) = 200\n1/cm3), the primary-CRe and CRp maximum energies are 30 GeV and 7 TeV, and the\nmagnetic field is B = 120 uG.

    "abstract": "Due to their weak coupling to the strongly interacting matter produced in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions, dileptons serve as a sensitive probe of the\ninitial geometry of the colliding nuclei. In this study, we investigate the\ninfluence of initial nuclear quadrupole deformation, characterized by the\nparameter $\\beta_2$, on dilepton production in $U+U$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=196$ GeV. The analysis is varried out using a modified\nmultiphase transport model in which partonic interactions are described by the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We observe a clear linear dependence of dilepton\nyields on $\\beta_2^2$ in both the low-mass region (LMR, $<1 GeV/c^2$) and\nintermediate-mass region (IMR, $1-3 GeV/c^2$) of the dilepton spectrum for the\nmost central collisions. Also, dilepton production in the IMR region exhibits a\nstronger sensitivity to nuclear deformation than in the LMR, reflecting the\ndominance of earlier partonic processes in this mass range. These results\nsuggest that precise measurements of dilepton yields in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions can provide a viable means to determine the deformation parameter\n$\\beta_2$ of $^{238}$U.",

In this paper, we study two such possible deviations: a\ntime variation of Newton's constant $G$ and the emission of dipolar\ngravitational radiation. We use updated data for some well-known pulsars,\nnamely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the\nKeplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital\ndynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian\nparameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We do\nthis via the TEMPO2 software, the MCMC4Tempo2 plugin, and a unified python\npipeline to analyze the data. We then perform a combined analysis of different\nbinary systems to constrain both the time evolution of Newton's constant and\nthe dipolar emission parameter $\\kappa_D$. For the best of our three pulsars\n(PSR J1713+0747), we obtain $\\dot{G}/G = (0.32 \\pm 0.31) \\times\n10^{-12}~\\text{yr}^{-1}$ at 95\\% confidence, along with a stringent constraint\non the dipolar emission parameter, $\\kappa_D = (-0.04 \\pm 0.14) \\times\n10^{-4}$.

PSR J0007+7303, a very bright\ngamma-ray pulsar, is the first pulsar discovered by the Fermi-LAT telescope. In\nthis paper, we present the 15 years of timing results of this pulsar using the\nFermi-LAT data. We identified nine glitches, five of which are newly\ndiscovered. Among these, two are small glitches, occurring between the three\npreviously reported ones, while the other four are large glitches. The glitches\nexhibit fractional frequency changes ranging from 15 x 10^-9 to 1238 x 10^-9,\nwith intervals of approximately 1-2 years between events. Uniquely, this pulsar\nshows no exponential recovery behavior following any glitch, setting it apart\nfrom most glitching pulsars. Furthermore, no significant changes were observed\nin the gamma-ray pulse profile, flux, or phase-averaged spectra before and\nafter glitches, indicating the stability of the pulsar's emission properties\ndespite internal changes. A parametric analysis of the glitches yielded a\nfractional moment of inertia of the crustal superfluid involved in glitches as\n1.06 percent, which matches extremely well with previous statistical work if\nthe non-dissipative entrainment effect is not considered and strongly supports\nthe internal origin of these glitches. These results highlight the distinct\nglitch behavior of PSR J0007+7303 and offer valuable insights into the\ncrust-superfluid interaction in neutron stars.

However, the high decoding latency of LLMs\nchallenges the real-time ASR requirements. Although speculative decoding has\nbeen explored for better decoding efficiency, they usually ignore the key\ncharacteristics of the ASR task and achieve limited speedup. To further reduce\nthe real-time ASR latency, in this paper, we propose a novel speculative\ndecoding framework specialized for ASR, dubbed SpecASR. SpecASR is developed\nbased on our core observation that ASR decoding is audio-conditioned, which\nresults in high output alignment between small and large ASR models, even given\noutput mismatches in intermediate decoding steps. Therefore, SpecASR features\nan adaptive draft sequence generation process that dynamically modifies the\ndraft sequence length to maximize the token acceptance length. SpecASR further\nproposes a draft sequence recycling strategy that reuses the previously\ngenerated draft sequence to reduce the draft ASR model latency. Moreover, a\ntwo-pass sparse token tree generation algorithm is also proposed to balance the\nlatency of draft and target ASR models. With extensive experimental results, we\ndemonstrate SpecASR achieves 3.04x-3.79x and 1.25x-1.84x speedup over the\nbaseline autoregressive decoding and speculative decoding, respectively,\nwithout any loss in recognition accuracy.",

In this paper, we\nsystematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and\nintroducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based\non sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model\nfamilies, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that\nthese tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,\nas well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora.

We\nfurther evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and\nretrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%.

It\njointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user\nprecoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A\nkey innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL),\nenabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel\nconditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive\nretraining. Furthermore, we employ the Dynamic Weight Averaging (DWA) algorithm\nto dynamically balance the individual task losses during multi-task training,\nensuring efficient and stable learning across diverse objectives. Extensive\nsimulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance\ncompared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization\ncapabilities to unseen system configurations.

This transition is mainly due to the\navailability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data\nburden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and\nenhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,\nsuggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal\nwith complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems\nemploy diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.\nAccurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to\navoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on\nthis part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate\nweakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of\nlarge-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even\nsystems with over 50\\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform\nroughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\\%). 5) Despite recent\nprogress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic\nenvironments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive\nsystem ensembles.",

The proposed solution integrates a UAV\nwith ROS2 framework, that utilizes multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN)\nfor search missions. System identification and PD controller deployment are\nperformed for autonomous UAV navigation. The ROS2 environment utilizes the\nYOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN\nfor face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face\nrecognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV\noperator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and\nimmediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on\nspecific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN\nmodel. These keypoints are used to track a specific individual and maintain a\nsafe distance. To enhance accurate tracking, system identification is\nperformed, based on measurement data from the UAVs IMU. The identified system\nparameters are used to design PD controllers that utilize YOLOv11-pose to\nestimate the distance between the UAVs camera and the identified individual.\nThe initial experiments, conducted on 14 known individuals, demonstrated that\nthe proposed subsystem can be successfully used in real time. The next step\ninvolves implementing the system on a large experimental UAV for field use and\nintegrating autonomous navigation with GPS-guided control for rescue operations\nplanning.",

However, with the rapid development of\nAI-assisted cryptanalysis and quantum computing technologies, there are serious\nchallenges to the secure implementation of ChaCha cipher. To further strengthen\nthe security of ChaCha cipher, we propose an improved variant based on quantum\nrandom numbers, i.e., Quantum Random Number Enhanced ChaCha (QRE-ChaCha).\nSpecifically, the design XORs the initial constants with quantum random numbers\nand periodically injects quantum random numbers into selected state words\nduring odd rounds to enhance diffusion. Compared with the original ChaCha, the\npresent variant shows stronger resistance to differential attacks and generates\na keystream with statistical randomness, thereby offering increased robustness\nagainst both classical and quantum attacks. To evaluate the security and\nperformance of the present ChaCha, our analysis proceeds in three main parts.\nFirstly, we analyze its theoretical security in terms of quantum randomness and\nattack testing, and conduct differential cryptanalysis with an automated search\nmethod based on the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). Secondly, we subject\nthe keystream generated by the cipher to randomness tests using the NIST\nstatistical test suite and the GM/T 0005-2021 randomness testing standard.\nFinally, we assess its encryption and decryption performance by measuring its\nencryption speed on files of various sizes.

    "abstract": "Nuclear reactors are often modeled as inflexible baseload generators with\nfixed downtimes and restrictive ramping constraints. In practice, however, a\nreactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to its fuel cycle and\nassociated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint for power\nmaneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused from the transient buildup of\nneutron-absorbing xenon following a power reduction. This transient can delay\nor prevent subsequent power ramp-up due to suppressed core reactivity.\nAdditionally, if a reactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity,\nrestart times can vary significantly, leading to prolonged downtimes. This work\nintroduces a physics-informed modeling framework that embeds fuel cycle\ndynamics within a unit commitment (UC) formulation. The framework tracks\nreactivity margin, dynamically enforces xenon induced constraints, and\nendogenously schedules refueling outages based on core conditions. By capturing\nintracycle reactivity evolution, the model enables operation dependent nuclear\ndispatch that reflects both techno-economic requirements and irreducible\nnuclear physics limits. Application to a representative reactor fleet shows\nthat flexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles.\nResults further demonstrate that different operational modes substantially\naffect VRE utilization, curtailment, and nuclear fleet capacity factors. These\nfindings highlight the importance of fuel cycle aware flexibility modeling for\naccurate reactor scheduling and integration of nuclear power into energy system\nmodels.",

However, due to the\nunique system model and inherent constraints, the effective application of the\nPS technique is still an open question in IM-DD systems, particularly in\nsystems with memory effects. In this paper, a novel indirect PS scheme tailored\nfor peak power constrained (PPC) IM-DD systems is proposed. The key idea lies\nin strategically controlling the signal envelope to mitigate memory-induced\nimpairments, such as nonlinearity, overshoot, peak-to-average power ratio\nenhancement, etc. The proposed scheme incorporates a dynamic selective mapping\n(DSLM) mechanism at the transmitter, enabling an untypical bit-to-symbol\nmapping in which the current symbol is not only determined by the current bits\npattern but also by previously generated symbols within a specified memory\nlength. At the receiver side, a turbo equalizer with a modified M-BCJR\nalgorithm is proposed to achieve the recovery of ambiguous bits induced by\nDSLM. Experimental verification in a 56GBaud PAM8 system demonstrates that the\nproposed scheme exhibits 1dB receiver sensitivity improvement over 2km\nsingle-mode fiber transmission. In addition, the proposed scheme has also been\ndemonstrated to be compatible with the typical probabilistic amplitude shaping\narchitecture, enabling a simple and fine-granularity rate adaptation\ncapability.

While diffusion-based methods\nhave shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.\nHowever, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to\ncapture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to\nstructural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that\njointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light\nimages, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing\ngeneration quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from\nlow-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce\nan adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.\nBy leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes\nan implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise\ndistribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the\nmodels ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,\nwe design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color\nrestoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content\nconsistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual\nperception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation\nscenarios.

We\nintroduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question\nanswering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant\nquestions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We\nevaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying\nprompt engineering to enhance performance.

Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro\nconsistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of\nthe top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question\ncomplexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform\ngeneral-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Determining cosmological parameters with high precision, as well as resolving\ncurrent tensions in their values derived from low and high redshift probes, is\none of the main objectives of the new generation of cosmological surveys. The\ncombination of complementary probes in terms of parameter degeneracies and\nsystematics is key to achieving these ambitious scientific goals. In this\ncontext, determining the optimal survey configuration for an analysis that\ncombines galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing, the\nso-called 3x2pt analysis, remains an open problem. In this paper, we present an\nefficient and flexible end-to-end pipeline to optimise the sample selection for\n3x2pt analyses in an automated way. Our pipeline is articulated in two main\nsteps: we first consider a self-organising map to determine the photometric\nredshifts of a simulated galaxy sample. As a proof of method for stage-IV\nsurveys, we use samples from the DESC Data Challenge 2 catalogue. This allows\nus to classify galaxies into tomographic bins based on their colour phenotype\nclustering. We then explore different redshift-bin edge configurations for weak\nlensing only as well as 3x2pt analyses in a novel way. Our method explores\nmultiple configurations of perturbed redshift-bin edges with respect to the\nfiducial case in an iterative manner. In particular, we sample tomographic\nconfigurations for the source and lens galaxies separately. We show that, using\nthis method we quickly converge into an optimised configuration for different\nnumbers of redshift bins and cosmologies. Our analysis demonstrates that for\nstage-IV surveys an optimal tomographic sample selection can increase the\nfigure of merit of the dark energy (DE) equation of state by a factor of\n$\\sim$2, comparable to an effective increase in survey area of $\\sim$4 for\nnon-optimal photometric survey analyses.",

Our\nproposed approach leverages the concept of incremental input-to-state stability\n(delta-ISS) of subsystems, characterized by delta-ISS Lyapunov functions. To\nimplement our data-driven scheme, we initially reframe the delta-ISS Lyapunov\nconditions as a robust optimization program (ROP). However, due to the presence\nof unknown subsystem dynamics in the ROP constraints, we develop a scenario\noptimization program (SOP) by gathering data from trajectories of each unknown\nsubsystem. We solve the SOP and construct a delta-ISS Lyapunov function for\neach subsystem with unknown dynamics. We then leverage a small-gain\ncompositional condition to facilitate the construction of an incremental\nLyapunov function for an unknown interconnected network with unknown dynamics\nbased on its data-driven delta-ISS Lyapunov functions of individual subsystems,\nwhile providing correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that our data-driven\ncompositional approach aligns sample complexity with subsystem granularity,\nresulting in a linear increase in required data as the number of subsystems\nrises. In contrast, the existing monolithic approach in the literature exhibits\nexponential growth in sample complexity with increasing number of subsystems,\nrendering it impractical for real-world applications.

    "abstract": "High Q-factor narrow-band absorption exhibits high spectral selectivity\nenabling high-sensitive photodetectors, sensors and thermal emitters.\nAll-dielectric metasurfaces are widely regarded as excellent candidates for\ngiving rise to such narrow-band absorption. However, designing metasurfaces\nwith specific functionalities remains a challenging task both experimentally\nand computationally, which is why inverse design methods are increasingly being\nexplored. Inverse design process is highly complex due to its non-unique\nsolutions and the higher dimensionality of the design space, making it\nchallenging to precisely control the resonance wavelength, linewidth, and\nabsorption intensity. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid methodology that\nintegrates generative adversarial networks (GANs) (both classical and quantum)\nwith physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the inverse design of\nnarrow-band absorbing metasurfaces. By introducing a Fano-shaped absorption\nspectrum equation into the PINN loss function, we enforce physical constraints\non the resonance behavior, ensuring outputs that are both spectrally accurate\nand physically consistent. The study presents a comparison between a\nconventional GAN + PINN framework and a PINN augmented by a hybrid\nquantum-classical GAN (QGAN). The findings indicate that the integrated PINN +\nQGAN model achieves faster convergence, requires 99.5\\% fewer training samples,\nand yields an order of magnitude lower MSE compared to conventional GANs.\nRemarkably, even though the training dataset only contains metasurfaces with\nQ-factors on the order of $10^3$, the model is able to generate highly\nasymmetric metasurface structures with Q-factors exceeding $10^5$. This study\npresents a novel framework that integrates quantum machine learning with\nphysics-based modeling, providing a promising method for quantum-enhanced\ninverse design in nanophotonic systems.",

    "abstract": "Model order reduction simplifies high-dimensional dynamical systems by\nderiving lower-dimensional models that preserve essential system\ncharacteristics. These techniques are crucial to controller design for complex\nsystems while significantly reducing computational costs. Nevertheless,\nconstructing effective reduced-order models (ROMs) poses considerable\nchallenges, particularly for dynamical systems characterized by highly\nnonlinear terms. These challenges are further exacerbated when the actual\nsystem model is unavailable, a scenario frequently encountered in real-world\napplications. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for the\nconstruction of ROMs for both continuous- and discrete-time nonlinear dynamical\nsystems with unknown mathematical models. By leveraging two sets of data\ncollected from the system, referred to as two input-state trajectories, we\nfirst construct a data-based closed-loop representation of the system. We then\nestablish a similarity relation between the output trajectories of the original\nsystem and those of its data-driven ROM employing the notion of simulation\nfunctions (SFs), thereby enabling a formal characterization of their closeness.\nTo achieve this, we propose data-dependent semidefinite programs as sufficient\nconditions to simultaneously construct both ROMs and SFs, while offering\ncorrectness guarantees. We demonstrate that the obtained data-driven ROMs can\nbe employed for synthesizing controllers that ensure the unknown system\nsatisfies high-level logic properties. This is accomplished by first designing\ncontrollers for the data-driven ROMs and then translating the results back to\nthe original system through an interface function. We evaluate the efficacy of\nour data-driven findings through four benchmark case studies involving unknown\ndynamics with highly nonlinear terms.",

To address this issue, a recently proposed\nmethod -- the sliding Lomb-Scargle periodogram (sLSP) -- can effectively\ndistinguish real frequencies from aliased ones. In this study, we compiled a\nsample of 68 $\\delta$ Scuti stars whose frequency analyses were based on the\n$Kepler$ photometry.

Here, we will review linear mixed models that have been proposed\nfor this purpose. The emphasis will be on predictions and on methods to assess\nthe uncertainty of predictions for new environments. Our point of departure is\nstraight-line regression, which may be extended to multiple environmental\ncovariates and genotype-specific responses. When observable environmental\ncovariates are used, this is also known as factorial regression. Early work\nalong these lines can be traced back to Stringfield & Salter (1934) and Yates &\nCochran (1938), who proposed a method nowadays best known as Finlay-Wilkinson\nregression. This method, in turn, has close ties with regression on latent\nenvironmental covariates and factor-analytic variance-covariance structures for\ngenotype-environment interaction. Extensions of these approaches - reduced rank\nregression, kernel- or kinship-based approaches, random coefficient regression,\nand extended Finlay-Wilkinson regression - will be the focus of this paper. Our\nobjective is to demonstrate how seemingly disparate methods are very closely\nlinked and fall within a common model-based prediction framework. The framework\nconsiders environments as random throughout, with genotypes also modelled as\nrandom in most cases.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have\nsignificantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken\ninteractions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle\nfor linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker\ncharacteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,\nand non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel\nspoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,\ndesigned to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM\nadopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling\nfrom acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while\nsupporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model\nefficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that\nprogressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic\ninformation using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on\nTELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM\nachieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,\nand outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal\nvariation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance\nof modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more\nnatural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.",

Industry-scale DLRMs are trained\nwith petabytes of recommendation data to serve billions of users every day. To\nutilize the rich user signals in the long user history, DLRMs have been scaled\nup to unprecedented complexity, up to trillions of floating-point operations\n(TFLOPs) per example. This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training\ndata, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve\nthe quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present\na Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO\nsimultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the\nmodel quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this\nchallenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure\n(i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture\n(i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling\nparadigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data. Compared with\nthe established practice of treating a user impression as a unit, our new\ndesign achieves native feature deduplication in data logging, consequently\nsaving data storage. Second, by de-duplicating computations and communications\nacross multiple impressions in a request, this new paradigm enables highly\nscaled-up neural network architectures to better capture user interest signals,\nsuch as Generative Recommenders (GRs) and other request-only friendly\narchitectures.",

In this work, we\nintroduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data\npipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,\ntask-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured\ndata, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing\nrecommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly\navailable datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.\nFor example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured\ndata (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by\nthe Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring\nprivacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize\nit. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based\napproach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage\nMedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.\nThese features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the\nbest-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent\nand Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on\ndata type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent\" runs\nthe selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs\nusing tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these\nhigh-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the\nneed for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient\npathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.",

Electric vehicles (EVs), owing to their vehicle-to-grid (V2G)\ncapabilities, can provide cost-effective frequency services for transmission\nsystem operators (TSOs). However, EVs that are inherently connected to\ndistribution networks may pose voltage security issues for distribution system\noperators (DSOs) when supporting TSO frequency. To coordinate both TSO\nfrequency and DSO voltage, this paper proposes a two-stage service provision\nframework for multi-EVs. At stage one, EVs participate in day-ahead TSO-DSO\ninteractions for frequency reserve schedules; at stage two, EVs make real-time\ndispatching behaviors in distribution networks for reserve delivery while\nsupporting DSO voltage. Considering the potentially large EV number and\nenvironment complexity, a decentralized operation paradigm is introduced for\nreal-time EV dispatches at stage two, while a communication-efficient\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to reduce the communication\noverhead during large-scale multi-agent RL training without compromising policy\nperformance.

However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)\nDropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to\nalign with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose\nthe Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models\ndistributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using\nfree energy.

By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)\nframework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and\nenables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta\ndistribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally\nefficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation.

Specifically, regional frequency constraints are first extracted\nvia an enhanced input convex neural network (ICNN) and then embedded into the\noriginal optimisation for frequency security, where a principled weight\ninitialisation strategy is adopted to deal with the gradient vanishing issues\nof non-negative weights in traditional ICNNs and enhance its fitting ability.\nAn adaptive genetic algorithm with sparsity calculation and local search is\ndeveloped to separate the planning model into two stages and effectively solve\nit iteratively.

    "abstract": "In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data\nscarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes\ncrucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it\nis often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\\it additional\nsupervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting\nnaturally raises fundamental questions: {\\it What kinds of additional\nsupervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\\it how do they contribute to\nimproved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a\ntheoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision\nas probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine\ncombination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of\nadditional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,\nbut rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled\nclasses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the\nmixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary\nroles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision\ndetermines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing\nthe hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the\nmixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through\ngeneralization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional\nsupervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and\nasymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate\nthat, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to\nimproved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.",

However, there is still a lack of theoretical characterization on\nmultipath errors in the context of DPE theory. Geometric observations highlight\nthe unique characteristics of DPE errors stemming from multipath and thermal\nnoise as estimation bias and variance respectively. Expanding upon the\ntheoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this\npaper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying\nthe deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative\nto the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)\nmodel is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite\nchannels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established\nthrough discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness\nof the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo\nsimulations and urban canyon tests. The findings indicate that the maximum PVT\nbias depends on the largest multipath errors observed across various satellite\nchannels. Additionally, the PVT bias increases with satellite elevation angles,\ninfluenced by the CAF multipath bias projection.

Electron energy-loss spectroscopy can capture\nthis indirect interaction, the final electron energy distribution encodes both\nquantum pathways arising from distinct combinations of multiphoton absorption\nand emission and BP scattering events. Interference among these pathways gives\nrise to characteristic spectral modulations, directly revealing the exchange of\nenergy and information between photons and BPs via the electron delivery. Our\nresults show that femtosecond-driven, ultrafast electrons provide a viable\nroute to modulate and even control bulk plasmon excitations in a volume,\nthereby extending beyond the conventional nanoplasmonics schemes on\nmanipulating surface plasmons by light.

In this work, the electronic transport properties of a\nmultilayer Kane-Mele model with screw dislocations is studied theoretically.\nNumerical simulations of a screw dislocation reveal that dissipationless\nquantum spin Hall edge states propagate not only at the outer boundaries of the\nstructure but also along the screw dislocation itself, working as layer-spin\nfilter.

Moreover, we found that the transmission\ncoefficient and spin polarization remain robust against Anderson disorder.\nUnder magnetic disorder, spin flip and backscattering occur, suppressing the\ntransmission coefficient while maintaining nearly unchanged spin polarization.\nFinally, the layer- and spin-resolved transport properties in a device with two\nscrew dislocations are investigated as well.

While theoretical work has established the\nevolvability of specific function classes under idealized conditions, the\nframework remains largely untested empirically. In this paper, we implement a\ngenetic algorithm that faithfully simulates Valiant's model and conduct\nextensive experiments across six Boolean function classes: monotone\nconjunctions, monotone disjunctions, parity, majority, general conjunctions,\nand general disjunctions. Our study examines evolvability under uniform and\nnon-uniform distributions, investigates the effects of fixed initial hypotheses\nand the removal of neutral mutations, and highlights how these constraints\nalter convergence behavior.

Numerical simulations show that\nthese phenomena strongly depend on physical and numerical parameters. In this\nwork, we study the combined influence of the softening parameter, $\\epsilon$\nand disc mass fraction, $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ on the formation and evolution of bars\nin isolated disc-halo models via $N$-body simulations with different particle\nresolutions. Previous studies indicate that the bar strength depends on\n$m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ as $\\propto m_{\\mathrm{d}}^{-1}$, which is seen as a delay in\nbar formation. However, the distorsion parameter, $\\eta$, which measures the\nbar's momentum through time, shows that an increase in $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ does\nnot always induce a delay in bar formation. This suggests that $\\epsilon$\ninteract to either enhance or weaken the bar. Moreover, numerical heating\ndominates in models with small softening values, creating highly accelerated\nparticles at the centre of discs, regardless of $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ or resolution.\nThese enhanced particle accelerations produce chaotic orbits for $\\epsilon \\leq\n5\\,$pc, resulting in bar suppression due to collisional dynamics in the centre.\nIn our high resolution models ($N \\approx 10^{7}$), small softening values are\nincapable of reproducing the bar instability. The role of disc mass is as\nfollows: increasing $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ for moderate $\\epsilon$ ($\\geq 10\\,$pc)\nreduces the amount of drift in the acceleration profile, without affecting the\nbar's behaviour. Models with lower $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ values coupled with small\nsoftening values, have an excess of highly accelerated particles, introducing\nunwanted effects into otherwise reliable simulations. Finally, we show that the\nevolution of the disc's vertical acceleration profile is a reliable indicator\nof numerical heating introduced by $\\epsilon$ and the bar.",

    "abstract": "Modern key-value stores rely heavily on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees for\nwrite optimization, but this design introduces significant read amplification.\nAuxiliary structures like Bloom filters help, but impose memory costs that\nscale with tree depth and dataset size. Recent advances in learned data\nstructures suggest that machine learning models can augment or replace these\ncomponents, trading handcrafted heuristics for data-adaptive behavior. In this\nwork, we explore two approaches for integrating learned predictions into the\nLSM-tree lookup path. The first uses a classifier to selectively bypass Bloom\nfilter probes for irrelevant levels, aiming to reduce average-case query\nlatency. The second replaces traditional Bloom filters with compact learned\nmodels and small backup filters, targeting memory footprint reduction without\ncompromising correctness. We implement both methods atop a Monkey-style\nLSM-tree with leveled compaction, per-level Bloom filters, and realistic\nworkloads. Our experiments show that the classifier reduces GET latency by up\nto 2.28x by skipping over 30% of Bloom filter checks with high precision,\nthough it incurs a modest false-negative rate. The learned Bloom filter design\nachieves zero false negatives and retains baseline latency while cutting memory\nusage per level by 70-80%. Together, these designs illustrate complementary\ntrade-offs between latency, memory, and correctness, and highlight the\npotential of learned index components in write-optimized storage systems.",

Ultra low-bit quantization can\nsignificantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression\n(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To\naddress this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively \"squeezing\" 16-bit LLMs'\nweights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision\npost-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits\nper weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We\nintroduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation\nRobustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a\nrefined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization\non activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that\npreserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate\ncumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2\nshow that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit\nweight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six\nzero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.\nOur code will be released upon publication.",

In oceanography,\nhigh-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental\nmonitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as\nCopernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and\nglobal ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed\nlocal analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning\nframework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary\nresolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to\nCopernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate\nPDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input\nresolution.

We introduce a QKD protocol that\nsurpasses the optimal Gaussian modulated CV-QKD (GG02) protocol by utilising\nprobabilistic filters without known physical representation. Our approach\nemploys a Gaussian filter at Alice's station and a non-Gaussian notch-like\nfilter at Bob's station. Alice's filter optimises modulation variance to\nachieve key rates near the optimal GG02 performance, while Bob's filter adapts\nthe effective channel conditions, which can result in higher key rates than the\noptimal GG02 protocol. Our security analysis avoids Gaussian extremality,\naccurately bounding Eve's information. The protocol dynamically optimises the\nsecret-key rate for rapidly changing channels, such as terrestrial links and\nsatellite-to-ground communications, and can extract keys in regions deemed\nnon-secure by parameter estimation. Implemented at software level, our protocol\nrequires no hardware modifications and can be integrated into existing QKD\nsystems.

However, the convergence rate of the volume enclosed by the\ninterface to its sharp-interface limit is usually at first order of the\ninterface thickness in the classical Cahn-Hilliard model with constant or\ndegenerate mobilities. In this work, we propose a variational framework for\ndeveloping new Cahn-Hilliard dynamics with enhanced volume conservation by\nintroducing a more general conserved quantity.

The ACH-IC model\nemploys a new conserved quantity that approximates a step function more\neffectively, and yields second-order volume conservation while preserving\nenergy dissipation for the classical anisotropic surface energy. The\nsecond-order volume conservation as well as the convergence to the\nsharp-interface surface diffusion dynamics is derived through comprehensive\nasymptotic analysis.

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During\ninference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by\ntoken-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve\nrepresentational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.",

Using a novel kinetic theory\nframework, we find that transport and thermodynamic coefficients -- including\nthe speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2}$, specific shear viscosity $\\eta/s$,\nspecific bulk viscosity $\\zeta/s$, and mean free path $\\lambda$ -- are\nsubstantially modified by spin polarization effects. Among the two sources,\nthermal vorticity-induced spin polarization dominates the modifications to\nthese coefficients. Moreover, both $c_{s}^{2}$ and $\\zeta/s$ exhibit a\nnonmonotonic dependence on the collision energy, and the associated scaling\nbehaviors potentially serve as indicators of the critical phenomena of QCD.",

Despite recent advances, these existing\nmethods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or\nalter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about\nwatermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of\nfine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a\nresult, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,\nwhich limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)\nsystems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a\nService (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in\nwhich we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark\ncan still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose\nShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical\ndeployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in\nthe protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark\ndecoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining\nthe so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN\narchitectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating\nthe fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,\nnoise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate\nthe efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of\nnonintrusive DNN watermarking.",

In\nthis work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language\ninstructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to\ncomplete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set\nobjects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit\nstrong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language\ninstructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension.

To\nfurther validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous\nvehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language\nnavigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability\nto execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation\ninstructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and\nlinguistic ambiguities.

This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that\nintegrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations\nwithin a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of\nViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as\nit provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack\nspecificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically\ndivides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates\nthem for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.\nThrough the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency\ndomains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to\ndetect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText\nsignificantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost\nwhen it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise\nfrom 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's\nsuperior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable\ndiffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in\nrecall compared to other deepfake detection approaches.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the communication bottleneck within a typical DMTL system that\nemploys non-linear global updates. This system involves distributed workers,\nassisted by a central server, who collaboratively learn distinct models derived\nfrom a non-linear aggregation of their local model parameters. We first\ncharacterize the communication process as a matrix decomposition problem. It\ntransforms workers' data storage constraints into structural characteristics of\nthe uplink encoding matrix, and worker data retrieval demands into Maximum\nDistance Separable (MDS) properties of the downlink encoding matrix. Building\non this, we propose a novel coded DTML scheme that can greatly reduce the\ncommunication cost of the DTML with heterogeneous data placement. Theoretical\nanalysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme achieves the theoretical lower\nbound for communication overhead under mild conditions. Remarkably, this\noptimality holds for both traditional homogeneous computing environments and\nvarious heterogeneous scenarios. Furthermore, our scheme is extensible to a\ndistributed linearly separable computation problem where the target function\ninvolves multiple linear combinations of local update values. This indicates\nthat our scheme offers a new way of tackling heterogeneous data placement\nchallenges in various distributed applications.",

To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose\nFashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection\nof alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.\nConsequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected\njudgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about\nalternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and\nlevel of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the\noriginal datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of\nalternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation\nof existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation\nunderestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to\ninstead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to\nmore quickly satisfy the user.",

However, the integration of ultra-thin gate dielectrics\nremains a challenge, as conventional oxides such as SiO2, Al2O3, and HfO2 tend\nto unintentionally dope 2D TMDs and introduce interfacial defect states,\nleading to undesirable field-effect transistor (FET) performance and unstable\nthreshold voltages. Here, we demonstrate that zirconium oxide (ZrO2), a high-k\ndielectric compatible with semiconductor processing, forms an ultra-clean\ninterface with monolayer MoS2. Using soft and hard X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy and density functional theory, we find that ZrO2 does not\nmeasurably interact with MoS2, in contrast to significant doping observed for\nSiO2 and HfO2 substrates. As a result, back-gated monolayer MoS2 FETs\nfabricated with ZrO2 dielectrics exhibit stable and positive threshold voltages\n(0.36 plus/minus 0.3 V), low subthreshold swing (75 mV per decade), and high ON\ncurrents exceeding 400 microamperes. We further demonstrate p-type WSe2 FETs\nwith ON currents greater than 200 microamperes per micrometer by suppressing\nelectron doping with ZrO2 dielectrics. Atomic-resolution imaging confirms a\ndefect-free ZrO2/MoS2 interface, which enables top-gate FETs with an equivalent\noxide thickness of 0.86 nanometers and subthreshold swing of 80 mV per decade.\nMoreover, the ultraclean ZrO2/MoS2 interface allows for effective threshold\nvoltage modulation in top-gate FETs via gate metal work function engineering.\nThese findings establish ZrO2 as a highly promising, industry-compatible high-k\ndielectric for scalable 2D TMD-based electronics.",

Current LLM serving systems face a fundamental tension: balancing\nserving demands with limited resources while adapting to unpredictable traffic\npatterns. Static deployments lead to suboptimal resource utilization and\nperformance degradation under dynamic workloads. Furthermore, the high cost of\nadjusting instances hinders dynamic scaling, limiting the true potential of\nefficient LLM serving.\n  To address this, we propose CoCoServe, an elastic system that facilitates\ndynamic and fine-grained scaling.

Through a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs\nassociated with these operations, we develop an auto-scaling mechanism that\ndynamically regulates module-level resource allocation and performance\noptimization, enabling a more cost-effective deployment of LLMs. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that the scaling operations employed by CoCoServe exhibit\nexcellent scalability and can reduce costs by 46% while maintaining\navailability.

Designing interference-aware strategies for\nlarge-scale, co-located microservice clusters is crucial for enhancing resource\nutilization and mitigating competition-induced interference. These challenges\nare further exacerbated by unreliable metrics, application diversity, and node\nheterogeneity.\n  In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of large-scale and\nco-located microservices clusters at Alibaba and further discuss why cycle per\ninstruction (CPI) is adopted as a metric for interference measurement in\nlarge-scale production clusters, as well as how to achieve accurate prediction\nof CPI through multi-dimensional metrics.

The Lyot-plane mask splits the incoming beam --\ncomprising leakage from the 1DDLC and planetary light -- into four beams so\nthat, in principle, the on-axis single-mode fiber does not couple with the\non-axis leak from the 1DDLC.

However,\nthe extraction of secret keys from non-Gaussian entangled states is a complex\nissue and is at present not fully understood. In this paper we describe a\ntechnique for adding photons to entangled states, and demonstrate how it leads\nto an increase in secret key rates and the maximal distance for which keys can\nbe distributed assuming asymptotic conditions. The quantum correlations thus\nproduced were found to be of a highly non-Gaussian character, such that the\nGaussian extremity principle returns a negative keyrate and effectively kills\nthe protocol; we have therefore developed methods of analysis that do not\nrequire prior assumptions about the state. Although it could have been that the\naddition of single photons would make the system more fragile, this turned out\nnot to be the case. Rather, the addition of a single photon was found to\nprotect the protocol against both passive and active decoherence.",

Our improvement results from using the\ndual, instead of the primal, to analyze the expected cost of the matching. We\nbelieve this method of analysis could lead to a simpler proof that max entropy\nis a better-than-3/2 approximation in the general case.\n  We also give a 1.4671 approximation for half integral LP solutions with no\nproper minimum cuts and an even number of vertices, improving upon the bound of\nHaddadan and Newman of 1.476.

    "abstract": "Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines\nand planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among\nfeatures. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the\nproximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body\ntransformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has\nremained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.\nThis paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function\nbetween two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation\n($\\mathbf{R}$ and $\\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous\nmathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear\nsubspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we\npropose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be\napplied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector\nparameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal\nsolution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to\nrepresentation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the\ninlier-set maximizing Branch-and-Bound (BnB) solver have been demonstrated to\nimprove the convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various\ncomputer vision tasks.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing technology has posed\npotential security threats to RSA cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography.\nIn response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\npublished several Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of\npost-quantum cryptography (PQC) in August 2024, including the\nModule-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module-Lattice-Based\nDigital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), and Stateless Hash-Based Digital\nSignature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). Although these PQC algorithms are designed to\nresist quantum computing attacks, they may not provide adequate security in\ncertain specialized application scenarios. To address this issue, this study\nproposes quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based PQC algorithms. These\nalgorithms leverage quantum computing to generate random numbers, which serve\nas the foundation for key pair generation, key encapsulation, and digital\nsignature generation. A generalized architecture of QRNG is proposed, along\nwith the design of six QRNGs. Each generator is evaluated according to the\nstatistical validation procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-90B, including tests\nfor verification of entropy sources and independent and identically distributed\n(IID) outputs. Experimental results assess the computation time of the six\nQRNGs, as well as the performance of QRNG-based ML-KEM, QRNG-based ML-DSA, and\nQRNG-based SLH-DSA. These findings provide valuable reference data for future\ndeployment of PQC systems.",

    "abstract": "In this work we study the identification of spatial correlation in\ndistributions of 2D scalar fields, presented across different forms of visual\ndisplays. We study simple visual displays that directly show color-mapped\nscalar fields, namely those drawn from a distribution, and whether humans can\nidentify strongly correlated spatial regions in these displays. In this\nsetting, the recognition of correlation requires making judgments on a set of\nfields, rather than just one field. Thus, in our experimental design we compare\ntwo basic visualization designs: animation-based displays against juxtaposed\nviews of scalar fields, along different choices of color scales. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the impacts of the distribution itself, controlling for the level\nof spatial correlation and discriminability in spatial scales. Our study's\nresults illustrate the impacts of these distribution characteristics, while\nalso highlighting how different visual displays impact the types of judgments\nmade in assessing spatial correlation.

In this work, we investigated how size and\nseparability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features\nand performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning\nmodels for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging\nDataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on\nimaging manufacturer) or non-separable \"pseudo-subgroups\". We found that\nsimulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature\nrepresentations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature\nspace were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the\nsubgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in\nsubgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels\nwas used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,\nwith label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive\nrate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean\nlabels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work\nrepresents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label\nbias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.",
