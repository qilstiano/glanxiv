    "abstract": "Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are emerging as a key enabler\nof next-generation communications, offering global coverage and significantly\nlower latency compared to traditional terrestrial networks and geostationary\nsatellites. However, further latency reduction is essential for time-critical\napplications such as real-time sensing, autonomous systems, and interactive\nservices. One critical bottleneck is the optical-to-electrical (O/E) and\nelectrical-to-optical (E/O) conversions at intermediate nodes in multi-hop\nlinks, which introduce unwanted processing delays. To address this, we\ninvestigate an all-optical relay system based on Optical Hard Limiters (OHL),\nwhich operate purely in the optical domain to suppress noise and restore signal\nquality without requiring O/E conversions. First, we present a rigorous\nanalysis of inter-satellite multi-relay communication under the OHL relaying\narchitecture, comparing it against conventional Amplify-and-Forward (AF) and\nDecode-and-Forward (DF) schemes. Through this comparison, we highlight both the\nadvantages and limitations of OHL relays, including their particular\nsensitivity to parameter choices such as the threshold setting and divergence\nangle at the transmitter. Recognizing that a LEO constellation is inherently\ntime-varying - satellites move relative to one another, causing continuous\nchanges in link distances and tracking errors - we propose a joint optimization\nstrategy. This scheme adaptively tunes the OHL decision threshold and beam\ndivergence in real time to maintain optimal performance, ultimately lowering\nerror rates and latency. Extensive simulations in a large-scale LEO network\ndemonstrate the viability of our method and offer insights into practical\nimplementation for next-generation inter-satellite communication systems.",

However, only one has been confirmed by the analysis of a\nmicrolensing event, and no confirmed emission detection from an IBH has been\nreported so far.\n  Aims: We analysed the detectability of electromagnetic signatures from IBHs\nmoving in the Galaxy. Methods: We considered accretion from the interstellar\nmedium onto an IBH and assumed the formation of an outflow. We modelled the\naccretion process and the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding\nmedium on large scales, including mechanical feedback on the accretion process.\nFurthermore, we also calculated the emission from three different regions: the\naccretion region, the radiation from the outflow medium interaction structure,\nand the emission of relativistic particles that diffuse in the surrounding\nmedium.\n  Results: Multiwavelength emission associated with Galactic IBHs can be\ndetected in systems moving through a very dense medium. Thermal emission from\naccretion could be observed in the mid infrared and in hard X rays with current\nand forthcoming observatories. Thermal and non thermal emission from the\noutflow medium shock could also be detected in the radio and millimetre ranges.\nMoreover, detection of the emission from particles diffusing in a dense medium\ncould be feasible in gamma rays. Applying our model to the IBH associated with\nthe gravitational microlensing event MOA2011BLG191 OGLE2011BLG0462, we inferred\nthat radio and infrared detection of the IBH is plausible. Also, we derived\nthat IBHs could be modest Galactic cosmic ray contributors, potentially\nreaching a 1% contribution at 1 PeV.

Conventional object\ndetection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's\nability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nobjects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to\ndetect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous\nsituations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection\napproach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification\nto object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their\nspecific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'\nbased on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object\nposition relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can\neffectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer\nreal-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model\neffectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies\nthem accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in\ndynamic environments.",

However, the design\nof spinodoids is often hindered by the curse of dimensionality with extremely\nlarge design space of spinodoid types, material density, orientation,\ncontinuity, and anisotropy. From a design optimization perspective, while\ngenetic algorithms are often beyond the reach of computing capacity,\ngradient-based topology optimization is challenged by the intricate\nmathematical derivation of gradient fields with respect to various spinodoid\nparameters. To address such challenges, we propose a data-driven multiscale\ntopology optimization framework. Our framework reformulates the design\nvariables of spinodoid materials as the parameters of neural networks, enabling\nautomated computation of topological gradients. Additionally, it incorporates a\nGaussian Process surrogate for spinodoid constitutive models, eliminating the\nneed for repeated computational homogenization and enhancing the scalability of\nmultiscale topology optimization. Compared to 'black-box' deep learning\napproaches, the proposed framework provides clear physical insights into\nmaterial distribution. It explicitly reveals why anisotropic spinodoids with\ntailored orientations are favored in certain regions, while isotropic\nspinodoids are more suitable elsewhere. This interpretability helps to bridge\nthe gap between data-driven design with mechanistic understanding.",

    "abstract": "Despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate high-quality,\nrealistic, and diverse images, they face challenges in compositional\ngeneration, often struggling to accurately represent details specified in the\ninput prompt. A prevalent issue in compositional generation is the misalignment\nof spatial relationships, as models often fail to faithfully generate images\nthat reflect the spatial configurations specified between objects in the input\nprompts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel probabilistic framework\nfor modeling the relative spatial positioning of objects in a scene, leveraging\nthe concept of Probability of Superiority (PoS). Building on this insight, we\nmake two key contributions. First, we introduce a novel evaluation metric,\nPoS-based Evaluation (PSE), designed to assess the alignment of 2D and 3D\nspatial relationships between text and image, with improved adherence to human\njudgment. Second, we propose PoS-based Generation (PSG), an inference-time\nmethod that improves the alignment of 2D and 3D spatial relationships in T2I\nmodels without requiring fine-tuning. PSG employs a Part-of-Speech PoS-based\nreward function that can be utilized in two distinct ways: (1) as a\ngradient-based guidance mechanism applied to the cross-attention maps during\nthe denoising steps, or (2) as a search-based strategy that evaluates a set of\ninitial noise vectors to select the best one. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the PSE metric exhibits stronger alignment with human judgment compared to\ntraditional center-based metrics, providing a more nuanced and reliable measure\nof complex spatial relationship accuracy in text-image alignment. Furthermore,\nPSG significantly enhances the ability of text-to-image models to generate\nimages with specified spatial configurations, outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods across multiple evaluation metrics and benchmarks.",

We validate our method by applying it to mock\ndatasets that mimic the observations of the Milky Way halo from LAMOST + Gaia\nwith stars' 3D position and 3D velocity observed.

The\ndominant source of scattering for most FRBs is expected to be within their host\ngalaxies, an assumption which can be tested by examining potential correlations\nbetween properties of the FRBs and global properties of their hosts. Using\nresults from the CRAFT survey, we investigate correlations across a range of\nhost galaxy properties against attributes of the FRB that encode propagation\neffects: scattering timescale tau, polarisation fractions, and absolute Faraday\nrotation measure. From 21 host galaxy properties considered, we find three\ncorrelated with tau, including the stellar surface density (or compactness;\nPearson p-value p = 0.002 and Spearman p = 0.010), mass-weighted age (Spearman\np-value p = 0.009), and a weaker correlation with gas-phase metallicity\n(Spearman p = 0.017). Weakly significant correlations are also found with\nHalpha equivalent widths and gravitational potential. From 10,000 trials of\nreshuffled datasets, we expect 2 strong Spearman correlations only 2% of the\ntime, and three weaker correlations in 6.6% of cases. Compact host galaxies may\nhave more ionised content which scatters the FRB further. No correlation is\nseen with host galaxy inclination, which weakens the case for an inclination\nbias, as previously suggested for samples of localised FRBs. A strong (p =\n0.002) correlation is found for absolute rotation measure with optical disc\naxis ratio b/a; greater rotation measures are seen for edge-on host galaxies.\nFurther high-time resolution FRB detections, coupled with localisation and\ndetailed follow-up on their host galaxies, are necessary to corroborate these\ninitial findings and shed further light into the FRB mechanism.",

We present\nNaviX, a native vector index for graph DBMSs (GDBMSs) that has two main design\ngoals. First, we aim to implement a disk-based vector index that leverages the\ncore storage and query-processing capabilities of the underlying GDBMS. To this\nend, NaviX is built on the Hierarchical Navigable Small-World (HNSW) graph,\nwhich itself is a graph-based structure. Second, we aim to support\npredicate-agnostic filtered vector search queries, in which the k nearest\nneighbors (kNNs) of a query vector vQ are searched only within an arbitrary\nsubset S of vectors defined by an ad-hoc selection sub-query QS. We adopt a\nprefiltering approach that evaluates QS first and passes the full description\nof subset S to the kNN search operator. We study how to design a prefiltering\nsearch algorithm that remains robust under varying selectivities and under\ndifferent correlations between subset S and query vector vQ. We propose an\nadaptive algorithm that uses the local selectivity of each vector in the HNSW\ngraph to choose an appropriate heuristic at every iteration of the kNN search.\nFinally, We demonstrate NaviX's robustness and efficiency through extensive\nexperiments against both existing prefiltering- and postfiltering-based\nbaselines.",

The resulting formulation is then employed to\nconduct parametric analyses of the effects of initial droplet radius and\nvelocity variations on ethanol/air non-premixed gas flamelets perturbed by\nsprays generated with different droplet injection strategies. Special emphasis\nis given to the differences between continuous and discontinuous droplet\ninjection. The results illustrate how the latter can considerably increase the\ntemperature and stability of flamelet structures, provided the spray parameters\nare appropriately selected.",

We\npropose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient\nneutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In\nthis scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the\nfinal inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of\ntrue-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black\nholes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense,\nshort-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting\nneutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly\nluminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining\nconsistent with IceCube's non-detections.

While post-transcriptional\nsplicing is well studied, co-transcriptional splicing is gaining attention for\nits efficiency, though its unpredictability still remains a challenge. In this\npaper, we focus on engineering co-transcriptional splicing, not only as a\nnatural phenomenon but as a programmable mechanism for generating specific RNA\ntarget sequences from DNA templates. The problem we address is whether we can\nencode a set of RNA sequences for a given system onto a DNA template word,\nensuring that all the sequences are generated through co-transcriptional\nsplicing. Given that finding the optimal encoding has been shown to be\nNP-complete under the various energy models considered, we propose a practical\nalternative approach under the logarithmic energy model. More specifically, we\nprovide a construction that encodes an arbitrary nondeterministic finite\nautomaton (NFA) into a circular DNA template from which co-transcriptional\nsplicing produces all sequences accepted by the NFA. As all finite languages\ncan be efficiently encoded as NFA, this framework solves the problem of finding\nsmall DNA templates for arbitrary target sets of RNA sequences. The quest to\nobtain the smallest possible such templates naturally leads us to consider the\nproblem of minimizing NFA and certain practically motivated variants of it, but\nas we show, those minimization problems are computationally intractable.",

To address this important issue, we introduce a new class of\ntime-structured models or TSMs that accurately depict growth under variable\nenvironments by splitting seemingly homogeneous populations into distinct\ndemographic cohorts based on their past exposure to environmental fluctuations.\nBy accounting for this cryptic population structure, TSMs accurately simulate\nthe historical effects of environmental variability, even when individuals\nexhibit different degrees of phenotypic plasticity.\n  3. Here, we provide a conceptual framework, the mathematical tools needed to\nsimulate any TSM, and a closed form solution for simple exponential growth.

Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden\nmediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical\nutility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)\nfor causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by\nunmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through\nmean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel\nindependence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for\neach variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the\nindependence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic\nconsistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under\nhidden mediation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate\nconsistent performance, outperforming existing methods in mediator-corrupted\nsettings while maintaining strong performance in mediator-free settings.",

To\noperationalize similarity to previous research, we introduce two complementary\nmetrics to characterize the local geometry of a publication's semantic\nneighborhood: (1) \\emph{density} ($\\rho$), defined as the ratio between a fixed\nnumber of previously-published papers and the minimum distance enclosing those\npapers in a semantic embedding space, and (2) asymmetry ($\\alpha$), defined as\nthe average directional difference between a paper and its nearest neighbors.\nWe tested the predictive relationship between these two metrics and its\nsubsequent citation rate using a Bayesian hierarchical regression approach,\nsurveying $\\sim 53,000$ publications across nine academic disciplines and five\ndifferent document embeddings.

The\nenergy-absorbing capabilities of these architected materials can be enhanced\nfurther by incorporating viscoelastic material behavior into the buckling\nelements using liquid crystal elastomers (LCE). In addition to conventional\nviscoelastic behavior, LCEs also exhibit a highly dissipative rate-dependent\nsoft stress response from mesogen rotation under a mechanical load. However,\nthe buckling elements cannot take advantage of this dissipation mechanism\nbecause buckling occurs at strains below the threshold for mesogen rotation.

Viscoelastic properties of LCEs\nwith two crosslinking densities were characterized experimentally, and a\nnonlinear viscoelastic model was implemented in Abaqus/Standard as a\nuser-defined element to simulate finite-strain behavior of monodomain LCEs,\nincluding soft stress response.

For the analysis, a Galerkin Boundary\nElement Method (GBEM) scheme is developed to generate the mechanical field\ndata, employing solely domain boundary information. The VPINN methodology is\ncomplemented by an adaptive, tree-based integration scheme for the evaluation\nof the weak-form integrals. Different double-phase material architectures are\nconsidered, with the VPINNs demonstrating their ability to capture the\ndeformation fields with considerable accuracy. Moreover, the performance\nenhancement by the incorporation of additional semi-analytical information at\nauxiliary internal points is analyzed. Tree-based integration schemes are shown\nto be capable of robustly capturing inner material discontinuities upon\nsubstantial computational cost reductions. The results suggest that the\nproposed VPINN formulation offers comparative advantages in the modeling of\nmultiphase architected materials compared to classical PINN formulations.

Our framework employs large language\nmodels (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate\nGCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess\nperformance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive\nbenchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging\ntasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement.\nExperiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D\nlanguage fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks.

To tackle this issue, we propose using\nSoftmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook\nselection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby\npreserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation,\nwe introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as\nimage-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale\nsource image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based\nconditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the\ntarget image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling\niterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation\nsynthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental\nfindings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior\ntranslation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step\nmode in unsupervised scenarios.

    "abstract": "Operator scrambling, which governs the spread of quantum information in\nmany-body systems, is a central concept in both condensed matter and\nhigh-energy physics. Accurately capturing the emergent properties of these\nsystems remains a formidable challenge for classical computation, while quantum\nsimulators have emerged as a powerful tool to address this complexity. In this\nwork, we reveal a fundamental connection between operator scrambling and the\nreliability of quantum simulations. We show that the Trotter error in\nsimulating operator dynamics is bounded by the degree of operator scrambling,\nproviding the most refined analysis of Trotter errors in operator dynamics so\nfar. Furthermore, we investigate the entanglement properties of the evolved\nstates, revealing that sufficient entanglement can lead to error scaling\ngoverned by the normalized Frobenius norms of both the observables of interest\nand the error operator, thereby enhancing simulation robustness and efficiency\ncompared to previous works. We also show that even in regimes where the\nsystem's entanglement remains low, operator-induced entanglement can still\nemerge and suppress simulation errors. Our results unveil a comprehensive\nrelationship between Trotterization, operator scrambling, and entanglement,\noffering new perspectives for optimizing quantum simulations.",

    "abstract": "The appearance of singularities in the function of interest constitutes a\nfundamental challenge in scientific computing. It can significantly undermine\nthe effectiveness of numerical schemes for function approximation, numerical\nintegration, and the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), etc.\nThe problem becomes more sophisticated if the location of the singularity is\nunknown, which is often encountered in solving PDEs. Detecting the singularity\nis therefore critical for developing efficient adaptive methods to reduce\ncomputational costs in various applications. In this paper, we consider\nsingularity detection in a purely data-driven setting. Namely, the input only\ncontains given data, such as the vertex set from a mesh. To overcome the\nlimitation of the raw unlabeled data, we propose a self-supervised learning\n(SSL) framework for estimating the location of the singularity. A key component\nis a filtering procedure as the pretext task in SSL, where two filtering\nmethods are presented, based on $k$ nearest neighbors and kernel density\nestimation, respectively. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the\npotential pathological or inaccurate results due to the use of raw data without\nfiltering. Various experiments are presented to demonstrate the ability of the\nproposed approach to deal with input perturbation, label corruption, and\ndifferent kinds of singularities such interior circle, boundary layer,\nconcentric semicircles, etc.",

For instance, in the\ncase of a protoplanetary disc with two planets, there are three indirect terms:\none arising from the whole disc, and one per planet. We also highlight that the\ndirect and indirect gravitational accelerations should be treated in a balanced\nway: the indirect term from one body should be applied to the other bodies in\nthe system that feel its direct gravitational acceleration, and only to them.\nWe point to situations where one of those terms is usually neglected however,\nwhich may lead to spurious results.

Under a network version of conditional\nignorability, the proposed approach identifies the expected potential outcome\nfor a unit given the treatment assignment vector for its network neighborhood\nup to a user-specified distance, while marginalizing over treatment assignments\nfor the rest of the network.

Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain\nDamage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the\nrecent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local\nHessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite\ntheir success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal\non closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear.\nWe present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of\nsecond-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves\nunder a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer\nmultilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz.\nPruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\\delta W_k$,\nproducing the perturbed parameter vector $\\widehat{\\Theta}=\\Theta+\\delta\\Theta$\nand the pruned policy $\\pi(\\cdot;\\widehat{\\Theta})$.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from\narbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets.\nAlthough contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they\noften lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation\nbias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial\nfeatures via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local\ndetails. However, they often face challenges in balancing the computation costs\nand the quality of the segmentation mask. In this work, we present FA-Seg, a\nFast and Accurate training-free framework for open-vocabulary segmentation\nbased on diffusion models. FA-Seg performs segmentation using only a (1+1)-step\nfrom a pretrained diffusion model. Moreover, instead of running multiple times\nfor different classes, FA-Seg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To\nfurther enhance the segmentation quality, FA-Seg introduces three key\ncomponents: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware\nattention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD)\nthat enhances semantic precision via multi-resolution attention fusion, and\n(iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial\nconsistency. Extensive experiments show that FA-Seg achieves state-of-the-art\ntraining-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC,\nPASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference\nefficiency. Our results demonstrate that FA-Seg provides a strong foundation\nfor extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference\nefficiency.

However, previous work has shown that\nusers' perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e.,\nallocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual\nor image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect\nattention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when\nscrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a\nfixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been\naddressed by existing LTR methods.\n  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking\ntask, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation\nlength is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show\nthat this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability\nranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem\ncannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.\n  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient\nestimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.\nOur semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the\nexpected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best\nperformance across different ranking settings. Furthermore, we observe that\neven simple length-aware methods can achieve significant performance\nimprovements over fixed-length models.

This indicates that the outer\ncocoon is formed by a powerful jet that propagates through an ambient density\nof $20-300\\,{\\rm cm}^{-3}$ with a jet power of $10^{45-46.5}\\,{\\rm erg}\\,{\\rm\ns}^{-1}$. On the other hand, the inner cocoon is formed by a weaker jet with a\npower of $10^{43-44}\\,{\\rm erg}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$, propagating through a\nrelatively low-density environment of $6-20\\, {\\rm cm}^{-3}$. These results\nsuggest that: 1) with respect to the difference in $n_{\\rm a}$, it appears to\nsupport the hypothesis that the inner cocoon, recently formed about 10 years\nago, is expanding in the low-density cocoon created by the jet emitted about\n25-50 years ago. 2) to achieve the short-lived and high $L_{\\rm j}$ that\ngenerated the outer cocoon, a large mass accretion rate must be required over a\nshort period to activate the jet. These may imply the extreme accretion event\ndriven by the tidal disruption events (TDEs) of massive stars and/or the disk\ninstability.",

The limit detection and\navoidance module comprises an optimization algorithm, a model predictive\ncontroller, and a computationally simple on-board dynamical model.

In the\nproposed scheme, coded bits from two users are split and assigned to one shared\nsymbol and two private symbols carried by different beams. Based on joint\nsymbol mapping of H-QAM constellations and phase-aligned precoding at the\ntransmitter, each receiver observes a different H-QAM constellation with Gray\nmapping, a unique parallax feature not shared by existing schemes. In addition\nto avoiding successive interference cancellation (SIC), each user independently\ndemodulates its own bits on separate I and Q branches with calculations based\non closed-form expressions. Hence the receiver complexity is on par with that\nof orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which is much lower than that in other\ncompeting alternatives such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and\nrate-splitting multiple access (RSMA).

To\naddress these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent\ndiffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a\nprogressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware\ngarment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained\ndeformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via\na cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment,\nthe original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality\nrendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit\neffectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and\nvisual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as\ntextures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the\nhuman body.

    "abstract": "We present a neuro-symbolic framework for generative language modeling based\non local, event-driven emergent learning. At its core is a hierarchical\nHopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic\ntokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or\nsupervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences\nas multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind\nco-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an\nemergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into\nlong-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form\nof plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to\ngeneralize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We\ndemonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds\ndistributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These\nemergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value\nmechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture\nprovides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can\nemerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building\nscalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and\nreasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy.

    "abstract": "Developing a better understanding of surprising or counterintuitive phenomena\nhas constituted a significant portion of deep learning research in recent\nyears. These include double descent, grokking, and the lottery ticket\nhypothesis -- among many others. Works in this area often develop ad hoc\nhypotheses attempting to explain these observed phenomena on an isolated,\ncase-by-case basis. This position paper asserts that, in many prominent cases,\nthere is little evidence to suggest that these phenomena appear in real-world\napplications and these efforts may be inefficient in driving progress in the\nbroader field. Consequently, we argue against viewing them as isolated puzzles\nthat require bespoke resolutions or explanations. However, despite this, we\nsuggest that deep learning phenomena do still offer research value by providing\nunique settings in which we can refine our broad explanatory theories of more\ngeneral deep learning principles. This position is reinforced by analyzing the\nresearch outcomes of several prominent examples of these phenomena from the\nrecent literature. We revisit the current norms in the research community in\napproaching these problems and propose practical recommendations for future\nresearch, aiming to ensure that progress on deep learning phenomena is well\naligned with the ultimate pragmatic goal of progress in the broader field of\ndeep learning.",

To improve DNN training process, knowledge distillation methods\ndemonstrate their effectiveness in accelerating network training by introducing\na fixed learning direction from the teacher network to student networks. In\nthis context, several distillation-based optimization strategies are proposed,\ne.g., deep mutual learning and self-distillation, as an attempt to achieve\ngeneric training performance enhancement through the cooperative training of\nmultiple networks. However, such strategies achieve limited improvements due to\nthe poor understanding of the impact of learning directions among networks\nacross different iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel competitive\ndistillation strategy that allows each network in a group to potentially act as\na teacher based on its performance, enhancing the overall learning performance.\nCompetitive distillation organizes a group of networks to perform a shared task\nand engage in competition, where competitive optimization is proposed to\nimprove the parameter updating process. We further introduce stochastic\nperturbation in competitive distillation, aiming to motivate networks to induce\nmutations to achieve better visual representations and global optimum.

However, these likelihood-based methods\nare blind to the anomalies located in local modes near the learned\ndistribution. To handle these ``unseen\" anomalies, we dive into three gaps\nuniquely existing in VAD regarding scene, motion and appearance. Specifically,\nwe first build a noise-conditioned score transformer for denoising score\nmatching. Then, we introduce a scene-dependent and motion-aware score function\nby embedding the scene condition of input sequences into our model and\nassigning motion weights based on the difference between key frames of input\nsequences. Next, to solve the problem of blindness in principle, we integrate\nunaffected visual information via a novel autoregressive denoising score\nmatching mechanism for inference. Through autoregressively injecting\nintensifying Gaussian noise into the denoised data and estimating the\ncorresponding score function, we compare the denoised data with the original\ndata to get a difference and aggregate it with the score function for an\nenhanced appearance perception and accumulate the abnormal context.

    "abstract": "Random testing has proven to be an effective technique for compiler\nvalidation. However, the debugging of bugs identified through random testing\npresents a significant challenge due to the frequent occurrence of duplicate\ntest programs that expose identical compiler bugs. The process to identify\nduplicates is a practical research problem known as bug deduplication. Prior\nmethodologies for compiler bug deduplication primarily rely on program analysis\nto extract bug-related features for duplicate identification, which can result\nin substantial computational overhead and limited generalizability. This paper\ninvestigates the feasibility of employing bisection, a standard debugging\nprocedure largely overlooked in prior research on compiler bug deduplication,\nfor this purpose. Our study demonstrates that the utilization of bisection to\nlocate failure-inducing commits provides a valuable criterion for\ndeduplication, albeit one that requires supplementary techniques for more\naccurate identification. Building on these results, we introduce BugLens, a\nnovel deduplication method that primarily uses bisection, enhanced by the\nidentification of bug-triggering optimizations to minimize false negatives.\nEmpirical evaluations conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that\nBugLens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art analysis-based\nmethodologies Tamer and D3 by saving an average of 26.98% and 9.64% human\neffort to identify the same number of distinct bugs.

Current deep\nlearning algorithms usually solve for the optimal classifier by\n\\emph{implicitly} estimating the posterior probabilities, \\emph{e.g.}, by\nminimizing the Softmax cross-entropy loss. This simple methodology has been\nproven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets.\nHowever, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real\nworld, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the\nBayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a\nnovel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of\nthe data distributions by \\emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the\nposterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently,\nour method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based\non Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and\nensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a\nstraightforward yet effective \\emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This\nmethod enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set\nto effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance\nfactor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional\ncomputational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are\northogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they\nare mostly designed under the principle of \\emph{implicitly} estimating the\nposterior probabilities.

To address these challenges, we\npropose Sample-Cluster-Select (SCS) for solving practical combinatorial\noptimization problems under the assumption of potentially acceptable solution\nset. SCS first samples the potential solutions, performs clustering on these\nsolutions, and selects a representative solution for each cluster.

We conducted experiments on randomly\ngenerated instances, comparing SCS against multi-start local search and\n$k$-best algorithms where efficient methods exist, or evolutionary algorithms\notherwise. The results show that SCS outperforms multi-start local search and\n$k$-best algorithms in most cases, while showing competitive performance\nagainst evolutionary algorithms, though not surpassing some of their variants.\nMost importantly, we found that the clustering approach provides insights into\nsolutions that are difficult to obtain with existing methods, such as local\nstructures of similar potential solutions and neighboring solutions of\nrepresentative solutions.

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and\ncollective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,\nrobustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving\nLLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not\nnecessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM\nagents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less\nexplored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective\nvisualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that\nproduce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,\nwhere each generated token depends on the previous context. Therefore, earlier\ncontext tokens can introduce redundant activations that interfere with the\nexplanation of later tokens beyond their original information. Existing studies\noften overlook this issue, but our observations reveal that these redundant\ncorrelations can significantly hurt the reliability of explanations. To address\nthis, we propose an estimated causal inference method to mitigate the\ninterference of context to achieve high-quality MLLM explanation, with a novel\nrank Gaussian filter to further reduce activation noises. We term this method\nToken Activation Map (TAM) to highlight the consideration of interactions\nbetween tokens. TAM also indicates that it excels at explaining multiple tokens\nof MLLM, which is different from the Class Activation Map (CAM) for a single\nprediction. Our TAM method significantly outperforms existing SoTA methods,\nshowcasing high-quality visualization results that can be utilized for various\nscenarios, such as object localization, failure case analysis, video\nvisualization, MLLMs visual comparison, and model understanding (e.g., color,\nshape, action, location, visual reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc).

We adopted stochastic variational inference to infer molecular\nparameters from spectra at individual positions, balancing between fitting\naccuracy and computational speed. For obtaining parameter maps, instead of\nquerying every location or pixel, we introduced an active learning framework\nbased on Bayesian quadrature and its parallelization. Specifically, we assessed\nand selected the locations or pixels of spectrum that are most informative for\nestimating the entire set of parameter maps by training a Gaussian processes\nmodel. By greedily selecting locations with maximum information gain, we\nachieve sublinear convergence. We benchmarked BASIL on a large synthetic\ndatacube and demonstrated that it produces accurate 468 molecular parameter\nmaps from 117 molecules within ~180 hours, orders of magnitude faster than\ntraditional pixel-by-pixel fitting using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, with\nvisually reliable results emerging in just ~20 hours.

In this paper, we present\nSub-MoE, a novel MoE compression framework via Subspace Expert Merging. Our key\ninsight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated\nexpert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared\n$U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$\ncomponents. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1)\nAdaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via\nK-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2)\nSubspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to\nderive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues\nfrequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert\nreconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse\nexperts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression\nfor further inference optimization. Extensive experiments on Mixtral, DeepSeek,\nand Qwen-1.5|3 MoE LLMs demonstrate that our Sub-MoE significantly outperforms\nexisting expert pruning and merging methods.

    "abstract": "Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are fundamental tools for detecting\nentanglement. However traditional linear witnesses often fail to identify most\nof the entangled states. In this work, we construct a family of nonlinear\nentanglement witnesses by taking the envelope of linear witnesses defined over\ncontinuous families of pure bipartite states with fixed Schmidt bases. This\nprocedure effectively \"bends\" the hyperplanes associated with linear witnesses\ninto curved hypersurfaces, thereby extending the region of detectable entangled\nstates. The resulting conditions can be expressed in terms of the positive\nsemi-definiteness of a family of matrices, whose principal minors define a\nhierarchy of increasingly sensitive detection criteria. We show that this\nconstruction is not limited to the transposition map and generalizes naturally\nto arbitrary Positive but not Completely Positive (PnCP) maps, leading to\nnonlinear analogues of general entanglement witnesses. We emphasize that the\nrequired measurements remain experimentally accessible, as the nonlinear\ncriteria are still formulated in terms of expectation values over local\noperator bases. Through both analytical and numerical examples, we demonstrate\nthat the proposed nonlinear witnesses outperform their linear counterparts in\ndetecting entangled states which may evade individual linear EWs in the\nconstruction. This approach offers a practical and conceptually elegant\nenhancement to entanglement detection in finite-dimensional systems.",

We find that a systematic quasi-linear bias affects the RV\nextraction with slopes that vary from -0.3 m/s-1/h-1 to -52 m/s-1/h-1 in our\nsample. This trend is not observed in CCF RVs and appears when all observations\nof a given star are collected within a short time-period (timescales of hours).\nWe show that this systematic contamination exists in the RV time-series of two\ndifferent template-matching pipelines, one line-by-line pipeline, and that it\nis agnostic to the spectrograph. We also find that this effect is connected\nwith the construction of the stellar template, as we are able to mitigate it\nthrough a careful selection of the observations used to construct it. Our\nresults suggest that a contamination of micro-telluric features, coupled other\nsources of correlated noise, could be the driving factor of this effect.

    "abstract": "It is generally believed that spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry is\nrestricted by Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. A special case is that the 1D\nferromagnetic Heisenberg chain holds long-range order because the order\nparameter commutes with the Hamiltonian. The other one is that the recently\nfound frustration-free Hamiltonians can bypass this theorem, but the observed\nsymmetry breaking is fragile under generic perturbations. In this Letter, we\nhave discovered a new example that goes beyond the above two examples -- a 1D\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on comb lattice -- that can achieve\nspontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry. In addition to the long range\norder parameter, its energy spectrum shows Anderson tower of states.\nImportantly, it is not a frustration-free model and its order parameter does\nnot commute with the Hamiltonian. Moreover, the long-range order is robust\nunder symmetry-preserving perturbations. Combining numerical simulation and\ntheoretical analysis, we have further confirmed and understood this nontrivial\nphenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale simulations on supercomputers have become important tools for\nusers. However, their scalability remains a problem due to the huge\ncommunication cost among parallel processes. Most of the existing communication\nlatency analysis methods rely on the physical link layer information, which is\nonly available to administrators. In this paper, a framework called PCLVis is\nproposed to help general users analyze process communication latency (PCL)\nevents. Instead of the physical link layer information, the PCLVis uses the MPI\nprocess communication data for the analysis. First, a spatial PCL event\nlocating method is developed. All processes with high correlation are\nclassified into a single cluster by constructing a process-correlation tree.\nSecond, the propagation path of PCL events is analyzed by constructing a\ncommunication-dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG), which can help\nusers interactively explore a PCL event from the temporal evolution of a\nlocated PCL event cluster. In this graph, a sliding window algorithm is\ndesigned to generate the PCL events abstraction. Meanwhile, a new glyph called\nthe communication state glyph (CS-Glyph) is designed for each process to show\nits communication states, including its in/out messages and load balance. Each\nleaf node can be further unfolded to view additional information. Third, a PCL\nevent attribution strategy is formulated to help users optimize their\nsimulations. The effectiveness of the PCLVis framework is demonstrated by\nanalyzing the PCL events of several simulations running on the TH-1A\nsupercomputer. By using the proposed framework, users can greatly improve the\nefficiency of their simulations.",

The main goal of this\nwork is to study the emission lines detected in the spectra of the bright\nC-rich PNe IC 418 and NGC 7027 and to identify all those emission features\nassociated with radio recombination lines (RRLs) of light elements.

This work allows us to provide the most complete and\nupdated catalog of RRLs in space, carried out at 2, 3 and 7 mm with the IRAM\n30m and the Yebes 40m radio telescopes. We compare these observational data\nsets with synthetic models produced with the radiation transfer code Co3RaL.\nOur observations reveal the presence of several H and He I RRLs at mm\nwavelengths in the spectra of IC 418 and NGC 7027 and also of HeIIi RRLs in the\nspectrum of NGC 7027. Many of these lines had remained undetected until now due\nto their weakness and the lack of high-sensitivity observations at these\nfrequencies. The data also confirm the absence of molecular emission towards IC\n418, above a detection level of ~3 mK [Tmb]. These mm observations represent\nthe most extended RRL line survey of two C-rich PNe carried out so far, with\nmost of the lines never reported before. These extremely complete catalogs\nevidence the importance of high-sensitivity observations and are expected to be\nvery helpful in the line identification process in mm observations, in\nparticular for still unknown or poorly characterized molecular species existing\nin the vicinity of ionized environments.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the notion of rational structure on a quiver and associated\nrepresentations to establish a coherent framework for studying quiver\nrepresentations in separable field extensions. This notion is linked to a\nrefinement of the notion of $K$-species, which we term \\'etale $K$-species: We\nestablish a categorical anti-equivalence between the category of $K$-rational\nquivers and that of \\'etale $K$-species, which extends to an equivalence of\ntheir respective representation categories. For $K$-rational quivers there is a\ncanonical notion of base change, which suggests a corresponding notion of base\nchange for (\\'etale) $K$-species which we elaborate. As a primary application,\nwe generalize Gelfand's celebrated equivalence between certain blocks of\nHarish-Chandra modules for $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{R})$ and representations of\nthe Gelfand quiver to a rational setting. To this end, we define a\n$\\mathbb{Q}$-rational structure on the Gelfand quiver and its representations.\nA key technical tool, which we call unipotent stabilization, is developed to\nconstruct the functor from certain rational Harish-Chandra modules to nilpotent\nrational quiver representations. We prove that this functor is an equivalence.\nA similar result is established for the cyclic quiver. A notable consequence of\nthis rational framework is that the defining relation of the Gelfand quiver\nbecomes superfluous when working over fields not containing $\\sqrt{-1}$.

A quantum simulation library was\ndeveloped to efficiently compute circuit outputs and derivatives by leveraging\nGPU acceleration based on PyTorch, enabling end-to-end training of the QPINN.\nThe method was evaluated on two 2D electromagnetic wave propagation problems:\none in free space (vacuum) and one with a dielectric medium. Multiple quantum\ncircuit ans\\\"atze, input scales, and an added loss term were compared in a\nthorough ablation study. Furthermore, recent techniques to enhance PINN\nconvergence, including random Fourier feature embeddings and adaptive\ntime-weighting, were incorporated. Our results demonstrate that the QPINN\nachieves accuracy comparable, and even greater than the classical PINN\nbaseline, while using a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters.\nThis study also shows that adding an energy conservation term to the loss\nstabilizes training and improves the physical fidelity of the solution in the\nlossless free-space case. This added term helps mitigate a new kind of a barren\nplateau (BP) related phenomenon - ``black hole'' (BH) loss landscape for the\nquantum experiments in that scenario. By optimizing the quantum-circuit ansatz\nand embedding energy-conservation constraints, our QPINN achieves up to a 19\npercent higher accuracy on 2D Maxwell benchmark problems compared to a\nclassical PINN.",

Incorporating radiative\ncorrections, soft SUSY-breaking contributions, and supergravity effects, we\nconstruct a consistent and predictive inflationary framework. Notably, the\npresence of $R$-symmetry violating terms at the nonrenormalizable level helps\nresolve the common issue of light waterfall fields in grand unified theories,\nrendering them sufficiently heavy without disturbing gauge coupling\nunification. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that these $R$-symmetry\nbreaking contributions play a crucial role in bringing the scalar spectral\nindex $n_s$ into excellent agreement with the recent cosmological observations,\nparticularly the Data Release 6 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The\ntensor-to-scalar ratio remains suppressed, with $r < 10^{-5}$, below the reach\nof current and near-future experiments.

Time series foundation models\nrepresent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional\nexpressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However,\nthis gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct\ndynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet\nthis is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox,\nthis paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives,\nthe representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of\npatch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not\nmerely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the\nrepresentation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic\nvector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our\ntheoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous\ntime-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary\nwhose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural\nlanguage. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust\nrepresentation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby\nexplaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work\nprovides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and\nimproving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "The origin of extragalactic, almost dark HI clouds with extreme\ngas-to-stellar mass ratios remains poorly understood. We investigate the nature\nand fate of the \"almost dark\" cloud AGC 226178, projected within the Virgo\ncluster, with an HI-to-stellar mass ratio of ~1000. We present deep single-dish\nHI mapping from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST),\ncomplemented by high-resolution interferometric data from the Very Large Array\n(VLA), as part of the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID)\nproject. These observations provide the highest-quality HI analysis to date of\nsuch a cloud, combining resolution and sensitivity. FAST data reveal a short,\nlow-velocity tail toward the dwarf galaxy VCC 2034, previously proposed as a\npossible origin for AGC 226178. However, VCC 2034 shows a line-of-sight\nasymmetric HI feature and cometary morphology indicating a stripping event\nunrelated to AGC 226178. VLA data reveal a velocity gradient across AGC 226178\nand a clumpy internal structure. The velocity dispersion exceeds the thermal\nlinewidth, implying turbulence or unresolved motions. The cloud cannot be\ngravitationally bound by atomic gas alone. The resolved HI clumps follow\nstandard HI mass-star formation rate and mass-size relations, with those\nforming stars reaching surface densities above the threshold for\nself-shielding. We conclude that AGC 226178 is a free-floating HI cloud of\nunknown origin. The system appears to be in the process of disintegration. It\nis likely located well outside the Virgo cluster, as the preservation of its\nextended HI morphology within the cluster environment would otherwise require a\nsubstantial reservoir of unseen molecular gas with a mass exceeding that of the\nobserved HI content. While confinement pressure from the hot intracluster\nmedium may aid its stability, it is unlikely to be the dominant factor\npreventing its disruption.",

Drawing on recruitment data classified under ISCO-08 and the Chinese\nStandard Occupational Classification 2022, we categorize jobs into five\nfunctional groups: management, professional, technical, auxiliary, and manual.\nUsing a task-based framework, we construct routine, abstract, and manual task\nintensity indices through keyword analysis of job descriptions. We find that\ndigitalization is associated with increased hiring in managerial, professional,\nand technical roles, and reduced demand for auxiliary and manual labor. At the\ntask level, abstract task demand rises, while routine and manual tasks decline.\nModeration analyses link these shifts to improvements in managerial efficiency\nand executive compensation.

Here we discuss\nthe possibility to consider the thermal accessibility of competing,\nhigher-energy configurations through Boltzmann averaging when the extended\nsurface configurations and their energetics are computed within periodic\nboundary condition supercells. We show analytically that fully converged\naverages can be obtained with a candidate pool derived from exhaustive sampling\nin a surface unit-cell exceeding the system's correlation length. In contrast,\naveraging over a small pool of ad hoc assembled structures is generally\nill-defined. Enumerations of a lattice-gas Hamiltonian model for on-surface\noxygen adsorption at Pd(100) are employed to illustrate these considerations in\na practical context.",

In the absence of precise point-level labels,\ncurrent methods first generate point-level pseudo-labels, which are then used\nto train segmentation models. However, generating accurate pseudo-labels for\neach point solely based on scene-level annotations poses a considerable\nchallenge, substantially affecting segmentation performance. Consequently, to\nenhance accuracy, this paper proposes a high-quality pseudo-label generation\nframework by exploring contemporary multi-modal information and region-point\nsemantic consistency. Specifically, with a cross-modal feature guidance module,\nour method utilizes 2D-3D correspondences to align point cloud features with\ncorresponding 2D image pixels, thereby assisting point cloud feature learning.\nTo further alleviate the challenge presented by the scene-level annotation, we\nintroduce a region-point semantic consistency module. It produces regional\nsemantics through a region-voting strategy derived from point-level semantics,\nwhich are subsequently employed to guide the point-level semantic predictions.\nLeveraging the aforementioned modules, our method can rectify inaccurate\npoint-level semantic predictions during training and obtain high-quality\npseudo-labels. Significant improvements over previous works on ScanNet v2 and\nS3DIS datasets under scene-level annotation can demonstrate the effectiveness.\nAdditionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of our\napproach's individual components.

On the other hand, certain classes of networks are 'closed'\nwhen we restrict to subsets of leaves, such as (i) the classes of all\nphylogenetic networks or all phylogenetic trees; (ii) the classes of galled\nnetworks, simplicial networks, galled trees; and (iii) the classes of networks\nthat have some parameter that is monotone-under-leaf-subsampling (e.g., the\nnumber of reticulations, height, etc) bounded by some fixed value.

    "abstract": "Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the\nunderstanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data\ntypes and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them\ncomprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models\n(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this\npaper, we introduce $\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model\ndesigned to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong\nperformance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In\n$\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset\nencompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from\nlocation view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a\nmulti-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement\nfrom domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and\ndownstream performance of $\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.\nFinally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the\nperformance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results\nfrom three cities demonstrate that $\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms\nopen-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex\ncross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.\nSource codes and data are openly accessible to the research community via\nhttps://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UrbanLLaVA.",

While this extension\nis theoretically nonintrusive-meaning it does not require the original\nstate-space realization-it depends on samples of spectral factorizations of the\ntransfer function. Since practical methods for obtaining such samples are\ncurrently unavailable, this extension remains largely a theoretical\ncontribution. In this work, we present a non-intrusive ADI-type framework for\nthese generalized balanced truncation methods that requires only samples of the\noriginal transfer function for implementation.",

For such a structure, it is a\nchallenging task to design a low-complexity and high-performance fusion of\ntarget direction values sensed by different sub-array groups with fewer use of\nprior knowledge. To address this issue, a lightweight Cramer-Rao lower bound\n(CRLB)-ratio-weight fusion (WF) method is proposed, which approximates inverse\nCRLB of each subarray using antenna number reciprocals to eliminate real-time\nCRLB computation. This reduces complexity and prior knowledge dependence while\npreserving fusion performance. Moreover, a multi-branch deep neural network\n(MBDNN) is constructed to further enhance direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensing by\nleveraging candidate angles from multiple subarrays. The subarray-specific\nbranch networks are integrated with a shared regression module to effectively\neliminate pseudo-solutions and fuse true angles. Simulation results show that\nthe proposed CRLB-ratio-WF method achieves DOA sensing performance comparable\nto CRLB-based methods, while significantly reducing the reliance on prior\nknowledge. More notably, the proposed MBDNN has superior performance in low-SNR\nranges. At SNR $= -15$ dB, it achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in\nestimation accuracy compared to CRLB-ratio-WF method.",

However, they still face three primary challenges: 1) the\nself-attention mechanism tends to suppress high-frequency components in the\nfeatures, which severely impacts model performance; 2) the computational cost\nof transformers is relatively high. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nHigh-frequency Augmentation and Multi-Wave mixing (HAMW) method for person\nsearch. HAMW is designed to enhance the discriminative feature extraction\ncapabilities of transformers while reducing computational overhead and\nimproving efficiency. Specifically, we develop a three-stage framework that\nprogressively optimizes both detection and re-identification performance. Our\nmodel enhances the perception of high-frequency features by learning from\naugmented inputs containing additional high-frequency components. Furthermore,\nwe replace the self-attention layers in the transformer with a strategy based\non multi-level Haar wavelet fusion to capture multi-scale features. This not\nonly lowers the computational complexity but also alleviates the suppression of\nhigh-frequency features and enhances the ability to exploit multi-scale\ninformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAMW achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets.",

In response to\nthis challenge, we introduce \\textit{Trident}, a face forgery detection\nframework that employs triplet learning with a Siamese network architecture for\nenhanced adaptability across diverse forgery methods. \\textit{Trident} is\ntrained on curated triplets to isolate nuanced differences of forgeries,\ncapturing fine-grained features that distinguish pristine samples from\nmanipulated ones while controlling for other variables. To further enhance\ngeneralizability, we incorporate domain-adversarial training with a forgery\ndiscriminator. This adversarial component guides our embedding model towards\nforgery-agnostic representations, improving its robustness to unseen\nmanipulations. In addition, we prevent gradient flow from the classifier head\nto the embedding model, avoiding overfitting induced by artifacts peculiar to\ncertain forgeries. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and\nablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. We will\nrelease our code in a GitHub repository.",

For example, the\nanalytical structure of the scattering coefficient implies that the decay rate\nof a mode generally plays the role of ``star excitation factor'', similar to\nthe ``black hole excitation factor'' previously defined for describing black\nhole mode excitations. With this star excitation factor we derive the transient\nmode excitation as a binary system crosses a generic mode resonance of a\ncompanion star during the inspiral stage. This application is useful because\nprevious description of resonant mode excitation of stars still relies on the\nmode and driving force decomposition based on the Newtonian formalism.

To mitigate\nthese issues, we introduce SynCheck, a quality-guided synthetic data\nutilization scheme that refines synthetic data quality during task model\ntraining.

We conducted a high-throughput screening of over $10,000$\nmaterials, focusing on centrosymmetric compounds with imaginary polar phonon\nmodes and suitable band gaps, and identified $310$ promising candidates with\npotential for enhanced optoelectronic tunability. From this set, three\nperovskite-like compounds --Ag$_3$SBr, BaTiO$_3$, and PbHfO$_3$-- were selected\nfor in-depth investigation based on their contrasting band-gap behavior with\ntemperature. Using first-principles calculations, \\textit{ab initio} molecular\ndynamics simulations, tight-binding models, and anharmonic Fr\\\"ohlich theory,\nwe analyzed the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results show that polar\nphonon distortions can induce substantial band-gap modulations at ambient\nconditions, including reductions of up to $70\\%$ in Ag$_3$SBr and increases of\nnearly $23\\%$ in BaTiO$_3$, relative to values calculated at zero temperature,\nwhile PbHfO$_3$ exhibits minimal change.

    "abstract": "We consider the one-dimensional ions dynamics in weakly collisional plasmas\ngoverned by the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system under the Boltzmann relation with\nthe small collision frequency $\\nu>0$. It is observed in physical experiments\nthat the interplay of nonlinearities and dispersion may lead to the formation\nof ion acoustic solitons that are described by the Korteweg-de Vries equation.\nIn this paper, to capture the ionic KdV structure in the weak-collision regime,\nwe study the combined cold-ions limit and longwave limit of the rescaled VPL\nsystem depending on a small scaling parameter $\\epsilon>0$. The main goal is to\njustify the uniform convergence of the VPL solutions to the KdV solutions over\nany finite time interval as $\\epsilon\\to 0$ under restriction that\n$\\epsilon^{3/2}\\lesssim \\nu \\lesssim \\epsilon^{1/2}$. The proof is based on the\nenergy method near local Maxwellians for making use of the Euler-Poisson\ndynamics under the longwave scaling. The KdV profiles, in particular including\nboth velocity field and electric potential, may have large amplitude, which\ninduces the cubic velocity growth. To overcome the $\\epsilon$-singularity in\nsuch multi-parameter limit problem, we design delicate velocity weighted energy\nfunctional and dissipation rate functional in the framework of macro-micro\ndecomposition that is further incorporated with the Caflisch's decomposition.\nAs an application of our approach, the global-in-time existence of solutions\nnear global Maxwellians when the KdV profile is degenerate to a constant\nequilibrium is also established under the same scaling with\n$\\epsilon^{3}\\lesssim \\nu \\lesssim \\epsilon^{5/2}$. For the proof, the velocity\nweight is modified to depend on the solution itself, providing an extra quartic\ndissipation so as to obtain the global dynamics for most singular Coulomb\npotentials.",

Typically, existing methods adopt unified\nrepresentation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal\nfeatures of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm\nfails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame\nimaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects.\nTo address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various\nlatent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between\nbackground and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate\nfor frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting\nframework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we\nfigure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in\nframe-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal\nfeatures, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between\nbackground and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that\nGaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal\ncharacteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal\ndisentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the\ncumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal\ndiscrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous\ndynamic scene.

These challenges make prior\nmethods struggle to produce satisfactory results or even become invalid. To\naddress the first challenge, we propose a novel Distribution-based Depth\nRegularization (DDR) that ensures the rendering weight distribution to align\nwith the true distribution. Specifically, unlike previous methods that use\ndepth loss to calculate the error of the expectation, we calculate the\nexpectation of the error by using Gumbel-softmax to differentiably sample\npoints from discrete rendering weight distribution. Additionally, we introduce\nconstraints that enforce the volume density of spatial points before the object\nboundary along the ray to be near zero, ensuring that our model learns the\ncorrect geometry of the scene. To demystify the DDR, we further propose a\nvisualization tool that enables observing the scene geometry representation at\nthe rendering weight level. For the second challenge, we incorporate camera\nparameter learning during training to enhance the robustness of our model to\ncamera parameters.

Current evaluation\napproaches, reliant on performance change after applying ICL, suffer from low\nreliability, poor attribution, and impracticality in data-insufficient\nscenarios. We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that\nquantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss\ndecrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input\nrelevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it\ncaptures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving\nreliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual\nalignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output\ncalibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance\non labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings\nand reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.\nFurther analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model\ncapabilities critical to ICL success.",

However,\ntraditional node-based message passing mechanisms, when applied to knowledge\ngraphs, often introduce noise and suffer from information dilution or\nover-smoothing by indiscriminately aggregating information from all neighboring\nedges. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-aware relational\nmessage passing. A core innovation of this framework is the introduction of a\nsemantic-aware Top-K neighbor selection strategy. Specifically, this strategy\nfirst evaluates the semantic relevance between a central node and its incident\nedges within a shared latent space, selecting only the Top-K most pertinent\nones. Subsequently, information from these selected edges is effectively fused\nwith the central node's own representation using a multi-head attention\naggregator to generate a semantically focused node message. In this manner, our\nmodel not only leverages the structure and features of edges within the\nknowledge graph but also more accurately captures and propagates the contextual\ninformation most relevant to the specific link prediction task, thereby\neffectively mitigating interference from irrelevant information.

    "abstract": "Art plagiarism detection plays a crucial role in protecting artists'\ncopyrights and intellectual property, yet it remains a challenging problem in\nforensic analysis. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing\nplagiarized paintings and explaining the detected plagarisms by retrieving\nvisually similar authentic artworks. To support this study, we construct a\ndataset by collecting painting photos and synthesizing plagiarized versions\nusing generative AI, tailored to specific artists' styles. We first establish a\nbaseline approach using off-the-shelf features from the visual foundation model\nDINOv2 to retrieve the most similar images in the database and classify\nplagiarism based on a similarity threshold. Surprisingly, this non-learned\nmethod achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97.2\\% but suffers from low\nretrieval precision 29.0\\% average precision (AP). To improve retrieval\nquality, we finetune DINOv2 with a metric learning loss using positive and\nnegative sample pairs sampled in the database. The finetuned model greatly\nimproves retrieval performance by 12\\% AP over the baseline, though it\nunexpectedly results in a lower recognition accuracy (92.7\\%). We conclude with\ninsightful discussions and outline directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Distributed integrated sensing and communication (DISAC) systems are key\nenablers for 6G networks, offering the capability to jointly track multiple\ntargets using spatially distributed base stations (BSs). A fundamental\nchallenge in DISAC is the seamless and efficient handover of target tracks\nbetween BSs with partially overlapping fields of view, especially in dense and\ndynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel target handover\nframework based on belief propagation (BP) for multi-target tracking in DISAC\nsystems. By representing the probabilistic data association and tracking\nproblem through a factor graph, the proposed method enables efficient marginal\ninference with reduced computational complexity. Our framework introduces a\nprincipled handover criterion and message-passing strategy that minimizes\ninter-BS communication while maintaining tracking continuity and accuracy. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed handover procedure achieves performance\ncomparable to centralized processing, yet significantly reduces data exchange\nand processing overhead. Extensive simulations validate the robustness of the\napproach in urban tracking scenarios with closely spaced targets.",

Despite its significance, generally how LLM\nperformances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored.\nIn this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement\nvia the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that\nthe performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between\nLLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical\nframework, we further introduce how to predict the ultimate power of\nself-improvement using only information from the first few training epochs. We\nempirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model on various LLMs\nand datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate\nhow external data influences these dynamics within the framework.

However, current approaches face three key\nlimitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for\nembedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled\npaired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training\nobjectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage\nframework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional\nmultimodal embedding models.

Our method\naddresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through\ncontinual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via\njoint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for\nenhanced representation robustness.

Most of the existing works which have used Frank\nCopula have focused on estimating the parameter computationally, and then\nproceeded with its application in the applied fields, mostly in finance. Here,\nin this investigation, we have looked at the point estimation of the\nassociation parameter in a comprehensive manner, and studied three estimators\nin terms of bias, mean squared error (MSE), relative bias and relative MSE. It\nhas been noted that in the neighborhood of zero, the method of moment\nestimators (MMEs) do perform well compared to the maximum likelihood estimator\n(MLE), even though the latter has the best overall performance.

    "abstract": "The recent release of RadGenome-Chest CT has significantly advanced CT-based\nreport generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on global\nfeatures, making it challenging to capture region-specific details, which may\ncause certain abnormalities to go unnoticed. To address this, we propose\nMedRegion-CT, a region-focused Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM)\nframework, featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce Region\nRepresentative ($R^2$) Token Pooling, which utilizes a 2D-wise pretrained\nvision model to efficiently extract 3D CT features. This approach generates\nglobal tokens representing overall slice features and region tokens\nhighlighting target areas, enabling the MLLM to process comprehensive\ninformation effectively. Second, a universal segmentation model generates\npseudo-masks, which are then processed by a mask encoder to extract\nregion-centric features. This allows the MLLM to focus on clinically relevant\nregions, using six predefined region masks. Third, we leverage segmentation\nresults to extract patient-specific attributions, including organ size,\ndiameter, and locations. These are converted into text prompts, enriching the\nMLLM's understanding of patient-specific contexts. To ensure rigorous\nevaluation, we conducted benchmark experiments on report generation using the\nRadGenome-Chest CT. MedRegion-CT achieved state-of-the-art performance,\noutperforming existing methods in natural language generation quality and\nclinical relevance while maintaining interpretability. The code for our\nframework is publicly available.",

Recent advances demonstrate that directly leveraging LLMs\ncan achieve leading results.

In this paper, we\npropose ReinFix, a novel framework that enables LLMs to autonomously search for\nrepair ingredients throughout both the reasoning and solution phases of bug\nfixing. In the reasoning phase, ReinFix integrates static analysis tools to\nretrieve internal ingredients, such as variable definitions, to assist the LLM\nin root cause analysis when it encounters difficulty understanding the context.\nDuring the solution phase, when the LLM lacks experience in fixing specific\nbugs, ReinFix searches for external ingredients from historical bug fixes with\nsimilar bug patterns, leveraging both the buggy code and its root cause to\nguide the LLM in identifying appropriate repair actions, thereby increasing the\nlikelihood of generating correct patches. Evaluations on two popular benchmarks\n(Defects4J V1.2 and V2.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over\nSOTA baselines. Notably, ReinFix fixes 146 bugs, which is 32 more than the\nbaselines on Defects4J V1.2. On Defects4J V2.0, ReinFix fixes 38 more bugs than\nthe SOTA.

    "abstract": "Online advertising in recommendation platforms has gained significant\nattention, with a predominant focus on channel recommendation and budget\nallocation strategies. However, current offline reinforcement learning (RL)\nmethods face substantial challenges when applied to sparse advertising\nscenarios, primarily due to severe overestimation, distributional shifts, and\noverlooking budget constraints. To address these issues, we propose MTORL, a\nnovel multi-task offline RL model that targets two key objectives. First, we\nestablish a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework specific to the nuances of\nadvertising. Then, we develop a causal state encoder to capture dynamic user\ninterests and temporal dependencies, facilitating offline RL through\nconditional sequence modeling. Causal attention mechanisms are introduced to\nenhance user sequence representations by identifying correlations among causal\nstates. We employ multi-task learning to decode actions and rewards,\nsimultaneously addressing channel recommendation and budget allocation.\nNotably, our framework includes an automated system for integrating these tasks\ninto online advertising. Extensive experiments on offline and online\nenvironments demonstrate MTORL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to\nmany natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its\nmolecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulations were used to investigate Na+, Cl-, and water diffusion inside\na 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging\nfrom 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of\ndiffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the\npore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of\nactivation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel,\nshowing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural\nanalysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to\nhydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the\npore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was\nintroduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and\nmolecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond 1 nm,\nsuppressed diffusivities were well captured by an exponential decay model based\non the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of\ntransport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These\nfindings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena\nand suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry\nof cementitious gels, such as surface coordination environments, pore size\ndistributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress\nionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.",

To alleviate these issues, we introduce a\nFrequency-enhanced Multi-granularity Context Network (FMC-Net) to improve the\naccuracy of vertebrae segmentation.

The utilization of multi-granularity contexts is\nessential for distinguishing similar vertebrae and improving segmentation\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Understanding and decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG)\nsignals is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI, with applications in\ncognition, emotion recognition, diagnosis, and brain-computer interfaces. While\nrecent EEG foundation models advance generalized decoding via unified\narchitectures and large-scale pretraining, they adopt a scale-agnostic dense\nmodeling paradigm inherited from NLP and vision. This design neglects a core\nproperty of neural activity: cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. EEG task\npatterns span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from short bursts to\nslow rhythms, and from localized cortical responses to distributed\ninteractions. Ignoring this diversity leads to suboptimal representations and\nweak generalization. We propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain\nfoundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces: (i)\nCross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale\nfeatures from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into\ncompact scale-aware tokens; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which\ncaptures cross-window and cross-region dependencies, enhancing scale diversity\nwhile removing spurious correlations. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to\nprogressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on 11 EEG tasks\nacross 16 datasets show that CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and\nfoundation model baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a\nkey inductive bias and position CSBrain as a robust backbone for future\nbrain-AI research.",

This brings about a problem that, when building a world\nmodel, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very\nobserved causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Meta-Causal\nGraph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently\nencodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across\ndifferent latent world states.

    "abstract": "Directed Grey-box Fuzzing (DGF) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for\ncrash reproduction and patch testing, leveraging its capability to precisely\nnavigate toward target locations and exploit vulnerabilities. However, current\nDGF tools are constrained by insufficient runtime feedback, limiting their\nefficiency in reaching targets and exploring state spaces. This study presents\nHF-DGF, a novel directed grey-box fuzzing framework. Its seed scheduling is\nguided by a hybrid feedback mechanism integrating control-flow distance,\nvalue-flow influence score, and slice coverage. To enable precise control-flow\ndistance feedback, we propose a backward-stepping algorithm to calculate basic\nblock-level seed distances on a virtual inter-procedural control-flow graph\n(ICFG). For effective state space exploration, we introduce value-flow\ninfluence and a corresponding metric, the value-flow influence score.\nAdditionally, to mitigate runtime overhead from hybrid feedback, we adopt a\nnovel selective instrumentation strategy. Evaluations on 41 real-world\nvulnerabilities show HF-DGF outperforms existing tools: it achieves crash\nreproduction 5.05 times faster than AFL, 5.79 times faster than AFLGo, 73.75\ntimes faster than WindRanger, 2.56 times faster than DAFL, and 8.45 times\nfaster than Beacon on average. Notably, when all fuzzers triggered crashes,\nHF-DGF exhibited the lowest code coverage, demonstrating superior\ndirectionality and efficiency. It also surpasses AFLGo, WindRanger, DAFL, and\nBeacon in static analysis efficiency.",

A central\nchallenge for analyzing ULD is that its degeneracy necessitates the development\nof new analysis approaches, e.g., the theory of hypocoercivity. In this paper,\nwe give a new coupling-based framework for analyzing ULD and its numerical\ndiscretizations. First, in the continuous-time setting, we use this framework\nto establish new parabolic Harnack inequalities for ULD. These are the first\nHarnack inequalities that decay to zero in contractive settings, thereby\nreflecting the convergence properties of ULD in addition to just its regularity\nproperties.\n  Second, we build upon these Harnack inequalities to develop a local error\nframework for analyzing discretizations of ULD in KL divergence. This extends\nour framework in part III from uniformly elliptic diffusions to degenerate\ndiffusions, and shares its virtues: the framework is user-friendly, applies to\nsophisticated discretization schemes, and does not require contractivity.\nApplying this framework to the randomized midpoint discretization of ULD\nestablishes (i) the first ballistic acceleration result for log-concave\nsampling (i.e., sublinear dependence on the condition number), and (ii) the\nfirst $d^{1/3}$ iteration complexity guarantee for sampling to constant total\nvariation error in dimension $d$.",

Existing training paradigms,\nincluding Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Reward (RLVR), impose substantial demands on the base VLM, exceeding\nthe capabilities of SVLMs. Consequently, directly applying these paradigms to\nSVLMs often suffers from severe pseudo thinking traces and advantage collapse,\nultimately undermining both thinking reliability and task performance. A\nnatural solution is to combine SFT and RLVR, leveraging their complementarity\nto reduce the dependence on model capacity. However, the widely adopted\ntwo-stage training paradigm still performs poorly on SVLMs, as their tendency\ntoward sub-optimal convergence hinders the trade-off and limits the benefits of\nthe combination. To address this, we propose DyME, a novel training paradigm\nthat Dynamically selects between Memorization (via SFT) and Exploration (via\nRLVR) modes at each optimization step, ensuring that every update contributes\nto the trade-off. Extensive experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that\nDyME consistently achieves this balance, and thus delivers substantial\nperformance improvements.

Implicit interests\nare captured from user history through a Differentiable Clustering Module\n(DCM), whereas explicit interests, such as topics that the user has followed,\nare modeled via Conditional Retrieval (CR).

Synergizing implicit and explicit user interests serves as a\ncomplementary approach to achieve more effective and comprehensive candidate\nretrieval as they benefit on different user segments and extract conditions\nfrom different but supplementary sources.

The key idea is to\nrepresent arrays as index functions: programs are index function\ntransformations over which properties are propagated and inferred. Our\nframework proves properties on index functions by distilling them into\nalgebraic (in)equalities and discharging them to a Fourier-Motzkin-based\nsolver. The framework is practical and accessible: properties are not\nrestricted to a decidable logic, but instead are carefully selected to express\npractically useful guarantees that can be automatically reasoned about and\ninferred. These guarantees extend beyond program correctness and can be\nexploited by the entire compiler pipeline for optimization.

AURA combines open-weight ASR, TTS, and LLMs in a\ncascaded pipeline and supports tools such as calendar booking, contact lookup,\nweb search, and email. Its modular design allows easy integration of new tools\nusing natural language prompts and action classes. On VoiceBench, AURA scores\n92.75% on OpenBookQA-outperforming all open-weight systems and nearing\nGPT-4o-and 4.39 on AlpacaEval, competitive with other open-weight systems.\nHuman evaluation shows 90% task success on complex, multi-turn speech tasks.",

We\npropose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in\nembodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on\nrich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi,\ncovering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework\nsupports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides\nmultimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person\nperspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person\nevaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records\nafter a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for\na more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the\nsubjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We\nconstructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective\nvideos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated\nmultiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically\nevaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large\nvision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform\nsignificantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between\nhumans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person\nevaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM\ncapabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.",

    "abstract": "We communicate over wireless channels by first estimating and then equalizing\nthe effective channel. In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation\nthe carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a\nquasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and\nDoppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the\nchannel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a\nsingle Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can\nbe used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. This makes DD\ndomain channel estimation straightforward, and there is no loss in spectral\nefficiency since it is possible to design data and pilot signals that are\nmutually unbiased. However, equalization in the DD domain has high complexity\n${\\mathcal O}(M^3N^3)$ where $M$, $N$ are respectively the number of delay and\nDoppler bins in an OTFS frame, and $MN$ is the number of information symbols.\n  We demonstrate that equalization in the frequency domain (FD) reduces\ncomplexity to only ${\\mathcal O}(M^2 N^2)$ by taking advantage of the banded\nstructure of the effective FD channel. We also derive a low-complexity method\nto reconstruct the effective FD channel from the estimated DD domain effective\nchannel.",

Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1\nincorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token\nrefiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like\nGPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation\ntasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a\nlanguage model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation\ntasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the\nenhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score\nof 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent\nstate-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In\ntext-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the\nDPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively.

    "abstract": "We present a thermodynamically consistent energetic variational model for\nactive nematics driven by ATP hydrolysis, with a focus on the coupling between\nchemical reactions and mechanical dynamics. Extending the classical Toner-Tu\nframework, we introduce a chemo-mechanical coupling mechanism in which the\nself-advection and polarization dynamics are modulated by the ATP hydrolysis\nrate. The model is derived using an energetic variational approach that\nintegrates both chemical free energy and mechanical energy into a unified\nenergy-dissipation law. The reaction rate equation explicitly incorporates\nmechanical feedback, revealing how active transport and alignment interactions\ninfluence chemical fluxes and vice versa. This formulation not only preserves\nconsistency with nonequilibrium thermodynamics but also provides a transparent\npathway for modeling energy transduction in active systems. We also present\nnumerical simulations demonstrating how ATP consumption drives the merging of\ntopological defects and enables the system to escape a quasi-equilibrium, a\nphenomenon not observed in passive nematic systems. This framework offers new\ninsights into energy transduction and regulation mechanisms in biologically\nrelated active systems.",

The key idea is to\nfeed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete\nWavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters\nare learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss\ngradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine\nprocess delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to\ncapture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through\nextensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate\nhyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks,\nand consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with\nmemory or storage-constrained hardware.",
