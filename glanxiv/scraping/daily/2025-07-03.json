    "abstract": "Ensuring the reliability and availability of complex networked services\ndemands effective root cause analysis (RCA) across cloud environments, data\ncenters, and on-premises networks. Traditional RCA methods, which involve\nmanual inspection of data sources such as logs and telemetry data, are often\ntime-consuming and challenging for on-call engineers. While statistical\ninference methods have been employed to estimate the causality of network\nevents, these approaches alone are similarly challenging and suffer from a lack\nof interpretability, making it difficult for engineers to understand the\npredictions made by black-box models. In this paper, we present RCACopilot, an\nadvanced on-call system that combines statistical tests and large language\nmodel (LLM) reasoning to automate RCA across various network environments.\nRCACopilot gathers and synthesizes critical runtime diagnostic information,\npredicts the root cause of incidents, provides a clear explanatory narrative,\nand offers targeted action steps for engineers to resolve the issues. By\nutilizing LLM reasoning techniques and retrieval, RCACopilot delivers accurate\nand practical support for operators.",

    "abstract": "System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often\nsuboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable\n\"soft prompts,\" sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a\nnovel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively\nrefine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs\nthree collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent\n(target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and\noptionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where\nfeedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing,\nevolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles,\nthe iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We\npresent experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on\nmetrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings\nindicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable\ntrade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines.\nPotential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing\nmodel transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback\nreliability are acknowledged.",

    "abstract": "Biological and artificial learning systems alike confront the\nplasticity-stability dilemma. In the brain, neuromodulators such as\nacetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain\nand inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed\nby dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal\nsystem, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant\nsubstrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals\ncoincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a\nsingle somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts\nthe output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that\ntranslate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this\nmechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons\nand single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,\nlinked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).\nThe soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,\nwhile dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by\nshifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive\nor tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of\ncalcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition\nsuppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold\nof neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting\naccelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and flexibility.\nThis suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators could serve as\nan adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively modulating the\nsynaptic weight updates.",

Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to\ncreation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models\n(LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or\nfine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning,\neach job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in\nexcessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular\ninference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow\nindependent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They\ncannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and\nfine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to\nexpose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we\naddress the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model.\nThe base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning\nprocesses. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of\nclient-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering\nthem flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method,\nto achieve their performance goals.

However, BCGs\naccount for less than 1% of all early-type galaxies (ETGs). To broaden our\nunderstanding of how multiphase filamentary nebulae form in ETGs and connect to\nthe greater picture of galaxy evolution, it is crucial to explore ETGs that are\noutside of the dense centers of galaxy clusters or groups. We present VLT-MUSE\nIFU observations of 126 nearby non-central ETGs, detecting warm ionized gas in\n54 of them. 35 out of 54 display rotating disks that are morphologically and\nkinematically aligned with their stellar components, suggesting stellar mass\nloss as the origin of their warm gas. The remaining 19 host filamentary nebulae\nthat are decoupled from the stellar components, resembling those observed in\nBCGs. These filamentary sources display unique emission line properties that\ncannot be fully explained by photoionization from post-asymptotic giant branch\nstars, active galactic nuclei, or fast gas shocks. For the eight filamentary\nsources that have been observed with Chandra, their soft X-ray emission\nindicates the presence of hot gas. We posit that their emission lines may be\npowered by EUV and X-ray radiation from the cooling of the hot gas, similar to\ncool-core clusters, but the detailed mechanisms and physical conditions may be\ndifferent. As a detailed study case, we investigate NGC 4374, a non-central ETG\nwith extensive Chandra observations, and find that its warm filaments are over\npressured compared to the hot filaments - opposite with what is observed in\ncool-core clusters.",

These RCBM arise by regulating coupled Brownian motions (CBM)\n$(\\chi_t(a), a,t \\geq 0)$ to remain nonnegative. Here, for $t\\geq 0$,\n$\\chi_t(0)=0$ and $\\chi_t(a):=w(a)+\\sigma B_t-\\mu(a)t$ for $a>0$, $w(\\cdot)$ is\na suitable initial condition, $\\sigma$ is a positive constant, $B$ is a\nstandard Brownian motion, and $\\mu(\\cdot)$ is an unbounded, positive, strictly\ndecreasing drift function. In the context of the BBP (2022) scaling limit, the\ndrift function is determined by the model parameters, and, for each $a\\geq 0$,\n$W_{\\cdot}(a)$ represents the scaling limit of the amount of work in the system\nof size $a$ or less. Thus, for the BBP (2022) scaling limit, the time $t$\nvalues of the RCBM describe the random distribution of the size of the\nremaining work in the system at time $t$. Our principal results characterize\nthe stationary distribution of the RCBM in terms of a maximum process\n$M_*(\\cdot)$ associated with CBM starting from zero. We obtain an explicit\nrepresentation for the finite-dimensional distributions of $M_*(\\cdot)$ and a\nsimple formula for its covariance. We further show that the RCBM converge in\ndistribution to $M_*(\\cdot)$ as time $t$ approaches infinity. From this, we\ndeduce the stationary behavior of the BBP (2022) scaling limit, including\nobtaining an integral expression for the stationary queue length in terms of\nthe associated maximum process. While its distribution appears somewhat\ncomplex, we compute the mean and variance explicitly, and we connect with the\nwork of Lin, Wierman, and Zwart (2011) to offer an illustration of Little's\nLaw.",

The results contest binary polarization\nnarratives inherited from US/UK scholarship by uncovering a multi-polar\nlandscape.

Excessive contaminants, including phosphate, deplete dissolved\noxygen and trigger eutrophication, leading to serious health and ecological\nproblems. Continuous sensors that track phosphate levels can therefore help\nprevent eutrophication. In this work we present a lithography-free phosphate\nsensor (P-sensor) that detects phosphate in river water at parts-per-billion\nlevels. The device uses a solid-state indicator electrode formed by 3D-printed\nperiodic polymer patterns (8 um feature size) coated with a thin phosphate\nion-selective membrane.

A feed-forward neural network was\ntrained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3,\nzero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for\nriver samples.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to\ntheir sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a\nmemory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to\nmulti-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute\nthroughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading\nmodel parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with\ndual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its\nsingle-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we\npresent DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed\nzeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:\n(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed\nforward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted\nto the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism\ndesign that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication\nbottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware\ncommunication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them\nacross GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales\nzeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory\nefficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our\nexperiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with\ndistributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in\nhttps://github.com/liangyuwang/zo2.",

Our results show that combining simpler models with\nchemically informative features, particularly count-based Morgan fingerprints,\noutperforms more complex models that rely on internally learned embeddings,\nsuch as AGILE. We also show that a multi-layer perceptron trained on a\ncombination of Morgan fingerprints and Expert descriptors achieved the highest\nperformance ($\\text{R}^2$ = 0.8161, r = 0.9053), significantly exceeding AGILE\n($\\text{R}^2$ = 0.2655, r = 0.5488).

The new method has\nconnections to ensemble Kalman inversion and works by evolving an ensemble so\nthat each ensemble member solves an instance of a randomly perturbed\noptimization problem. Linear analysis demonstrates that ensemble members\nconverge exponentially fast to randomized maximum likelihood estimators and,\nfurthermore, that the new method produces samples from the Bayesian posterior\nwhen applied to a suitably regularized optimization problem. The method\nrequires that the forward operator, relating the unknown parameter to the data,\nbe evaluated once per iteration per ensemble member, which can be prohibitively\nexpensive when the forward model requires the evolution of a high-dimensional\ndynamical system. We propose a strategy for making the proposed method\ntractable in this setting based on a balanced truncation model reduction method\ntailored to the Bayesian smoothing problem.

Prior to interacting with the receiver,\nthe sender observes the distribution of actions taken by a population of\ndecision makers who share the receiver's preferences in best response to an\nunobserved distribution of messages generated by an unknown and potentially\nheterogeneous signal. The sender views any prior that rationalizes this data as\nplausible and seeks a signal that maximizes her worst-case payoff against the\nset of all such distributions.

We show that the Langevin equation that describes the dynamics of\nthe Brownian particle contains (due to rotation) long-range correlated noise.\nIn contrast to the usual situation of non-rotational equilibration, the\nrotational Gibbs distribution is recovered only for a weak coupling with the\nbath.

In this context, we clarify the\napplicability of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem to classical systems in\nrotational equilibrium, as well as the concept of work done by a changing\nmagnetic field. Additionally, we show that the Brownian particle under a\nrotationally symmetric potential reaches a stationary state that behaves as an\neffective equilibrium, characterized by a free energy. As a result, no work can\nbe extracted via cyclic processes that respect the rotation symmetry.

Berenstein, Henson, and Ibarluc\\'ia\nshowed that the model companion of $\\mathcal{K}_\\Gamma$ exists when $\\Gamma$ is\na nonabelian free group on a countable number of generators. We significantly\ngeneralize their result by showing that the model companion of $\\cal K_\\Gamma$\nexists whenever $\\Gamma$ is an approximately treeable group. The class of\napproximately treeable groups contain the class of treeable groups as well as\nthe class of universally free groups, that is, the class of groups with the\nsame universal theory as nonabelian free groups. We prove this result using an\nopen mapping characterization of when the model companion exists; moreover,\nthis open mapping characterization provides concrete, ergodic-theoretic axioms\nfor the model companion when it exists. We show how to simplify these axioms in\nthe case of treeable groups, providing an alternate axiomatization for the\nmodel companion in the case of the free group, which was first axiomatized by\nBerenstein, Henson, and Ibarluc\\'ia using techniques from model-theoretic\nstability theory. Along the way, we prove a purely ergodic-theoretic result of\nindependent interest, namely that finitely generated universally free groups\n(also known as limit groups) have Kechris' property MD. We also show that for\ngroups with Kechris' EMD property, the profinite completion action is\nexistentially closed, and for groups without property (T), the generic\nexistentially closed action is weakly mixing, generalizing results of\nBerenstein, Henson, and Ibarluc\\'ia for the case of nonabelian free groups.",

We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and\nquantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in\nsummarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay\nconsistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs\nexpose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of\nthe cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of\nthe cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases.

In particular, over the Boolean cube ($S = \\{0,1\\}\n\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}$), the lemma asserts non-zero polynomials are non-zero\nwith probability at least $2^{-d}$. In this work we extend the ODLSZ lemma\noptimally (up to lower-order terms) to \"Boolean slices\" i.e., points of Hamming\nweight exactly $k$. We show that non-zero polynomials on the slice are non-zero\nwith probability $(t/n)^{d}(1 - o_{n}(1))$ where $t = \\min\\{k,n-k\\}$ for every\n$d\\leq k\\leq (n-d)$. As with the ODLSZ lemma, our results extend to polynomials\nover Abelian groups. This bound is tight (upto the error term) as evidenced by\ndegree d multilinear monomials. A particularly interesting case is the\n\"balanced slice\" ($k=n/2$) where our lemma asserts that non-zero polynomials\nare non-zero with roughly the same probability on the slice as on the whole\ncube.\n  The behaviour of low-degree polynomials over Boolean slices has received much\nattention in recent years. However, the problem of proving a tight version of\nthe ODLSZ lemma does not seem to have been considered before, except for a\nrecent work of Amireddy, Behera, Paraashar, Srinivasan and Sudan (SODA 2025)\nwho established a sub-optimal bound of approximately $((k/n)\\cdot(1-(k/n)))^d$\nusing a proof similar to that of the standard ODLSZ lemma.\n  While the statement of our result mimics that of the ODLSZ lemma, our proof\nis significantly more intricate and involves spectral reasoning which is\nemployed to show that a natural way of embedding a copy of the Boolean cube\ninside a balanced Boolean slice is a good sampler.",

In the latter case, despite the distinct\nnature of the fields, their non-zero vacuum expectation values contribute\nadditively to the overall effect on the phantom distribution and on the\nresulting line element. Moreover, we consider scalar waves to probe the effects\nof the Lorentz violation in these spacetimes. Notably, the additional\nLorentz-violating couplings can alter scalar field dynamics such that\nperturbations propagate as if in a General Relativity background, which allows\nfor some traits of Lorentz violation to be hidden.

    "abstract": "A large scale parametric study of the flow over the prolate spheroid is\npresented to understand the effect of Reynolds number and angle of attack on\nthe separation, the wake formation and the loads. Large-Eddy Simulation is\nperformed for six Reynolds numbers ranging from Re = 0.15M to Re = 4M and for\neight angles of attack ranging from 10 degrees to 90 degrees. For all the cases\nconsidered, the boundary layer separates symmetrically and forms a\nrecirculation region. Several distinct flow topologies are observed that can be\ngrouped into three categories: proto-vortex, coherent vortex and recirculating\nwake. In the proto-vortex state, the recirculation does not have a distinct\ncenter of rotation, instead, a two-layer detached flow structure is formed. In\nthe coherent vortex state, the separated shear layer rolls into a\nthree-dimensional vortex that is aligned with the axis of the spheroid. This\nvortex has a clear center of rotation corresponding to a minimum of pressure\nand transforms the azimuthal momentum from the separated shear layer into axial\nmomentum. In the recirculating wake regime, the recirculation is incoherent and\nthe primary separation forms a dissipative shear layer that is convected in the\ndirection of the free-stream. This symmetric pair of shear layers bounds a\nlow-momentum recirculating cavity on the leeward side of the spheroid. The\nproperties of these states are not constant, but evolve along the axis of the\nspheroid and are dictated by the characteristics of the boundary layer at\nseparation. The variation of the flow with Reynolds number and angle of attack\nis described, and its connection to the loads on the spheroid are discussed.",

Projecting these distributions onto meaningful\nlow-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream\nanalysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as\nNormalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but\ntheir scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work,\nwe introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that\ntightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF\nunifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to\nsimultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as\nCollective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate\nequilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two\ncomponents of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized\njointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow,\nimportant degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces\nthe system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across\ndiverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and\ncluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking\nusing multiple metrics and extensive simulations.

On the matrix model side this is an interpolation in the Dyson index\nbetween the Wigner-Dyson classes, on the gravity side it can be thought of as\ninterpolating between orientable and unorientable manifolds in the\ngravitational path integral, opening up the possibility to study moduli space\nvolumes of manifolds ``in between''. Using the perturbative loop equations we\nstudy correlation functions of this theory and prove several structural\nproperties, having clear implications on the generalised moduli space volumes.\nAdditionally we give a geometric interpretation of these properties using the\ngeneralisation to arbitrary Dyson index of the recently found Mirzakhani-like\nrecursion for unorientable surfaces. Using these properties, we investigate\nwhether $\\upbeta$-topological gravity is quantum chaotic in the sense of the\nBGS conjecture. Along the way we answer this question for the last Wigner-Dyson\nclass not studied in the literature, the symplectic one, and establish strong\nevidence for quantum chaos for this variety of the theory, and thus for all\nbosonic varieties of topological gravity. For the general $\\upbeta$ case we\nalso argue for the case of quantum chaoticity, based on novel constraints we\nfind to be obeyed by genuinely non Wigner-Dyson parts of the moduli space\nvolumes. As for the general $\\upbeta$ case the universal behaviour expected\nfrom a chaotic system is not known analytically we give first steps how to\nobtain it, starting with the result of $\\upbeta$ topological gravity and\ncomparing then to a numerical evaluation of the universal result.",

An example of this interplay is Cosmic Reionization, where\nionizing photons from galaxies escaped into the intergalactic medium (IGM),\ndriving its transition from neutral to ionized at $z>6$. Star-forming galaxies\nare thought to be the dominant sources of reionization. However, an open\nquestion remains as to whether bright or faint star-forming galaxies are the\nprimary reionization contributors. This depends on the escape fraction\n$f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ -- the fraction of ionizing photons that successfully escape\nthe galaxy's interstellar and circumgalactic medium to reach the IGM.\nPerforming direct measurements of $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ during the reionization\nepoch is not feasible, due to the near-zero transmission of the IGM at\n$z\\gtrsim4$. However, by calibrating $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ against indirect\nindicators (i.e. galaxy properties that correlate with $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$) at\nlower $z$, we can estimate its value in galaxies during reionization.\nCurrently, $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ calibrations are mostly limited to $\\sim 90$\nsources brighter $M_{UV} \\sim -18$ at $z\\sim0.3$. Yet, recent models suggest\nthat fainter galaxies ($-19<M_{UV}<-13$) may be the major contributors to\nreionization.

Additionally, we plan to reach\nmagnitudes as faint as 1/100 $L^*$ at $z\\sim0.1$. Suitable targets will be\nselected from the upcoming Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) survey.

We present a domain-specific fine-tuning approach for Generative\nEngine Optimization (GEO) that transforms web content to improve\ndiscoverability in large language model outputs. Our method fine-tunes a\nBART-base transformer on synthetically generated training data comprising 1,905\ncleaned travel website content pairs. Each pair consists of raw website text\nand its GEO-optimized counterpart incorporating credible citations, statistical\nevidence, and improved linguistic fluency. We evaluate using intrinsic metrics\n(ROUGE-L, BLEU) and extrinsic visibility assessments through controlled\nexperiments with Llama-3.3-70B. The fine-tuned model achieves significant\nimprovements over baseline BART: ROUGE-L scores of 0.249 (vs. 0.226) and BLEU\nscores of 0.200 (vs. 0.173). Most importantly, optimized content demonstrates\nsubstantial visibility gains in generative search responses with 15.63%\nimprovement in absolute word count and 30.96% improvement in position-adjusted\nword count metrics. This work provides the first empirical demonstration that\ntargeted transformer fine-tuning can effectively enhance web content visibility\nin generative search engines with modest computational resources. Our results\nsuggest GEO represents a tractable approach for content optimization in the\nAI-driven search landscape, offering concrete evidence that small-scale,\ndomain-focused fine-tuning yields meaningful improvements in content\ndiscoverability.",

    "abstract": "Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence\n(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision\npersists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than\nshape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract\nshapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a\nsolution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than\nscaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early\ninfancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising\ndecades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel\ndevelopmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems\nthrough this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with\nhuman behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the\nstrongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape\nrecognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image\ncorruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming\nhigh parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,\nwe provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way\nhow a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a\nresource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual\nsystems.",

Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by\nproducing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing\nthe need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has\nseen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains\nlargely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for\nContrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically\nassesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology\nreports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive\nmodels on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their\nutility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address\nperformance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM\nthat weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance.\nOur results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised\nbaselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond\nthree modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated\nLSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from\n51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively\nlearned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate\ngeneralization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in\ninterpretability and fairness.

The HCHC-XX is a novel compact cyclotron accelerating H$_2^+$. Beam is\ninjected through a radio-frequency quadrupole buncher-accelerator (embedded in\nthe cyclotron yoke) and utilizes so-called vortex motion during acceleration.\nIf successful, it will deliver 10 mA of protons at 60 MeV in CW mode. This\nscheme requires a low-emittance, high-current initial beam with high H$_2^+$\npurity. We briefly summarize the design and previous results of the MIST-1 ion\nsource and, for the first time, the detailed design of the new and improved\nMIST-2, including the mechanical, electrical, and control system design. We\nfurther show experimental results of using the MIST-2 backplate on the MIST-1\nbody, present a study using different types of permanent magnets for\nconfinement (including no magnets), and finally, we present first results of\nthe MIST-2 in full operation.

This study investigates domain growth in an LRIM\nwith quenched disorder, following a deep low-temperature quench. Specifically,\nwe consider an Ising model with interactions that decay as $J(r) \\sim\nr^{-(D+\\sigma)}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension and $\\sigma > 0$ is the\npower-law exponent. The quenched disorder is introduced via random pinning\nfields at each lattice site. For nearest-neighbor models, we expect that domain\ngrowth during activated dynamics is logarithmic in nature: $R(t) \\sim (\\ln\nt)^{\\alpha}$, with growth exponent $\\alpha >0$. Here, we examine how long-range\ninteractions influence domain growth with disorder in dimensions $D = 1$ and $D\n= 2$. In $D = 1$, logarithmic growth is found to persist for various $\\sigma >\n0$. However, in $D = 2$, the dynamics is more complex due to the non-trivial\ninterplay between extended interactions, disorder, and thermal fluctuations.",

While existing approaches offload\nKV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they\noften underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy.

HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head\nsparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual\nrelevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates\ninto existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining.

    "abstract": "With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there\nis an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated\nmedical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician\nreview. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because\n1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often\nunavailable in real-world settings. While the \"LM-as-judge\" paradigm (a LM\nevaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss\nsubtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we\npropose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to\ntrain evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are\nfactually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or\nreference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a\ndataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a\nphysician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6\ndiverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,\nproprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly\nimproves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,\nincreasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety\nclassification scores up to 86%.

In this paper we study the edge query complexity\nof learning a hidden bipartite graph, or equivalently its bipartite adjacency\nmatrix, in the classical as well as quantum settings.

Recent results have shown that online algorithms related to Follow the\nRegularized Leader (FTRL) converge to Nash equilibria (NE) in the last iterate\nin a wide variety of games, including zero-sum games. However, bargaining games\ndo not have the properties used previously to established convergence\nguarantees, even in the simplest case of the ultimatum game, which features a\nsingle take-it-or-leave-it offer. Nonetheless, we establish that FTRL (without\nthe modifications necessary for zero-sum games) achieves last-iterate\nconvergence to an approximate NE in the ultimatum game along with a bound on\nconvergence time under mild assumptions. Further, we provide experimental\nresults to demonstrate that convergence to NE, including NE with asymmetric\npayoffs, occurs under a broad range of initial conditions, both in the\nultimatum game and in bargaining games with multiple rounds. This work\ndemonstrates how complex economic behavior (e.g. learning to use threats and\nthe existence of many possible equilibrium outcomes) can result from using a\nsimple learning algorithm, and that FTRL can converge to equilibria in a more\ndiverse set of games than previously known.",

Dark energy is contributed from both holographic\nvacuum energy and the NMC scalar field. NMC effective gravitational constant\n$G_\\text{eff}(\\phi)$, is naturally defined at the action level. Therefore, the\ngravitational constant in the holographic vacuum density is an effective one,\ni.e. $ \\rho_{\\Lambda} = {3c^{2}}/{8\\pi G_{\\text{eff}}L^{2}}\\,. $ Apparent\nhorizon is chosen as IR holographic cutoff scale as it is a trapped null\nsurface. There are nine fixed points in this dynamical system with four\nindependent dimensionless parameters. We consider flat case and find that\nviable cosmological evolution follows the sequence: an initial\nstiff-fluid-dominated phase, transitioning through a nearly dust-dominated era,\nand eventually reaching a stable dark energy-dominating state. Stability\nanalysis requires that $\\xi <0$ and $0 < c < 1$ for the theory to be physically\nvalid. Since zero NMC coupling, $\\xi=0$, is not allowed in the autonomous\nsystem, the model can not completely recover canonical scalar field case. That\nis to say, as $\\xi \\rightarrow 0^-$ and $c \\rightarrow 0^+$, the model can only\napproach the canonical scalar case but can not completely recover it. To\napproach dust or stiff fluid dominations, both magnitudes of the NMC coupling\nand the holographic parameter must be small. Numerical integration shows that\nfor any allowed values of $\\xi$ and $c$, $w_\\text{eff}$ approaches $-1$ at late\ntimes. Increasing of $c$ does not change shape of the $w_{\\rm eff}$, but larger\n$c$ increases $w_\\text{eff}$. As $\\xi$ becomes stronger, dust era gradually\ndisappears. Good behaviors of the dynamics require $-1 \\ll \\xi <0$ and $0 < c\n\\ll 1$.",

Given that the corresponding decay rate is\nsmall, this one can be used as a perturbative parameter and it is possible to\nconstruct analytic solutions from a perturbative analysis for the densities of\nthe species and the scale factor. The decay of dark matter is an irreversible\nprocess since it occurs out of chemical equilibrium and therefore the entropy\nper comoving volume increases considerably, as a consequence the temperature\ndoes not scale as $a^{-1}$ in contrast to an adiabatic expansion. We take into\naccount two scenarios: a) The case in which both species making up the fluid\nend up in thermal equilibrium and therefore their temperature is the same. b) A\nsecond instance in which the species do not reach thermal equilibrium and\ntherefore they have different temperatures. We verify that the second law of\nthermodynamics is satisfied in any case.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP), enabling performance across diverse tasks with\nlittle task-specific training. However, LLMs remain susceptible to social\nbiases, particularly reflecting harmful stereotypes from training data, which\ncan disproportionately affect marginalised communities. We measure gender bias\nin Maltese LMs, arguing that such bias is harmful as it reinforces societal\nstereotypes and fails to account for gender diversity, which is especially\nproblematic in gendered, low-resource languages. While bias evaluation and\nmitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on\nlow-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research\ninvestigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language\nmodels, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual\nmodels respectively. Bias measurement and mitigation techniques from English\nare adapted to Maltese, using benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs and SEAT,\nalongside debiasing methods Counterfactual Data Augmentation, Dropout\nRegularization, Auto-Debias, and GuiDebias. We also contribute to future work\nin the study of gender bias in Maltese by creating evaluation datasets. Our\nfindings highlight the challenges of applying existing bias mitigation methods\nto linguistically complex languages, underscoring the need for more inclusive\napproaches in the development of multilingual NLP.",

While this result overcame previous\nbarriers and impossibility results for Hamming LDCs, it is not clear whether\nthe techniques extend to Insdel LDCs. Constructing Insdel LDCs which are\nresilient to insertion and/or deletion errors is known to be even more\nchallenging.\n  Our first contribution is to provide a Hamming-to-Insdel compiler which\ntransforms any amortized Hamming LDC that satisfies a particular property to\namortized Insdel LDC while asymptotically preserving the rate, error tolerance\nand amortized locality. Prior Hamming-to-Insdel compilers worked for arbitrary\nHamming LDCs, but incurred an undesirable polylogarithmic blow-up in the\nlocality.

To systematically investigate LLM reliability in\nmathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both\nsolvable and unsolvable problems.

A synthetic two-dimensional base flow is constructed by\nadding finite-amplitude streaks to the turbulent mean flow. The streak mode is\nchosen as the leading resolvent mode from linear response theory. Besides,\nturbulent fluctuations can be taken into account or not by using a simple Cess\neddy viscosity model. The linear stability of the base flow is considered by\nsearching for detuned unstable eigenmodes, thereby allowing for large-scale\nmodulations.

    "abstract": "Jellyfish galaxies provide direct evidence of ram pressure stripping in\ncluster environments. We investigate the role of magnetic fields in the\nformation of jellyfish galaxies with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM)\nusing radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. We impose magnetized (MHD)\nand non-magnetized (HD) winds on the gas-rich dwarf galaxies containing the\nmagnetized or non-magnetized ISM. The MHD winds strip the disk gas more\neffectively than the HD winds because of the magnetic force acting against the\nlocal density gradient, which results in remarkably different ram pressure\nstripped features. The magnetic fields induced by the MHD winds generate a\nstrong magnetic pressure, which forms smoothed disks and tail gas features.\nSince the stripped ISM in MHD wind cases travels while being nearly isolated\nfrom the intracluster medium (ICM), the stripped ISM mostly forms stars within\n20~kpc of the galactic disks. In contrast, non-magnetized winds facilitate the\nefficient mixing of the stripped ISM with the ICM, resulting in the formation\nof abundant warm clouds that cool and collapse in the distant\n($\\sim50-100\\,$kpc) tails at times of a few hundred Myr. Consequently, distant\ntail star formation occurs only in the HD wind runs. Finally, despite the\ndifferent tail features, the star formation rates in the disk remain similar\nowing to the interplay between the increased gas stripping and the gas density\nincrease in the disks of the MHD wind runs. These results suggest that the\nmagnetized ICM may have a significant influence on jellyfish galaxies, whereas\nthe magnetized ISM play a minor role.",

Existing research commonly attributes\nhallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter\nmeans the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user\nexpectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or\nexternally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that\nhallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human\npsychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically\nanalyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals\npsychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,\nwe investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size\ninfluence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated\nquestions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit\nstronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting\nincreasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human\nsubject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural\ndifferences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new\nperspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the\nimportance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The\nbenchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.",

Additionally, ablation studies over ten random stratified splits\nassess performance stability. Results show that embedding quality substantially\noutweighs classifier complexity in determining predictive performance, and that\nfederated learning can closely match centralized results in idealized\nconditions.

We\nshow that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced\nchoice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence\nin their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind.

In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of\nnoninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze\nmuch larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic\nAubry-Andr\\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential\n(AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections\nto noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least\nan $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and\nconverge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances.\nAdditionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this\nweakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport\ncapacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these\nresults demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak\ninteractions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization\npersists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We\nexpect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently\nstrong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true\nlocalized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed\ninteraction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized\nregime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon\narising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative\neffects.",

We consider this an ideal execution scenario, where the\ncommunication in parallel has not impact on the compute time. However,\nperforming computation and communication sequentially is, on average, 10.2%\nslower than overlapped execution, with a maximum slowdown of 26.6%. We further\nobserve, while specialized datapath and optimized numeric precision mitigate\ncertain slowdowns, overlapping execution can lead to resource contention and\nalso increase power consumption under specific configurations. The analysis\nalso uncovers trade-offs introduced by power and frequency capping, emphasizing\nthe importance of balanced strategies to optimize energy efficiency and\ntraining throughput.",

A comprehensive\nanalysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using\nsampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding\nwavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start\nthe article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental\ntheorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions\ncorresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study\nthe other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the\nspeckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean\npreservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various\nlevels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated\nvia an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of\nsamples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the\nregion of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken\nslice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental\ntheorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations\nwe observe that the various operators have their own significance while\nstudying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an\nimage (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work\nwell and some do not for some specific features of the image.",

Using a similarity transformation, we obtain four coupled\nfirst-order differential equations. Subsequently, obtain four non-homogeneous\nsecond-order differential equations. To solve these equations exactly and\nanalytically, we use a change of variable, the asymptotic behavior, and the\nFrobenius method. Consequently, we obtain the relativistic spectrum for the\nelectron/positron, where we note that this spectrum is quantized in terms of\nthe radial and angular quantum numbers $n$ and $m_j$, and explicitly depends on\nthe position and momentum NC parameters $\\theta$ and $\\eta$ (describes the NC\nphase space), cyclotron frequency $\\omega_c$ (an angular frequency that depends\non the electric charge $e$, mass $m$, and external magnetic field $B$),\nanomalous magnetic energy $E_m$ (an energy generated through the interaction of\nthe AMM with the external magnetic field), $z$-momentum $k_z$ (linear momentum\nalong the $z$-axis), and on the fermion and chiral chemical potentials $\\mu$\nand $\\mu_5$ (describes the CME). However, through $\\theta$, $\\eta$, and $m$, we\ndefine two types of ''NC angular frequencies'', given by\n$\\omega_\\theta=4/m\\theta$ and $\\omega_\\eta=\\eta/m$ (i.e., our spectrum depends\non three angular frequencies). Comparing our spectrum with other papers, we\nverified that it generalizes several particular cases in the literature.\nBesides, we also graphically analyze the behavior of the spectrum as a function\nof $B$, $\\mu$, $\\mu_5$, $k_z$, $\\theta$, and $\\eta$ for three different values\nof $n$ and $m_j$.",

The limitations of the model,\nparticularly a systematic overestimation and its dependence on series\ntruncation, are rigorously discussed.

We have carried out\na systematic search of gamma-ray emitting GRGs using sensitive low-resolution\nradio surveys, such as by Low Frequency Array, NRAO VLA Sky Survey, and Rapid\nASKAP Continuum Survey, and considering the fourth data release of the fourth\nFermi-Large Area Telescope gamma-ray source (4FGL-DR4) catalog.

Some of their observed parameters, e.g., core\ndominance, appeared to differ from that found for the non-gamma-ray detected\nGRG population, possibly due to the relatively small viewing angle of the\ngamma-ray emitting jet.

In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known\nOpen Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it\nto include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the\nmost general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation.\nRemarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is\ndissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at\nhigher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case.

    "abstract": "Ferrofluids are a class of materials that exhibit both fluid and magnetic\nproperties. We consider a two-phase diffuse interface model for the dynamics of\nferrofluids on a bounded domain. One phase is assumed to be magnetic, the other\nphase can be magnetic or non-magnetic. We derive a coupled system of partial\ndifferential equations consisting of the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations, an evolution equation for the magnetization, the magnetostatics\nequations for the magnetic field and the Cahn-Hilliard equations for the\nevolution of the phase field variable, which are all coupled through various\nsource terms and parameters. In contrast to similar models in the literature,\nthe system in this work formally satisfies an energy balance which remains\nmeaningful even in singular limits such as a limit of zero relaxation time.\nHowever, the formal derivation of this balance requires a delicate cancellation\nof several highly non-linear terms, making it challenging to ensure similar\ncancellations for approximating systems. Our first main result is to prove the\nexistence of global weak solutions for our ferrofluid system based on a\ncarefully constructed sequence of approximation steps. Additionally, we also\nstudy the relaxation towards the quasi-equilibrium, in which case the\nmagnetization equation degenerates to a linear relation between the magnetic\nfield and the magnetization. As our second main result, we prove the rigorous\nconvergence to this limiting system.",

Nine such sources were identified in JWST NIRCam imaging of a\nsingle galaxy at redshift z = 0.94 known as the \"Warhol arc,'' which is\nmirror-imaged by the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403. Here we present the\ndiscovery of two coincident and well-characterized microlensing events at the\nsame location followed by a third event observed in a single filter\napproximately 18 months later. The events can be explained by microlensing of a\nbinary star system consisting of a red supergiant (T ~ 4000 K) and a B-type (T\n> 13,000 K) companion star. The timescale of the coincident microlensing events\nconstrains the projected source-plane size to R < 270 AU. The most likely\nbinary configurations consistent with the observational constraints on the\ntemperatures and luminosities of each star are stars with initial masses M1 =\n22.5+7.1-5.5 Msun and an initial mass ratio very close to unity. A kinematic\nmodel that reproduces the observed light curve in all filters gives a\nrelatively small transverse velocity of ~50 km/s. This requires the dominant\nvelocity component of several hundreds of km/s to be roughly parallel to the\nmicrocaustic. An alternative possibility would be that the three microlensing\nevents correspond to unrelated stars crossing distinct microcaustics, but this\nwould imply a highly elevated rate of events at their common position, even\nthough no underlying knot is present at the location.",

We consider the natural possibility that\nthe radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading\nto the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the\ndark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the\nvariations of a scalar field $\\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra\ndimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\\phi$ is\nadequately captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form\n$V=V_0\\ {\\rm exp}(-c\\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\\rm DM}=m_0\\ {\\rm exp}(-c'\n\\phi)$ where the sign of $\\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\\geq 0$ while we have\ntwo choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands\nor shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with\nrecent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements (from DES,\nUnion3 or Pantheon+) and reproduces the same significance as CPL\nparametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for\nthe apparent phantom behavior ($w<-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a\nphysical model.

In\nparticular, the improved SimBIG WST analysis yields $\\Lambda$CDM constraints of\n$\\Omega_m = 0.32^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\\sigma_8 = 0.80^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, which\nare respectively $1.4\\times$ and $3.1\\times$ tighter than those from a standard\nperturbation-theory-based power spectrum analysis, confirming the significant\ninformation gain of WST summary statistics. The proposed method is easily\napplicable to other cosmological SBI contexts and represents a step toward more\nrobust SBI pipelines.",

    "abstract": "We present new methods to quantify the AGN population in terms of a\nmulti-dimensional luminosity function that describes the space density of\nsources as a function of both X-ray and radio luminosity. We compile a sample\nof 1891 radio and X-ray detected extragalactic sources from the Bo\\\"otes and\nCOSMOS fields. First, we investigate the X-ray--radio luminosity correlation in\nthe sample and find that an apparent correlation is introduced due to the\nsensitivity limits of the surveys; when considering individual redshift bins we\nfind a wide range of radio luminosities associated with a given X-ray\nluminosity, and vice versa, indicating little direct connection between the\nemission processes. We then measure the X-ray luminosity function, radio\nluminosity function and multi-dimensional X-ray--radio luminosity function\nacross redshift ($0<z<6$). We apply luminosity thresholds in X-ray and radio to\nrestrict our sample to those in the AGN-dominated regime and explore how the\nfraction of radio-selected AGN within the overall X-ray sample varies with\nincreasing X-ray luminosity (and vice versa). We find that towards the highest\nX-ray and radio luminosities the fraction of sources with both an X-ray and\nradio detection increases towards 100%, indicating that at the highest\nluminosities we are more likely to obtain a detection in both bands, though the\nsource will not necessarily be bright in both bands. Thus, the most luminous\naccretion events are more likely to be associated with the production of a jet,\ndespite the distinct physical structures that produce the emission and likely\npersist over very different timescales.",

    "abstract": "The fluid behavior of the solar wind is affected by the heat flux carried by\nthe suprathermal electron populations, especially the electron strahl (or beam)\nthat propagates along the magnetic field. In turn, the electron strahl cannot\nbe stable, and in the absence of collisions, its properties are regulated\nmainly by self-generated instabilities. This paper approaches the description\nof these heat-flux instabilities in a novel manner using regularized Kappa\ndistributions (RKDs) to characterize the electron strahl. RKDs conform to the\nvelocity distributions with suprathermal tails observed in situ, and at the\nsame time allow for consistent macromodeling, based on their singularity-free\nmoments. In contrast, the complexity of RKD models makes the analytical kinetic\nformalism complicated and still inaccessible, and therefore, here heat-flux\ninstabilities are resolved using the advanced solver ALPS. Two primary types of\ninstabilities emerge depending on plasma conditions: the whistler and firehose\nheat-flux instabilities. The solver is successfully tested for the first time\nfor such instabilities by comparison with previous results for standard\ndistributions, such as Maxwellian and Kappa. Moreover, the new RKD results show\nthat idealized Maxwellian models can overrate or underestimate the effects of\nthese instabilities, and also show differences from those obtained for the\nstandard Kappa, which, for instance, underestimate the firehose heat-flux\ngrowth rates.",

    "abstract": "Seismic structure inversions have been used to study the solar interior for\ndecades. With the high-precision frequencies obtained using data from the\nKepler mission, it has now become possible to study other solar-like\noscillators using structure inversions, including both main-sequence and\nsubgiant stars. Subgiant stars are particularly interesting because they\nexhibit modes of mixed acoustic-buoyancy nature, which provide the opportunity\nto probe the deeper region of stellar cores. This work examines whether the\nstructure inversion techniques developed for the pure acoustic modes of the Sun\nand other main-sequence stars are still valid for mixed modes observed in\nsubgiant stars. We construct two grids of models: one of main-sequence stars\nand one of early subgiant stars. Using these grids, we examine two different\nparts of the inversion procedure. First, we examine what we call the \"kernel\nerrors\", which measure how well the mode sensitivity functions can recover\nknown frequency differences between two models. Second, we test how these\nkernel errors affect the ability of an inversion to infer known structure\ndifferences. On the main sequence, we find that reliable structure inversion\nresults can be obtained across the entire range of masses and large frequency\nseparations we consider. On the subgiant branch, however, the rapid evolution\nof mixed modes leads to large kernel errors and hence difficulty recovering\nknown structure differences. Our tests show that using mixed modes to infer the\nstructure of subgiant stars reliably will require improvements to current\nfitting approaches and modifications to the structure inversion techniques.",

To account for\nthe accretion backreaction, we consider a near-horizon approximation, yielding\nfirst-order corrections of a Vaidya-dark energy form. We further propose a\nsystematic perturbative scheme to study these effects for an arbitrary\nbackground. As an application, we analyze an accreting Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nblack hole and demonstrate the horizon shifts that are produced. Finally, we\ncompute accretion-induced corrections to an extremal configuration. It is shown\nthat momentum influx and energy density produce distinct effects: the former\nforces the splitting of the extremal horizon, while the latter induces\nsignificant displacements in its position, computed up to first-order\nperturbative corrections. These results highlight how different components of\nthe stress-energy tensor significantly affect horizon geometry, with potential\nimplications for broader areas of research, including black-hole\nthermodynamics.",

By suitably deforming the light-cone\naction, we reduce the Poincar\\'e invariance to a Bargmann subgroup, from which\nboth magnetic and electric Carroll actions can be obtained in one lower\ndimension. Through a canonical analysis, we show that the second-class\nconstraints usually found in Lorentzian light-cone theories are absent for\nthese deformed Bargmann-invariant actions. We demonstrate the procedure for\ntheories with and without gauge symmetry. Notably, while the magnetic Carroll\nsector can be directly derived from the original Lorentzian action, the\ndeformation is essential to obtain the electric Carroll sector. We further\nargue that magnetic Carroll solutions in $d$ dimensions represent a consistent\ntruncation of the solutions of the $(d+1)$-dimensional Lorentzian parent\ntheory, providing an effective description of light-cone dynamics near a null\nhypersurface. For gauge theories, we also highlight the role of the light-cone\ngauge condition in deriving Carrollian theories.",

The dimmimg lasted $\\sim$8 months before returning to\nquiescence in late May 2025. The spectral energy distribution (SED) before the\nevent is that of a pre-main sequence or a modestly evolved F star with some\nwarm dust emission. The shape of the optical SED during the dim phase is\nunchanged and the optical and near-infrared spectra are those of an F star. The\nSED and the dilution of some of the F star infrared absorption features near\nminimum suggest the presence of a $\\sim$0.25$M_\\odot$ M dwarf binary companion.\nThe 43.8 year period proposed by Nair & Denisenko (2024) appears correct and is\nprobably half the precession period of a circumbinary disk. The optical eclipse\nis nearly achromatic, although slightly deeper in bluer filters, $\\Delta\n(g-z)=0.31\\pm0.15$ mag, and the $V$ band emission is polarized by up to 4%. The\nmaterials most able to produce such small optical color changes and a high\npolarization are big ($\\sim$20 $\\mu$m) carbonaceous or water ice grains.\nParticle distributions dominated by big grains are seen in protoplanetary\ndisks, Saturn-like ring systems and evolved debris disks. We also carry out a\nsurvey of occultation events, finding 46 additional systems, of which only 7\n(4) closely match $\\varepsilon$ Aurigae (KH 15D), the two archetypes of stars\nwith long and deep eclipses. The full sample is widely distributed in an\noptical color-magnitude diagram, but roughly half show a mid-IR excess.

We use deep (190-270 ks) Chandra observations to identify AGN\namong the protocluster members and perform X-ray spectral analysis to derive\nthe properties of those sources. We compare the AGN fraction and space density\nwith those observed in other known protoclusters and from the field\nenvironment. We find 11 X-ray detected AGN in the three protoclusters. Each\nstructure hosts a central, X-ray powerful (log$(L_{\\rm X}/{\\rm erg \\, s^{-1}})\n\\sim 45-46$), QSO, while the other X-ray sources are mostly moderately luminous\n(log$(L_{\\rm X}/{\\rm erg \\, s^{-1}}) \\sim 44$) and obscured Compton-Thin AGN.\nThe fraction of AGN in our targets is comparable with estimates for other\nprotoclusters, and significantly higher than what is found for low-redshift\nclusters. We also find a significant enhancement (2-4 dex) of AGN density with\nrespect to the field and to non active galaxies in the protoclusters. Finally,\nwe find no significant soft X-ray diffuse emissions from the nebulae, thus\nruling out gravitational heating as the main powering mechanism of the ELANe.",

While substantial progress\nhas been made in studying flavour physics in string compactifications over the\npast few decades, a concrete string construction that reproduces the full set\nof observed SM flavour parameters remains unknown. Here, we take a significant\nstep in this direction by identifying two explicit $E_8 \\times E_8$ heterotic\nstring models compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold with abelian, holomorphic,\nand poly-stable vector bundles with an (MS)SM spectrum.

Aside from its implications for planetary climate and astrobiology,\ndetecting surface water on terrestrial exoplanets would place important\nconstraints on our theories of planet formation and volatile delivery.\nRotational variability in the reflectance of an exoplanet may reveal surface\nfeatures rotating in and out of view, including oceans. Orbital changes in\nreflectance and polarization, meanwhile, are sensitive to the scattering phase\nfunction of the planetary surface, including specular reflection from large\nbodies of water. Although these techniques are applicable to all temperate\nterrestrial exoplanets, we focus in this document on the directly-imaged\nplanets that are more likely to drive the HWO coronagraph design.\nIdentification of water oceans relies on detecting a liquid, and using other\nlines of evidence to narrow that liquid down to being water. Liquids have\nsmoother surfaces than most solids, and hence exhibit specular reflection\ninstead of diffuse reflection. In practice, this makes lakes and oceans look\ndark from most illumination angles, but mirror-like at glancing angles.

In\naddition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that\nachieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,\nalong with a robust material painting module capable of transferring\nappearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe\nmisalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting.

    "abstract": "Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning\nvideo models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames\nindependently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and\nredundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce\nRefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing\ncomplex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and\ndecodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When\ndecoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of\nobjects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head\nmotion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains\nthe legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,\nUCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all\nevaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or\nhigher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using\nRefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only\noutperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,\nacross all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.",

However, without\nusing large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt\nto specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused\nby a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training\ndatasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited\ninformation about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In\nthis paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in\nspecialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we\nidentify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,\ni.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.\nTo address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple\nbootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,\nbounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more\nfaithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision\ntasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,\nreceipts, and reports.

However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still\nrely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation\ncosts, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level\ntendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that\nleverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on\nGoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback\ninto continuous preference scores.

Experiments on\nQwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate\nthat ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO.

Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small\nones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator\nagreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using\nLLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.\nImproving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:\nthe rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their\nfree-form responses with answer matching.

In accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN),\nradiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising wind-driving mechanism.\nHowever, the efficiency of line driving is extremely sensitive to the\nionization state of the flow, making it difficult to construct a reliable\nphysical picture of these winds. Recently, we presented the first\nradiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations for AWDs that incorporated detailed,\nmulti-dimensional ionization calculations via fully frequency-dependent\nradiative transfer, using the Sirocco code coupled to PLUTO. These simulations\nproduced much weaker line-driven winds (Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc < 1e-5 for our\nadopted parameters) than earlier studies using more approximate treatments of\nionization and radiative transfer (which yielded Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc ~ 1e-4).\nOne remaining limitation of our work was the assumption of an isothermal\noutflow. Here, we relax this by adopting an ideal gas equation of state and\nexplicitly solving for the multi-dimensional temperature structure of the flow.\nIn the AWD setting, accounting for the thermal state of the wind does not\nchange the overall conclusions drawn from the isothermal approximation. Our new\nsimulations confirm the line-driving efficiency problem: the predicted outflows\nare too highly ionized, meaning they neither create optimal driving conditions\nnor reproduce the observed ultraviolet wind signatures. Possible solutions\ninclude wind clumping on sub-grid scales, a softer-than-expected spectral\nenergy distribution, or additional driving mechanisms. With the physics now\nbuilt into our simulations, we are well-equipped to also explore line-driven\ndisc winds in AGN.",

Extracting metadata from regulations to\nelicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.\nHowever, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal\ntext. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting\nstructural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they\ndo not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes\nassociated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or\nheuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new\ndocuments.

Our representation is\ninstantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a\ndomain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal\nmetadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for\nlarge, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen\nlegislation.

Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric\njailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in\nconstructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context.

We build general tools to\nprove lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of replicable testers,\nunifying and quantitatively improving upon existing results.\n  We identify a set of canonical properties, and prove that any replicable\ntesting algorithm can be modified to satisfy these properties without worsening\naccuracy or sample complexity. A canonical replicable algorithm computes a\ndeterministic function of its input (i.e., a test statistic) and thresholds\nagainst a uniformly random value in $[0,1]$. It is invariant to the order in\nwhich the samples are received, and, if the testing problem is ``symmetric,''\nthen the algorithm is also invariant to the labeling of the domain elements,\nresolving an open question by Liu and Ye [NeurIPS'24]. We prove new lower\nbounds for uniformity, identity, and closeness testing by reducing to the case\nwhere the replicable algorithm satisfies these canonical properties.\n  We systematize and improve upon a common strategy for replicable algorithm\ndesign based on test statistics with known expectation and bounded variance.\nOur framework allow testers which have been extensively analyzed in the\nnon-replicable setting to be made replicable with minimal overhead.

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the\nexternal reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,\nenabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration\nstagnation.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model\noutputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement\nthis by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.\nHowever, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce\npositive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows\n(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems\nwhere it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in\nearly-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive\nsamples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such\nsettings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current\noutput distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good\npositive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a\nnatural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.\nInstead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they\nshould (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's\nlikelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we\npropose $\\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and\nmodular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the\nground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to\nproduce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written\nCoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.\nExperiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final\nperformance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based\nmethods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially\nstruggles the most.",

Despite proliferating\nresearch, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled\nsamples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,\nand suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on\nmulti-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,\nstatistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,\nthereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class\nimbalance.

A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to\nimprove the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive\nmulti-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic\nadjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization.

We\nconsider two main scenarios: one where PBHs evaporate completely before big\nbang nucleosynthesis, and another where PBHs persist until today. In the case\nof evaporation, we analyse the emission of dark matter (DM) and dark radiation\n(DR) during the process of evaporation. Conversely, in the other case, the\nsurviving PBHs themselves can contribute as DM. We further investigate how\nrelativistic and non-relativistic accretion, together with memory burdened\nevaporation, impact the parameter space of the emitted DM, the abundance of\nstable PBHs as DM, and the contribution of DR to the effective number of\nrelativistic degrees of freedom, $\\Delta N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.",

To address this, we introduce\na semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically\nGPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR\nformat while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method\nto the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering\nalgorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in\nmapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial\nbenchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o\noutperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within\nthe prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but\nrefinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis\nrevealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in\ngranularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study\ndemonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of\nclinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated\ninteroperability workflows.

In this work,\nwe first study whether traditionally learned HRTF representations are well\ncorrelated with perceptual relations using auditory-based objective perceptual\nmetrics; we then propose a method for explicitly embedding HRTFs into a\nperception-informed latent space, leveraging a metric-based loss function and\nsupervision via Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MMDS).

Rather than inferring latent causes solely from\nsensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on\nabstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle\nof forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation\nintegrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,\nenforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and\nrecognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the\nframework of the \\emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which\nposits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with\nhigh-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,\nsupports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial\ncompositional imagination.

As we aim to build larger telescopes - extending\ntens of meters - designs in which the main mirror is based on liquid deployment\nin space are emerging as promising candidates. However, alongside their\nenormous potential advantages, liquid-based surfaces present new challenges in\nmaterial science, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. One of the fundamental\nquestions is whether it is possible for such surfaces to maintain their precise\noptical shape over long durations, and in particular under the forces induced\nby the telescope's accelerations. In this paper, we present a model and a\nclosed-form analytical solution for the non-self-adjoint problem of the\ndynamics of a thin liquid film pinned within a finite circular domain. We use\nthe 50-meter Fluidic Telescope (FLUTE) concept as the case study, and examine\nthe liquid dynamics of the telescope under both slewing actuation and\nrelaxation regimes, elucidating the role of geometrical parameters and liquid\nproperties. The solutions reveal a maneuvering 'budget' wherein the degradation\nof the mirror surface is directly linked to the choice of maneuvers and their\nsequence. By simulating ten years of typical operation, we show that, while the\nmaximal deformation might reach several microns, the spatial distribution of\nthe deformation and their propagation rate allows the telescope to maintain its\noptical functionality for years, with at least a substantial portion of the\naperture remaining suitable for astronomical observations.

The optical/NIR\nand GeV afterglow light curves be described by the standard external shock\nmodel, with early-time emission dominated by a reverse shock (RS) and a\nsubsequent transition to forward shock (FS) emission.

However, enabling\nsuch collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact\nwith host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases,\nfine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure\ninteractions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for\nnon-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically\nconfigure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules.\nAdditionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.\n  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and\nseamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs\na Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level\nintents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless\ndevice collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for\nauthorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing\nhardware-independent abstractions.\n  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto\nconfiguration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in\nlarge-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation\npipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100%\naccuracy. At runtime, our evaluation shows that our system configures new\ndevices in ~150 ms, and our proxy-based data plane incurs network overheads of\nup to 2 ms and access control overheads up to 0.3 ms.",

Creating such detailed face avatars from\nvideos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and\nvirtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static\nfaces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny\nvalley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face\nthrough a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static\nfaces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,\ncomplex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on\npredicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D\nGaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,\nsplatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires\ninverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by\nreparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.\nThis trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians\ninto the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar.

Our evaluation\naddresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning\ncapabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models\nfine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT\nprompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak\nattacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms\nemployed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning\ncapabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,\nwhether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more\nvulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,\nsuggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype\nreinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those\nrelying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing\nattacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped\ninstructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently\nimproves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to\nreasoning design.",

The\nSegment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a\npromptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires\nmanual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to\nprocess a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates\nthe task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small\nset of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,\nas learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a\nreference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic\ngeneration of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and\ninstantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)\nmemory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware\nfeature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation\nmetrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP),\nPASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free\napproaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).",

However, its microscopic details remain\nobscure, as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range,\nto excitons, living in the \\mbox{$\\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative.\nHere, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which\ntime-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions (TDNEF) for electrons driven by\nfsLP are coupled self-consistently to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG)\nequation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs)\nwithin 2D AF semiconductors. This theory explains how fsLP, of central\nfrequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that\nsubsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a {\\em\nnonequilibrium spintronic mechanism}. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by\nwindowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) decodes frequencies of excited magnons,\nas well as their lifetime governed by {\\em nonlocal} damping with the LLG\nequation due to, explicitly included via TDNEGF, electronic bath. The TDNEGF\npart of the loop is also used to include excitons via mean-field treatment,\nutilizing off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, of Coulomb interaction\nbinding conduction-band electrons and valence-band holes. Finally, our theory\npredicts how excited magnons will {\\em pump} time-dependent charge currents\ninto the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor that will then\nemit electromagnetic radiation.

While controlling\nthe error in the unitary evolution or the wavefunction typically requires the\ntime step size to shrink as the semiclassical parameter $h$ decreases, it has\nbeen observed -- and proved for first- and second-order Trotterization schemes\n-- that the error in certain classes of observables admits a time step size\nindependent of $h$. In this work, we explicitly characterize this class of\nobservables and present a new, simple algebraic proof of uniform-in-$h$ error\nbounds for arbitrarily high-order Trotterization schemes. Our proof relies\nsolely on the algebraic structure of the underlying operators in both the\ncontinuous and discrete settings.

In this work, we\nprovide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the\nunexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length\ngeneralize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of\nthe distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained\nif the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate\nsimple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states\nthat the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian\nnoise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500\npost-training steps ($\\sim 0.1\\%$ of the pre-training budget), these\ninterventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of\nmagnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\\longrightarrow 128k$) and\nshow improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and\nefficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent\nmodels.",

Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in\npost-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which\nare inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents\nof damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a\nnovel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation\nproblem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected\nareas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity\ndataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged\nstructures, and debris.

Our model accounts\nfor the effects of mass transfer on the stars' mass loss rates, their radiation\nspectra, and the timing of core-collapse supernovae. It also injects mass lost\nthrough non-conservative mass transfer and common envelope ejection into the\ninterstellar medium. We demonstrate the use of our feedback model through\nsimulations of isolated binaries in a gaseous medium, and of embedded clusters\nof massive binaries. Feedback from interacting binaries efficiently couples\nwith the surrounding interstellar medium. It increases the size of HII regions,\nincreases the kinetic and thermal energy of the gas, and increases the pressure\nwithin HII regions compared to models that use single star stellar evolution.\nThose differences arise from the ionizing radiation, which increases by three\norders of magnitude, resulting in HII regions that expand due to thermal\npressure rather than radiation pressure. The effects of stellar dynamics and\nthe gravitational potential of the background gas cause the evolution of\nindividual binaries to deviate from the predictions made by secular evolution,\nimpacting the subsequent feedback from the binary. We conclude that massive\ninteracting binaries are an important source of feedback in cluster-forming\nregions, and must be considered when studying the emerging timescales of young\nstar clusters.",

The search\nfor sources of neutral particles offers distinct advantages over searching for\nsources of charged particles, as the former traverse cosmic distances\nundeflected by magnetic fields. While no cosmic-ray photons exceeding $10^{17}$\neV have been definitively detected, identifying the clustering of events in\ncosmic-ray data would provide compelling evidence for their existence. We\ncompare two analysis methods for detecting direction-time clustering in UHE\nextensive air showers: an approach that examines multiplets, and the stacking\nmethod, which analyzes sets of doublets that are not necessarily consecutive,\nthus making it sensitive to multiple flares. Both techniques combine\ntime-clustering algorithms with unbinned likelihood study. Background events\n(initiated by hadrons) can be more efficiently distinguished from\nphoton-induced events (signals) by using a photon tag that employs probability\ndistribution functions to classify each event as more likely to be initiated by\neither a photon or a hadron. We demonstrate that these methods can effectively\ndistinguish between events initiated by photons and those initiated by hadrons\n(background), and can accurately reproduce both the number of photon events\nwithin flares and their duration. We calculate the discovery potentials, i.e.,\nthe number of events required to identify a photon flare.

For end users, transitioning to GPU-CC mode is seamless, requiring no\nmodifications to existing AI applications. However, this ease of adoption\ncontrasts sharply with the complexity of the underlying proprietary systems.\nThe lack of transparency presents significant challenges for security\nresearchers seeking a deeper understanding of GPU-CC's architecture and\noperational mechanisms.\n  The challenges of analyzing the NVIDIA GPU-CC system arise from a scarcity of\ndetailed specifications, the proprietary nature of the ecosystem, and the\ncomplexity of product design. In this paper, we aim to demystify the\nimplementation of NVIDIA GPU-CC system by piecing together the fragmented and\nincomplete information disclosed from various sources. Our investigation begins\nwith a high-level discussion of the threat model and security principles before\ndelving into the low-level details of each system component. We instrument the\nGPU kernel module -- the only open-source component of the system -- and\nconduct a series of experiments to identify the security weaknesses and\npotential exploits. For certain components that are out of reach through\nexperiments, we propose well-reasoned speculations about their inner working\nmechanisms. We have responsibly reported all security findings presented in\nthis paper to the NVIDIA PSIRT Team.",

    "abstract": "We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model\n(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,\nwithout requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs\ntypically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by\ntraining on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction\ndatasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic\nforgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we\nrevisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated\ncross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own\ntraining targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency\nwhile establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot\ngeneralization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct\nDeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training\nsamples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,\nincluding speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves\nstate-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of\naudio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,\nSpeech-IFEval, and VoiceBench.

This study presents a numerical methodology for\nmodeling thixotropic multiphase fluids, emphasizing the transient behavior of\nviscosity and the intricate interactions between phases. The model incorporates\nphase-dependent viscosities, interfacial tension effects, and the dynamics of\nphase separation, coalescence, and break-up, making it suitable for simulating\nsystems with complex flow regimes. A key feature of the methodology is its\nability to capture thixotropic behavior, where viscosity evolves over time due\nto microstructural changes induced by shear history. This approach enables the\nsimulation of aging and recovery processes in materials such as gels,\nemulsions, and biological tissues. The model is rigorously validated against\nbenchmark cases, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting multiphase systems\nunder static and dynamic conditions. Subsequently, the methodology is applied\nto investigate systems with varying levels of microstructural evolution,\nrevealing the impact of thixotropic dynamics on overall system behavior.

This work introduces a Binary\nField-Driven Meta-Routing Method supported by a semi-analytical framework that\nmodels the tunable interaction between THz plasmonic phenomena and graphene's\nelectromagnetic properties. By modulating graphene's impedance, the method\nenables dynamic coupling and routing of localized surface plasmon resonances\n(LSPRs) across a meta-network, facilitating real-time beam steering in\nchip-scale systems. Combining analytical conductivity models, coupled-mode\ntheory, and algorithmic control, the approach enables predictive configuration\nof LSPR-based steering in reconfigurable graphene metasurfaces.

RAG provides factual\ncontext but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be\ninefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm\nfocused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed\nin natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol\n(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented\ninformation to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational\nstrategies, and methodological principles.

Researchers have formalized various types of group\ninteractions, such as public goods games, biological contagion, and information\nbroadcasting, showing how higher-order networks can capture group effects more\ndirectly than pairwise models. However, equating hyperedges-edges involving\nmore than two agents-with groups can be misleading, as it obscures the\npolysemous nature of ``group interactions''. For instance, many models of\nhigher-order interactions focus on the internal state of the hyperedge,\nspecifying dynamical rules at the group level. These models often neglect how\ninteractions with external groups can influence behaviors and dynamics within\nthe group. Yet, anthropologists and philosophers remind us that external norms,\nfactors, and forces governing intergroup behavior are essential to defining\nwithin-group dynamics. In this paper, we synthesize concepts from social\nontology relevant to the emerging physics of higher-order networks. We propose\na typology for classifying models of group interactions based on two\nperspectives. The first focuses on individuals within groups engaging in\ncollective action, where shared agency serves as the binding force. The second\nadopts a group-first approach, emphasizing institutional facts that extend\nbeyond the specific individuals involved. Building on these perspectives, we\nintroduce four dimensions to classify models of group interactions:\npersistence, coupling, reducibility, and alignment. For the physics of\nhigher-order networks, we provide a hierarchy of nested mathematical models to\nexplore the complex properties of social groups. We highlight social\ninteractions not yet explored in the literature on higher-order networks and\npropose future research avenues to foster collaboration between social ontology\nand the physics of complex systems.",

    "abstract": "Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic\nenvironment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,\nseparation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a\nlinear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their\nlocation, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of\nwhich, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario\n(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).\nHowever, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,\nwhile making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to\nerrors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and\ncomputational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop\ntechniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives\nrise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a\nsmall computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,\nhearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this\neffect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where\nthe tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate\nfor local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to\ncorrect the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the\nlocalization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent\nauditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,\nwithout a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.\nThe complete proposed MASA system is provided as a publicly available framework\nthat uses open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and\ninter-agent communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.",

Using a dynamical-system approach, we classify\nthe various de-Sitter like (inflationary) vacua from the point of view of their\nstability, which depend on the values of the model parameters.

Part of the parameter space of the systems under consideration\nincludes the running-vacuum (approximately) linear-axion monodromy potentials,\nconsidered in previous works by some of the authors, where inflation is induced\nby primordial gravitational-wave condensates. A particularly interesting case,\ncorresponding to another part of the parameter space of the models, includes a\nseries of stable de-Sitter vacua, which physically may correspond to a series\nof successive tunnelings of the system, via say non-perturbative effects, with\na decreasing effective cosmological constant.

    "abstract": "A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the\ncomplex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are\ngoverned (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of\nauditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has\nalso been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.\nThe current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two\nvowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different\nimitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The\ncurrent study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of\nJPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is\nestimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has\nimplications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the\npossible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower\nbound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and\nhence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of\npossible vowel phonemes.",

To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on\nbounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.\nVision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation\nperformance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt\nlearning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and\nautomating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention.

Traditional\nmechanistic models demand extensive domain expertise, while many data-driven\napproaches often lack interpretability and fail to enforce physical\nconsistency.

This representation\nallows to efficiently count the number of nodes reached by a given string\npattern. To analyze the space complexity of the above trie index, we propose a\nproof for the combinatorial problem of counting the number of tries with a\ngiven symbol distribution. We use this formula to define a worst-case entropy\nmeasure for tries, as well as a notion of k-th order empirical entropy. In\nparticular, we show that the relationships between these two entropy measures\nare similar to those between the corresponding well-known measures for strings.\nWe use these measures to prove that the XBWT of a trie can be encoded within a\nspace bounded by our k-th order empirical entropy plus a o(n) term, with n\nbeing the number of nodes in the trie. Notably, as happens for strings, this\nspace bound can be reached for every sufficiently small k simultaneously.\nFinally, we compare the space complexity of the above index with that of the\nr-index for tries proposed by Prezza [SODA '21] and we prove that in some cases\nthe FM-index for tries is asymptotically smaller.",

The key insight is that LDP perturbation is\nconcentrated around the original data with a specific probability, transforming\nutility analysis of the classifier into its robustness analysis in this\nconcentrated region. Our framework connects the concentration analysis of LDP\nmechanisms with the robustness analysis of classifiers. It treats LDP\nmechanisms as general distributional functions and classifiers as black-box\nfunctions, thus applicable to any LDP mechanism and classifier. A direct\napplication of our utility quantification is guiding the selection of LDP\nmechanisms and privacy parameters for a given classifier. Notably, our analysis\nshows that a piecewise-based mechanism leads to better utility compared to\nalternatives in common scenarios.\n  Using this framework alongside two novel refinement techniques, we conduct\ncase studies on utility quantification for typical mechanism-classifier\ncombinations.

However,\ngenerating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains\nchallenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.\nTo address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning\napproach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.\nSpecifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective\nderived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives\nfor hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we\nderive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the\nMinimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware\noptimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed\nmethod can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local\ndetails while maintaining overall quality.

Moreover, it is\ndifficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint\ncontrols solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent\nlimitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.\nFirst, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying\ncontrollable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and\nkeypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as\nclass, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the\nlimitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and\nclasses due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we\npropose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed\nfor keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K\nimages with 2.9M instances.

We have obtained high-resolution CRIRES+\nK-band spectra of these brown dwarfs, which we analyzed with an atmospheric\nretrieval pipeline. Atmospheric models were generated with the radiative\ntransfer code petitRADTRANS, for which we employed a free and equilibrium\nchemistry approach, which we coupled with the PyMultiNest sampling algorithm to\ndetermine the best fit.

In the weighted variant, the\nedits have associated costs (depending on the involved node labels) normalized\nso that each cost is at least one, and the goal is to minimize the total cost\nof edits.\n  The unweighted tree edit distance between two trees of total size $n$ can be\ncomputed in $O(n^{2.6857})$ time; in contrast, determining the weighted tree\nedit distance is fine-grained equivalent to the All-Pairs Shortest Paths\nproblem and requires $n^3/2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$ time [Nogler et al.;\nSTOC'25].

    "abstract": "The increasing capabilities of LLMs have led to the rapid proliferation of\nLLM agent apps, where developers enhance LLMs with access to external resources\nto support complex task execution. Among these, LLM email agent apps represent\none of the widely used categories, as email remains a critical communication\nmedium for users. LLM email agents are capable of managing and responding to\nemail using LLM-driven reasoning and autonomously executing user instructions\nvia external email APIs (e.g., send email). However, despite their growing\ndeployment and utility, the security mechanism of LLM email agent apps remains\nunderexplored. Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential\nsecurity risk within these agent apps and their broader implications.\n  In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of\nLLM email agents. We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which\noverrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources,\nallowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further\nperform specific attack scenarios without user awareness.\n  To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to\nevaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps. By EAHawk, we performed an\nempirical study spanning 14 representative LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps,\n12 LLMs, and 20 email services, which led to the generation of 1,404 real-world\nemail agent instances for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that all\n1,404 instances were successfully hijacked; on average, only 2.03 attack\nattempts are required to control an email agent instance. Even worse, for some\nLLMs, the average number of attempts needed to achieve full agent control drops\nto as few as 1.23.",

While recent research has\napplied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain\nsingle-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply\nchains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three\nMARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,\nwithin a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and\na LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve\nnear-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability\n(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL\nagents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest\nvolatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced\napproach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while\nmaintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These\nfindings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured\nby static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.",

We attribute\nthis issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.\nTo address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework\nthat decouples motion information from appearance information.

To further achieve\nprecise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we\ndesign a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source\nidentity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial\nregions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization\nmetrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping\nmethods.

This framework utilizes natural language prompts\ndescribing the given optimization problems along with past solutions generated\nby LLMs themselves.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian\ncomputational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging\nDMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly\nflexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which\nachieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through\nsupervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that\nintegrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior\ninto a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation\nof our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm\n- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et\nal., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to\na Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and\ndistilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state\nof the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,\nwhile retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at\ninference time.",

Because of the Chern-Simons interaction, one polarization of the\ngauge field experiences the tachyonic growth during the first slow-roll stage,\ninducing large corrections in curvature perturbations via the inverse decay\neffect. A non-trivial feature of our setup is that once the system enters the\nUSR phase, the instability parameter falls off rapidly, terminating the gauge\nfield production efficiently. Consequently, the power spectrum involves two\nseparate peaks, the first peak is induced by the gauge field particles\nproduction while the second peak is due to standard USR mechanism. We show that\nthe power spectrum at the intermediate scales develops strong scale-dependence\n$\\propto k^m$ with the index $m >4$.

The emergence of special\npoints in the Mass-Radius plot is a significant outcome for neutron stars which\nis more commonly seen in case of hybrid stars.

To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs\nare primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)\nlike humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all\nreasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:\nCan we explicitly bootstrap such ability to alleviate overthinking in LRMs? In\nthis paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage fine-tuning\nstrategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and redundancy\ncognition of LRMs. Specifically, we first inject difficulty hypnosis into\noutput prefixes to guide the model toward adaptive reasoning depth, trained on\na hybrid dataset mixing short and long reasoning paths. Then, we incorporate\nredundancy hypnosis, which supervises the intermediate reasoning steps to\nidentify and eliminate unnecessary reasoning patterns. Experiments on\n7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that TH2T significantly reduces inference costs\nby over 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks while maintaining performance\nstability.

We show that this offline variant is complete\nfor the second-level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e., $\\Sigma_2^p$-complete,\nand cannot be approximated within a non-trivial factor unless $\\Sigma_2^p =\n\\Delta_2^p$. Motivated by these strong hardness results, we consider a\nresource-augmented variant of the problem where the requirements on the query\nset computed by an algorithm are less strict than the requirements on the\noptimal solution we compare against. More precisely, a query set computed by\nthe algorithm must reveal sufficient information to identify an approximate\nknapsack solution, while the optimal query set we compare against has to reveal\nsufficient information to identify an optimal solution. We show that this\nresource-augmented setting allows interesting non-trivial algorithmic results.",

Two competing scenarios are that they formed either\nwith rocky interiors and H2-He atmospheres (`gas-dwarfs'), or instead with bulk\ncompositions dominated by H2O phases (`water-worlds'). Observations of L 98-59\nd have revealed its unusually low density and spectral characteristics, opening\na window for disentangling its origin. We constrain the possible range of\nevolutionary histories linking L 98-59 d's birth conditions to these\nobservations, using a coupled atmosphere-interior modelling framework.\nObservations are explained by a chemically-reducing mantle and early\nsubstantial (>1.8 mass%) sulfur and hydrogen content, inconsistent with both\nthe gas-dwarf and water-world origin scenarios. Observed spectral features are\nexplained by in-situ photochemical production of SO2 in an H2 background. L\n98-59 d's interior comprises a permanent magma ocean, allowing long-term\nretention of volatiles within its interior over billions of years, consistent\nwith surveyed Kepler Survey trends. Modelling of the `cosmic shoreline'\nsuggests that early volatile-metal budget is a determinant of atmospheric\nretention - here, we explicitly show that large initial budgets can explain\nJWST observations of some super-Earth planets (including DDT targets).

The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen\nduring cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during\nthis critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking\nradiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and\nionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the\n21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as\na powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we\nsystematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array\n(SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum.\nAssuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach\nsensitivities of $\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle \\leq 10^{-28}\\,{\\rm cm}^{3}\\,{\\rm\ns}^{-1}$ and $\\tau\\geq 10^{28}\\,{\\rm seconds}$, for $10\\,{\\rm GeV}$ DM\nparticles.

These results indicate that the SKA\ncould place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation\nthat are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits.\nFurthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to\nprobe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\\,{\\rm g}$, which\nare otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes.

By combining analysis of interatomic force constants and of\nphonon eigenvectors composition, we conclude that higher doping concentrations\nprovide a larger enhancement to glucose's Raman signal, while the molecule\norientation relative to the surface plays a fundamental role in the Raman\nresponse. We suggest that high concentration B-graphene presents itself as a\npotential substrate for SERS based detection of glucose, while the used\nphonon-based analysis can be promptly applied for the search of promising\ncandidates as substrate materials for enhanced Raman response.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel pinching-antenna assisted index modulation (PA-IM)\nscheme is proposed for improving the spectral efficiency without increasing the\nhardware complexity, where the information bits are conveyed not only by the\nconventional M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols but also by\nthe indices of pinching antenna (PA) position patterns. To realize the full\npotential of this scheme, this paper focuses on the comprehensive transceiver\ndesign, addressing key challenges in signal detection at the receiver and\nperformance optimization at thetransmitter. First, a comprehensive channel\nmodel is formulated for this architecture, which sophisticatedly integrates the\ndeterministic in-waveguide propagation effects with the stochastic nature of\nwireless channels, including both largescale path loss and small-scale fading.\nNext, to overcome the prohibitive complexity of optimal maximum likelihood (ML)\ndetection, a low-complexity box-optimized sphere decoding (BOSD) algorithm is\ndesigned, which adaptively prunes the search space whilst preserving optimal ML\nperformance. Furthermore, an analytical upper bound on the bit error rate (BER)\nis derived and validated by the simulations. Moreover, a new transmit precoding\nmethod is designed using manifold optimization, which minimizes the BER by\njointly optimizing the complex-valued precoding coefficients across the\nwaveguides for the sake of maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance of all\nreceived signal points. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed PA-IM scheme attains a significant performance gain over its\nconventional counterparts and that the overall BER of the pinching-antenna\nsystem is substantially improved by the proposed precoding design.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive\nhigher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,\nsolve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is\na generative mechanism that creates \\emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem\ninstances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \\emph{soft constraints}\nand unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables\nthe framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby\nfreeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely\non human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and\nseeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner\niteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,\nregularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and\nconstraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy\ncorresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at\nlower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By\ninterpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \\emph{functors} that generate\nand condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional\nstructure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively\ngeneralised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing\nmeta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and\ncompared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design\nprinciples for structuring meta-learning.

A\nvery weak anti-correlation between the equatorial rotation rate and solar\nactivity is also observed. Our findings reaffirm the potential of radio\nobservations to probe the dynamics of the solar chromosphere with reduced\nheight ambiguity. The overlap of the equatorial rotation rate found in this\nstudy with that for $304$ {\\AA} in the EUV regime lends additional support to\nthe view that the equatorial rotation rates increase with height above the\nphotosphere.

Using panel data comprising 5,400 firm-year\nobservations from 2019 to 2023, sourced from CNRDS and CSMAR databases, we\nemploy fixed-effects regression models to investigate this relationship. Our\nfindings reveal that human-AI technology integration significantly enhances\ngreen ESG performance, with green technology innovation serving as a crucial\nmediating pathway. The results demonstrate that a one standard-deviation\nincrease in human-AI integration leads to a 12.7% improvement in green ESG\nscores. The mediation analysis confirms that approximately 35% of this effect\noperates through enhanced green technology innovation capabilities.\nHeterogeneity analysis reveals stronger effects among larger firms, state-owned\nenterprises, and companies in developed regions.

    "abstract": "Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological\nstudies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The\nreliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR\ndata. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including\nmisrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they\nare primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality\nassessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess\ndata fitness for research.\n  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit\ntesting and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data\nquality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking\nTool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test\ngenerator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a\ntest suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework\nthat executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and\nSyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These\ntests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We\npresent a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of\nreference grounding and value accuracy.\n  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable\ncontext-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to\nimprove the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges\nfrom a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further\ndevelopment such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.",

However, in the realm of\nvideo recommendation, existing studies predominantly resort to prompt-based\nsimulation using frozen LLMs and encounter the intricate challenge of\nmultimodal content understanding. This frequently results in suboptimal item\nmodeling and user preference learning, thereby ultimately constraining\nrecommendation performance. To address these challenges, we introduce\nVRAgent-R1, a novel agent-based paradigm that incorporates human-like\nintelligence in user simulation. Specifically, VRAgent-R1 comprises two\ndistinct agents: the Item Perception (IP) Agent and the User Simulation (US)\nAgent, designed for interactive user-item modeling. Firstly, the IP Agent\nemulates human-like progressive thinking based on MLLMs, effectively capturing\nhidden recommendation semantics in videos. With a more comprehensive multimodal\ncontent understanding provided by the IP Agent, the video recommendation system\nis equipped to provide higher-quality candidate items. Subsequently, the US\nAgent refines the recommended video sets based on in-depth chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning and achieves better alignment with real user preferences\nthrough reinforcement learning. Experimental results on a large-scale video\nrecommendation benchmark have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed\nVRAgent-R1 method, e.g., the IP Agent achieves a 6.0\\% improvement in NDCG@10\non the MicroLens-100k dataset, while the US Agent shows approximately 45.0\\%\nhigher accuracy in user decision simulation compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines.",

Remarkably, all\nproperties of this state may be computed analytically by combinatorial means,\nand also derived from an exactly solvable correlated hopping Hamiltonian.\nFurthermore, this Coupled Cluster state can be re-expressed as a low-rank\nMatrix Product State (MPS) with bond dimension exactly four.

Previous studies have two\nlimitations: either employing an incorrect formula for self-gravity potential\nin analytical treatments, or introducing additional input parameters in\nnumerical implementations to circumvent solving the full TPBVP. To address\nthese issues, we present a self-consistent TPBVP formulation, solved using the\nrelaxation method. We also derive approximate analytical formulae that enable\nrapid estimates of self-gravity effects. Our analysis identifies a\ndimensionless parameter $\\beta \\equiv 2G \\bar{\\rho}\nr_\\mathrm{out}^2/a_\\mathrm{out}^2$ that characterizes the strength of\nself-gravity, where $\\bar{\\rho}$ and $r_\\mathrm{out}$ are the mean density and\nouter radius of the flow, respectively, and $a_\\mathrm{out}$ is the adiabatic\nsound speed of the external medium. For practical estimation, $\\bar{\\rho}$ may\nbe approximated by the external medium density $\\rho_\\mathrm{out}$. We identify\nan upper limit for $\\beta$, beyond which steady accretion becomes unsustainable\n-- a behavior consistent with classical gravitational instability that previous\nstudies failed to capture.

Instead, the key driver appears to be the competition between CEF\nanisotropy and exchange interaction anisotropy. A direct comparison of CeCuSi\nand CeAgSb$_2$ further indicates that antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions\nalong the CEF easy-axis can be crucial in stabilizing the hard-axis FM ordering\nobserved in CeAgSb$_2$. Finally, our results suggest that an anisotropic\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) model could offer deeper insights into the\ncomplicated magnetic properties of Ce-based and other heavy-fermion systems.",

The framework\ndeveloped herein demonstrates that consciousness exists as a continuous,\nnon-monotonic function across a high-dimensional neurochemical space, with\ndopamine serving as the primary intensity regulator and serotonin (5-HT2A) as\nthe complexity modulator. This work offers mechanistic explanations for the\nfull spectrum of conscious states, from deep sleep and psychosis to the\nultimate collapse in neural death. The theory explains paradoxical phenomena\nsuch as prefrontal cortex hypoactivity during seizures, the evolutionary\npersistence of psychosis-prone individuals, and why controlled administration\nof classical 5-HT2A agonists shows a comparatively low incidence of serious\nmedical events (< 0.01 % in modern clinical trials), while dopaminergic excess\nproves rapidly lethal. The framework is tested using 70,290 sleep nights from\n242 Parkinson's disease patients, using disease severity (UPDRS) as a proxy for\nsystem integrity and medication (LEDD) as a proxy for dopaminergic input. The\nanalysis reveals a significant LEDD x UPDRS interaction (beta=-1.7, p<.0001),\nconfirming the model's prediction of state-dependent, non-linear dynamics.",

The continuous advancement of\nattack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms\nthat can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of\nML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on\nimplementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and\nethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack\nscenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective\nmethods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper\npresents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and\ncorresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,\nrepresenting various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,\nspoofing, suspension, and replay attacks.

    "abstract": "Articulated object manipulation remains a critical challenge in robotics due\nto the complex kinematic constraints and the limited physical reasoning of\nexisting methods. In this work, we introduce ArtGS, a novel framework that\nextends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by integrating visual-physical modeling\nfor articulated object understanding and interaction. ArtGS begins with\nmulti-view RGB-D reconstruction, followed by reasoning with a vision-language\nmodel (VLM) to extract semantic and structural information, particularly the\narticulated bones. Through dynamic, differentiable 3DGS-based rendering, ArtGS\noptimizes the parameters of the articulated bones, ensuring physically\nconsistent motion constraints and enhancing the manipulation policy. By\nleveraging dynamic Gaussian splatting, cross-embodiment adaptability, and\nclosed-loop optimization, ArtGS establishes a new framework for efficient,\nscalable, and generalizable articulated object modeling and manipulation.\nExperiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments\ndemonstrate that ArtGS significantly outperforms previous methods in joint\nestimation accuracy and manipulation success rates across a variety of\narticulated objects.

We investigated\nwhether frequency separation ratios, which are commonly used to efficiently\nsuppress surface effects, are also able to suppress magnetic activity effects.\nBased on GOLF and BiSON observations of the Sun-as-a-star, we performed\nasteroseismic characterisations using frequency separation ratios as\nconstraints to measure the apparent temporal evolution of the stellar\nparameters and their correlation with the 10.7 cm radio flux. Frequency\nseparation ratios do not suppress the effects of magnetic activity. Both\n$r_{01}$ and $r_{02}$ ratios exhibit a clear signature of the magnetic activity\ncycle.

    "abstract": "Building on work by H.L.Resnikoff we consider (Resnikoff) silver numbers,\nwhich generalize the familiar golden number. By definition, a silver number is\nthe largest positive root of a certain polynomial called silver polynomial. In\nturn, a corresponding companion matrix of a silver polynomial gives rise to a\nwell known construction of inflationary tilings of the (non-negative) real\nhalf-line, via an iteration of inflation and substitution. Resnikoff noted for\nthe golden number $\\phi$ that this tiling corresponds to the set of what he\ncalled $\\phi$-integers. We generalize this result for a special class of silver\nnumbers, the distinguished silver numbers, by showing that the integers for a\ndistinguished silver number give rise to a tiling, of which we provide a\nprecise description. For the general problem, whether the integers for an\narbitrary silver number give rise to a tiling, we cannot give a general answer,\nbut we show that tilings are obtained if and only if the differences of silver\nintegers satisfy a (rather weak looking) non-accumulation condition. If tilings\nof this type exist for certain (necessarily non-distinguished) silver numbers,\nthey would seem to form a class of inflationary tilings that differs from those\nobtained by inflation and substitution. In an Appendix we recall necessary\nnotions and -- mostly known -- results, including the inflation-substitution\nconstruction principle for (one dimensional) inflationary tilings, in an\nelementary manner. For the readers' convenience we also collect the pertinent\nfacts about non-negative matrices, thus the construction is accessible with\nonly basic prerequisites from linear algebra and analysis. Finally, in our\nsetting we give a detailed proof of a non-periodicity result that goes back to\nPenrose.",

In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images\nwith the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that\npatches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic\nconsistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics\n(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework\nnamed $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency\nin two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different\npatches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport\nstrategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level\nbased on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and\nstructure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware\nrepresentations.

    "abstract": "The formation of planetesimals from cm-sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks\nfaces significant barriers, including fragmentation and radial drift. We\nidentify a previously unaccounted screening force, arising from mutual\nshielding of thermal gas particles between pebbles when their separation falls\nbelow the gas mean free path. This force facilitates pebble binding, overcoming\nkey growth barriers under turbulent disk conditions. Unlike conventional\nmechanisms, screening forces operate independently of surface adhesion and\ncomplement streaming instability and pressure traps by enhancing aggregation in\nhigh-density regions. Our analysis predicts that screening interactions are\nmost effective in the {middle disk regions ($ \\sim 0.3$ to few AU),} consistent\nwith ALMA observations (e.g., TW Hya) of enhanced dust concentrations.\n{Furthermore, we find that screening-induced pebble growth from centimeter to\nkilometer scales can occur on timescales significantly shorter than the disk\nlifetime ($\\sim 10^5$ years). Importantly, this growth naturally terminates\nwhen particles smaller than the local gas mean free path are depleted, thereby\navoiding runaway accretion.} Beyond planetary science, the screening forces\nhave {potential} implications for high-energy astrophysics, dusty plasmas,\nconfined particle suspensions and other relevant areas, suggesting a broader\nfundamental significance.",

Several constraints\nbased on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to\nassist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our\nmethod is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos\ncaptured in complex environments.

    "abstract": "Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all\ntransformer-based large language models. While its effects on training\nstability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.\nAdditionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing\nadditional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual\nmodel components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every\nGPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03\ncross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in\nlanguage modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN\nremoval grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger\nmodels is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.\nFurthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct\nlogit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,\nwhile the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We\nalso confirm that GPT-2's \"confidence neurons\" are inactive in the LN-free\nmodels. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing\nthat GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our\nLN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise\ninterpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach for assessing the muon content of air showers\nwith large zenith angles on a combined analysis of their radio emission and\nparticle footprint. We use the radiation energy reconstructed by the Auger\nEngineering Radio Array (AERA) as an energy estimator and determine the muon\nnumber independently with the water-Cherenkov detector array of the Pierre\nAuger Observatory, deployed on a 1500 m grid. We focus our analysis on air\nshowers with primary energy above 4 EeV to ensure full detection efficiency.\nOver approximately ten years of accumulated data, we identify a set of 40\nhigh-quality events that are used in the analysis. The estimated muon contents\nin data are compatible with those for iron primaries as predicted by\ncurrent-generation hadronic interaction models. This result can be interpreted\nas a deficit of muons in simulations as a lighter mass composition has been\nestablished from Xmax measurements. This muon deficit was already observed in\nprevious analyses of the Auger Collaboration and is confirmed using hybrid\nevents that include radio measurements for the first time.",

While collective decoherence is\nthought to induce steady-state coherence, experiments often fail to observe\nthis because of individual decoherence. We study a system of two harmonic\noscillators coupled to both individual and collective environments, introducing\na tunable parameter to adjust the decoherence proportions. By analytically\nsolving the exact dynamical equations, we find that steady-state coherence\ndepends on the initial state under collective decoherence, but not under\npartial decoherence. Interestingly, non-Markovianity induces rich and complex\nsteady-state coherence behaviors. Our results offer new insights into the role\nof non-Markovian decoherence in quantum systems and serve as a benchmark for\nevaluating approximate methods in modelling quantum processes.",

When a disk galaxy\nreceives the wind edge-on, however, the characteristic signature is not a\ntypical jellyfish tail, but rather an unwinding of the spiral arms. We aim to\nquantify such asymmetries both in the gas and in the stellar component of a\nsimulated galaxy. To this end, we simulate a gas-rich star-forming spiral\ngalaxy moving through a self-consistent ICM gas. The amplitude and location of\nthe asymmetries were measured via Fourier decomposition. We found that the\nasymmetry is much more evident in the gas component, but it is also measurable\nin the stars. The amplitude tends to increase with time and the asymmetry\nradius migrates inwards. We found that, when considering the gas, the spiral\narms extend much further and are more unwound than the corresponding stellar\narms. Characterizing the unwinding via simulations should help inform the\nobservational criteria used to classify ram pressure stripped galaxies, as\nopposed to asymmetries induced by other mechanisms.",

This\nform of \"inherent sparsity\" captures a delicate interplay between the\ncovariance structure of the regressors and the change in regression\ncoefficients on the detectability of a change point.

In particular, QcScan is the\nfirst method shown to achieve consistency in the dense regime and further, we\ndevise a combined procedure which is adaptively minimax optimal across sparse\nand dense regimes without the knowledge of the sparsity. Computationally,\ncovariance scanning-based methods avoid costly computation of Lasso-type\nestimators and attain worst-case computation complexity that is linear in the\ndimension and sample size. Additionally, we consider the post-detection\nestimation of the differential parameter and the refinement of the change point\nestimator.

    "abstract": "Achieving rapid and time-deterministic stabilization for complex systems\ncharacterized by strong nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties presents a\nsignificant challenge. Traditional model-based control relies on precise system\nmodels, whereas purely data-driven methods often lack formal stability\nguarantees, limiting their applicability in safety-critical systems. This paper\nproposes a novel control framework that synergistically integrates data-driven\nmodeling with model-based control. The framework first employs the Extended\nDynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (EDMDc) to identify a high-dimensional\nKoopman linear model and quantify its bounded uncertainty from data.\nSubsequently, a novel Prescribed-Time Adaptive Backstepping (PTAB) controller\nis synthesized based on this data-driven model. The design leverages the\nstructural advantages of Koopman linearization to systematically handle model\nerrors and circumvent the \"explosion of complexity\" issue inherent in\ntraditional backstepping. The proposed controller is validated through\nsimulations on the classic Van der Pol oscillator. The results demonstrate that\nthe controller can precisely stabilize the system states to a small\nneighborhood of the origin within a user-prescribed time, regardless of the\ninitial conditions, while ensuring the boundedness of all closed-loop signals.\nThis research successfully combines the flexibility of data-driven approaches\nwith the rigor of Lyapunov-based analysis. It provides a high-performance\ncontrol strategy with quantifiable performance and pre-assignable settling time\nfor nonlinear systems, showcasing its great potential for controlling complex\ndynamics.",

Its weighted counterpart $ed^w(X,Y)$ minimizes the\ntotal cost of edits, which are specified using a function $w$, normalized so\nthat each edit costs at least one. The textbook dynamic-programming procedure,\ngiven strings $X,Y\\in \\Sigma^{\\le n}$ and oracle access to $w$, computes\n$ed^w(X,Y)$ in $O(n^2)$ time. Nevertheless, one can achieve better running\ntimes if the computed distance, denoted $k$, is small: $O(n+k^2)$ for unit\nweights [Landau and Vishkin; JCSS'88] and $\\tilde{O}(n+\\sqrt{nk^3})$ for\narbitrary weights [Cassis, Kociumaka, Wellnitz; FOCS'23].\n  In this paper, we study the dynamic version of the weighted edit distance\nproblem, where the goal is to maintain $ed^w(X,Y)$ for strings $X,Y\\in\n\\Sigma^{\\le n}$ that change over time, with each update specified as an edit in\n$X$ or $Y$. Very recently, Gorbachev and Kociumaka [STOC'25] showed that the\nunweighted distance $ed(X,Y)$ can be maintained in $\\tilde{O}(k)$ time per\nupdate after $\\tilde{O}(n+k^2)$-time preprocessing; here, $k$ denotes the\ncurrent value of $ed(X,Y)$.

Here, $\\gamma\\in [0,1]$ is a real trade-off parameter and $k\\ge\n1$ is an integer threshold fixed at preprocessing time, with $\\infty$ returned\nwhenever $ed^w(X,Y)>k$.

This\n'Markovian' assumption is sometimes in conflict with experimental evidence, as\nthere might be time-correlated noise leading to non-Markovian dynamics or,\nalternatively, slow drifts and cumulative calibration errors that lead to\ncontext dependence, such that the CP-divisible maps composed during a sequence\nactually change with the circuit depth.

    "abstract": "Non-stabilizerness, or magic, is a resource for universal quantum computation\nin most fault-tolerant architectures; access to states with non-stabilizerness\nallows for non-classically simulable quantum computation to be performed.\nQuantifying this resource for unknown states is therefore essential to\nassessing their utility in quantum computation. The Stabilizer R\\'enyi\nEntropies have emerged as a leading tools for achieving this, having already\nenabled one efficient algorithm for measuring non-stabilizerness. In addition,\nthe Stabilizer R\\'enyi Entropies have proven useful in developing connections\nbetween non-stabilizerness and other quantum phenomena. In this work, we\nintroduced an alternative algorithm for measuring the Stabilizer R\\'enyi\nEntropies of an unknown quantum state. Firstly, we show the existence of a\nstate, produced from the action of a channel on $\\alpha$ copies of some pure\nstate, that encodes the $\\alpha$-Stabilizer R\\'enyi Entropy into its purity. We\ndetail several methods of applying this channel and then, by employing existing\npurity-measuring algorithms, provide an algorithm for measuring the\n$\\alpha$-Stabilizer R\\'enyi Entropies for all integers $\\alpha>1$. This\nalgorithm is benchmarked for qubits and the resource requirements compared to\nother known algorithms. Finally, a non-stabilizerness/entanglement relationship\nis shown to exist in the algorithm, demonstrating an novel relationship between\nthe two resources.",

    "abstract": "Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the\ndevelopment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult\nto assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language\nmodels (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic\nheuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult\nto scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method\nfor testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific\nresources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,\nMeta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained\nLLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.\nThe results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,\nachieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of\nexecutions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,\nwith the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although\nnon-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through\ncareful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the\nresults indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation\nin LLM testing.",

In this work, we\nintroduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models\n(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control\nwithin a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as\ninterpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes\nrecovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each\ntransition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.\nIn Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25\nstates, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path\nsuccess within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy\nand latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs\non a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target\naverage temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to\nclassical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,\nwhile ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling\nnonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following\nlapses and coarse ODE approximations.

We\ncontinuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and\ndemonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points\nin both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to\npre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised\nfine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that\nfull-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We\nshowcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the\nincrease in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.\nFinally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL\npipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy\nwith proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.\nRetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL\ntask and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented\nlanguage models.",

    "abstract": "The UK has pursued a distinctive path in AI regulation: less cautious than\nthe EU but more willing to address risks than the US, and has emerged as a\nglobal leader in coordinating AI safety efforts. Impressive developments from\ncompanies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about\ncatastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time\nfocussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved\ninto a \"pro-innovation\" strategy, in which the government directed existing\nregulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but\navoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived\nin late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The\nUK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and\nhosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU -\nrefrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new\ngovernment was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the\ntime of writing is yet to do so.\n  What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives:\nharnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating\nrisk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based\nregulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures\nagainst risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more\ntechnical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated\nmisinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright,\ndiscrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but\nimportant role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.\n  If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic\nsocieties can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks.",

    "abstract": "Context. Galaxies fly inside galaxy clusters and ram pressure by the ICM can\nremove a large amount of the ISM from the galaxy, and deposit the gas in the\nICM. The ISM decoupled from the host galaxy leaves a long trail following the\nmoving galaxy. Such long trails track the galaxy motion and can be detected\nwith sensitive data in Halpha.\n  Aims. We study the Halpha tail trailing NGC 4569 in the Virgo cluster.\n  Methods. The initial discovery was made with the deep Halpha imaging data\nwith CFHT, from the VESTIGE project. The follow-up spectroscopic observations\nwere made with APO/DIS, MMT/Binospec and CFHT/SITELLE.\n  Results. Besides the known 80 kpc Halpha tail downstream of NGC 4569, the\ndeep Halpha imaging data allow the Halpha tail detected to at least 230 kpc\nfrom the galaxy. More importantly, the Halpha clumps implied from the imaging\ndata are confirmed with the spectroscopic data. The Halpha clumps show a smooth\nradial velocity gradient across about 1300 km/s, eventually reaching the\nvelocity of the cluster. We build a simple model to explain the deceleration of\nstripped clumps and constrain the age to about 0.9 Gyr.\n  Conclusions. This discovery, for the first time, demonstrates the full\ndeceleration process of the stripped ISM. This discovery also showcases the\npotential with wide-field Halpha survey on galaxy clusters to discover\nintracluster optical emission-line clouds originated from cluster galaxies.\nThese clouds provide kinematic tracers to the infall history of cluster\ngalaxies and the turbulence in the ICM. They are also excellent multi-phase\nobjects to study the relevant important physical processes.",

    "abstract": "Orientable sequences of order n are infinite periodic sequences with symbols\ndrawn from a finite alphabet of size k with the property that any particular\nsubsequence of length n occurs at most once in a period in either direction.\nThey were introduced in the early 1990s in the context of possible applications\nin position sensing. Bounds on the period of such sequences and a range of\nmethods of construction have been devised, although apart from very small cases\na significant gap remains between the largest known period for such a sequence\nand the best known upper bound. In this paper we first give improved upper\nbounds on the period of such sequences. We then give a new general method of\nconstruction for orientable sequences involving subgraphs of the de Bruijn\ngraph with special properties, and describe two different approaches for\ngenerating such subgraphs. This enables us to construct orientable sequences\nwith periods meeting the improved upper bounds when n is 2 or 3, as well as n=4\nand k odd. For 4\\leq n\\leq 8, in some cases the sequences produced by the\nmethods described have periods larger than for any previously known sequences.",

    "abstract": "The transient growth of disturbances made possible by the non-normality of\nthe linearized Navier-Stokes equations plays an important role in bypass\ntransition for many shear flows. Transient growth is typically quantified by\nthe maximum energy growth among all possible initial disturbances, which is\ngiven by the largest squared singular value of the matrix exponential of the\nlinearized Navier-Stokes operator. In this paper, we propose a data-driven\napproach to studying transient growth wherein we calculate optimal initial\nconditions, the resulting responses, and the corresponding energy growth\ndirectly from flow data. Mathematically, this is accomplished by optimizing the\ngrowth over linear combinations of input and output data pairs. We also\nintroduce a regularization to mitigate the sensitivity to noisy measurements\nand unwanted nonlinearity. The data-driven method simplifies and broadens the\napplication of transient growth analysis -- it removes the burden of writing a\nnew code or linearizing an existing one, alleviates the computational expense\nfor large problems, eliminates the challenge of obtaining a well-posed spatial\npropagator for spatial growth analyses, and enables the direct application of\ntransient growth analysis to experimental data. We validate the data-driven\nmethod using a linearized Ginzburg-Landau model problem corrupted by process\nand measurement noise and obtain good agreement between the data-driven and the\nstandard operator-based results. We then apply the method to study the spatial\ntransient growth of disturbances in a transitional boundary layer using data\nfrom the Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database. Our method successfully identifies\nthe optimal output response and provides plausible estimates of the transient\nspatial energy growth at various spanwise wavenumbers.",

The NCDE encodes an entire load\nhistory as the solution of a controlled ODE driven by a spline-interpolated\ninput path, making the representation input-resolution-independent: it encodes\ndifferent input signal discretizations of the observed samples. The trunk then\nprobes this latent path at arbitrary spatial locations and times, rendering the\noverall map output-resolution independent: predictions can be queried on meshes\nand time steps unseen during training without retraining or interpolation.\nBenchmarks on transient Poisson, elastodynamic, and thermoelastic problems\nconfirm the robustness and accuracy of the framework, achieving almost instant\nsolution prediction.

IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination\nmodules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the\npoint of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a \"two-factor\nauthentication (human and IA)\" system, it reduces human error in view\nclassification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.\nAdditionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23\nkey points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and\ndorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.\nExperimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,\nachieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a\npixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm.

When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,\nthe results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the\nones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and\nmAP@50-95 metrics.

Focusing on the Forestry\nOffice of Zwiesel, the article analyses archival records that document the\ndistribution of animal and tree species during a period of administrative\nrationalisation and early scientific systematisation. These sources include\nofficial correspondence, detailed species inventories, and early distribution\nmaps compiled under the direction of zoologist Johann Andreas Wagner. The study\nhighlights local and regional observations of fauna, such as the Eurasian lynx,\ncapercaillie, and various freshwater fish, and presents new data on historical\nforest composition, including the presence of rare tree species and venerable\nspecimen trees such as the \"Urwaldtanne\" and the \"Wolframslinde\". By\nintegrating historical ecology, environmental history, and digital humanities,\nthe article sheds light on how 19th-century state institutions, scientific\nactors, and local knowledge contributed to the early documentation of\nbiodiversity. The findings also offer a basis for long-term environmental\ncomparisons and inform current conservation efforts in the region.",

    "abstract": "Immigration has shaped many nations, posing the challenge of integrating\nimmigrants into society. While economists often focus on immigrants' economic\noutcomes compared to natives (such as education, labor market success, and\nhealth) social interactions between immigrants and natives are equally crucial.\nThese interactions, from everyday exchanges to teamwork, often lack enforceable\ncontracts and require cooperation to avoid conflicts and achieve efficient\noutcomes. However, socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural differences can hinder\ncooperation. Thus, evaluating integration should also consider its impact on\nfostering cooperation across diverse groups. This paper studies how priming\ndifferent identity dimensions affects cooperation between immigrant and native\nyouth. Immigrant identity includes both ethnic ties to their country of origin\nand connections to the host country. We test whether cooperation improves by\nmaking salient a specific identity: Common identity (shared society),\nMulticultural identity (ethnic group within society), or Neutral identity. In a\nlab in the field experiment with over 390 adolescents, participants were\nrandomly assigned to one of these priming conditions and played a Public Good\nGame. Results show that immigrants are 13 percent more cooperative than natives\nat baseline.

This\nvariability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to\nsubject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing\ncalibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI\nclassification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning\ntechniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier\nTransform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a\nbalanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,\nincluding three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial\nimprovements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI\nCompetition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on\nDataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we\nsystematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows\nranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows.

    "abstract": "The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of\nstrongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic\nresearch with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper\nthe dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the\nbackground spins form a $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a\nfield theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the\nelectrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying\nholons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the\nspinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling\nstrong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing\nthis dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation\nof long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas\nmicroscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for\nverifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent\nfermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their\ninternal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole\npockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in\nthe Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase.\nSuch agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate\ninterplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the\nemerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of\nfreedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the\nconjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring\nthe pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a\nQSL.",

The effect exhibits a\nstrong low-pass behavior: It decreases by approximately 75% from 0 THz to 0.2\nTHz and vanishes at 1.5 THz. Based on a dynamic model of SMR, we can\nconsistently explain the measured frequency dependence by a competition of the\ntransverse coherent and longitudinal incoherent spin-torque contributions to\nthe spin current. Our analysis suggests that the nonzero response time of the\nmagnon chemical potential is responsible for the increased out-flow of\nincoherent magnons through the YIG|Pt interface at high frequencies and,\nconsequently, for the dramatic spectral decay of the SMR.

In our problem, we are given a target\nmiscoverage rate $\\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \\le T$ an\nalgorithm must output an interval $I_t \\subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \\in\n[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,\n$y_t \\in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \\alpha)$-fraction of days, while\nmaintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the\nintervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of\nconstructing efficient confidence intervals.\n  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input\nsequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct\nintervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \\alpha) - o(1)$, while having length\nupper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.\nFor arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a\n$\\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval\nachieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more\nmistakes than $\\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\\mu$ and\nthe aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching\nalgorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\\mu$ and number of\nmistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to\nan adaptive adversary.\n  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to\nthe classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single\nalgorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and\noptimal for exchangeable sequences.

Two\nversions of the technique are explored and compared: the conventional HPOD,\ncomputing the analytic signal in time; a novel space-only HPOD, computing it\nalong the advection direction. The HPOD is shown to extract wavepackets with\namplitude and frequency modulation in time and space. Its broadband nature\noffers an alternative to spectrally-pure decompositions when instantaneous,\nlocal wave characteristics are important. The space-only version, leveraging\nspace/time equivalence in travelling waves to swap temporal operations by\nspatial ones, is proved mathematically equivalent to its conventional\ncounterpart. The two HPOD versions are characterized and validated on three\ndatasets ordered by complexity: a 2D-DNS of a laminar bluff-body wake with\nperiodic vortex shedding; an LES of a turbulent jet with intermittent, highly\nmodulated wavepackets; and a 2D-PIV of a turbulent jet with measurement errors\nand no temporal resolution. In advecting flows, both HPOD versions deliver\npractically identical complex-valued advecting wavepacket structures,\ncharacterized by spatiotemporal amplification and decay, wave modulation and\nintermittency phenomena in turbulent flow cases, such as in turbulent jets.

This result recovers and extends a result of Freire and\nMa\\~n\\'e (cf. [9]). Second, we prove that if the level set of the Lyapunov\nexponents has full measure with respect to some fully supported measure, then\nthe sectional curvature must be constant. This advances the resolution of\nConjecture 1 in [17]. Furthermore, we establish curvature relationships between\nmanifolds with $1$-equivalent geodesic flows, yielding a new criterion to\nobstruct smooth conjugacy for flows on manifolds without conjugate points. Our\ntechniques provide unified proofs for all rigidity results in [17] as\ncorollaries, and additionally yield rigidity theorems for totally geodesic\nsubmanifolds in settings without conjugate points.

The\nsuccess of machine learning methods suggests that many physical quantities\nexhibit substantial redundancy in that space, lowering their effective\ndimensionality. A low dimensionality is favorable for machine learning\napplications, as it reduces the required number of data points. It is unknown\nhowever, how far the dimensionality of physical properties can be reduced, how\nthis depends on the exact physical property considered, and how accepting a\nmodel error can help further reducing the dimensionality. We show that\naccepting a modest, nearly negligible error leads to a drastic reduction in\nindependent degrees of freedom. This applies to several properties such as the\ntotal energy and frontier orbital energies for a wide range of neutral\nmolecules with up to 20 atoms. We provide a method to quantify an upper bound\nfor the intrinsic dimensionality given a desired accuracy threshold by\ninclusion of all continuous variables in the molecular Hamiltonian including\nthe nuclear charges. We find the intrinsic dimensionality to be remarkably\nstable across molecules, i.e. it is a property of the underlying physical\nquantity and the number of atoms rather than a property of an individual\nmolecular configuration and therefore highly transferable between molecules.\nThe results suggest that the feature space of state-of-the-art molecular\nrepresentations can be compressed further, leaving room for more data efficient\nand transferable models.",

Existing methods mainly use motion or\nappearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex\nscenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often\nprevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,\nnon-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial\nvisibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform\ntracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,\nthe existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods\nmainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and\nnon-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing\ndataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from\nadequate for research purposes.

Since the width of an individual filament can\nvary significantly along its spine, we divided each filament into segments with\nlengths between $1.5\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $2.5\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and\nmeasure their properties. The typical width of these filament segments\nincreases gradually from approximately $0.3\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ at redshift $z =\n2.0$ to about $1.0-1.5\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $z = 0.0$. We find that the segment\nwidth correlates nearly linearly with the linear halo mass density, consistent\nwith previous studies. A similar linear relation is observed between the\nsegment width and the linear stellar mass density, providing a potential\nestimator for filament width. Furthermore, the density profiles of filaments\nwith different widths exhibit self-similarity and can be described by a unified\nformula akin to the isothermal $\\beta$-model. For segments with a given width,\nthe rescaled density profiles show only mild evolution from $z = 2.0$ to $z =\n0.0$. Within the filament width, the gas temperature decreases slowly from the\ncenter to the boundary, with thicker filaments generally containing hotter gas\nthan thinner ones. These trends in filament width, density, and thermal\nprofiles are consistently observed across the TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300\nsimulations, and align well with results from earlier studies.

The motion of the Sun and Earth\nwith respect to the Galactic Centre is expected to induce a strong directional\ndependence in the recoil spectrum.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce HPR-QP, a dual Halpern Peaceman-Rachford (HPR)\nmethod designed for solving large-scale convex composite quadratic programming.\nOne distinctive feature of HPR-QP is that, instead of working with the primal\nformulations, it builds on the novel restricted Wolfe dual introduced in recent\nyears. It also leverages the symmetric Gauss-Seidel technique to simplify\nsubproblem updates without introducing auxiliary slack variables that typically\nlead to slow convergence. By restricting updates to the range space of the\nHessian of the quadratic objective function, HPR-QP employs proximal operators\nof smaller spectral norms to speed up the convergence. Shadow sequences are\nelaborately constructed to deal with the range space constraints. Additionally,\nHPR-QP incorporates adaptive restart and penalty parameter update strategies,\nderived from the HPR method's $O(1/k)$ convergence in terms of the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker residual, to further enhance its performance and robustness.\nExtensive numerical experiments on benchmark data sets using a GPU demonstrate\nthat our Julia implementation of HPR-QP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art solvers in both speed and scalability.",

To address these issues, we introduce the\nDUal Simple Test (DUST) framework, which prunes candidate changes by evaluating\na dual function against a threshold. This approach is highly flexible and\nbroadly applicable to parametric models of any dimension. Under mild\nassumptions, we establish strong duality for the underlying non-convex pruning\nproblem. We demonstrate DUST's effectiveness across various change-point\nregimes and models. In particular, for one-parametric models, DUST matches the\nsimplicity of PELT with the efficiency of FPOP. Its use is especially\nadvantageous for non-Gaussian models.

When the shocked plasma\ninteracts with cold gas, narrow radiative recombination continua (RRCs) and\ncharge exchange (CX) emission are observed. We present the analysis of\nhigh-resolution ChandraLETG X-ray grating spectra of Nova Sco 2023, observed\n128 and 183 days after the optical peak, on 2023 August and October. At both\nepochs, the absorbed X-ray thermal continuum is well described by a Non-Local\nThermal Equilibrium atmosphere model with a temperature T=750,000 K (kT = 65\neV). On day 128, the atmosphere is found to be outflowing at v=-3500 km s^-1.\nOn day 183, the atmosphere brightened by a factor of ~2 and slowed down to\nv=-1500$ km s^-1. The discrete emission features of the spectrum consist of the\nC^+5, N^+5, and N^+6 RRCs, indicating a cold electron temperature of kT_e=1 eV\non day 128, and kT_e=20 eV on day 183. The observed line series of H-like and\nHe-like C^+5, N^+5, N^+6, and O^+6 show enhanced intensities of high-n\n(principal quantum number) transitions, consistent with a CX model of hot ions\nat kT~100 eV.

This work introduces a novel\nparadigm for coarse graining that eschews the assignment of a unique\ncoarse-grained trajectory to a microscopic one. Instead, observations are not\nonly coarse-grained but are also accompanied by a small chance of error.\nFormulating the problem in terms of path weights, we identify a condition on\nthe structure of errors that ensures that the observed entropy production does\nnot increase. As a result, the framework of stochastic thermodynamics for\nestimating entropy production can be extended to this broader class of systems.\nAs an application, we consider Markov networks in which individual transitions\ncan be observed but may be mistaken for each other. We motivate, derive, and\nillustrate thermodynamic bounds that relate the error sensitivity of the\nobserved entropy production to the strength of the driving and are valid for\narbitrary network topologies. If sufficiently many transitions in the network\ncan be observed, redundancies in the coarse-grained trajectories can be used to\ndetect and correct errors, which potentially improves naive estimates of\nentropy production. We conclude with an outlook on subsequent research on\nthermodynamic bounds for erroneous coarse graining.",

We\ninvestigate how combining these techniques improves the detection constraints\nfor giant planets and brown dwarfs compared to using each method individually.\nFor each star and each data set, we compute the mass limits as a function of\nsemi-major axis or projected separation using standard techniques. We then use\na Monte Carlo approach to assess the completeness of the companion mass /\nsemi-major axis parameter space probed by the combination of the three methods,\nas well as by the three methods independently. Our combined approach\nsignificantly increases the fraction of detectable companions. Although no new\ncompanion was detected, we could place stronger constraints on potential\nsubstellar companions. The combination of HCI, RV and astrometry provides\nsignificant improvements in the detection of substellar companions over a wider\nparameter space.

    "abstract": "Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target\ndetection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background\ncontrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying\non a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually\nannotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially\nfor low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,\nnon-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be\npotential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional\nfully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes\na new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires\nsimple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our\nscheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential\ntarget mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and\nmulti-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to\nfurther improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity\nbetween positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose\na long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the\nlocal motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The\nextensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that\nour weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised\nmethods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nfully-supervised ones.",

The probability of this contour was estimated using a recurrent method\non a state space of weighted random walks with short-term memory. In this\npaper, we generalize and extend this method by systematically increasing the\nwalk's memory and enriching the set of forbidden path sequences. By increasing\nthe memory up to a length of 20 steps (corresponding to our parameter $n=7$),\nwe formulate the problem with a one-step transition matrix and numerically\noptimize its spectral radius.

However, the complexity of brain\nstructural connectivity, coupled with continuous modifications driven by\nsynaptic plasticity, makes its direct experimental measurement particularly\nchallenging. Conventional connectivity inference methods based on neuronal\nrecordings often assumes a static underlying structural connectivity and\nrequires stable statistical features of neural activities, making them\nunsuitable for reconstructing structural connectivity that undergoes changes.\nTo fulfill the needs of reconstructing networks undergoing potential structural\nchanges, we propose a unified network reconstruction framework that combines\nconnectivity-induced change point detection (CPD) with pairwise time-delayed\ncorrelation coefficient (TDCC) method. For general neuronal networks in\nbalanced regimes, we develop a theoretical analysis for discriminating changes\nin structural connectivity based on the fluctuation of neuronal voltage time\nseries. We then demonstrate a pairwise TDCC method to reconstruct the network\nusing spike train recordings segmented at the detected change points. We show\nthe effectiveness of our CPD-TDCC network reconstruction using large-scale\nnetwork simulations with multiple neuronal models. Crucially, our method\naccommodates networks with changes in both network topologies and synaptic\ncoupling strengths while retaining accuracy even with sparsely sampled\nsubnetwork data, achieving a critical advancement for practical applications in\nreal experimental situations.

Compared to the MDI model, the\nsingle-nucleon potential in the MDI3Y model exhibits more flexible\nmomentum-dependent behaviors. Furthermore, the inclusion of three zero-range\ndensity-dependent interactions follows the idea of Fermi momentum expansion,\nallowing more flexible variation for the largely uncertain high-density\nbehaviors of nuclear matter equation of state (EOS), especially the symmetry\nenergy. Moreover, we also obtain the corresponding Skyrme-like energy density\nfunctional through density matrix expansion of the finite-range exchange\ninteractions. Based on the MDI3Y model, we construct four interactions with the\nsame symmetry energy slope parameter $L=35$ MeV but different momentum\ndependence of $U_{\\mathrm{sym}}$, by fitting the empirical nucleon optical\npotential, the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter, the\nmicroscopic calculations of pure neutron matter EOS and the astrophysical\nconstraints on neutron stars. In addition, two interactions with $L=55$ and\n$75$ MeV are also constructed for comparison. Using these MDI3Y interactions,\nwe study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars.

    "abstract": "Despite recent remarkable achievements in quadruped control, it remains\nchallenging to ensure robust and compliant locomotion in the presence of\nunforeseen external disturbances. Existing methods prioritize locomotion\nrobustness over compliance, often leading to stiff, high-frequency motions, and\nenergy inefficiency. This paper, therefore, presents a two-stage hierarchical\nlearning framework that can learn to take active reactions to external force\ndisturbances based on force estimation. In the first stage, a velocity-tracking\npolicy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical\nproprioceptive features. A neural network-based estimator is learned through\nsupervised learning, which estimates body velocity and external forces based on\nproprioceptive measurements. In the second stage, a compliance action module,\ninspired by impedance control, is learned based on the pre-trained encoder and\npolicy. This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in\nresponse to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the\ncompliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor\ndisturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking\na balance between robustness and compliance. Simulations and real-world\nexperiments have demonstrated that our method has superior performance in terms\nof robustness, energy efficiency, and safety. Experiment comparison shows that\nour method outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based locomotion controllers.\nAblation studies are given to show the critical roles of the compliance action\nmodule.",

To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a\nZero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,\nwithout requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong\ngeneralization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring\nillumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising\nmodule.

A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined\niteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public\ndatasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under\ncomplex lighting conditions.

In creating this index, we apply Text Mining, Context Window,\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs) from Deep\nLearning techniques to analyse the monthly country reports of the Economist\nIntelligence Unit from May 2012 to January 2025. Additionally, we employ a\nstandard vector autoregression (VAR) analysis to examine the model-implied\nresponses of various macroeconomic variables to BRUI shocks. While developing\nthe BRUI, we also create a complementary COVID-19 Related Uncertainty Index\n(CRUI) to distinguish the uncertainties stemming from these distinct events.\nEmpirical findings and comparisons of BRUI with other earlier-developed\nuncertainty indexes demonstrate the robustness of the new index. This new index\ncan assist British policymakers in measuring and understanding the impacts of\nBrexit-related uncertainties, enabling more effective policy formulation.",

    "abstract": "Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a\nsource model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high\ncost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)\nmethod that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant\nprompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and\nglaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing\nTTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA.

    "abstract": "Owing to the use of attention mechanism to leverage the dependency across\ntokens, Transformers are efficient for natural language processing. By\nharnessing permutation properties broadly exist in resource allocation\npolicies, each mapping measurable environmental parameters (e.g., channel\nmatrix) to optimized variables (e.g., precoding matrix), graph neural networks\n(GNNs) are promising for learning these policies efficiently in terms of\nscalability and generalizability. To reap the benefits of both architectures,\nthere is a recent trend of incorporating attention mechanism with GNNs for\nlearning wireless policies. Nevertheless, is the attention mechanism really\nneeded for resource allocation? In this paper, we strive to answer this\nquestion by analyzing the structures of functions defined on sets and numerical\nalgorithms, given that the permutation properties of wireless policies are\ninduced by the involved sets (say user set). In particular, we prove that the\npermutation equivariant functions on a single set can be recursively expressed\nby two types of functions: one involves attention, and the other does not. We\nproceed to re-express the numerical algorithms for optimizing several\nrepresentative resource allocation problems in recursive forms. We find that\nwhen interference (say multi-user or inter-data stream interference) is not\nreflected in the measurable parameters of a policy, attention needs to be used\nto model the interference. With the insight, we establish a framework of\ndesigning GNNs by aligning with the structures. By taking reconfigurable\nintelligent surface-aided hybrid precoding as an example, the learning\nefficiency of the proposed GNN is validated via simulations.",

The proposal is illustrated through a simulation study comparing\nparameter estimation accuracy and computational efficiency across different\nestimation procedures. We also demonstrate the potential of this class of\nmodels through the analysis of longitudinal data collected during spinal\nanesthesia to monitor the occurrence of hypotension in patients, and we compare\nthe results with those obtained from other standard models.",

Conventional machine-learning\ndetectors reduce alert volume but still yield many false positives, while\nstandard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve\nirrelevant context and fail to justify predictions. We present CyberRAG, a\nmodular agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,\nexplanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent\norchestrates: (i) fine-tuned classifiers specialized by attack family; (ii)\ntool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and (iii) an iterative\nretrieval-and-reason loop that queries a domain-specific knowledge base until\nevidence is relevant and self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG, CyberRAG\nadopts an agentic design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive\nreasoning. This architecture autonomously refines threat labels and\nnatural-language justifications, reducing false positives and enhancing\ninterpretability. It is also extensible: new attack types can be supported by\nadding classifiers without retraining the core agent. CyberRAG was evaluated on\nSQL Injection, XSS, and SSTI, achieving over 94\\% accuracy per class and a\nfinal classification accuracy of 94.92\\% through semantic orchestration.\nGenerated explanations reached 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based\nexpert evaluation, with robustness preserved against adversarial and unseen\npayloads.

Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods\ncan be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the\nfundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a\nconsistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity\nthroughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine\ndetails. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named\nAvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup\npatterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a\ncoarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,\nand then to refine the details.

Due to the uncertainties in diffusion\nprocess, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and\nexpressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely\napply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and\nmultiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding\nthe averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying\nthe global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from\narbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse\nmakeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement\nModule into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality.

In the\nregion of masses lower than the scale of inflation, and sufficiently away from\nthe conformal limit, the total comoving number density of produced particles\nbecomes a function of the coupling to the geometry alone. This allows us to\nprovide an approximated analytic expression for fitting the resulting\nabundance.",

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental\nevaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB\nNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based\nweakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to\nthat of fully supervised methods.",

Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by\nstacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to\ndetect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D\nFourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly\nsensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural\nmovements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we\nintroduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.\nAdditionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise\ntemporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding\nthe range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a\nsignificant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust\nperformance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.",

Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been\nstudied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,\nleveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16\n\\times 16$) using pre-trained models.

Virtual coupling is an emerging railroad technology that\nreduces the distance between trains to increase the capacity of the line,\nwhereas LMPC is an optimization-based controller that incorporates artificial\nintelligence methods to improve its control policies. By incorporating data\nfrom past experiences into the optimization problem, LMPC can learn unmodeled\ndynamics and enhance system performance while satisfying constraints. The LMPC\ndeveloped in this paper is simulated and compared, in terms of energy\nconsumption, with a general MPC, without learning capabilities. The simulations\nare divided into two main practical applications: a LMPC applied only to the\nrear trains (followers) and a LMPC applied to both the followers and the first\nfront train of the convoy (leader). Within each application, the LMPC is\nindependently tested for three railroad categories: metro, regional, and\nhigh-speed. The results show that the LMPC reduces energy consumption in all\nsimulation cases while approximately maintaining speed and travel time. The\neffect is more pronounced in rail applications with frequent speed variations,\nsuch as metro systems, compared to high-speed rail. Future research will\ninvestigate the impact of using real-world data in place of simulated data.",

    "abstract": "The Mars ambient space environment evolves with the varying solar activity.\nUnderstanding the Martian space environment, particularly the topside\nionosphere across different phases of Solar Cycles (SC) 24 \\& 25 remains a key\nresearch gap in planetary ionospheric science. In this study, we utilized the\nNASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission data (150-500 km)\nfrom Martian years 32-38 (2015-2024) during solar quiet-time. This study\ninvestigated the behavior of topside ionosphere (e-, CO2+, O2+, NO+, OH+, O+,\nN+ \\& C+) across different phases of SC over the northern hemisphere. A\nsignificant variation in ionosphere is observed over low-latitude (0-30{\\deg}N)\nwith higher densities compared to mid-latitude (31-60{\\deg}N) across SC.\nAdditionally, we found that the Martian northern ionospheric densities were\nhighest during solar maximum phase on both dayside and nightside compared to\nlow active phases. The dayside densities were approximately 1-2 orders higher\ncompared to those on the nightside. The electron and molecular ions densities\nincreased by factors of 1-5 and 1-13, respectively. While O+ ion density was\nenhanced by nearly 2-2.5 times, along with an upliftment of 40-50 km in the\npeak height. The enhanced dayside densities are attributed to the elevated\nsolar irradiance (1.4-2 times) and varying solar wind flux. Furthermore, the\nenhanced day-to-night plasma transport and elevated solar electron flux during\nmaxima, higher by 33-66\\% than during low-activity, can contribute to the\nincreased nightside ionization. This work, for the first time, uses long-term\nMAVEN datasets across the descending-to-maxima phases of SC to reveal\nclimatology of Martian topside ionosphere.",

Accurate\nkinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally\nachieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small\nanimals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,\nprecluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully\nconvolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions\ndirectly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling\nin dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial\nfeature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,\nextracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a\ntemporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The\nproposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood\ncurves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model\napplicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected\nusing two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The\nmodel was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate\nshorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts\nthe arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.\nFurthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function\neven from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF\nfrom samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not\nrepresented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers\na non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving\nrobust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.",

    "abstract": "Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising\ncomponents for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this\nwork, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the\nfeedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by\nPQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter\ncontribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the\nparameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have\nprimarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the\nFFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,\nexpressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a\nresidual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating\nentanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our\nexperiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia\nbenchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured\nQFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its\nclassical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific\nparameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive\nedge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data\nefficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized\nPQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and\nparameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with\nfoundational deep learning principles.",

Most commonly, a minimal coupling\nprinciple is employed, meaning that all matter fields, except spinors, couple\nonly to the spacetime metric, while spinors additionally couple to the\nspacetime connection. Non-minimal couplings between matter fields and spacetime\ncurvature can arise, for example, from quantum field theory on curved spacetime\nthrough renormalization corrections, in gauge theories of gravity, and in\neffective field theories. In this article, we consider a non-minimal coupling\n$F^{\\mu\\nu}\\tilde{R}{\\mu\\nu}$ between the field strength tensor of the\nelectromagnetic field $F{\\mu\\nu}$ and the antisymmetric part of the Ricci\ntensor $\\tilde{R}_{[\\mu\\nu]}$ in Riemann-Cartan geometry, which is based on a\ngeneral metric-compatible connection with torsion.

However, it remains questionable\nwhether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL\nalgorithms, given their significant computational requirements during\ninference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a\nmethod that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected\nactions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the\namount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models\nhave worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for\nthis method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected\nactions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy\naction MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and\noffline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements across various benchmarks.",

We observed the four repeating FRBs with FAST,\ndetecting a total of 66 bursts. Two bursts from FRB~20190417A exhibit a\ncircular polarization signal-to-noise ratio greater than 7, with the highest\ncircular polarization fraction recorded at 35.7%. While the bursts from FRBs\n20190208A and 20190303A are highly linearly polarized, those from\nFRBs~20190117A and 20190417A show depolarization due to multi-path propagation,\nwith \\sigma_{\\mathrm{RM}} = 2.78 \\pm 0.05 rad m$^{-2}$ and 5.19 \\pm 0.09 rad\nm$^{-2}$, respectively. The linear polarization distributions among five\nrepeating FRB--FRBs~20190208A, 20190303A, 20201124A, 20220912A, and\n20240114A--are nearly identical but show distinct differences from those of\nnon-repeating FRBs. FRBs~20190117A, 20190303A, and 20190417A exhibit\nsubstantial rotation measure (RM) variations between bursts, joining other\nrepeating FRBs in this behavior. Combining these findings with published\nresults, 64% of repeating FRBs show RM variations greater than 50 rad m$^{-2}$,\nand 21\\% exhibit RM reversals. A significant proportion of repeating FRBs\nreside in a dynamic magneto-ionic environment. The structure function of RM\nvariations shows a power-law index of $\\gamma \\sim (0-0.8)$, corresponding to a\nshallow power spectrum $\\alpha = -(\\gamma + 2) \\sim -(2.0-2.8)$ of turbulence,\nif the RM variations are attributed to turbulence. This suggests that the\nvariations are dominated by small-scale RM density fluctuations. We perform K-S\ntests comparing the RMs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs, which reveal a\nmarginal dichotomy in the distribution of their RMs.We caution that the\nobserved dichotomy may be due to the small sample size and selection biases.",

    "abstract": "The optimal management of a building's microclimate to satisfy the occupants'\nneeds and objectives in terms of comfort, energy efficiency, and costs is\nparticularly challenging. This complexity arises from the non-linear,\ntime-dependent interactions among all the variables of the control problem and\nthe changing internal and external constraints. Focusing on the accurate\nmodeling of the indoor temperature, we propose a data-driven approach to\naddress this challenge. We account for thermal inertia, non-linear effects,\nsmall perturbations of the indoor climate dynamics caused by ventilation and\nweather variations, as well as for the stochastic nature of the control system\ndue to the observed noise in the input signal. Since the prohibitive cost of\nquality data acquisition and processing limits the implementation of\ndata-driven approaches for real-life problems, we applied a method that merges\nseveral Bayesian machine learning and deep learning architectures that are\nsuitable for predicting complex system dynamics, while relaxing the dataset\nquality requirements. Our framework includes a built-in deep Kalman filter,\nwhich makes it deployable even with low-accuracy temperature sensors. It\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, best performing with a 150-minute\nprediction horizon with an RMSE of 0.2455, an MAE of 0.162, and an $R^2$ of\n0.926.

    "abstract": "Traditional video-induced emotion physiological datasets often use\nwhole-trial annotation, assigning a single emotion label to all data collected\nduring an entire trial. This coarse-grained annotation approach misaligns with\nthe dynamic and temporally localized nature of emotional responses as they\nunfold with video narratives, introducing label noise that limits emotion\nrecognition algorithm evaluation and performance. To solve the label noise\nproblem caused by coarse-grained annotation, we propose a fine-grained\nannotation method through an immediate recall paradigm. This paradigm\nintegrates an immediate video replay phase after the initial stimulus viewing,\nallowing participants to precisely mark the onset timestamp, emotion label, and\nintensity based on their immediate recall. We validate this paradigm through\nphysiological evidence and recognition performance. Physiological validation of\nmultimodal signals within participant-marked windows revealed rhythm-specific\nEEG patterns and arousal-dependent GSR responses-with SCRs appearing in 91% of\nhigh-arousal versus 6% of low-arousal emotion windows. These objective\nphysiological data changes strongly aligned with subjective annotations,\nconfirming annotation precision. For recognition performance, classification\nexperiments showed that models trained on fine-grained annotations achieved\n9.7% higher accuracy than traditional whole-trial labeling, despite using less\ndata. This work not only addresses label noise through fine-grained annotation\nbut also demonstrates that annotation precision outweighs data scale in\ndetermining emotion recognition performance.",

    "abstract": "Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have been recently proposed to improve the\nperformance of wireless networks by reconfiguring both the large-scale and\nsmall-scale channel conditions. However, existing studies ignore the physical\nconstraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To\nfill this research gap, this paper investigates the design of PASS taking into\naccount the motion power consumption of pinching-antennas (PAs) and the impact\nof adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average\npower consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, by jointly\noptimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit\nbeamforming. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to\nconsider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional\ndegree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and\ndiscrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the\nfact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the\nchannel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To\ntackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for\ncontinuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a\nmixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance\nenhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power assumption and\nadjustable radiation power into PASS design, while also demonstrating the\nefficiency of the proposed optimization framework. The benefits of PASS over\nconventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in mitigating the\nlarge-scale path loss and inter-user interference is also revealed.",

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin.

    "abstract": "Teachers hold a prominent place in modern societies, particularly where\neducation is compulsory and widely institutionalized. This ubiquity obscures an\nunderlying question: why do societies designate certain individuals exclusively\nfor the instruction of others? This question is especially enigmatic for\ndedicated teachers, who invest their labor in cultivating others' skills but do\nnot directly participate in the productive activities for which their students\nare being trained. To address this puzzle, we develop a simple, mathematically\ntractable model of teaching and learning in a population with a shared goal. We\nidentify a tradeoff between the size of the workforce and its collective level\nof expertise; and we analyze the optimal proportion of a population that should\nserve as teachers across a wide range of scenarios. We show that a population\nmust exceed a critical size before it is beneficial to allocate anyone as a\ndedicated teacher at all. Subsequently, the peak demand for teachers is\nachieved at an intermediate population size, and it never surpasses one half of\nthe population. For more complicated tasks, our analysis predicts the optimal\nallocation of teachers across different levels of expertise. The structure of\nthis teacher allocation is more complex when the population size is large, in\nagreement with the general size-complexity hypothesis. Our account lays a\nfoundation for understanding the adaptive advantage of dedicated teachers in\nboth human and non-human societies.",

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based\nmethods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly\ngenerators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when\nthe mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms\nsemantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains\nplausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary\nartifacts.

Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level\nstrategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely\nheavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained\nsemantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple\nsemantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns\nand how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an\nexperimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention\nconditions.

    "abstract": "Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and\nfocus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that\nthe data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This\noverlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift\npermanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid\nadaptation.\n  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift\nthat simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a\nbaseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained\nfrom scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While\neffective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment\n(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a\ndrift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of\ndrifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number\nof up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new\ndistribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while\nreducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.\n  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants\nof standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and\nTiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted\nrepresentations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several\nrehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,\nmaintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead.

We\nbegin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)\nspatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of\nrelying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max\npooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer\nfilters to learn \"non-repeatable local patterns\" that are well aligned with\nobject keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection\nstrategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention\nmask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to\nthe whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final\nkeypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint\nproposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly\ninterpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect\npredefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically\ndiscover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves\nstrong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.",

The second one\ncombines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to\ngenerate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new\nchange detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,\na loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a\nnew evaluation metric called FEPE are designed.

To ensure\nthe security of Web3 services among diverse user entities, a decentralized\nidentity (DID) system is essential.

However, a critical implementation issue arises\nin the current Web3, i.e., how to deploy network nodes to serve users on a\nglobal scale. To address this issue, emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite\ncommunication systems, such as Starlink, offer a promising solution.

Three modes integrate ground\nnodes and satellites to provide flexible and continuous DID services for\nworldwide users. Meanwhile, to evaluate the effectiveness of the present hybrid\ndeployment modes, we analyze the complete DID consensus performance of\nblockchain on three hybrid satellite-ground modes.

Several FL\nframeworks have been built for testing novel FL strategies. However, most focus\non validating the learning aspects of FL through pseudo-distributed simulation\nbut not for deploying on real edge hardware in a distributed manner to\nmeaningfully evaluate the federated aspects from a systems perspective. Current\nframeworks are also inherently not designed to support asynchronous\naggregation, which is gaining popularity, and have limited resilience to client\nand server failures. We introduce Flotilla, a scalable and lightweight FL\nframework. It adopts a ``user-first'' modular design to help rapidly compose\nvarious synchronous and asynchronous FL strategies while being agnostic to the\nDNN architecture. It uses stateless clients and a server design that separates\nout the session state, which are periodically or incrementally checkpointed. We\ndemonstrate the modularity of Flotilla by evaluating five different FL\nstrategies for training five DNN models. We also evaluate the client and\nserver-side fault tolerance on 200+ clients, and showcase its ability to\nrapidly failover within seconds. Finally, we show that Flotilla's resource\nusage on Raspberry Pis and Nvidia Jetson edge accelerators are comparable to or\nbetter than three state-of-the-art FL frameworks, Flower, OpenFL and FedML.

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits\nstrong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to\nremote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually\nconstructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is\nlabor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small\nobjects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain\nadaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to\ncapture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when\nsegmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by\nfew-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM\nutilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific\nobjects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic\nsegmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,\nViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original\narchitecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts\nclass-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware\nprompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target\nAlignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the\ndomain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,\nenabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive\nexperiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,\nLoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and\nautomatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference\nimages and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods\nacross diverse datasets.",

Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text\nmodality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel\nframework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions.

    "abstract": "The Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has\nso far observed three classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): Draco,\nSextans and Ursa Minor. Based on the observed line-of-sight velocities and\nmetallicities of their member stars, we apply the axisymmetric Jeans\nAnisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion modeling (JAM) approach to recover their\ninner dark matter distributions. In particular, both the traditional\nsingle-population Jeans model and the multiple population chemodynamical model\nare adopted. With the chemodynamical model, we divide member stars of each dSph\ninto metal-rich and metal-poor populations. The metal-rich populations are more\ncentrally concentrated and dynamically colder, featuring lower velocity\ndispersion profiles than the metal-poor populations. We find a diversity of the\ninner density slopes $\\gamma$ of dark matter halos, with the best constraints\nby single-population or chemodynamical models consistent with each other. The\ninner density slopes are $0.71^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$, $0.26^{+0.22}_{-0.12}$ and\n$0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor, respectively. We also\npresent the measured astrophysical J and D factors of the three dSphs. Our\nresults indicate that the study of the dark matter content of dSphs through\nstellar kinematics is still subject to uncertainties behind both the\nmethodology and the observed data, through comparisons with previous\nmeasurements and data sets.",

Through a\ndetailed case study of an LLM acting as an HR consultant, we show how its\nadvice, while superficially professional, systematically reinforces\nunproductive problem-solving approaches and blocks pathways to deeper\norganisational learning. This represents a specific instance of the alignment\nproblem where the AI system successfully mirrors human behaviour but inherits\nour cognitive blind spots. This poses particular risks if LLMs are integrated\ninto organisational decision-making processes, potentially entrenching\nanti-learning practices while lending authority to them. The paper concludes by\nexploring the possibility of developing LLMs capable of facilitating Model 2\nlearning - a more productive theory-in-use - and suggests this effort could\nadvance both AI alignment research and action science practice.

In order\nto constrain their current state and structure, we need sufficiently complex\nmodels, constrained by astrometric, interferometric, and spectroscopic\nobservations.

We obtained VLTI\ninterferometric observations of Orion Belt stars and calibrated visibility data\nfrom the GRAVITY and PIONIER instruments. Additionally, we obtained\nspectroscopic data from the CFHT and CTIO observatories. For modelling, we used\na modified version of PHOEBE2, extended with new interferometric and\nspectroscopic modules. To describe non-spherical, rotating, or Roche-like\nstars, integrals over triangular meshes have to be computed, using extensive\ngrids of synthetic spectra. For fitting, we used the simplex algorithm and chi2\nmapping of the parameter space. In this paper, we present single-star models of\nthe B0Ia supergiant eps Ori. Interferometric visibilities indicate that the\nstar is not spherical but rotating close to its critical velocity. The\npreferred distance, d=(384+-8)pc, corresponds to the median of distances for\nthe Orion OB1b association.

However, significant challenges remain in achieving high\nefficiency, stable acceleration, and scalable energy gain. Heavy ion beam\ndrivers, with their high kinetic energy, offer the potential for greater energy\ntransfer to the witness beam. Unfortunately, limited by the relatively low\nvelocity of heavy ion, the dephasing length is really short leading to a low\nenergy gain of the witness beam. Conventional method that increase plasma\ndensity linearly is ineffective in this context because the mismatch between\nthe RMS beam radius and plasma wavelength will make the wakefield degrade or\neven disappear. In this paper, we propose a method that periodically switches\nthe witness beam between different accelerating phase, allowing it to shift\nbetween adjacent accelerating cavities.

Typically, satellite or airborne images used\nfor training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where\nthe same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes.

In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch\ntransformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)\nwith semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source\nbranch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and\ntarget domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is\ndeveloped in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain\ncorrelation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed\nto guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we\npropose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to\nfocus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target\nscenes in noise condition.

    "abstract": "Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement\nlearning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies\nand inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.\nRecent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to\nautomate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in\nnumerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the\nevolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation\nresources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with\ndisproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we\npropose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework\nthat integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and\nevaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function\nuncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free\nidentification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward\ncomponents. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization\n(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance\nhyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level\noptimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and\nthe hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between\nthe reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths\nof the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP\nacross 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments.

To address these\nissues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement\noccupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame\n3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a\nfeature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow\nMatching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and\nPlane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the\nimpact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall\nefficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,\nwe design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and\naddress the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the\nOcc3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing\nstate-of-theart methods.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant\ngrowth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and\ngross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,\nservice providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,\nconsequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive\nranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt\ncoupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as\norder volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.\nThus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to\nmarket fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints\nis a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain\nscarce.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based\nsubsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing\nadjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition\nAdaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and\nReinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget\nconstraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.\nFurthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment\ntailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation\nand benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising\nreal-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse\nmarket conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for\nride-hailing service providers.",

Participants are asked to make a source\ndetermination (typically an identification, exclusion, or some kind of\ninconclusive). We study inconclusives in two black box studies, one on\nfingerprints and one on bullets. Rather than treating all inconclusive\nresponses as functionally correct (as is the practice in reported error rates\nin the two studies we address), irrelevant to reported error rates (as some\nwould do), or treating them all as potential errors (as others would do), we\npropose that the overall pattern of inconclusives in a particular black box\nstudy can shed light on the proportion of inconclusives that are due to\nexaminer variability. Raw item and examiner variances are computed, and\ncompared with the results of a logistic regression model that takes account of\nwhich items were addressed by which examiner. The error rates reported in black\nbox studies are substantially smaller than ``failure rate\" analyses that take\ninconclusives into account.

    "abstract": "Quantum hardware rarely suffers equal amounts of bit-flip ($X$) and\nphase-flip ($Z$) errors; one type is often much more common than the other. A\ncode that is ``bias-tailored'' can exploit this imbalance, lowering the\nfault-tolerance overhead. A complementary idea, called \"single-shot\" error\ncorrection, aims to recover from data errors and noisy measurements in a single\nround of stabilizer readout, avoiding slow repetition cycles. In this work, we\ncombine these two ideas and build a hierarchy of new quantum codes.\n  The full construction starts from the syndrome-encoded hypergraph product\ncode and then tailors it to the dominant error type. The resulting code keeps\nthe single-shot guarantee for every noise model while boosting the threshold\nwhenever $X$ and $Z$ errors are asymmetric.\n  By removing carefully chosen blocks of stabilizers we obtain two trimmed\nvariants. The first, called the simplified code, cuts the physical-qubit count\nby $1/6$ and halves the number of stabilizer measurements, yet its minimum\ndistance grows quadratically compared to the standard design and its biased\nnoise threshold is unchanged. The second, called the reduced code, achieves the\nsame hardware savings but trades away single-shot protection for purely $X$ or\npurely $Z$ noise; instead it remains single-shot under balanced, or\ndepolarizing, noise. In settings where strongly biased noise is likely, either\ntrimmed code offers a less resource-intensive alternative to the full\nconstruction.\n  As a concrete illustration, we lift the two-dimensional XZZX surface code to\na three-dimensional cubic lattice and show that this ``3D XZZX'' code is an\nexplicit member of the simplified family.\n  Taken together, these bias-tailored single-shot codes provide an adjustable\nset of code design alternatives, allowing tradeoffs between hardware overhead\nand noise types.",

Aquaporin 3 (AQP3), a membrane\nchannel protein, regulates cellular osmotic balance by transporting water and\nosmolytes. Although AQP3 downregulation is associated with disc degeneration,\nits role in apoptosis under hyperosmotic conditions remains unclear. Here, we\ndemonstrate that hyperosmolarity induces AQP3 depletion, suppresses the\nPI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS\naccumulation in NPCs. Lentiviral overexpression of AQP3 restores this pathway,\nattenuates oxidative damage, and reduces apoptosis, preserving disc structure\nin IVDD rat models. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of AQP3 exacerbates\nECM catabolism and NP tissue loss. Our findings reveal that AQP3 deficiency\nunder hyperosmolarity contributes to NPC apoptosis via suppression of\nPI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, potentially creating a pathological cycle of disc\ndegeneration. These results highlight AQP3 as a promising therapeutic target\nfor IVDD.",

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer\npromising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit\ntheir adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed\non the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13\nto 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical\ntranscription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete\non-device browser deployment.

In this paper, we\nfirst investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an\nempirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings\nreveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or\nsemantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to\ndifferentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)\nand those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical\nregions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time\ndecoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code\ngeneration. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)\nself-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks\nthem based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining\ndiversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies\ntokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling\ntemperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens\nand higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at\ninference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through\nevaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we\ndemonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional\ncorrectness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance\noverhead) is imperceptible.",

We prove this through a\nthree-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal\napproximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of\npractical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we\nprove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional\nto the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any\ntheoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the\nability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the\ndense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical\nNecessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is\nempirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing\nany successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities.

    "abstract": "We develop a new class of cosmological attractors which are compatible with\nthe recent ACT results. They are based on two types of fractional Kaehler\npotentials, K, for a gauge-singlet inflaton phi which reduce, along the\ninflationary path, to the form N/(1-phi^qM)^p with qM=1, 2 and 0.1< p<10. The\ncombination of these K's with the chaotic potentials phi^n (where n=2, 4)\nwithin a non-linear sigma model leads to inflationary observables which are\nconsistent with the current data and largely independent from qM and n.\nEndowing these K's with a shift symmetry we also offer a supergravity\nrealization of our models introducing two chiral superfields and a monomial\nsuperpotential, linear with respect to the inflaton-accompanying field. The\nattainment of inflation with subplanckian inflaton values and the large values\nfor the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which increases with N, are two additional\nattractive features of our proposal.",

Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data\nefficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely\non 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still\nrequire weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer\nfrom a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a\nstep change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet\nprecise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although\nmany adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of\ndifferent conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.\nWe study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object\ndetection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and\nlayout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning\nyields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning\nbecomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,\nsynthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four\npercent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using\nreal data alone.",

Here we report spectrally resolved line profiles for\nthe majority of detected features and provide information on the variability of\nthese maser components between 2012 and 2023. This includes the first tentative\ndetection of a ($J$,$K$) = (5,2) maser in the interstellar medium and the first\ntentative detection of a (6,4) maser in W51-IRS2. Furthermore, we report for\nthe first time NH$_3$ (9,6) maser emission below Local Standard of Rest\nvelocities of 50 km s$^{-1}$ in this source as well as double maser features\noccasionally seen in other transitions. The detected maser lines strongly\nindicate vibrational pumping by $\\approx$10 $\\mu$m photons, which must be\nabundant due to the high kinetic temperature ($\\approx$300 K) of the ammonia\nemitting gas. The detection of vibrationally excited NH$_3$, suggesting a\nvibrational excitation temperature consistent with the kinetic one, and a\ncomparison with measured SiO line profiles is also presented. For the (10,7)\nline, we find a tentative correlation between flux density and line width\ncompatible with unsaturated maser emission. The velocity drift of the so-called\n45 km s$^{-1}$ maser features, reported to be +0.2 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$\nbetween 1996 and 2012, has either slowed down to values $<$0.1 km s$^{-1}$ or\nhas entirely disappeared.

    "abstract": "This work addresses the general problem of control synthesis for\ncontinuous-space, discrete-time stochastic systems with probabilistic\nguarantees via finite abstractions. While established methods exist, they often\ntrade off accuracy for tractability. We propose a unified abstraction framework\nthat improves both the tightness of probabilistic guarantees and computational\nefficiency. First, we introduce multi-interval MDPs (MI-MDPs), a generalization\nof interval-valued MDPs (IMDPs), which allows multiple, possibly overlapping\nclusters of successor states. This results in tighter abstractions but with\nincreased computational complexity. To mitigate this, we further propose a\ngeneralized form of MDPs with set-valued transition probabilities (SMDPs),\nwhich model transitions as a fixed probability to a state cluster, followed by\na non-deterministic choice within the cluster, as a sound abstraction. We show\nthat control synthesis for MI-MDPs reduces to robust dynamic programming via\nlinear optimization, while SMDPs admit even more efficient synthesis algorithms\nthat avoid linear programming altogether. Theoretically, we prove that, given\nthe partitioning of the state and disturbance spaces, both MI-MDPs and SMDPs\nyield tighter probabilistic guarantees than IMDPs, and that SMDPs are tighter\nthan MI-MDPs. Extensive experiments across several benchmarks validate our\ntheoretical results and demonstrate that SMDPs achieve favorable trade-offs\namong tightness, memory usage, and computation time.",

We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks.
