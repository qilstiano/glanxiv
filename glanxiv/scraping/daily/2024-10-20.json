From a critical analysis of 84 publications\nsystematically gathered across a decade of social computing research, we\ndetermine that research into social computing with neurodiverse participants is\nlargely medicalized, adheres to historical stereotypes of neurodivergent\nchildren and their families, and is insensitive to the wide spectrum of\nneurodivergent people that are potential users of social technologies. When\nsocial computing systems designed for neurodivergent people rely upon a\nconception of disability that restricts expression for the sake of preserving\nexisting norms surrounding social experience, the result is often simplistic\nand restrictive systems that prevent users from \"being social\" in a way that\nfeels natural and enjoyable. We argue that a neurodiversity perspective\ninformed by critical disability theory allows us to engage with alternative\nforms of sociality as meaningful and desirable rather than a deficit to be\ncompensated for. We conclude by identifying opportunities for researchers to\ncollaborate with neurodivergent users and their communities, including the\ncreation of spectrum-conscious social systems and the embedding of double\nempathy into systems for more equitable design.",

Distributed training, particularly through Sharded Data\nParallelism (ShardedDP) which partitions optimizer states among workers, has\nemerged as a crucial technique to mitigate training time and memory usage. Yet,\na major challenge in the scalability of ShardedDP is the intensive\ncommunication of weights and gradients. While compression techniques can\nalleviate this issue, they often result in worse accuracy. Driven by this\nlimitation, we propose SDP4Bit (Toward 4Bit Communication Quantization in\nSharded Data Parallelism for LLM Training), which effectively reduces the\ncommunication of weights and gradients to nearly 4 bits via two novel\ntechniques: quantization on weight differences, and two-level gradient smooth\nquantization. Furthermore, SDP4Bit presents an algorithm-system co-design with\nruntime optimization to minimize the computation overhead of compression. In\naddition to the theoretical guarantees of convergence, we empirically evaluate\nthe accuracy of SDP4Bit on the pre-training of GPT models with up to 6.7\nbillion parameters, and the results demonstrate a negligible impact on training\nloss. Furthermore, speed experiments show that SDP4Bit achieves up to\n4.08$\\times$ speedup in end-to-end throughput on a scale of 128 GPUs.",

This research introduces a novel approach to predicting monthly\ngasoline consumption using a hybrid Transformer-LSTM-CNN model, which\nintegrates the strengths of Transformer networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nnetworks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This advanced architecture\noffers a superior alternative to conventional methods such as artificial neural\nnetworks and regression models by capturing both short- and long-term\ndependencies in time series data. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism of\nTransformers, the temporal memory of LSTMs, and the local pattern detection of\nCNNs, our hybrid model delivers improved prediction accuracy. Implemented using\nPython, the model provides precise future gasoline consumption forecasts and\nevaluates the environmental impact through the analysis of greenhouse gas\nemissions. This study examines gasoline consumption trends from 2007 to 2021,\nwhich rose from 64.5 million liters per day in 2007 to 99.80 million liters per\nday in 2021. Our proposed model forecasts consumption levels up to 2031,\noffering a valuable tool for policymakers and energy analysts. The results\nhighlight the superiority of this hybrid model in improving the accuracy of\ngasoline consumption forecasts, reinforcing the need for advanced machine\nlearning techniques to optimize resource management and mitigate environmental\nrisks in the energy sector.",

Protons are affected mostly by the strong interaction, whereas other\ncharged particles are mostly influenced by the Coulomb interaction. The\ninteraction of the particles under investigation with the fireball or the\nexpanding cloud of the other particles in the final state might also have\nsignificant consequences. This may cause the particle's trajectory to shift.\nThis phenomenon can be viewed as an Aharonov-Bohm effect since the pair's\nalternate tracks reveal a closed loop with an internal field.

    "abstract": "Item Response Theory (IRT) has been widely used in educational psychometrics\nto assess student ability, as well as the difficulty and discrimination of test\nquestions. In this context, discrimination specifically refers to how\neffectively a question distinguishes between students of different ability\nlevels, and it does not carry any connotation related to fairness. In recent\nyears, IRT has been successfully used to evaluate the predictive performance of\nMachine Learning (ML) models, but this paper marks its first application in\nfairness evaluation. In this paper, we propose a novel Fair-IRT framework to\nevaluate a set of predictive models on a set of individuals, while\nsimultaneously eliciting specific parameters, namely, the ability to make fair\npredictions (a feature of predictive models), as well as the discrimination and\ndifficulty of individuals that affect the prediction results. Furthermore, we\nconduct a series of experiments to comprehensively understand the implications\nof these parameters for fairness evaluation. Detailed explanations for item\ncharacteristic curves (ICCs) are provided for particular individuals. We\npropose the flatness of ICCs to disentangle the unfairness between individuals\nand predictive models. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this\nframework as a fairness evaluation tool. Two real-world case studies illustrate\nits potential application in evaluating fairness in both classification and\nregression tasks. Our paper aligns well with the Responsible Web track by\nproposing a Fair-IRT framework to evaluate fairness in ML models, which\ndirectly contributes to the development of a more inclusive, equitable, and\ntrustworthy AI.",

The Allen-Cahn equation is usually\nused to characterize phase separation or the motion of anti-phase boundaries in\nmaterials. Its solution is time-consuming when high-resolution meshes and large\ntime scale integration are involved. To resolve these issues, the convolution\ntensor decomposition method is developed, in conjunction with a stabilized\nsemi-implicit scheme for time integration. The development enables a powerful\ncomputational framework for high-resolution solutions of Allen-Cahn problems,\nand allows the use of relatively large time increments for time integration\nwithout violating the discrete energy law. To further improve the efficiency\nand robustness of the method, an adaptive algorithm is also proposed. Numerical\nexamples have confirmed the efficiency of the method in both 2D and 3D\nproblems. Orders-of-magnitude speedups were obtained with the method for\nhigh-resolution problems, compared to the finite element method. The proposed\ncomputational framework opens numerous opportunities for simulating complex\nmicrostructure formation in materials on large-volume high-resolution meshes at\na deeply reduced computational cost.",

    "abstract": "Privacy and regulatory constraints make data generation vital to advancing\nmachine learning without relying on real-world datasets. A leading approach for\ntabular data generation is the Forest Flow (FF) method, which combines Flow\nMatching with XGBoost. Despite its good performance, FF is slow and makes\nerrors when treating categorical variables as one-hot continuous features. It\nis also highly sensitive to small changes in the initial conditions of the\nordinary differential equation (ODE). To overcome these limitations, we develop\nHeterogeneous Sequential Feature Forest Flow (HS3F). Our method generates data\nsequentially (feature-by-feature), reducing the dependency on noisy initial\nconditions through the additional information from previously generated\nfeatures. Furthermore, it generates categorical variables using multinomial\nsampling (from an XGBoost classifier) instead of flow matching, improving\ngeneration speed. We also use a Runge-Kutta 4th order (Rg4) ODE solver for\nimproved performance over the Euler solver used in FF. Our experiments with 25\ndatasets reveal that HS3F produces higher quality and more diverse synthetic\ndata than FF, especially for categorical variables. It also generates data\n21-27 times faster for datasets with $\\geq20%$ categorical variables.

Motivated by\ndisparate inferences on the source of Martian atmospheric volatiles (outgassed\nversus nebular captured), we consider hybrid-source accretionary atmospheres in\nwhich a high molecular weight (e.g., CO2-rich) outgassed component is mixed in\nwith the low molecular weight H2-rich nebular atmosphere.

Examples include non-classical critical scaling\nnear ferromagnetic transitions, thermal and dynamic behavior near liquid-glass\ntransitions, and the 1/f-like noise in metal films and qubits. A key feature in\nseveral models is to allow separate time steps for distinct conservation laws:\none type of step conserves energy and the other conserves momentum (e.g. dipole\nalignment). This \"orthogonal dynamics\" explains how the relaxation of a single\nparameter can exhibit multiple responses such as primary, secondary, and\nmicroscopic peaks in the dielectric loss of supercooled liquids, and the\ncrossover in thermal fluctuations from Johnson-Nyquist (white) noise at high\nfrequencies to 1/f-like noise at low frequencies.

    "abstract": "Recently, the field of 3D medical segmentation has been dominated by deep\nlearning models employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and\nTransformer-based architectures, each with their distinctive strengths and\nlimitations. CNNs are constrained by a local receptive field, whereas\ntransformers are hindered by their substantial memory requirements as well as\nthey data hungriness, making them not ideal for processing 3D medical volumes\nat a fine-grained level. For these reasons, fully convolutional neural\nnetworks, as nnUNet, still dominate the scene when segmenting medical\nstructures in 3D large medical volumes. Despite numerous advancements towards\ndeveloping transformer variants with subquadratic time and memory complexity,\nthese models still fall short in content-based reasoning.

The unresolved issue of rollout error accumulation results in\nunreliable estimations as the network predicts further into the future, with\neach step's error compounding and leading to an increase in inaccuracy. Here,\nwe introduce the State-Exchange Attention (SEA) module, a novel\ntransformer-based module enabling information exchange between encoded fields\nthrough multi-head cross-attention. The cross-field multidirectional\ninformation exchange design enables all state variables in the system to\nexchange information with one another, capturing physical relationships and\nsymmetries between fields. Additionally, we introduce an efficient ViT-like\nmesh autoencoder to generate spatially coherent mesh embeddings for a large\nnumber of meshing cells. The SEA integrated transformer demonstrates the\nstate-of-the-art rollout error compared to other competitive baselines.\nSpecifically, we outperform PbGMR-GMUS Transformer-RealNVP and GMR-GMUS\nTransformer, with a reduction in error of 88% and 91%, respectively.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the SEA module alone can reduce errors by 97%\nfor state variables that are highly dependent on other states of the system.\nThe repository for this work is available at:\nhttps://github.com/ParsaEsmati/SEA",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has been extensively applied for various classical software\ntesting activities such as test generation, minimization, and prioritization.\nAlong the same lines, recently, there has been interest in applying quantum\nmachine learning to software testing. For example, Quantum Extreme Learning\nMachines (QELMs) were recently applied for testing classical software of\nindustrial elevators. However, most studies on QELMs, whether in software\ntesting or other areas, used ideal quantum simulators that fail to account for\nthe noise in current quantum computers. While ideal simulations offer insight\ninto QELM's theoretical capabilities, they do not enable studying their\nperformance on current noisy quantum computers. To this end, we study how\nquantum noise affects QELM in three industrial and real-world classical\nsoftware testing case studies, providing insights into QELMs' robustness to\nnoise. Such insights assess QELMs potential as a viable solution for industrial\nsoftware testing problems in today's noisy quantum computing. Our results show\nthat QELMs are significantly affected by quantum noise, with a performance drop\nof 250% in regression tasks and 50% in classification tasks. Although\nintroducing noise during both ML training and testing phases can improve\nresults, the reduction is insufficient for practical applications.

One such popular domain where RL has\nbeen effective is resource management problems in systems. We look to extend\nwork on RL for resource management problems by considering the novel domain of\ndynamic memory allocation management. We consider dynamic memory allocation to\nbe a suitable domain for RL since current algorithms like first-fit, best-fit,\nand worst-fit can fail to adapt to changing conditions and can lead to\nfragmentation and suboptimal efficiency. In this paper, we present a framework\nin which an RL agent continuously learns from interactions with the system to\nimprove memory management tactics. We evaluate our approach through various\nexperiments using high-level and low-level action spaces and examine different\nmemory allocation patterns. Our results show that RL can successfully train\nagents that can match and surpass traditional allocation strategies,\nparticularly in environments characterized by adversarial request patterns. We\nalso explore the potential of history-aware policies that leverage previous\nallocation requests to enhance the allocator's ability to handle complex\nrequest patterns.

However, current\nbenchmarks are often simplistic, allowing models to perform uniformly well and\nmaking it difficult to distinguish their capabilities. Additionally, benchmarks\ntypically rely on static question-answer pairs that the models might memorize\nor guess. To address these limitations, we introduce Dynamic Intelligence\nAssessment (DIA), a novel methodology for testing AI models using dynamic\nquestion templates and improved metrics across multiple disciplines such as\nmathematics, cryptography, cybersecurity, and computer science. The\naccompanying dataset, DIA-Bench, contains a diverse collection of challenge\ntemplates with mutable parameters presented in various formats, including text,\nPDFs, compiled binaries, visual puzzles, and CTF-style cybersecurity\nchallenges. Our framework introduces four new metrics to assess a model's\nreliability and confidence across multiple attempts. These metrics revealed\nthat even simple questions are frequently answered incorrectly when posed in\nvarying forms, highlighting significant gaps in models' reliability. Notably,\nAPI models like GPT-4o often overestimated their mathematical capabilities,\nwhile ChatGPT-4o demonstrated better performance due to effective tool usage.\nIn self-assessment, OpenAI's o1-mini proved to have the best judgement on what\ntasks it should attempt to solve. We evaluated 25 state-of-the-art LLMs using\nDIA-Bench, showing that current models struggle with complex tasks and often\ndisplay unexpectedly low confidence, even with simpler questions.

Conventional frame-based cameras suffer from\nlimitations such as motion blur and drift, which can be mitigated by the\ncontinuous, low-latency data provided by event cameras. Similarly, LiDAR-based\nodometry encounters challenges related to the loss of geometric information in\nenvironments such as corridors. To address these limitations, unlike the\nexisting event camera-related surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive\noverview of recent advancements in event-based sensor fusion for odometry\napplications particularly, investigating fusion strategies that incorporate\nframe-based cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), and LiDAR.

The complexity of register\nimplementation is relatively low when compared with other design blocks.\nHowever, the extensive number of registers, combined with the various potential\nfunctions they can perform, necessitates considerable effort during\nimplementation, especially when using a manual approach. Therefore, an in-house\nregister generator was proposed by the design team to reduce the manual effort\nin the register implementation. This in-house register generator supports not\nonly the generation of register blocks but also bus-related blocks. Meanwhile,\nto support various requirements, 41 generation options are used for this\ngenerator, which is highly-configurable. From the verification perspective, it\nis infeasible to achieve complete verification results with a manual approach\nfor all options combinations.

Nevertheless, such methods often encounter challenges regarding the\nefficacy of feature extraction, data integrity, consistency of feature\ndimensions, and adaptability across various downstream tasks. This paper\nproposes a generalized multimodal fusion method (GMF) via the\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equation, which adeptly addresses the\naforementioned issues. Theoretically, the optimization objective for\ntraditional multimodal tasks is formulated and redefined by integrating\ninformation entropy and the flow of gradient backward step. Leveraging these\ntheoretical insights, the PNP equation is applied to feature fusion, rethinking\nmultimodal features through the framework of charged particles in physics and\ncontrolling their movement through dissociation, concentration, and\nreconstruction. Building on these theoretical foundations, GMF disassociated\nfeatures which extracted by the unimodal feature extractor into\nmodality-specific and modality-invariant subspaces, thereby reducing mutual\ninformation and subsequently lowering the entropy of downstream tasks. The\nidentifiability of the feature's origin enables our approach to function\nindependently as a frontend, seamlessly integrated with a simple concatenation\nbackend, or serve as a prerequisite for other modules. Experimental results on\nmultiple downstream tasks show that the proposed GMF achieves performance close\nto the state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy while utilizing fewer parameters and\ncomputational resources.

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there is\ngrowing interest in leveraging AI-based methods to accelerate yield predictions\nwithout conducting in vitro experiments. We present log-RRIM, an innovative\ngraph transformer-based framework designed for predicting chemical reaction\nyields. A key feature of log-RRIM is its integration of a cross-attention\nmechanism that focuses on the interplay between reagents and reaction centers.\nThis design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial\nrole of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which\nultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM also implements a local-to-global\nreaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures\ndetailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates\nintermolecular interactions. Through this hierarchical process, log-RRIM\neffectively captures how different molecular fragments contribute to and\ninfluence the overall reaction yield, regardless of their size variations.\nlog-RRIM shows superior performance in our experiments, especially for medium\nto high-yielding reactions, proving its reliability as a predictor.

The attained H concentrations are large enough\nto induce superconductivity in Pd, albeit with an incomplete resistive\ntransition which suggests a strongly inhomogeneous H incorporation in the Pd\nmatrix. This DES-based IGP protocol can be used as a guideline for maximizing H\nloading in different materials, although specific details of the applied\nvoltage profile might require adjustments based on the material under\ninvestigation.",

Recent research works address\ncomplex tasks by dividing them into subtasks with dependencies and assigning\nthem to suitable workers. However, the dependencies among subtasks and their\nheterogeneous skill requirements, as well as the need for efficient utilization\nof workers' limited work time in the multi-task allocation mode, pose\nchallenges in achieving an optimal task allocation scheme. Therefore, this\npaper formally investigates the problem of Dependency-aware Multi-task\nAllocation (DMA) and presents a well-designed framework to solve it, known as\nHeterogeneous Graph Reinforcement Learning-based Task Allocation (HGRL-TA). To\naddress the challenges associated with representing and embedding diverse\nproblem instances to ensure robust generalization, we propose a multi-relation\ngraph model and a Compound-path-based Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network\n(CHANet) for effectively representing and capturing intricate relations among\ntasks and workers, as well as providing embedding of problem state. The task\nallocation decision is determined sequentially by a policy network, which\nundergoes simultaneous training with CHANet using the proximal policy\noptimization algorithm.

    "abstract": "The most common method to auto-grade a student's submission in a CS1 or a CS2\ncourse is to run it against a pre-defined test suite and compare the results\nagainst reference results. However, this technique cannot be used if the\ncorrectness of the solution goes beyond simple output, such as the algorithm\nused to obtain the result. There is no convenient method for the graders to\nidentify the kind of algorithm used in solving a problem. They must read the\nsource code and understand the algorithm implemented and its features, which\nmakes the process tedious. We propose CASET(Complexity Analysis using Simple\nExecution Traces), a novel tool to analyze the time complexity of algorithms\nusing dynamic traces and unsupervised machine learning. CASET makes it\nconvenient for tutors to classify the submissions for a program into time\ncomplexity baskets. Thus, tutors can identify the algorithms used by the\nsubmissions without necessarily going through the code written by the students.\nCASET's analysis can be used to improve grading and provide detailed feedback\nfor submissions that try to match the results without a proper algorithm, for\nexample, hard-coding a binary result, pattern-matching the visible or common\ninputs. We show the effectiveness of CASET by computing the time complexity of\nmany classes of algorithms like sorting, searching and those using dynamic\nprogramming paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Representation learning for time series using contrastive learning has\nemerged as a critical technique for improving the performance of downstream\ntasks. To advance this effective approach, we introduce CaTT (\\textit{Contrast\nAll The Time}), a new approach to unsupervised contrastive learning for time\nseries, which takes advantage of dynamics between temporally similar moments\nmore efficiently and effectively than existing methods. CaTT departs from\nconventional time-series contrastive approaches that rely on data augmentations\nor selected views. Instead, it uses the full temporal dimension by contrasting\nall time steps in parallel. This is made possible by a scalable NT-pair\nformulation, which extends the classic N-pair loss across both batch and\ntemporal dimensions, making the learning process end-to-end and more efficient.\nCaTT learns directly from the natural structure of temporal data, using\nrepeated or adjacent time steps as implicit supervision, without the need for\npair selection heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach produces superior\nembeddings which allow better performance in downstream tasks. Additionally,\ntraining is faster than other contrastive learning approaches, making it\nsuitable for large-scale and real-world time series applications.

    "abstract": "Recent numerical results seem to suggest that in certain regimes of typical\nparticle velocities the gravitational $N-$body problem (for $3\\leq N\\lesssim\n10^3$) is intrinsically less chaotic when the post-Newtonian (PN) force terms\nare included, with respect to its classical counterpart that exhibits a\nslightly larger maximal Lyapunov exponent $\\Lambda_{\\rm max}$. In this work we\nexplore the dynamics of wildly chaotic, regular and nearly regular\nconfigurations of the 3-body problem with and without the PN corrective terms\naiming at shedding some light on the behaviour of the Lyapunov spectra under\nthe effect of said corrections. Because the interaction of the tangent-space\ndynamics in gravitating systems, needed to evaluate the Lyapunov exponents,\nbecomes rapidly computationally heavy due to the complexity of the higher order\nforce derivatives involving multiple powers of $v/c$, we introduce a technique\nto compute a proxy of the Lyapunov spectrum based on the time-dependent\ndiagonalization of the inertia tensor of a cluster of trajectories in\nphase-space. We find that, for a broad range of orbital configurations, the\nrelativistic 3-body problem has a smaller $\\Lambda_{\\rm max}$ than its\nclassical counterpart starting with the exact same initial condition. However,\nthe rest of the Lyapunov spectrum can be either lower or larger in the\nclassical case, suggesting that the relativistic precession effectively reduces\nchaos only along one (or few) directions in phase-space. As a general trend,\nthe dynamical entropy of the relativistic simulations as function of the\nrescaled speed of light always has a regime in which falls below the classical\nvalue.} We observe that, the sole analysis of $\\Lambda_{\\rm max}$ could induce\npossibly misleading conclusions on the chaoticity of systems with small (and\npossibly large $N$.",

As\nit is known, the Killing vector fields specify infinitesimal transformations of\nthe group of motions of space $V_4$. In the case when in the homogeneous space\n$V_4$ the group of motions $G_3$ acts simply transitive, the geometry of the\nnon-isotropic hypersurface is determined by the geometry of the transitivity\nspace $V_3$ of the group $G_3$. In this case, the metric tensor of the space\n$V_3$ can be given by a nonholonomic reper consisting of three independent\nvectors $\\ell_{(a)}^\\alpha$, which define the generators of the group $G_3$ of\nfinite transformations in the space $V_3$. The representation of the metric\ntensor of $V_4$ spaces by means of vector fields $\\ell_{(a)}^\\alpha$ has a\ngreat physical meaning and allows to simplify substantially the equations of\nmathematical physics in such spaces. Therefore, the Petrov classification\nshould be complemented by the classification of vector fields\n$\\ell_{(a)}^\\alpha$ connected to Killing vector fields.

By fusing top features\nidentified by these XAI methods across six diverse AI models (Decision Trees,\nRandom Forests, Deep Neural Networks, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector\nMachines, and AdaBoost), the framework creates a robust and comprehensive set\nof features critical for detecting anomalies. These feature sets, produced by\nour feature ensemble framework, are evaluated using independent classifiers\n(CatBoost, Logistic Regression, and LightGBM) to ensure unbiased performance.\nWe evaluated our feature ensemble approach on two popular autonomous driving\ndatasets (VeReMi and Sensor) datasets.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have remarkably adapted to\nvarious downstream tasks. Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the\nspecificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template\nengineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the\nprompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable\nparameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base\nclasses seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer\nunderstandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable\nprompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate\ntextual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not\nonly guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts\nwith their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information.\nAdditionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on\nvisual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction\nbetween textual and visual modalities. This allows for thae creation of\ndataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while\nmaintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals\nthat IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based\nprompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of\nthe generated prompts.

Starting with a 2D layout provided by a user or generated\nfrom a text description, we first create a coarse 3D scene using a carefully\ndesigned initialization process based on efficient reconstruction models. To\nenforce coherent global 3D layouts and enhance the quality of instance\nappearances, we propose a collision-aware layout optimization process followed\nby instance-wise refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that\nLayout-Your-3D yields more reasonable and visually appealing compositional 3D\nassets while significantly reducing the time required for each prompt.\nAdditionally, Layout-Your-3D can be easily applicable to downstream tasks, such\nas 3D editing and object insertion.

They show that these\nprobabilities are closely related to the concept for heavy tails. Tukey's\nboxplots are very popular and useful in practice. Analogously to the\nchi-square-criterion, the relative frequencies of the events an observation to\nfall in different their parts, compared with the corresponding probabilities an\nobservation of a fixed probability distribution to fall in the same parts, help\nthe practitioners to find the accurate probability distribution of the observed\nrandom variable.

All these methods, however, suffer from the disadvantage that\nthey use inter quantile range in a symmetric way. The concept for outside\nvalues should take into account the form of the distribution. Therefore, here,\nwe give possibility for more asymmetry in analysis of the tails of the\ndistributions. We suggest new theoretical and empirical box-plots and\ncharacteristics of the tails of the distributions. These are theoretical\nasymmetric p-outside values functions.

Here, we combine experiments and\nsimulations to reveal the twisting dynamics of the MoS$_2$/graphite\nheterostructure. Unlike the translational friction falling into the\nsuperlubricity regime with no twist angle dependence, the dynamic rotational\nresistances highly depend on twist angles. Our results show that the periodic\nrotational resistance force originates from structural potential energy changes\nduring the twisting. The structural potential energy of MoS$_2$/graphite\nheterostructure increases monotonically from0 to 30 degrees twist angles, and\nthe estimated relative energy barrier is (1.43 +/- 0.36) x 10 J/m. The\nformation of Moir\\'e superstructures in the graphene layer is the key to\ncontrolling the structural potential energy of the MoS$_2$/graphene\nheterostructure. Our results suggest that in twisting 2D heterostructures, even\nif the interface sliding friction is negligible, the evolving potential energy\nchange results in a non-vanishing rotational resistance force.

Its efficacy is demonstrated by preparing spin-squeezed\nstates in an open collective spin model governed by a linear control field.\nInspired by Darwinian evolution, the algorithm iteratively refines control\nsequences using crossover, mutation, and elimination strategies, starting from\na coherent spin state within a dissipative and dephasing environment. An\nadaptive parameter adjustment mechanism further enhances optimization. Our\napproach, compared to constant control schemes, yields a variety of control\nsequences capable of maintaining squeezing for the collective spin model.\nFurthermore, the proposed strategy exhibits increased effectiveness in diverse\nsystems, while reservoir thermal excitations are shown to negatively impact\ncontrol outcomes. We discuss feasible experimental implementations and\npotential extensions to alternative quantum systems, and the adaptability of\nthe GA module.

This study explores the\nimplementation of SMILE, a novel explainability method originally designed for\ndeep neural networks, on point cloud-based models.

The approach demonstrates superior\nperformance in terms of fidelity loss, R2 scores, and robustness across various\nkernel widths, perturbation numbers, and clustering configurations. Moreover,\nthis study introduces a stability analysis for point cloud data using the\nJaccard index, establishing a new benchmark and baseline for model stability in\nthis field. The study further identifies dataset biases in the classification\nof the 'person' category, emphasizing the necessity for more comprehensive\ndatasets in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and robotics.\nThe results underscore the potential of advanced explainability models and\nhighlight areas for future research, including the application of alternative\nsurrogate models and explainability techniques in point cloud data.",

    "abstract": "Incremental learning (IL) aims to acquire new knowledge from current tasks\nwhile retaining knowledge learned from previous tasks. Replay-based IL methods\nstore a set of exemplars from previous tasks in a buffer and replay them when\nlearning new tasks. However, there is usually a size-limited buffer that cannot\nstore adequate real exemplars to retain the knowledge of previous tasks. In\ncontrast, data distillation (DD) can reduce the exemplar buffer's size, by\ncondensing a large real dataset into a much smaller set of more\ninformation-compact synthetic exemplars. Nevertheless, DD's performance gain on\nIL quickly vanishes as the number of synthetic exemplars grows. To overcome the\nweaknesses of real-data and synthetic-data buffers, we instead optimize a\nhybrid memory including both types of data. Specifically, we propose an\ninnovative modification to DD that distills synthetic data from a sliding\nwindow of checkpoints in history (rather than checkpoints on multiple training\ntrajectories). Conditioned on the synthetic data, we then optimize the\nselection of real exemplars to provide complementary improvement to the DD\nobjective. The optimized hybrid memory combines the strengths of synthetic and\nreal exemplars, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting in Class IL\n(CIL) when the buffer size for exemplars is limited. Notably, our method can be\nseamlessly integrated into most existing replay-based CIL models.

Using\nsuch fixed text classifiers not only struggles to model visual relations with\nhigh variance, but also falls short in adapting to distinct contexts. To plug\nthese intrinsic shortcomings, we devise SDSGG, a scene-specific description\nbased OVSGG framework where the weights of text classifiers are adaptively\nadjusted according to the visual content. In particular, to generate\ncomprehensive and diverse descriptions oriented to the scene, an LLM is asked\nto play different roles (e.g., biologist and engineer) to analyze and discuss\nthe descriptive features of a given scene from different views. Unlike previous\nefforts simply treating the generated descriptions as mutually equivalent text\nclassifiers, SDSGG is equipped with an advanced renormalization mechanism to\nadjust the influence of each text classifier based on its relevance to the\npresented scene (this is what the term \"specific\" means). Furthermore, to\ncapture the complicated interplay between subjects and objects, we propose a\nnew lightweight module called mutual visual adapter.

    "abstract": "Volumetric medical image segmentation is a fundamental problem in medical\nimage analysis where the objective is to accurately classify a given 3D\nvolumetric medical image with voxel-level precision. In this work, we propose a\nnovel hierarchical encoder-decoder-based framework that strives to explicitly\ncapture the local and global dependencies for volumetric 3D medical image\nsegmentation. The proposed framework exploits local volume-based self-attention\nto encode the local dependencies at high resolution and introduces a novel\nvolumetric MLP-mixer to capture the global dependencies at low-resolution\nfeature representations, respectively. The proposed volumetric MLP-mixer learns\nbetter associations among volumetric feature representations. These explicit\nlocal and global feature representations contribute to better learning of the\nshape-boundary characteristics of the organs. Extensive experiments on three\ndifferent datasets reveal that the proposed method achieves favorable\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. On the challenging Synapse\nMulti-organ dataset, the proposed method achieves an absolute 3.82\\% gain over\nthe state-of-the-art approaches in terms of HD95 evaluation metrics {while a\nsimilar improvement pattern is exhibited in MSD Liver and Pancreas tumor\ndatasets}. We also provide a detailed comparison between recent architectural\ndesign choices in the 2D computer vision literature by adapting them for the\nproblem of 3D medical image segmentation. Finally, our experiments on the\nZebraFish 3D cell membrane dataset having limited training data demonstrate the\nsuperior transfer learning capabilities of the proposed vMixer model on the\nchallenging 3D cell instance segmentation task, where accurate boundary\nprediction plays a vital role in distinguishing individual cell instances.",

To achieve\nstable communication, it is essential to implement proactive measures, such as\nswitching to an alternative path and ensuring data buffering before the\ncommunication quality becomes unstable. The technology of Wireless Link Quality\nEstimation (WLQE), which predicts the communication quality of wireless\nnetworks in advance, plays a crucial role in this context. In this paper, we\npropose a novel WLQE model for estimating the communication quality of wireless\nnetworks by leveraging sequential information.

Nevertheless, a\nprevalent limitation in existing models is overemphasizing the current input\nwhile ignoring the information from the entire dataset. We introduce an\ninnovative Retriever-Dictionary (RD) module to address this issue. This\narchitecture enables YOLO-based models to efficiently retrieve features from a\nDictionary that contains the insight of the dataset, which is built by the\nknowledge from Visual Models (VM), Large Language Models (LLM), or Visual\nLanguage Models (VLM). The flexible RD enables the model to incorporate such\nexplicit knowledge that enhances the ability to benefit multiple tasks,\nspecifically, segmentation, detection, and classification, from pixel to image\nlevel. The experiments show that using the RD significantly improves model\nperformance, achieving more than a 3\\% increase in mean Average Precision for\nobject detection with less than a 1% increase in model parameters. Beyond\n1-stage object detection models, the RD module improves the effectiveness of\n2-stage models and DETR-based architectures, such as Faster R-CNN and\nDeformable DETR.

Specifically, the mechanical\nentanglement is quantified using logarithmic negativity within the bipartite\nGaussian states of the two mechanical modes. The results show that several key\nparameters, including the parametric phase and nonlinear gain of the\nnon-degenerate optical parametric amplifier, the strength of the squeezing\nreservoir, optomechanical cooperativity, thermal excitation of phonons, and the\ntemperature of mechanical baths, strongly influence the degree of mechanical\nentanglement.

    "abstract": "The increasing use of Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) in computer architecture has\nbrought about new challenges, one of which is the write endurance problem.\nFrequent writes to a particular cache cell in NVM can lead to degradation of\nthe memory cell and reduce its lifespan. To solve this problem, we propose a\nsample-based blocking technique for the Last Level Cache (LLC). Our approach\ninvolves defining a threshold value and sampling a subset of cache sets. If the\nnumber of writes to a way in a sampled set exceeds the threshold, the way is\nblocked, and writes are redirected to other ways. We also maintain a history\nstructure to record the number of writes in a set and a PC-Table to use for\nblocking in unsampled sets. Based on blocking on sampled sets, variance of\nvalues stored in history is used to determine whether blocking had a positive\nimpact or not, and on this basis, value corresponding to instruction pointer is\nincremented or decremented. This value is later used for blocking in unsampled\nsets. Our results show that our approach significantly balances write traffic\nto the cache and improves the overall lifespan of the memory cells while having\nbetter performance to the base-line system.

However, separate training of visual and textual encoders\noften results in a misalignment of the modality. Such misalignment may lead\nmodels to generate content that is absent from the input image, a phenomenon\nreferred to as hallucination. These inaccuracies severely undermine the\ntrustworthiness of MLLMs in real-world applications. Despite attempts to\noptimize text preferences to mitigate this issue, our initial investigation\nindicates that the trustworthiness of MLLMs remains inadequate. Specifically,\nthese models tend to provide preferred answers even when the input image is\nheavily distorted. Analysis of visual token attention also indicates that the\nmodel focuses primarily on the surrounding context rather than the key object\nreferenced in the question. These findings highlight a misalignment between the\nmodalities, where answers inadequately leverage input images. Motivated by our\nfindings, we propose Modality-Fair Preference Optimization (MFPO), which\ncomprises three components: the construction of a multimodal preference dataset\nin which dispreferred images differ from originals solely in key regions; an\nimage reward loss function encouraging the model to generate answers better\naligned with the input images; and an easy-to-hard iterative alignment strategy\nto stabilize joint modality training. Extensive experiments on three\ntrustworthiness benchmarks demonstrate that MFPO significantly enhances the\ntrustworthiness of MLLMs. In particular, it enables the 7B models to attain\ntrustworthiness levels on par with, or even surpass, those of the 13B, 34B, and\nlarger models.",

By incorporating Wachspress shape\nfunctions, a polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method (PSBFEM) was\nproposed to address heat conduction challenges in complex geometries. To\naddress the complexity of traditional methods, this work introduced polygonal\ndiscretization techniques that simplified the topological structure of the\npolyhedral mesh and effectively integrated polyhedral and octree meshes,\nthereby reducing the number of element faces and enhancing mesh efficiency to\naccommodate intricate shapes. The developed formulation supported both\nsteady-state and transient heat conduction analyses and was implemented in\nABAQUS through a user-defined element (UEL). Through a series of numerical\nexamples, the accuracy and convergence of the proposed method were validated.\nThe results indicated that the PSBFEM consistently achieved higher accuracy\nthan the FEM as the mesh was refined. The polyhedral elements offered a\ncomputationally efficient solution for complex simulations, significantly\nreducing computational costs.Additionally, by utilizing the octree mesh parent\nelement acceleration technique, the computational efficiency of PSBFEM\nsurpassed that of the FEM.",

Interestingly, the differential equations arising from many\nsuch models often exhibit a similar form, resulting in qualitatively comparable\nglobal bifurcation patterns. Motivated by this observation, we investigate a\ngeneralized mean-field-type model that provides a unified framework for\nanalysing a range of different models. In particular, we derive analytical\nconditions for the emergence of different bifurcation regimes exhibited by\nthree models of increasing complexity -- ranging from three- and four-body\ninteractions to two connected populations with both pairwise and three-body\ninteractions. For the first two cases, we give a complete characterisation of\nall possible outcomes, along with the corresponding conditions on network and\nepidemic parameters. In the third case, we demonstrate that multistability is\npossible despite only three-body interactions. Our results reveal that single\npopulation models with three-body interactions can only exhibit simple\ntranscritical transitions or bistability, whereas with four-body interactions\nmultistability with two distinct endemic steady states is possible.\nSurprisingly, the two-population model exhibits multistability via symmetry\nbreaking despite three-body interactions only.

We find\nanalytic, closed-form expressions for the transition radii in total intensity,\nLP, and CP, wherein the resultant formulae are composed of ratios of tunable\nimage parameters, with the overall \"scale\" set primarily by the thickness of\nthe direct image. Using these formulae, we compute the transition radii for\ntime-averaged images of M87* simulations at 230 GHz, studying both Magnetically\nArrested Disc (MAD) and Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE) configurations for\nvarious spin and electron heating models.

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have driven a paradigm shift,\nwhere large language models (LLMs) with billions or trillions of parameters are\ntrained on vast datasets, achieving unprecedented success across a series of\nlanguage tasks. However, despite these successes, LLMs still rely on\nprobabilistic modeling, which often captures spurious correlations rooted in\nlinguistic patterns and social stereotypes, rather than the true causal\nrelationships between entities and events. This limitation renders LLMs\nvulnerable to issues such as demographic biases, social stereotypes, and LLM\nhallucinations. These challenges highlight the urgent need to integrate\ncausality into LLMs, moving beyond correlation-driven paradigms to build more\nreliable and ethically aligned AI systems.\n  While many existing surveys and studies focus on utilizing prompt engineering\nto activate LLMs for causal knowledge or developing benchmarks to assess their\ncausal reasoning abilities, most of these efforts rely on human intervention to\nactivate pre-trained models. How to embed causality into the training process\nof LLMs and build more general and intelligent models remains unexplored.\nRecent research highlights that LLMs function as causal parrots, capable of\nreciting causal knowledge without truly understanding or applying it. These\nprompt-based methods are still limited to human interventional improvements.\nThis survey aims to address this gap by exploring how causality can enhance\nLLMs at every stage of their lifecycle-from token embedding learning and\nfoundation model training to fine-tuning, alignment, inference, and\nevaluation-paving the way for more interpretable, reliable, and\ncausally-informed models. Additionally, we further outline six promising future\ndirections to advance LLM development, enhance their causal reasoning\ncapabilities, and address the current limitations these models face.",

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD), detecting specific classes of objects\nusing only their linguistic descriptions (e.g., class names) without any image\nsamples, has garnered significant attention. However, in real-world\napplications, the target class concepts is often hard to describe in text and\nthe only way to specify target objects is to provide their image examples, yet\nit is often challenging to obtain a good number of samples. Thus, there is a\nhigh demand from practitioners for few-shot object detection (FSOD). A natural\nquestion arises: Can the benefits of OVD extend to FSOD for object classes that\nare difficult to describe in text? Compared to traditional methods that learn\nonly predefined classes (referred to in this paper as closed-set object\ndetection, COD), can the extra cost of OVD be justified? To answer these\nquestions, we propose a method to quantify the ``text-describability'' of\nobject detection datasets using the zero-shot image classification accuracy\nwith CLIP. This allows us to categorize various OD datasets with different\ntext-describability and emprically evaluate the FSOD performance of OVD and COD\nmethods within each category. Our findings reveal that: i) there is little\ndifference between OVD and COD for object classes with low text-describability\nunder equal conditions in OD pretraining; and ii) although OVD can learn from\nmore diverse data than OD-specific data, thereby increasing the volume of\ntraining data, it can be counterproductive for classes with\nlow-text-describability. These findings provide practitioners with valuable\nguidance amidst the recent advancements of OVD methods.",

Moreover, this paper further extends it to perform\nclustering via the multiple kernel local regression (CMKLR). We construct the\nkernel level local regression sparse coefficient matrix for each candidate\nkernel, which well characterizes the kernel level manifold structure. We then\naggregate all the kernel level local regression coefficients via linear weights\nand generate the consensus sparse local regression coefficient, which largely\nreduces the number of candidate variables and becomes more robust against\nnoises and outliers within multiple kernel data. Thus, the proposed method\nCMKLR avoids the above two limitations. It only contains one additional\nhyperparameter for tuning. Extensive experimental results show that the\nclustering performance of the proposed method on benchmark datasets is better\nthan that of 10 state-of-the-art multiple kernel clustering methods.",

The larger\nsample provides robust results that are consistent with our first data release.\nAt S/N $\\geq5$, we rediscover 59-91% of clusters in existing catalogs that lie\nin the unmasked area of MC2. The median positional offsets are under 250 kpc,\nand the standard deviation of the redshifts is 0.031(1+z). We fit a\nredshift-dependent power law to the relation between MaDCoWS2 S/N and\nobservables from existing catalogs. Over the redshift ranges where the surveys\noverlap with MaDCoWS2, the lowest scatter is found between S/N and observables\nfrom optical/infrared surveys. We also assess the performance of our method\nusing a mock light cone measuring purity and completeness as a function of\ncluster mass. The purity is above 90%, and we estimate the 50% completeness\nthreshold at a virial mass of log(M/M$_\\odot$)$\\approx14.3$. The completeness\nestimate is uncertain due to the small number of massive halos in the light\ncone, but consistent with the recovery fraction found by comparing to other\ncluster catalogs.",

    "abstract": "Data assimilation will be essential for the management and expansion of\ngeological carbon storage operations. In traditional data assimilation\napproaches a fixed set of geological hyperparameters, such as mean and standard\ndeviation of log-permeability, is often assumed. Such hyperparameters, however,\nmay be highly uncertain in practical CO2 storage applications where\nmeasurements are scarce. In this study, we develop a hierarchical data\nassimilation framework for carbon storage that treats hyperparameters as\nuncertain variables characterized by hyperprior distributions. To deal with the\ncomputationally intractable likelihood function in hyperparameter estimation,\nwe apply a likelihood-free (or simulation-based) inference algorithm,\nspecifically sequential Monte Carlo-based approximate Bayesian computation\n(SMC-ABC), to draw posterior samples of hyperparameters given dynamic\nmonitoring well data. In the second step we use an ensemble smoother with\nmultiple data assimilation (ESMDA) procedure to provide posterior realizations\nof grid-block permeability. To reduce computational costs, a 3D recurrent\nR-U-Net deep learning-based surrogate model is applied for forward function\nevaluations. A rejection sampling (RS) procedure for data assimilation is\napplied to provide reference posterior results. Detailed posterior results from\nSMC-ABC-ESMDA are compared to those from the reference RS method. Close\nagreement is achieved with 'converged' RS results, for two synthetic true\nmodels, in all quantities considered. Importantly, the SMC-ABC-ESMDA procedure\nprovides speedup of 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to RS for the two cases. A\nmodified standalone ESMDA procedure is introduced for comparison purposes. For\nthe same number of function evaluations, the hierarchical approach is shown to\nprovide superior results for posterior hyperparameter distributions and\nmonitoring well pressure predictions.",

However, the\nsupervised learning of SNNs still remains a challenge because the\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) of connected spiking neurons is\ndifficult to implement and interpret in existing backpropagation learning\nschemes. This paper proposes a fractional-order spike-timing-dependent gradient\ndescent (FO-STDGD) learning model by considering a derived nonlinear activation\nfunction that describes the relationship between the quasi-instantaneous firing\nrate and the temporal membrane potentials of nonleaky integrate-and-fire\nneurons.

    "abstract": "Recent experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of storing digital\ninformation in macromolecules such as DNA and protein. However, the DNA storage\nchannel is prone to errors such as deletions, insertions, and substitutions.\nDuring the synthesis and reading phases of DNA strings, many noisy copies of\nthe original string are generated. The problem of recovering the original\nstring from these noisy copies is known as sequence reconstruction. A key\nconcept in this problem is the error ball, which is the set of all possible\nsequences that can result from a limited number of errors applied to the\noriginal sequence. Levenshtein showed that the minimum number of noisy copies\nrequired for a given channel to recover the original sequence is equal to one\nplus the maximum size of the intersection of two error balls. Therefore,\nderiving the size of the error ball for any channel and any sequence is\nessential for solving the sequence reconstruction problem. In DNA storage\nsystems, multiple types of errors such as deletion, insertion and substitution\nin a string could occur simultaneously. In this work, we aim to derive the size\nof the error ball for channels with multiple types of errors and at most three\nedits. Specifically, we consider the channels with single-deletion\ndouble-substitution, single-deletion double-insertion and single-insertion\nsingle-substitution errors.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of software systems and the growing number of reported\nvulnerabilities have emphasized the importance of accurately identifying\nvulnerable code segments. Traditional methods for vulnerability localization,\nsuch as manual code audits or rule-based tools, are often time-consuming and\nlimited in scope, typically focusing on specific programming languages or types\nof vulnerabilities. In recent years, the introduction of large language models\n(LLMs) such as GPT and LLaMA has opened new possibilities for automating\nvulnerability detection. However, while LLMs show promise in this area, they\nface challenges, particularly in maintaining accuracy over longer code\ncontexts. This paper introduces LOVA, a novel framework leveraging the\nself-attention mechanisms inherent in LLMs to enhance vulnerability\nlocalization. Our key insight is that self-attention mechanisms assign varying\nimportance to different parts of the input, making it possible to track how\nmuch attention the model focuses on specific lines of code. In the context of\nvulnerability localization, the hypothesis is that vulnerable lines of code\nwill naturally attract higher attention weights because they have a greater\ninfluence on the model's output. By systematically tracking changes in\nattention weights and focusing on specific lines of code, LOVA improves the\nprecision of identifying vulnerable lines across various programming languages.\nThrough rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate that LOVA\nsignificantly outperforms existing LLM-based approaches, achieving up to a 5.3x\nimprovement in F1-scores. LOVA also demonstrated strong scalability, with up to\na 14.6x improvement in smart contract vulnerability localization across\nlanguages like C, Python, Java, and Solidity.

Recent works primarily rely on supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) using critiques generated by a single LLM like GPT-4.\nHowever, these model-generated critiques often exhibit flaws due to the\ninherent complexity of the critique. Consequently, fine-tuning LLMs on such\nflawed critiques typically limits the model's performance and propagates these\nflaws into the learned model. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes\na novel data generation pipeline, named MultiCritique, that improves the\ncritique ability of LLMs by utilizing multi-agent feedback in both the SFT and\nreinforcement learning (RL) stages. First, our data generation pipeline\naggregates high-quality critiques from multiple agents instead of a single\nmodel, with crucial information as input for simplifying the critique.\nFurthermore, our pipeline improves the preference accuracy of critique quality\nthrough multi-agent feedback, facilitating the effectiveness of RL in improving\nthe critique ability of LLMs. Based on our proposed MultiCritique data\ngeneration pipeline, we construct the MultiCritiqueDataset for the SFT and RL\nfine-tuning stages.

This study proposes a hybrid\ndeep learning model that combines TRIZ innovation theory with GWO, SARIMA and\nLSTM to improve the accuracy of building energy consumption prediction.

However, as the number of retrieved\ndocuments increases, the input length to LLMs grows linearly, causing a\ndramatic increase in latency and a degradation in long-context understanding.\nThis is particularly serious for multi-hop questions that require a chain of\nreasoning across documents. To accelerate inference, reduce costs, and minimize\ndistractions, this paper presents BRIEF (Bridging Retrieval and Inference\nthrough Evidence Fusion), a lightweight approach that performs query-aware\nmulti-hop reasoning by compressing retrieved documents into highly dense\ntextual summaries to integrate into in-context RAG. To enable learning\ncompression for multi-hop reasoning, we curate synthetic data by extracting\natomic propositions that encapsulate distinct factoids from the source\ndocuments to compose synthetic summaries. Based on our synthetic data built\nentirely by open-source models, BRIEF generates more concise summaries and\nenables a range of LLMs to achieve exceptional open-domain question answering\n(QA) performance.

While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart\ncontracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the\nease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of a decompiler\nto reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existing decompilers for\nSui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly\nrecompiled. To address this, we developed the SuiGPT Move AI Decompiler (MAD),\na Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application that decompiles smart\ncontract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and\nre-compilable source code with prompt engineering.\n  Our evaluation shows that MAD's output successfully passes original unit\ntests and achieves a 73.33% recompilation success rate on real-world smart\ncontracts. Additionally, newer models tend to deliver improved performance,\nsuggesting that MAD's approach will become increasingly effective as LLMs\ncontinue to advance.\n  In a user study involving 12 developers, we found that MAD significantly\nreduced the auditing workload compared to using traditional decompilers.\nParticipants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code,\nimproving accessibility for understanding and auditing non-open-source smart\ncontracts. Through qualitative interviews with these developers and Web3\nprojects, we further discussed the strengths and concerns of MAD.\n  MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency,\nauditing, and education.

The\nMagnetotelluric (MT) method is crucial for these tasks, providing critical\ninformation on the distribution of subsurface electrical resistivity at depths\nranging from hundreds to thousands of meters. However, traditional iterative\nalgorithm-based inversion methods require the adjustment of multiple\nparameters, demanding time-consuming and exhaustive tuning processes to achieve\nproper cost function minimization.

Moreover, instead of\nsolving for the subsurface model directly, as classical algorithms perform,\nthis paper presents a new deep unsupervised inversion algorithm guided by\nphysics to estimate 1D MT models. Instead of using datasets with the observed\ndata and their respective model as labels during training, our method employs a\ndifferentiable modeling operator that physically guides the cost function\nminimization, making the proposed method solely dependent on observed data.\nTherefore, the optimization algorithm updates the network weights to minimize\nthe data misfit.

Most rely on a single annotation per video and lexical\nsimilarity-based metrics, failing to capture the variability in human\nperception and the cognitive importance of events. These limitations hinder\naccurate diagnosis of model capabilities in producing coherent, complete, and\nhuman-aligned descriptions. To address this, we introduce FIOVA (Five-In-One\nVideo Annotations), a human-centric benchmark tailored for evaluation. It\ncomprises 3,002 real-world videos (about 33.6s each), each annotated\nindependently by five annotators. This design enables modeling of semantic\ndiversity and inter-subjective agreement, offering a richer foundation for\nmeasuring human-machine alignment. We further propose FIOVA-DQ, an event-level\nevaluation metric that incorporates cognitive weights derived from annotator\nconsensus, providing fine-grained assessment of event relevance and semantic\ncoverage. Leveraging FIOVA, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine\nrepresentative LVLMs and introduce a complexity-aware analysis framework based\non inter-annotator variation (CV). This reveals consistency gaps across\ndifficulty levels and identifies structural issues such as event\nunder-description and template convergence. Our results highlight FIOVA's\ndiagnostic value for understanding LVLM behavior under varying complexity,\nsetting a new standard for cognitively aligned evaluation in long-video\ncaptioning.

    "abstract": "Most research on within-day dynamic traffic equilibrium with information\nprovision implicitly considers travel time information, often assuming\ninformation to be perfect or imperfect based on travelers' perception error.\nHowever, lacking explicit formulation of information limits insightful analysis\nof information impact on dynamic traffic equilibrium and the potential benefits\nof leveraging information provision to improve system-level performance. To\naddress this gap, this paper proposes a within-day dynamic traffic equilibrium\nmodel that explicitly formulates strategic information provision as an\nendogenous element. In the proposed framework, two classes of travelers receive\ndifferent types of travel time information: one class receives instantaneous\ntravel time reflecting the prevailing traffic conditions, while the other class\nreceives strategic forecasts of travel times, generated by accounting for\ntravelers' reactions to instantaneous information based on strategic thinking\nfrom behavioral game theory. The resulting multi-class within-day dynamic\nequilibrium differs from existing models by explicitly modeling information\nprovision and consideration of information consistency. The inherent dynamics\nof real-time updated traffic information, traffic conditions, and travelers'\nchoice behaviors are analytically modeled, with the resulting dynamic\nequilibrium formulated as a fixed-point problem. The theoretical propositions\nand numerical findings offer rich insights into the impact of information on\nthe traffic network, strategic forecast information penetration, the\nrelationship between the proposed equilibrium and traditional dynamic traffic\nequilibria, and information accuracy.

While\nstandard theory assumes that mass is lost in the form of radiation driven,\noptically thick wind (fast wind; FW), recent numerical simulations indicate\nthat most of the mass loss is initiated and shaped by binary interaction. We\nexplore the effect of this binary-driven mass-loss (BDML) on the CV evolutions\nassuming a major fraction of the lost mass leaves the system from the outer\nLagrangian point.

The\nmass transfer rates at a given orbital period occupy a large range, in\nagreement with the observed secular mass transfer rate distribution in CVs.

In addition to well studied\nsingular defects such as point or line disclinations, liquid crystals can also\nhost non-singular solitonic defects such as skyrmions, hopfions, and torons.\nThe solitons, with their localised and stable configurations, offer an\nalternative view into material properties and behaviour of liquid crystals. In\nthis study, we demonstrate that the optical signatures of skyrmions can be\nutilised effectively in machine learning to predict important system\nparameters. Our method focuses specifically on the skyrmion-localised regions,\nreducing significantly the computational cost. By training convolutional neural\nnetworks on simulated polarised optical microscopy images of liquid crystal\nskyrmions, we showcase the ability of trained networks to accurately predict\nseveral selected parameters such as the free energy, cholesteric pitch, and\nstrength of applied electric fields. This study highlights the importance of\nlocalized topologically arrested order parameter configurations for materials\ncharacterisation research empowered by state-of-the-art data science methods,\nand may pave the way for the development of advanced skyrmion-based\napplications.",

    "abstract": "We study a two-stage online reusable resource allocation problem over T days\ninvolving advance reservations and walk-ins. Each day begins with a reservation\nstage (Stage I), where reservation requests arrive sequentially. When service\nstarts (Stage II), both reserved and walk-in customers arrive to check in and\noccupy resources for several days. Reserved customers can cancel without\npenalty before or during a confirmation call initiated by the decision maker\n(DM) before day's end. The DM must immediately accept or reject each booking or\ncheck-in request, potentially overbooking by accepting more reservations than\ncapacity. An overbooking loss occurs if a reserved customer's check-in is\nrejected in Stage II; a reward is obtained for each occupied resource unit\ndaily. Our goal is to develop an online policy that controls bookings and\ncheck-ins to maximize total revenue over the T-day horizon. We show that due to\ncancellation uncertainties and complex correlations between occupancy\ndurations, any online policy incurs a regret of \\Omega(T) compared to the\noffline optimal policy when the \\textit{busy season} assumption does not hold.\nTo address this, we introduce decoupled adaptive safety stocks, which use only\nsingle-day information to hedge against overbooking risks and reduce resource\nidling. Under the busy season condition, our policy decouples the overall\noffline optimal into single-day offline optimal policies. Consequently, the\nregret between our policy and the offline optimal decays exponentially with the\ntime between the confirmation call and day's end, suggesting the DM can delay\nconfirmation calls while maintaining near-optimal performance. We validate our\nalgorithm through sythetic experiments and empirical data from an Algarve\nresort hotel.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive medical procedure\nthat can modulate brain activity, and it is widely used in neuroscience and\nneurology research. Compared to manual operators, robots may improve the\noutcome of TMS due to their superior accuracy and repeatability. However, there\nhas not been a widely accepted standard protocol for performing robotic TMS\nusing fine-segmented brain images, resulting in arbitrary planned angles with\nrespect to the true boundaries of the modulated cortex. Given that the recent\nstudy in TMS simulation suggests a noticeable difference in outcomes when using\ndifferent anatomical details, cortical shape should play a more significant\nrole in deciding the optimal TMS coil pose. In this work, we introduce an\nimage-guided robotic system for TMS that focuses on (1) establishing\nstandardized planning methods and heuristics to define a reference (true zero)\nfor the coil poses and (2) solving the issue that the manual coil placement\nrequires expert hand-eye coordination which often leading to low repeatability\nof the experiments. To validate the design of our robotic system, a phantom\nstudy and a preliminary human subject study were performed. Our results show\nthat the robotic method can half the positional error and improve the\nrotational accuracy by up to two orders of magnitude. The accuracy is proven to\nbe repeatable because the standard deviation of multiple trials is lowered by\nan order of magnitude. The improved actuation accuracy successfully translates\nto the TMS application, with a higher and more stable induced voltage in\nmagnetic field sensors.",

Our empirical validation, conducted across 10\nreal-world datasets, demonstrates the superiority of CF-T2NN over a wide array\nof state-of-the-art methods on various graph benchmarks.
