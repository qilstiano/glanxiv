Inspired by the recent works of\nNojiri and Nashed, we explore a reconstruction procedure for a generic static\nspherically symmetric metric written in the Buchdal parametrization: $ds^2 =\n\\left(A(u)\\right)^{-1}du^2 - A(u)dt^2 + C(u)d\\Omega^2$, with given $A(u) > 0$\nand $C(u) > 0$.

A key role in this approach is played by the\nsolutions to a second order linear differential equation for the function\n$f(\\varphi(u))$. The formalism is illustrated by two examples when: a) the\nSchwarzschild metric and b) the Ellis wormhole metric, are chosen as a starting\npoint.

Under structural\nassumptions, we refine our abstract result by providing an algorithm, of wide\napplicability, for the construction of Lyapunov functionals. This allows us to\nsystematically establish decay estimates for a given system and uncover\nalgebraic cancellations (beyond the reach of the Kalman-based approach)\nreducing the loss of derivatives in high frequencies. To demonstrate the\napplicability of our method, we derive new stability results for the Sugimoto\nmodel, which describes the propagation of nonlinear acoustic waves, and for a\nbeam model of Timoshenko type with memory.",

Joint analyses of lensing and\nstellar kinematics have been widely adopted to break the MSD. A 3D mass and\nstellar tracer population is required to accurately interpret the kinematics\ndata. We aim at forward-modeling the projection effects in strong lensing and\nkinematics observables, and finding the best model assumption for the stellar\nkinematics analysis which leads to unbiased interpretation of the MSD. We\nnumerically simulate the projection and selection effects for both a triaxial\nETG sample from the IllustrisTNG simulation and an axisymmetric sample which\nmatches the properties of slow-rotator galaxies representative of the strong\nlens galaxy population. Using the axisymmetric sample, we generate mock\nkinematics observables with spherically-aligned axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic\nModeling (JAM) and assess kinematic recovery under different model assumptions.\nUsing the triaxial sample, we quantify the random uncertainty introduced by\nmodeling triaxial galaxies with axisymmetric JAM. We show that a spherical JAM\nanalysis of spatially unresolved kinematic data introduces a bias of up to\n2%-4% (depending on the intrinsic shape of the lens) in the inferred MSD. Our\nmodel largely corrects this bias, resulting in a residual random uncertainty in\nthe range of 0-2.1% in the stellar velocity dispersion (0-4.2% in $H_0$)\ndepending on the projected ellipticity and the anisotropy of the stellar\norbits. This residual uncertainty can be further mitigated using spatially\nresolved kinematic data which constrain the intrinsic shape. We also show that\nthe random uncertainty in the velocity dispersion recovery using axisymmetric\nJAM for axisymmetric galaxies is at the level of < 0.17%, and the uncertainty\nusing axisymmetric JAM for triaxial galaxies is at the level of < 0.25%.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have led\nto significant progress in 2D body pose estimation. However, achieving a good\nbalance between accuracy, efficiency, and robustness remains a challenge. For\ninstance, CNNs are computationally efficient but struggle with long-range\ndependencies, while ViTs excel in capturing such dependencies but suffer from\nquadratic computational complexity. This paper proposes two ViT-based models\nfor accurate, efficient, and robust 2D pose estimation. The first one,\nEViTPose, operates in a computationally efficient manner without sacrificing\naccuracy by utilizing learnable joint tokens to select and process a subset of\nthe most important body patches, enabling us to control the trade-off between\naccuracy and efficiency by changing the number of patches to be processed. The\nsecond one, UniTransPose, while not allowing for the same level of direct\ncontrol over the trade-off, efficiently handles multiple scales by combining\n(1) an efficient multi-scale transformer encoder that uses both local and\nglobal attention with (2) an efficient sub-pixel CNN decoder for better speed\nand accuracy. Moreover, by incorporating all joints from different benchmarks\ninto a unified skeletal representation, we train robust methods that learn from\nmultiple datasets simultaneously and perform well across a range of scenarios\n-- including pose variations, lighting conditions, and occlusions. Experiments\non six benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly\noutperform state-of-the-art methods while improving computational efficiency.\nEViTPose exhibits a significant decrease in computational complexity (30% to\n44% less in GFLOPs) with a minimal drop of accuracy (0% to 3.5% less), and\nUniTransPose achieves accuracy improvements ranging from 0.9% to 43.8% across\nthese benchmarks.",

Existing theoretical analyses show that GD with\nArmijo-LS (GD-LS) can result in constant factor improvements over GD with a 1/L\nstep-size (denoted as GD(1/L)). We strengthen these results and show that if\nthe objective function satisfies a certain non-uniform smoothness condition,\nGD-LS can result in a faster convergence rate than GD(1/L).

Furthermore, for\nnon-convex objectives satisfying gradient domination (e.g., those corresponding\nto the softmax policy gradient in RL or generalized linear models with a\nlogistic link function), GD-LS can match the fast convergence of algorithms\ntailored for these specific settings.

Unlike Markov decision processes,\nwhich formalize control problems but not agent design, our framework subsumes\nstandard reinforcement learning structures.

    "authors": [
      "Naveen Mysore"
    ],
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) methods frequently assume that each new\nobservation completely reflects the environment's state, thereby guaranteeing\nMarkovian (one-step) transitions. In practice, partial observability or\nsensor/actuator noise often invalidates this assumption. This paper proposes a\nsystematic methodology for detecting such violations, combining a partial\ncorrelation-based causal discovery process (PCMCI) with a novel Markov\nViolation score (MVS). The MVS measures multi-step dependencies that emerge\nwhen noise or incomplete state information disrupts the Markov property.\n  Classic control tasks (CartPole, Pendulum, Acrobot) serve as examples to\nillustrate how targeted noise and dimension omissions affect both RL\nperformance and measured Markov consistency. Surprisingly, even substantial\nobservation noise sometimes fails to induce strong multi-lag dependencies in\ncertain domains (e.g., Acrobot). In contrast, dimension-dropping investigations\nshow that excluding some state variables (e.g., angular velocities in CartPole\nand Pendulum) significantly reduces returns and increases MVS, while removing\nother dimensions has minimal impact.\n  These findings emphasize the importance of locating and safeguarding the most\ncausally essential dimensions in order to preserve effective single-step\nlearning. By integrating partial correlation tests with RL performance\noutcomes, the proposed approach precisely identifies when and where the Markov\nassumption is violated. This framework offers a principled mechanism for\ndeveloping robust policies, informing representation learning, and addressing\npartial observability in real-world RL scenarios.

    "abstract": "A unified video and action model holds significant promise for robotics,\nwhere videos provide rich scene information for action prediction, and actions\nprovide dynamics information for video prediction. However, effectively\ncombining video generation and action prediction remains challenging, and\ncurrent video generation-based methods struggle to match the performance of\ndirect policy learning in action accuracy and inference speed. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce the Unified Video Action model (UVA), which jointly optimizes\nvideo and action predictions to achieve both high accuracy and efficient action\ninference. The key lies in learning a joint video-action latent representation\nand decoupling video-action decoding. The joint latent representation bridges\nthe visual and action domains, effectively modeling the relationship between\nvideo and action sequences. Meanwhile, the decoupled decoding, powered by two\nlightweight diffusion heads, enables high-speed action inference by bypassing\nvideo generation during inference. Such a unified framework further enables\nversatile functionality through masked input training. By selectively masking\nactions or videos, a single model can tackle diverse tasks beyond policy\nlearning, such as forward and inverse dynamics modeling and video generation.\nVia an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that UVA can serve as a\ngeneral-purpose solution for a wide range of robotics tasks, such as policy\nlearning, forward/inverse dynamics and video observation prediction, without\ncompromising performance compared to methods tailored for specific\napplications.

Apart from its importance as\na secondary distance indicator, the TFR relation serves as a test for galaxy\nevolution models, because it connects the baryonic and dark matter components\nof galaxies. We aim at simulating the multi-wavelength TFR relation from UV to\nmid-infrared wavelengths for the TNG50 cosmological simulation at $z = 0$, and\nat comparing the results with observational TFR studies. We want to compare the\nwavelength dependence of the slope and scatter with the observed values, and\nsearch for secondary parameters that reduce the scatter in the TFR. We select a\nlarge sample of simulated late-type, disc-dominated galaxies from the TNG50\nsimulation. For each galaxy, we use the SKIRT radiative transfer code to\ngenerate realistic synthetic global fluxes in 12 UV to mid-infrared broadbands\nand synthetic integrated HI line profiles. We use bivariate linear regression\nto determine the TFR in each band, and we search for a second TFR parameter by\ncorrelating the residuals with different physical parameters. Our TNG50 TFR\nreproduces the characteristic behaviour of the observed TFR in many studies:\nthe TFR becomes steeper and tighter as we move from UV/optical to infrared\nwavelengths.

The\n${\\textit{u}} - {\\textit{r}}$ colour or the sSFR can significantly reduce the\nscatter in the UV and optical bands.

In particular, Josephson-based Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers\n(JTWPA) have shown record bandwidth with added noise close to the quantum\nlimit. In this work, we report the appearance of echo signals emitted by JTWPAs\ndriven by trains of high-power pulses exceeding their dynamical range. we\nexplore the case of weak signals generated through high power pulses. By\nsending a train of such high-power pulses, beyond the 1 dB compression point of\nsuch amplifiers, we observe the appearance of echoes, solely due to the JTWPA.\nThese echoes have micro-second coherence and we attribute their origin to\nmicroscopic defects in the amplifier dielectric layer. By analyzing the power\nand the coherence of the echo signal as a function of temperature, we estimate\nthe dielectric loss brought by these defects, and their impact on the JTWPA\nquantum efficiency. We introduce a mitigation technique (BLAST) to prevent the\nappearance of these echoes, consisting in an additional high-power tone sent\nconcurrently with each pulse. We demonstrate that it suppresses the spurious\ndefect signals and we recover the typical gain and noise figure within 95% of\ntheir low-power values in 300 ns.

If the shape is narrow in frequency this can be done\nby pulsed homodyne detection, in which the mode and a matched local oscillator\n(LO) interfere on a beamsplitter, whose output ports are monitored by\nphoto-detectors. The quadrature value is proportional to the difference between\nthe photo-detectors' signals. When the shape of the mode is broad in frequency,\nthe lack of uniform response of the detectors across the spectrum prevents\ndirect application of this technique. We show that pulsed homodyne detection\ncan be generalized to broadband pulsed (BBP) homodyne detection setups with\ndetectors such as calorimeters that detect total energy instead of total number\nof photons. This generalization has applications in quantum measurements of\nfemtosecond pulses, and, speculatively, measurements of Rindler modes to verify\nthe temperature of Unruh radiation. Like pulsed homodyne detection, BBP\nhomodyne detection requires choosing the LO pulse such that the subtracted\nsignal approaches the desired quadrature measurement for large LO amplitudes. A\ndistinctive feature of the technique is that the LO pulse does not belong to\nthe mode of the quadrature being measured. We analyze how the implemented\nmeasurement approaches an ideal quadrature measurement with growing LO\namplitude. We prove that the moments of the measurement converge to the moments\nof the quadrature and that the measurement distributions converge weakly.",

To address this challenge, we propose a safety\nsteering framework grounded in safe control theory, ensuring invariant safety\nin multi-turn dialogues. Our approach models the dialogue with LLMs using\nstate-space representations and introduces a novel neural barrier function\n(NBF) to detect and filter harmful queries emerging from evolving contexts\nproactively.

Firstly, we show that\nhot-spot magnetization alters the radial temperature profile, increasing the\ncentral peakedness which is most pronounced for moderately magnetized\nimplosions (with 8-14 T applied field), compared to both unmagnetized (with no\napplied field) and highly magnetized (with 26 T or higher applied field)\nimplosions. This model explains the trend in the experimental data which finds\na similarly altered temperature profile in the 12 T experiment. Next, we derive\nthe hot-spot model for gas-filled (Symcap) implosions, accounting for the\neffects of magnetization on the thermal conduction and in changing the radial\ntemperature (and density) profiles. Using this model, we compute predicted\ncentral temperature amplification and yield enhancement scaling with the\napplied magnetic field. The central temperature fits the experimental data\naccurately, and the discrepancy in the yield suggests a systematic (independent\nof applied field) degradation such as mix, and additional degradation in the\nreference unmagnetized shot such as reduced laser drive, increased implosion\nasymmetry, or the magnetic field suppressing ablator mixing into the hot-spot.",

The analysis focuses on the momentum spectra in\ntwo different choices of adiabatic mode functions, which are related by a\nWronskian normalization condition. Oscillations in the momentum spectra are\nattributed to quantum interference effects in the adiabatic number basis. A\nnovel dynamical scaling behavior emerges when examining the oscillatory\nmomentum spectra of pairs created by a Sauter pulsed field at intermediate\ntimes. While the oscillatory spectra are observed at distinct times in the two\ndifferent choices, they overlap when time is rescaled by the point marking the\ninitiation of the first occurrence of the Residual ParticleAntiparticle Plasma\n(RPAP) stage (or end of the transient stage) for the central momentum case.\nThis scaling identifies the approximate time at which real\nparticle-antiparticle pair formation becomes possible, shifting the focus from\nasymptotic times to finite-time dynamics.

The four-process cycle version, which comprises a water\npump section, a boiler/superheater section, a steam turbine section, and a\ncondenser section, was considered. The performance of this thermodynamic power\ncycle depends on several design parameters. This study varied a single\nindependent variable, the absolute pressure of the condenser, by a factor of\n256, from 0.78125 to 200 kPa. The peak pressure and peak temperature in the\ncycle were fixed at 50 bar (5,000 kPa) and 600{\\deg}C, respectively,\ncorresponding to a base case with a base value for the condenser's absolute\npressure of 12.5 kPa (0.125 bar).

However, current research on CNP suffers from the issues of\nlimited CNP training data and low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a\nzero-shot and efficient CNP framework (Zef-CNP), in which we first prompt large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in a zero-shot manner to generate two sets of synthetic\nqueries: ambiguous and specific (unambiguous) queries. We then use the\ngenerated queries to train efficient CNP models. Zef-CNP eliminates the need\nfor human-annotated clarification-need labels during training and avoids the\nuse of LLMs with high query latency at query time. To further improve the\ngeneration quality of synthetic queries, we devise a topic-, information-need-,\nand query-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy (TIQ-CoT). Moreover,\nwe enhance TIQ-CoT with counterfactual query generation (CoQu), which guides\nLLMs first to generate a specific/ambiguous query and then sequentially\ngenerate its corresponding ambiguous/specific query. Experimental results show\nthat Zef-CNP achieves superior CNP effectiveness and efficiency compared with\nzero- and few-shot LLM-based CNP predictors.",

Restaking networks let validators secure multiple services by\nreusing stake. These networks have quickly gained traction, leveraging over\n\\$20 billion in stake. However, restaking introduces a new attack vector where\nvalidators can coordinate to misbehave across multiple services simultaneously,\nextracting digital assets while forfeiting their stake only once.\n  Previous work focused either on preventing coordinated misbehavior or on\nprotecting services if all other services are Byzantine and might unjustly\ncause slashing due to bugs or malice. The first model overlooks how a single\nByzantine service can collapse the network, while the second ignores\nshared-stake benefits.\n  To bridge the gap, we analyze the system as a strategic game of coordinated\nmisbehavior, when a given fraction of the services are Byzantine. We introduce\nelastic restaking networks, where validators can allocate portions of their\nstake that may cumulatively exceed their total stake, and when allocations are\nlost, the remaining stake stretches to cover remaining allocations. We show\nthat elastic networks exhibit superior robustness compared to previous\napproaches, and demonstrate a synergistic effect where an elastic restaking\nnetwork enhances its blockchain's security, contrary to community concerns of\nan opposite effect in existing networks.

This manuscript explores how the\nconvergence of agentic AI and Frontier AI is transforming cybersecurity by\nreimagining frameworks such as the cyber kill chain, enhancing threat\nintelligence processes, and embedding robust ethical governance within\nautomated response systems. Drawing on real-world data and forward looking\nperspectives, we examine the roles of real time monitoring, automated incident\nresponse, and perpetual learning in forging a resilient, dynamic defense\necosystem. Our vision is to harmonize technological innovation with unwavering\nethical oversight, ensuring that future AI driven security solutions uphold\ncore human values of fairness, transparency, and accountability while\neffectively countering emerging cyber threats.",

    "abstract": "The study of collisionless shocks and their role in cosmic ray acceleration\nhas gained importance through observations and simulations, driving interest in\nreproducing these conditions in laboratory experiments using high-power lasers.\nIn this work, we examine the role of three-dimensional (3D) effects in ion\nacceleration in quasi-perpendicular shocks under laboratory-relevant\nconditions. Using hybrid particle-in-cell simulations (kinetic ions and fluid\nelectrons), we explore how the Alfv\\'enic and sonic Mach numbers, along with\nplasma beta, influence ion energization, unlocked only in 3D, and establish\nscaling criteria for when conducting 3D simulations is necessary. Our results\nshow that efficient ion acceleration requires Alfv\\'enic Mach numbers $\\geq 25$\nand sonic Mach numbers $\\geq 13$, with plasma-$\\beta \\leq 5$. We theoretically\nfound that, while 2D simulations suffice for current laboratory-accessible\nshock conditions, 3D effects become crucial for shock velocities exceeding 1000\nkm/s and experiments sustaining the shock for at least 10 ns. We surveyed\nprevious laboratory experiments on collisionless shocks and found that 3D\neffects are unimportant under those conditions, implying that 1D and 2D\nsimulations should be enough to model the accelerated ion spectra. However, we\ndo find that the same experiments are realistically close to accessing the\nregime relevant to 3D effects, an exciting prospect for future laboratory\nefforts. We propose modifications to past experimental configurations to\noptimize and control 3D effects on ion acceleration. These proposed experiments\ncould be used to benchmark plasma astrophysics kinetic codes and/or employed as\ncontrollable sources of energetic particles.",

PreMind first\nsegments videos into slide-presentation segments using a Vision-Language Model\n(VLM) to enhance modern shot-detection techniques.

Three\ninnovative mechanisms are also proposed to improve performance: leveraging\nprior lecture knowledge to refine visual understanding, detecting/correcting\nspeech transcription errors using a VLM, and utilizing a critic agent for\ndynamic iterative self-reflection in vision analysis. Compared to traditional\nvideo indexing methods, PreMind captures rich, reliable multimodal information,\nallowing users to search for details like abbreviations shown only on slides.\nSystematic evaluations on the public LPM dataset and an internal enterprise\ndataset are conducted to validate PreMind's effectiveness, supported by\ndetailed analyses.",

    "abstract": "The crew rostering problem (CRP) for pilots is a complex crew scheduling task\nassigning pairings, or sequences of flights starting and ending at the same\nairport, to pilots to create a monthly schedule. In this paper, we propose an\ninnovative solution method for the CRP that uses a windowing approach. First,\nusing a combination of machine learning (ML) and combinatorial optimisation\n(CO), we quickly generate an initial solution. The solution is obtained with a\nsequential assignment procedure (\\textit{seqAsg}) based on a neural network\ntrained by an evolutionary algorithm. Then, this initial solution is\nreoptimized using a branch-and-price algorithm that relies on a windowing\nscheme to quickly obtain a CRP solution. This windowing method consists of\ndecomposing the optimization horizon into several overlapping windows, and then\noptimizing each one sequentially. Although windowing has been successfully used\nin other airline applications, it had never been implemented for the CRP, due\nto its large number of horizontal constraints involving the whole planning\nhorizon. We test our approach on two large real-world instances, and show that\nour method is over ten times faster than the state-of-the-art branch-and-price\nCRP solver GENCOL while providing solutions on average less than 1% away from\noptimality. We show that our windowing approach greatly benefits from being\ninitialized with good-quality ML-based solutions. This is because the initial\nsolution provides reliable information on the following windows, allowing the\nsolver to better optimize the current one. For this reason, this approach\noutperforms other naive heuristics, including stand-alone ML or windowing.",

The growth\nrate of density fluctuations determines the amplitude of overdensities that\ncollapse to form galaxies. Late-time modifications of growth, combined with\nmeasurements at both $z\\sim 1$ from large-scale structure and $z\\sim 1000$ from\nthe cosmic microwave background, affect the predictions for the abundance of\nfirst galaxies in the universe. In this paper, we point out that the late-time\ngrowth rate of structure affects the statistical significance of high-redshift,\nhigh-mass objects very weakly.

The effect was analyzed by both URANS calculations as well as by\ndata-driven methods such as the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). The results\nof the investigation showed that the effect, termed jet-buffet, is decoupled\nfrom the dominant shockwave located upstream, indicating that the jet can no\nlonger augment the wing's circulation, and thus the termination of circulation\ncontrol. Furthermore, it was found that the governing mechanism of the\nbi-stability originated from a feedback of pressure propagating between the\ntrailing-edge shockwave and the downstream separation bubble produced by the\njet, as well as a secondary feedback governing the pressure redistribution due\nto the detachment cycle. It was concluded that the bi-stability can not only be\ncaptured by URANS effectively but also approximated using a Reduced Order Model\nvia 2% of the total modes, which encapsulate 25% of the modal influence as well\nas reconstructing the pressure field with 98% accuracy.",

This paper develops AMuLeT, the first tool\ncapable of testing secure speculation countermeasures for speculative leakage\nearly in their design phase in simulators.

AMuLeT speeds up\ntest throughput by more than 10x compared to a naive design and uses techniques\nto amplify vulnerabilities to uncover them within a limited test budget. Using\nAMuLeT, we launch for the first time, a systematic, large-scale testing\ncampaign of four secure speculation countermeasures from 2018 to\n2024--InvisiSpec, CleanupSpec, STT, and SpecLFB--and uncover 3 known and 6\nunknown bugs and vulnerabilities, within 3 hours of testing.

Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector\n(CLICdet) model for the initial training set and demonstrate successful\nknowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future\nCircular Collider in electron-positron mode. We show that with an order of\nmagnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same\nperformance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and\nevent-level performance metrics, including jet and missing transverse momentum\nresolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable\nperformance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level\nmetrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from\nscratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar\nreconstruction performance.

We investigate the origin and evolution of this structure by (i)\ncharacterizing its 3D morphology and kinematics and (ii) identifying the\nphysical mechanisms driving its formation. Using high-resolution hydrodynamic\n(HD) and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we model the evolution of a\nneutrino-driven SN from explosion to a remnant age of 1000 years. The initial\nconditions, set just after shock breakout, are based on a 3D neutrino-driven SN\nmodel matching Cas A's basic properties. We find that magnetic fields have\nlittle impact on unshocked ejecta evolution, so we focus on HD simulations. A\nweb-like filamentary structure, consistent with JWST observations (down to\n$\\sim 0.01$ pc), naturally forms during the explosion. These filaments arise\nfrom early post-collapse processes, including neutrino-heated bubble expansion,\nhydrodynamic instabilities during blast propagation, and the Ni-bubble effect\nafter shock breakout. The reverse shock later disrupts the filaments via\nhydrodynamic instabilities, rendering them unobservable by $\\sim 700$ years.\nOur models suggest that JWST-detected filaments in Cas A preserve a 'memory' of\nearly explosion conditions, tracing processes active during and immediately\nafter the SN event.

One of the more\neffective mechanisms that humans use to coordinate with one another is theory\nof mind (ToM). ToM can be described as the ability to `take someone else's\nperspective and make estimations of their beliefs, desires and intentions, in\norder to make sense of their behaviour and attitudes towards the world'. If\nleveraged properly, this skill can be very useful in Human-AI collaboration.\n  This introduces the question how we implement ToM when building an AI system.\nHumans and AI Systems work quite differently, and ToM is a multifaceted\nconcept, each facet rooted in different research traditions across the\ncognitive and developmental sciences. We observe that researchers from\nartificial intelligence and the computing sciences, ourselves included, often\nhave difficulties finding their way in the ToM literature. In this paper, we\nidentify four common misconceptions around ToM that we believe should be taken\ninto account when developing an AI system.

    "abstract": "We present the COSMOS Spectroscopic Redshift Compilation encompassing ~ 20\nyears of spectroscopic redshifts within the 2 deg$^2$ COSMOS legacy field. This\ncompilation contains 165,312 redshifts of 97,929 unique objects from 108\nindividual observing programs up to $z \\sim 8$ with median stellar mass $\\sim\n10^{9}$ to $10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ (redshift dependent). Rest-frame $NUVrJ$ colors\nand SFR -- stellar mass correlations show the compilation primarily contains\nlow- to intermediate-mass star-forming and massive, quiescent galaxies at $z <\n1.25$ and mostly low-mass bursty star-forming galaxies at $z > 2$. Sources in\nthe compilation cover a diverse range of environments, including protoclusters\nsuch as ``Hyperion''. The full compilation is 50\\% spectroscopically complete\nby $i \\sim 23.2$ and $K_s \\sim 21.3$ mag; however, this is redshift dependent.\nSpatially, the compilation is $>50$\\% complete within the CANDELS area, while\nthe outer regions of COSMOS are $>10$\\% complete limited to $i < 24$ mag and\n$K_S < 22.5$ mag, separately. We demonstrate how the compilation can be used to\nvalidate photometric redshifts and investigate calibration metrics. By training\nself-organizing maps on COSMOS2020/Classic and projecting the compilation onto\nit, we find key galaxy subpopulations that currently lack spectroscopic\ncoverage including $z < 1$ intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies and\nlow-/intermediate-mass bursty star-forming galaxies, $z \\sim 2$ massive\nquiescent galaxies, and $z > 3$ massive star-forming galaxies. This approach\nhighlights how combining self-organizing maps with our compilation can provide\nguidance for future spectroscopic observations to get a complete spectroscopic\nview of galaxy populations. Lastly, the compilation will undergo periodic data\nreleases that incorporate new spectroscopic redshift measurements, providing a\nlasting legacy resource for the community.",

While\nunstable LRs are relevant for the observation of black hole images, stable LRs\nhave been suspected to trigger instabilities, namely in exotic compact objects\nthat could mimic black holes. The underlying mechanism behind this instability\nremains poorly understood, but a key missing piece is how the backreaction of a\nperturbation around the stable LR modifies the surrounding spacetime. In this\nwork, some progress in this direction is provided by examining a conceptually\nsimple, yet instructive, toy model: continuum-shell stars, supported solely by\ntangential pressures. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we show how\nperturbations around the stable LR deepen the geodesic potential and shifts its\nlocation inward, potentially amplifying any instability associated with the LR.\nBy then extending the analysis to more general stars with nonzero radial\npressure, we find that the same phenomenon can be expected to persist under\nreasonable assumptions.",

The number of isotopes formed requires solving a large set of\nfully-coupled stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs), making the\nsimulations computationally intensive and prone to numerical instability. To\novercome this barrier, we design a nuclear neural network (NNN) framework with\nmultiple hidden layers to emulate nucleosynthesis calculations and conduct a\nproof-of-concept to evaluate its performance. The NNN takes the temperature,\ndensity and composition of a burning region as input and predicts the resulting\nisotopic abundances along with the energy generation and loss rates. We\ngenerate training sets for initial conditions corresponding to oxygen core\ndepletion and beyond using large nuclear reaction networks, and compare the\npredictions of the NNNs to results from a commonly used small net. We find that\nthe NNNs improve the accuracy of the electron fraction by $280-660\\:\\%$, the\naverage atomic and mass numbers by $150-360 \\%$ and the nuclear energy\ngeneration by $250-750\\:\\%$, consistently outperforming the small network\nacross all timesteps. They also achieve significantly better predictions of\nneutrino losses on relatively short timescales, with improvements ranging from\n$100-10^{6}\\:\\%$.

We used the TNG50 cosmological\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulation and its Lagrangian tracer particles to explore\nand quantify the origin of gas that ultimately forms the in situ stars of\ngalaxies. We tracked back the baryonic mass contributing to the $z=0$ in situ\nstellar populations of galaxies, studying trends in mass from dwarfs to\ngroup-scale halos. We find that more massive halos acquire this matter earlier\nthan lower-mass halos, reflecting an overall earlier assembly of their in situ\nstellar mass. Defining the Lagrangian half-mass radius R$_{\\rm L, 1/2}$ of a\ngalaxy as the distance containing half of the mass that will form its in situ\nstars by $z=0$, we find that R$_{\\rm L, 1/2}$ is larger for more massive halos\nat early times, reflecting larger \"in situ Lagrangian regions.\" However, the\ndependence of this radius on halo mass becomes flat at $z \\simeq 3$ and then\ninverts toward $z=0$. In addition, R$_{\\rm L, 1/2}$ increases rapidly with\nredshift, surpassing the virial radii of halos at $z \\sim 2$. This marks the\ncosmic epoch at which most of the gas that eventually forms the in situ stars\nof galaxies leaves the intergalactic medium (IGM) and enters halos, a\ntransition that occurs earlier for more massive halos. The formation redshift\nof the in situ stellar component increases with halo mass, while the formation\nredshift of the dark matter halo decreases, indicative of a differential\nassembly history between these two components. Finally, we decomposed the $z=0$\nin situ stellar mass into its distinct modes of accretion. Smooth accretion\nfrom the IGM is the most important for low-mass galaxies, while mergers and\nsatellite-stripped gas become relevant and even dominant only for high-mass\ngalaxies.",

To study\nshort-term star-formation variability, or ''burstiness'', we isolate the\nscatter on timescales shorter than 50 Myr. The short-term scatter is larger at\nhigher redshift, indicating that star formation is indeed more bursty in the\nearly Universe. We identify two starburst modes: (i) externally driven, where\nrapid large-scale inflows trigger and fuel prolonged, extreme star formation\nepisodes, and (ii) internally driven, where cyclical ejection and re-accretion\nof the interstellar medium in low-mass galaxies drive bursts, even under\nrelatively steady large-scale inflow. Both modes occur at all redshifts, but\nthe increased burstiness of galaxies at higher redshift is due to the\nincreasing prevalence of the more extreme external mode of star formation.",

However, various other\nmodels of inflation predict deviations from this behaviour, motivating a\ndata-driven approach to reconstruct the PPS and constrain its shape. In this\nwork, we present a novel method that employs a fully differentiable pipeline to\nreconstruct the PPS using Gaussian Processes and uses neural network emulators\nfor fast and differentiable theoretical predictions. By leveraging\ngradient-based sampling techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, our\napproach efficiently samples the high-dimensional parameter space of\ncosmological parameters and the free-form PPS, enabling joint constraints on\nboth. Applying this framework to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\ntemperature anisotropy data we find our reconstructed PPS to be consistent with\nnear scale-invariance on small scales, while exhibiting large uncertainties at\nlarge scales, driven mostly by cosmic variance. Our results show an\noverestimation of the PPS amplitude compared to $\\Lambda$CDM predictions from\nthe Planck 2018 analysis, which we attribute to our choice of a wider prior on\nthe optical depth $\\tau$ based on Planck 2015 measurements. Adopting a prior\nconsistent with Planck 2018 measurements brings our results into full agreement\nwith previous work. To ensure robustness of our results, we validate our\ndifferentiable pipeline against a non-differentiable framework, and also\ndemonstrate that our results are insensitive to the choice of Gaussian process\nhyperparameters. These promising results and the flexibility of our pipeline\nmake it ideally suited for application to additional data sets such as CMB\npolarisation as well as Large-Scale Structure probes, thus moving towards\nmulti-probe primordial power spectrum reconstruction.",

Precise measurements of $H_0$ stand as one of the most\npressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires\nprecise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling\nprocess to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a\ncritical step toward reducing uncertainty in $H_0$ comes from increasing the\nprecision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable.\nWe present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST\ndata, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033--4723. While the primary\nsource of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the\nmass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on\nhow the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also\nthe primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of\ndifferent PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we\nrecover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based\nmodels, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through\nimplementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding\nprecision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase\nin precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing\nuncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3%\n($1\\sigma$ of the modeling error) shift of $H_0$ towards a higher value for\nthis lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the\ngroundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the\ngroundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful\nconstraints on $H_0$.",

    "abstract": "Standard Model (SM) with 15 Weyl fermions per family (lacking the 16th, the\nsterile right-handed neutrino $\\nu_R$) suffers from mixed gauge-gravitational\nanomalies tied to baryon number plus or minus lepton number ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf\nL}$ symmetry. Including $\\nu_R$ per family can cancel these anomalies, but when\n${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$ symmetry is preserved as discrete finite subgroups rather\nthan a continuous U(1), the perturbative local anomalies become nonperturbative\nglobal anomalies. In this work, we systematically enumerate these\ngauge-gravitational global anomalies involving discrete ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$\nthat are enhanced from the fermion parity $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}$ to\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$, with $N=2,3,4,6,9$, etc. The ${\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L}$\ndiscreteness is constrained by multi-fermion deformations beyond-the-SM and the\nfamily number $N_f$. Unlike the free quadratic $\\nu_R$ Majorana mass gap\npreserving the minimal $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}$, we explore novel scenarios\ncanceling $({\\bf B} \\pm {\\bf L})$-gravitational anomalies while preserving the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$ discrete symmetries, featuring 4d interacting gapped\ntopological orders (potentially with or without low-energy TQFT descriptions)\nor gapless sectors (e.g., conformal field theories). We propose anomalous\nsectors as quantum dark matter to cancel SM's global anomalies. We find the\n$N_f=3$ uniqueness, when the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2N}^{\\rm F}$ representation from the\nfaithful ${\\bf B} + {\\bf L}$ for baryons at $N=N_c=3$ is extended to the\nfaithful ${\\bf Q} + N_c {\\bf L}$ for quarks at $N=N_c N_f=9$, this symmetry\nextension matches with the topological order dark matter construction.

(2) dark matter as topological order quantum matter with\ngapped anyon excitations at ends of extended defects. (3) topological\nleptogenesis.",

To\ncomplete the picture on wave propagation, an empirical dependence between the\nwave attenuation and the last four dimensionless groups mentioned above is\nfound for non-linear long surface waves. We conclude quantitatively about all\nthe viscosity effects in non-linear long wave propagation.",

Given\nits longer data-taking period and larger effective area relative to KM3NeT,\nIceCube should have observed events around that energy. This tension has\nrecently been quantified to lie between $2\\sigma$ and $3.5\\sigma$, depending on\nthe neutrino source. A $\\mathscr{O}(100)$ PeV neutrino detected at KM3NeT has\ntraversed approximately $147$ km of rock and sea en route to the detector,\nwhereas neutrinos arriving from the same location in the sky would have only\ntraveled through about $14$ km of ice before reaching IceCube. We use this\ndifference in propagation distance to address the tension between KM3NeT and\nIceCube. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which the source emits sterile\nneutrinos that partially convert to active neutrinos through oscillations. We\nscrutinize two such realizations, one where a new physics matter potential\ninduces a resonance in sterile-to-active transitions and another one where\noff-diagonal neutrino non-standard interactions are employed. In both cases,\nsterile-to-active neutrino oscillations become relevant at length scales of\n$\\sim100$ km, resulting in increased active neutrino flux near the KM3NeT\ndetector, alleviating the tension between KM3NeT and IceCube.

    "abstract": "Persuasive dialogue plays a pivotal role in human communication, influencing\nvarious domains. Recent persuasive dialogue datasets often fail to align with\nreal-world interpersonal interactions, leading to unfaithful representations.\nFor instance, unrealistic scenarios may arise, such as when the persuadee\nexplicitly instructs the persuader on which persuasion strategies to employ,\nwith each of the persuadee's questions corresponding to a specific strategy for\nthe persuader to follow. This issue can be attributed to a violation of the\n\"Double Blind\" condition, where critical information is fully shared between\nparticipants. In actual human interactions, however, key information such as\nthe mental state of the persuadee and the persuasion strategies of the\npersuader is not directly accessible. The persuader must infer the persuadee's\nmental state using Theory of Mind capabilities and construct arguments that\nalign with the persuadee's motivations. To address this gap, we introduce\nToMMA, a novel multi-agent framework for dialogue generation that is guided by\ncausal Theory of Mind. This framework ensures that information remains\nundisclosed between agents, preserving \"double-blind\" conditions, while causal\nToM directs the persuader's reasoning, enhancing alignment with human-like\npersuasion dynamics. Consequently, we present CToMPersu, a multi-domain,\nmulti-turn persuasive dialogue dataset that tackles both double-blind and\nlogical coherence issues, demonstrating superior performance across multiple\nmetrics and achieving better alignment with real human dialogues.

    "abstract": "Forecasting violent rockbursts remains a formidable challenge due to\nsignificant uncertainties involved. One major uncertainty arises from the\nintermittency of rock failure processes, typically characterised by a series of\nprogressively shorter quiescent phases punctuated by sudden accelerations,\nrather than a smooth continuous progression towards the final breakdown. This\nnon-monotonic evolution of rock mass deformation complicates rockburst\nprediction, challenging conventional time-to-failure models that often assume a\nsmooth power law accelerating behaviour. Here, we introduce a generalised\ntime-to-failure model called log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model\nto effectively capture the intermittent dynamics of damage and rupture\nprocesses in rock leading up to violent rockbursts. We perform parametric and\nnonparametric tests on 11 historical rockburst events at three underground\nmines, documenting empirical evidence and providing theoretical arguments to\ndemonstrate the significance of log-periodic oscillatory power law finite-time\nsingularities. Log-periodicity in these rockburst events is likely driven by\nthe interaction of subparallel propagating cracks, the diffusion of\nstress-triggering processes, or the interplay between stress drop and stress\ncorrosion. Our results and insights obtained have significant implications for\nnot only understanding but also forecasting rockbursts, as recognising and\ncharacterising log-periodicity can help transform intermittency from\ntraditionally perceived noise into valuable predictive information.",

This unification enables joint training of both tasks, providing two\nkey advantages: (1) Cross-Task Enhancement: by leveraging shared visual and\nsemantic representations, joint training improves instruction adherence and\nvisual consistency in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based\nediting. (2) Generalization: learning in a unified format facilitates\ncross-task knowledge transfer, enabling MIGE to generalize to novel\ncompositional tasks, including instruction-based subject-driven editing.\nExperiments show that MIGE excels in both subject-driven generation and\ninstruction-based editing while setting a SOTA in the new task of\ninstruction-based subject-driven editing.

Machine learning has the potential\nto guide efficient exploration of the perturbation space and extract novel\ninsights from these data. However, current approaches neglect the semantic\nrichness of the relevant biology, and their objectives are misaligned with\ndownstream biological analyses. In this paper, we hypothesize that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) present a natural medium for representing complex\nbiological relationships and rationalizing experimental outcomes. We propose\nPerturbQA, a benchmark for structured reasoning over perturbation experiments.\nUnlike current benchmarks that primarily interrogate existing knowledge,\nPerturbQA is inspired by open problems in perturbation modeling: prediction of\ndifferential expression and change of direction for unseen perturbations, and\ngene set enrichment. We evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning and\nstatistical approaches for modeling perturbations, as well as standard LLM\nreasoning strategies, and we find that current methods perform poorly on\nPerturbQA.

This proposed design is hereby\nnamed Selig20 Clarkson Ducted Turbine or Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine (SCDT)\ncompared to the original Clarkson Ducted Wind Turbine (CDWT). In both SCDT and\nCDWT configurations, the rotor is placed a distance behind the throat of the\nduct. For in-depth analysis, we employ a flow-driven-rotor (FDR) model of a\ncommercial CFD package, Simerics-MP+, based on unstructured-grid finite-volume\nsolutions of Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations for the\nflow field that are two-way fully coupled with a dynamic solution of the\nrigid-body rotation of the turbine rotor. The FDR model successfully predicts\nthe optimal thrust coefficient, whereas the prescribed rotation model fails to\ndo so. Although the optimal Cp predicted by the FDR model is fairly close to\nthe prediction from the prescribed motion model, FDR is generally more accurate\nin predicting underperformance under ambient wind conditions away from the\noptimal tip speed ratio. FDR offers a new path to simulate ducted wind turbines\nin ambient wind conditions. The Seyi-Chunlei Ducted Turbine is confirmed to\nhave a Cpt peak approximately 7% higher than that of the Clarkson DWT. SCDT\nalso has a wider range of optimal tip speed ratios, enabling it to harvest more\nwind energy under ambient conditions.",

    "abstract": "With the digitalization of power grids, physical equations become\ninsufficient to describe the network's behavior, and realistic but\ntime-consuming simulators must be used. Numerical experiments, such as safety\nvalidation, that involve simulating a large number of scenarios become\ncomputationally intractable. A popular solution to reduce the computational\nburden is to learn a surrogate model of the simulator with Machine Learning\n(ML) and then conduct the experiment directly on the fast-to-evaluate surrogate\nmodel. Among the various ML possibilities for building surrogate models,\nGaussian processes (GPs) emerged as a popular solution due to their\nflexibility, data efficiency, and interpretability. Their probabilistic nature\nenables them to provide both predictions and uncertainty quantification (UQ).\nThis paper starts with a discussion on the interest of using GPs to approximate\npower grid simulators and fasten numerical experiments. Such simulators,\nhowever, often violate the GP's underlying Gaussian assumption, leading to poor\napproximations. To address this limitation, an approach that consists in adding\nan adaptive residual uncertainty term to the UQ is proposed. It enables the GP\nto remain accurate and reliable despite the simulator's non-Gaussian behaviors.\nThis approach is successfully applied to the certification of the proper\nfunctioning of a congestion management controller, with over 98% of simulations\navoided.",

    "abstract": "There is strong empirical evidence that the state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodeling paradigm leads to models that memorize the training set, especially\nwhen the training set is small. Prior methods to mitigate the memorization\nproblem often lead to a decrease in image quality. Is it possible to obtain\nstrong and creative generative models, i.e., models that achieve high\ngeneration quality and low memorization? Despite the current pessimistic\nlandscape of results, we make significant progress in pushing the trade-off\nbetween fidelity and memorization. We first provide theoretical evidence that\nmemorization in diffusion models is only necessary for denoising problems at\nlow noise scales (usually used in generating high-frequency details). Using\nthis theoretical insight, we propose a simple, principled method to train the\ndiffusion models using noisy data at large noise scales. We show that our\nmethod significantly reduces memorization without decreasing the image quality,\nfor both text-conditional and unconditional models and for a variety of data\navailability settings.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Forecasting volcanic eruptions remains a formidable challenge due to the\ninherent complexity and variability of volcanic processes. A key source of\nuncertainty arises from the sporadic nature of volcanic unrest, which is often\ncharacterised by intermittent phases of quiescent deceleration and sudden\nacceleration, rather than a consistent, predictable progression towards\neruption. This seemingly erratic pattern complicates volcano forecasting as it\nchallenges conventional time-to-failure models that often assume a simple\nsmooth power law acceleration. We propose a log-periodic power law singularity\nmodel, which effectively captures the intermittent and non-monotonic rupture\ndynamics characteristic of reawakening volcanoes at the site scale.\nMathematically, generalising the power law exponent by extending it from real\nto complex numbers, this model captures the partial break of continuous scale\ninvariance to discrete scale invariance that is inherent to the intermittent\ndynamics of damage and rupture processes in heterogeneous crustal systems. By\nperforming parametric and nonparametric tests on a large dataset of 34\nhistorical eruptions worldwide, we present empirical evidence and theoretical\narguments demonstrating the statistical significance of log-periodic\noscillations decorating power law finite-time singularities during pre-eruptive\nvolcanic unrest. Log-periodicity in volcanoes may originate from various\nmechanisms, including diffusion-dominated magma flow, magma-driven propagation\nof subparallel dykes, interaction between stress drop and stress corrosion,\nand/or interplay of inertia, damage, and healing within volcanic systems. Our\nresults have important implications for volcano forecasting, because\nunderstanding and characterising log-periodicity could turn the intermittency\nof volcanic activity from a challenge into a valuable asset for improving\npredictions.",

In this paper, we\nemploy semiparametric estimation approaches to develop boosting prediction\nmethods for data with missing responses. We explore two strategies for\nadjusting the loss functions to account for missingness effects.

Here, we investigate the conditions\nunder which these stochastic wild-type recolonisation events are likely and\nwhen they are unlikely to occur in one spatial dimension. More precisely, we\nexamine the conditions ensuring that the last individual carrying a wild-type\nallele is surrounded by a large enough number of drive homozygous individuals,\nresulting in a very low chance of wild-type recolonisation. To do so, we make a\ndeterministic approximation of the distribution of drive alleles within the\nwave, and we split the distribution of wild-type alleles into a deterministic\npart and a stochastic part. Our analytical and numerical results suggest that\nthe probability of wild-type recolonisation events increases with lower fitness\nof drive individuals, with smaller migration rate, and also with smaller local\ncarrying capacity. Numerical simulations show that these results extend to two\nspatial dimensions. We also demonstrate that, if a wild-type recolonisation\nevent were to occur, the probability of a following drive reinvasion event\ndecreases with smaller values of the intrinsic growth rate of the population.\nOverall, our study paves the way for further analysis of wild-type\nrecolonisation at the back of eradication traveling waves.",

    "abstract": "The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in pathology has evolved from aiding\ndiagnostics to uncovering predictive morphological patterns in whole slide\nimages (WSIs). Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised\npre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse\ndownstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical\napplicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using\ntask-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade\nperformance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the\nlargest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies\nfrom 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a\nfully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our\nfindings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While\nFMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged\nwith - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled\ntraining data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training\nmarkedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging\nmorphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs\nused up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their\nsustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages\nfor rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for\nclinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical\napplications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training\nremain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs\nand end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology\nsolutions fit for clinical use.",

    "abstract": "UX Orionis stars are the most active young stars; they undergo sporadic\nfadings of 2 - 4 magnitudes in the V-band, due to variable circumstellar\nextinction caused by a nearly edge-on star-disc system. The long-lasting\nmonitoring of a number of stars of this type with the Nordic Optical Telescope\nfrom 2019 to 2024 has given a rich collection of material of high-resolution (R\n~ 25000) spectra obtained during different brightness states of the stars. In\nthis paper, we present the results of observations for UX Ori itself. Until now\nonly one spectrum of high resolution had been obtained for this star during\nbrightness minimum, making it difficult to do a comprehensive analysis. Our aim\nis to analyse how different spectral lines change during such irregular fading\nevents, when the star is going in and out of eclipses, obscured by dust along\nthe line of sight. For this purpose we provide a comparative analysis of the\nprofiles and equivalent widths of the spectral lines belonging to the different\natoms and ions. In addition we compare the results for UX Ori with those made\nfor another target in our sample: RR Tau. Common features of variability are\nrevealed: 1) a strengthening of the H-alpha line relatively to the continuum\nduring eclipses; 2) the appearance of additional emission on the frequencies of\nphotospheric lines (e.g. Fe II, Ca II, Si II). The different behaviour of the\nspectral lines during fading found for UX Ori and RR Tau may be caused by two\neffects: a different contribution of the scattered light to the stellar flux\nduring eclipses or a less intense disc wind of UX Ori.",

Denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated promising performance for PET\nimage denoising. However, existing DDPM-based methods typically overlook\nvaluable metadata such as patient demographics, anatomical information, and\nscanning parameters, which should further enhance the denoising performance if\nconsidered. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs), particularly the\npre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, have\nhighlighted the potential of incorporating text-based information into visual\ntasks to improve downstream performance. In this preliminary study, we proposed\na novel text-guided DDPM for PET image denoising that integrated anatomical\npriors through text prompts. Anatomical text descriptions were encoded using a\npre-trained CLIP text encoder to extract semantic guidance, which was then\nincorporated into the diffusion process via the cross-attention mechanism.\nEvaluations based on paired 1/20 low-dose and normal-dose 18F-FDG PET datasets\ndemonstrated that the proposed method achieved better quantitative performance\nthan conventional UNet and standard DDPM methods at both the whole-body and\norgan levels.

However, PIM system-level benefits over traditional\nvon Neumann architecture can be reduced when the memory array cannot fully\nstore all the neural network (NN) weights. The NN size is increasing while the\nPIM design size cannot scale up accordingly due to area constraints. Therefore,\nthis work targets the system performance optimization and exploration for\ncompact PIM designs. We first analyze the impact of data movement on compact\ndesigns. Then, we propose a novel pipeline method that maximizes the reuse of\nNN weights to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of inference in\ncompact chips. To further boost throughput, we introduce a scheduling algorithm\nto mitigate the pipeline bubble problem. Moreover, we investigate the trade-off\nbetween the network size and system performance for a compact PIM chip.\nExperimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 2.35x and 0.5%\nimprovement in throughput and energy efficiency, respectively.

More\nrecently, a quasi-optimal Bayesian strategy was computed under the assumption\nthat encounters with the scalar are independent.

In this work, we perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) of an\nincompressible flow at $\\mathrm{Re}_\\lambda\\simeq150,$ while tracking\nLagrangian particles which are emitted by a point source and imposing a uniform\nmean flow with several magnitudes (including zero). We extract the\nspatially-dependent statistics of encounters with the particles, which we use\nto build Bayesian policies, including generalized (\"space-aware\") infotactic\nheuristics and quasi-optimal policies. We then assess the relative performance\nof these policies when they are used to search using scalar cue data from the\nDNS, and in particular study how this performance depends on correlations\nbetween encounters.

This approach ensures convergence to an optimal solution, which we\ndemonstrate, while maintaining computational efficiency. We apply the proposed\nalgorithm to a real-world offshore oil production optimization problem. In\ncomparison to the Gurobi solver, our algorithm was able to find the optimal\nsolution at least four times faster, and to consistently provide better\nincumbents under limited time.",

These digital doppelgangers serve various\nfunctions, including enhancing productivity, enabling creative collaboration,\nand preserving personal legacies. However, their development raises critical\nethical, legal, and societal concerns. Issues such as identity fragmentation,\npsychological effects on individuals and their social circles, and the risks of\nunauthorized cloning and data exploitation demand careful examination.\nAdditionally, as these AI clones evolve into more autonomous entities, concerns\nabout consent, ownership, and accountability become increasingly complex.\n  This paper differentiates pre-mortem AI clones from post-mortem generative\nghosts, examining their unique ethical and legal implications. We explore key\nchallenges, including the erosion of personal identity, the implications of AI\nagency, and the regulatory gaps in digital rights and privacy laws. Through a\nresearch-driven approach, we propose a framework for responsible AI governance,\nemphasizing identity preservation, consent mechanisms, and autonomy safeguards.\nBy aligning technological advancements with societal values, this study\ncontributes to the growing discourse on AI ethics and provides policy\nrecommendations for the ethical deployment of pre-mortem AI clones.",

This problem has been extensively studied in both theory and practice: on\none side, practitioners have developed algorithms that are highly efficient in\npractice, whereas theoreticians have proven that the problem cannot be solved\nfaster than naive multiplication in the worst-case. This lower bound holds even\nin the average-case, implying that existing average-case analyses cannot\nexplain this gap between theory and practice. Therefore, we study the problem\nfor structured matrices. We show that for $n\\times n$ matrices of VC-dimension\nd, the matrix-vector multiplication problem can be solved with $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$\npreprocessing and $\\tilde O(n^{2-1/d})$ query time. Given the low constant\nVC-dimensions observed in most real-world data, our results posit an\nexplanation for why the problem can be solved so much faster in practice.\nMoreover, our bounds hold even if the matrix does not have a low VC-dimension,\nbut is obtained by (possibly adversarially) corrupting at most a subquadratic\nnumber of entries of any unknown low VC-dimension matrix. Our results yield the\nfirst non-trivial upper bounds for many applications.

In this work, we introduce Semantic Volume,\na novel mathematical measure for quantifying both external and internal\nuncertainty in LLMs. Our approach perturbs queries and responses, embeds them\nin a semantic space, and computes the determinant of the Gram matrix of the\nembedding vectors, capturing their dispersion as a measure of uncertainty. Our\nframework provides a generalizable and unsupervised uncertainty detection\nmethod without requiring internal access to LLMs. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on both external and internal uncertainty detection, demonstrating\nthat our Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing baselines in\nboth tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights linking our measure\nto differential entropy, unifying and extending previous sampling-based\nuncertainty measures such as the semantic entropy.

Recent\nexperimental advances now allow precise control over individual molecules,\nenabling two-qubit gates based on the iSWAP gate. A key challenge is however\nthe sensitivity to variations of the dipole-dipole interaction strength -\nstemming from motion of the molecules and uncertainty on the precise\npositioning of external confining potentials - that limits current gate\nfidelities. To address this, we develop a quantum optimal control framework,\nbased on a perturbative approach, to design gates that are robust with respect\nto quasi-static deviations of Hamiltonian parameters, and provide criteria to\nevaluate a priori whether a gate can be made robust for a given control\nHamiltonian. By applying these criteria to exchange-coupled qubits, as polar\nmolecules, we demonstrate that robustness cannot be achieved with global\ncontrols only, but can be attained by breaking the exchange symmetry through\nlocal controls, such as a local detuning. We determine the robust time-optimal\nsolution for realizing an iSWAP gate, show that the control pulses can be\ndesigned to be smooth functions, and achieve theoretical gate fidelities\ncompatible with error correction under realistic parameters. Additionally, we\nshow that certain entangled state preparations, such as Bell states, can be\nmade robust even with global controls only. We demonstrate that, under the\nadiabatic approximation - where molecular motion occurs on timescales faster\nthan that of the exchange interaction - the noise arising from thermal motion\ncan be effectively treated as quasi-static variations of Hamiltonian\nparameters.

    "abstract": "Scaling long-context ability is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs).\nTo amortize the memory consumption across multiple devices in long-context\ntraining, inter-data partitioning (a.k.a. Data Parallelism) and intra-data\npartitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training\nframeworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish\nstatic communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a\n2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no\nmatter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch\nbetween data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and\nimbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency.\n  In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable\nLLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short\nsequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid\nData Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning\nwith a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer,\nwhich eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware\nsharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication\ncost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a\nbalance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware\ndata assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model sizes ranging from 7B to\n141B, context lengths from 256K to 2048K, on a production cluster with more\nthan 12,000 GPUs. Experiment results show that ByteScale outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art training system by up to 7.89x.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a novel GPU-accelerated circuit satisfiability\n(CircuitSAT) sampling technique for sequential circuits. This work is motivated\nby the requirement in constrained random verification (CRV) to generate input\nstimuli to validate the functionality of digital hardware circuits. A major\nchallenge in CRV is generating inputs for sequential circuits, along with the\nappropriate number of clock cycles required to meet design constraints.\nTraditional approaches often use Boolean satisfiability (SAT) samplers to\ngenerate inputs by unrolling state transitions over a fixed number of clock\ncycles. However, these methods do not guarantee that a solution exists for the\ngiven number of cycles. Consequently, producing input stimuli together with the\nrequired clock cycles is essential for thorough testing and verification. Our\napproach converts the logical constraints and temporal behavior of sequential\ncircuits into a recurrent CircuitSAT problem, optimized via gradient descent to\nefficiently explore a diverse set of valid solutions, including their\nassociated number of clock cycles. By operating directly on the circuit\nstructure, our method reinterprets the sampling process as a supervised\nmulti-output regression task. This differentiable framework enables independent\nelement-wise operations on each tensor element, facilitating parallel execution\nduring learning. As a result, we achieve GPU-accelerated sampling with\nsubstantial runtime improvements (up to 105.1x) over state-of-the-art heuristic\nsamplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive\nevaluations on circuit problems from the ISCAS-89 and ITC'99 benchmark suites.",

Brickify extracts visual elements (e.g., subject, style, and\ncolor) from reference images and converts them into interactive and reusable\ndesign tokens that can be directly manipulated (e.g., resize, group, link,\netc.) to form the visual lexicon.

Here, we leverage the FEP to\ndevelop a mathematical physics approach to the identification of objects,\nobject types, and the macroscopic, object-type-specific rules that govern their\nbehavior. We take a generative modeling approach and use variational Bayesian\nexpectation maximization to develop a dynamic Markov blanket detection\nalgorithm that is capable of identifying and classifying macroscopic objects,\ngiven partial observation of microscopic dynamics. This unsupervised algorithm\nuses Bayesian attention to explicitly label observable microscopic elements\naccording to their current role in a given system, as either the internal or\nboundary elements of a given macroscopic object; and it identifies macroscopic\nphysical laws that govern how the object interacts with its environment.\nBecause these labels are dynamic or evolve over time, the algorithm is capable\nof identifying complex objects that travel through fixed media or exchange\nmatter with their environment. This approach leads directly to a flexible class\nof structured, unsupervised algorithms that sensibly partition complex\nmany-particle or many-component systems into collections of interacting\nmacroscopic subsystems, namely, ``objects'' or ``things''.

All such manifolds are Riemannian normal manifolds, according\nto Alekseevsky's definition, in the sense that they are metrically equivalent\nto a solvable Lie group manifold. This identification provides a vision in\nwhich, on one side one can derive quite explicit and challenging formulae for\nthe unique distance function between points of the manifold, on the other one,\none can organize the entire set of the available manifolds in universality\nclasses distinguished by their common Tits Satake submanifold and,\ncorrespondingly, by their non-compact rank.

    "abstract": "This work presents a new method for online selection of multiple penalty\nparameters for the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm\napplied to optimization problems with multiple constraints or functionals with\nblock matrix components. ADMM is widely used for solving constrained\noptimization problems in a variety of fields, including signal and image\nprocessing. Implementations of ADMM often utilize a single hyperparameter,\nreferred to as the penalty parameter, which needs to be tuned to control the\nrate of convergence. However, in problems with multiple constraints, ADMM may\ndemonstrate slow convergence regardless of penalty parameter selection due to\nscale differences between constraints. Accounting for scale differences between\nconstraints to improve convergence in these cases requires introducing a\npenalty parameter for each constraint. The proposed method is able to\nadaptively account for differences in scale between constraints, providing\nrobustness with respect to problem transformations and initial selection of\npenalty parameters. It is also simple to understand and implement. Our\nnumerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably\ncompared to a variety of existing penalty parameter selection methods.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous self-triggering for radio detection of extensive air showers\nremains a long-standing challenge, particularly in environments dominated by\nstrong and variable radio-frequency interference. Current radio arrays usually\nrely on external particle-detector triggers: while this lowers thresholds for\nvertical showers, it excludes very inclined events, where radio detection is\nuniquely powerful because the particle cascade is absorbed while the radio\npulse remains measurable. In this work, I present a proof-of-principle study\nshowing that deep-learning-based triggering can overcome these limitations,\noperating robustly under realistic high-interference conditions and within the\nstrict latency constraints of large-scale observatories. Using measured noise\ntraces combined with simulated cosmic-ray pulses, a fully convolutional network\nwas trained and optimised for MHz-scale trigger-trial rates, and its\nperformance was compared to a simple threshold-based trigger, which proved\nmarkedly less efficient at the same false-positive rate. The trained model was\nthen quantised with HLS4ML and synthesised with Vitis HLS for multiple FPGA\ntargets. The quantised implementation preserves the floating-point model\nperformance (AUC_float = 0.997, AUC_quant = 0.996) while achieving\nmicrosecond-scale inference latencies.These results show that modern FPGA-based\nAI inference can provide low-latency, radio-only triggering for next-generation\ncosmic-ray observatories, particularly in regions with strong and variable\nradio backgrounds. This capability unlocks access to weak and highly inclined\nair-shower signals--even in noisy environments--thereby broadening the energy\nrange, extending sky coverage, and opening the path toward ultra-high-energy\nneutrino detection with ground-based radio arrays.",

Recent studies have proposed that this\nputative offset bulge is not a classical bulge within the plane of the disk but\ninstead a dwarf companion galaxy along the line-of-sight. Using integral field\nspectroscopy data taken as part of the PPak IFS Nearby Galaxies Survey (PINGS),\nwe perform the first analysis of the stellar and gas kinematics of this\nputative bulge and portions of the disk. We find a radial velocity offset of\n~24 km/s between the emission lines produced by the disk HII regions and the\nabsorption lines produced by the putative bulge stellar component. We interpret\nthis velocity offset as evidence that the putative bulge and disk are two\nseparate objects, the former orbiting around the latter, supporting simulations\nand observations of this peculiar system. We attempt to place this external\ncompanion into the context of the M101 Group and the M101-NGC 5474 interaction.",

L-MAP employs\na (separate) learned prior model that acts as a latent transition model and\nallows efficient sampling of plausible actions.

In offline RL settings, including\nstochastic continuous control tasks, L-MAP efficiently searches over discrete\nlatent actions to yield high expected returns. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat L-MAP maintains low decision latency despite increased action\ndimensionality. Notably, across tasks ranging from continuous control with\ninherently stochastic dynamics to high-dimensional robotic hand manipulation,\nL-MAP significantly outperforms existing model-based methods and performs\non-par with strong model-free actor-critic baselines, highlighting the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach in planning in complex and stochastic\nenvironments with high-dimensional action spaces.",

Our aim is to reduce the reliance of\nlearning agents on humans or expensive rewards, improving the efficiency of\nlearning while maintaining the quality of the learned policy. We offer a novel\nreinforcement learning algorithm that requests a reward only when its knowledge\nof the value of actions in an environment state is low.

In the present work, we demonstrate how such\naugmentation can be accomplished via $\\Delta$-learning based on the\nrepresentation already embedded in the universal potentials. The $\\Delta$-model\nintroduced is a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model and various types of\naggregation (global, species-separated, and atomic) of the representation\nvector are discussed. Employing a specific universal potential, CHGNet [Deng et\nal., Nat. Mach. Intell. 5, 1031 (2023)], in a global structure optimization\nsetting, we find that it correctly describes the energetics of the \"8\" Cu\noxide, which is an ultra-thin oxide film on Cu(111). The universal potential\nmodel even predicts a more favorable structure compared to that discussed in\nrecent DFT-based literature. Moving to sulfur adatom overlayers on Cu(111),\nAg(111), and Au(111) the CHGNet model, however, requires corrections. We\ndemonstrate that these are efficiently provided via the GPR-based\n$\\Delta$-model formulated on the CHGNet's own internal atomic embedding\nrepresentation. The need for corrections is tracked to the scarcity of\nmetal-sulfur atomic environments in the materials project database that CHGNet\nis trained on leading to an overreliance on sulfur-sulfur atomic environments.\nOther universal potentials trained on the same data, MACE-MP0, SevenNet-0, and\nORB-v2-only-MPtrj show similar behavior, but with varying degrees of error,\ndemonstrating the general need for augmentation schemes for universal potential\nmodels.",

Despite\nthe high device quality, we note an order-of-magnitude difference in mobility\nbetween electrons and holes. By studying additional n-type and p-type devices\nwith identical oxides, and fitting to transport theory, we show that this\nmobility discrepancy is due to valence band nonparabolicity. The\nnonparabolicity endows holes with a density-dependent transverse effective mass\nranging from $0.6m_0$ to $0.7m_0$, significantly larger than the usually quoted\nbend-edge mass of $0.22m_0$. Finally, we perform magnetotransport measurements\nto extract momentum and quantum scattering lifetimes.",

We discuss this concept from the point of view of projection\noperator formalisms in classical statistical physics. We analyse an autonomous\ncomposite system which consists of a system and an environment in the most\ngeneral sense (i.e. we neither impose conditions on the coupling between system\nand environment nor on the properties of the environment). One condition any\nuseful definition of work needs to fulfill is that it reproduces the\nthermodynamic notion of work in the limit of weak coupling to an environment\nthat has infinite heat capacity. We propose a projection operator route to a\ndefinition of work that reaches this limit and we discuss its relation to\nminimal dissipation.",

This work\npioneers the integration of adversarial training into QFL, proposing a robust\nframework, quantum federated adversarial learning (QFAL), where clients\ncollaboratively defend against perturbations by combining local adversarial\nexample generation with federated averaging (FedAvg). We systematically\nevaluate the interplay between three critical factors: client count (5, 10,\n15), adversarial training coverage (0-100%), and adversarial attack\nperturbation strength (epsilon = 0.01-0.5), using the MNIST dataset. Our\nexperimental results show that while fewer clients often yield higher\nclean-data accuracy, larger federations can more effectively balance accuracy\nand robustness when partially adversarially trained. Notably, even limited\nadversarial coverage (e.g., 20%-50%) can significantly improve resilience to\nmoderate perturbations, though at the cost of reduced baseline performance.\nConversely, full adversarial training (100%) may regain high clean accuracy but\nis vulnerable under stronger attacks. These findings underscore an inherent\ntrade-off between robust and standard objectives, which is further complicated\nby quantum-specific factors. We conclude that a carefully chosen combination of\nclient count and adversarial coverage is critical for mitigating adversarial\nvulnerabilities in QFL. Moreover, we highlight opportunities for future\nresearch, including adaptive adversarial training schedules, more diverse\nquantum encoding schemes, and personalized defense strategies to further\nenhance the robustness-accuracy trade-off in real-world quantum federated\nenvironments.",

The CP coverage was 0.9982 for the internal test set and 0.9977\nfor the external test set. Statistical analysis showed a significant negative\ncorrelation between UR and DSC for test sets (p<0.001). UR was also linked to\nsignificantly lower DSCs in the BFMS (p<0.001). Additionally, certain cases had\nsignificantly higher DSCs than uncertain cases in test sets and the BFMS\n(p<0.001). Conclusion: CP effectively quantifies uncertainty in glioma\nsegmentation. Using CONSeg improves the reliability of segmentation models and\nenhances human-computer interaction.",

Current ERC methods\nprimarily rely on semantic, audio and visual data but face significant\nchallenges in integrating physiological signals such as Electroencephalography\n(EEG). This research proposes Hypergraph Multi-Modal Learning (Hyper-MML), a\nnovel framework for identifying emotions in conversation. Hyper-MML effectively\nintegrates EEG with audio and video information to capture complex emotional\ndynamics. Firstly, we introduce an Adaptive Brain Encoder with Mutual-cross\nAttention (ABEMA) module for processing EEG signals. This module captures\nemotion-relevant features across different frequency bands and adapts to\nsubject-specific variations through hierarchical mutual-cross attention\nmechanisms. Secondly, we propose an Adaptive Hypergraph Fusion Module (AHFM) to\nactively model the higher-order relationships among multi-modal signals in ERC.\nExperimental results on the EAV and AFFEC datasets demonstrate that our\nHyper-MML model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The\nproposed Hyper-MML can serve as an effective communication tool for healthcare\nprofessionals, enabling better engagement with patients who have difficulty\nexpressing their emotions.

Experiments to date have revealed Chern\ninsulators from hole doping at v = -1, -2/3, -3/5, and -4/7 (per moir\\'e unit\ncell). In parallel, theories predict that, between v = -1 and -3, there exist\nexotic quantum phases, such as the coveted fractional topological insulators\n(FTI), fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) states, and non-abelian fractional\nstates. Here we employ transient optical spectroscopy on tMoTe2 to reveal\nnearly 20 hidden states at fractional fillings that are absent in static\noptical sensing or transport measurements. A pump pulse selectively excites\ncharge across the correlated or pseudo gaps, leading to the disordering\n(melting) of correlated states. A probe pulse detects the subsequent melting\nand recovery dynamics via exciton and trion sensing. Besides the known states,\nwe observe additional fractional fillings between v = 0 and -1 and a large\nnumber of states on the electron doping side (v > 0). Most importantly, we\nobserve new states at fractional fillings of the Chern bands at v = -4/3, -3/2,\n-5/3, -7/3, -5/2, and -8/3. These states are potential candidates for the\npredicted exotic topological phases. Moreover, we show that melting of\ncorrelated states occurs on two distinct time scales, 2-4 ps and 180-270 ps,\nattributed to electronic and phonon mechanisms, respectively. We discuss the\ndiffering dynamics of the electron and hole doped states from the distinct\nmoir\\'e conduction and valence bands.",

    "abstract": "We present a model inspired by the Global Workspace Theory that integrates\nspecialized modules to perform a sequential reasoning task. A controller\nselectively routes information between modules through the workspace using a\ngating mechanism. This approach allows the model to chain operations by\niteratively broadcasting information between specialized domains, mimicking\nSystem-2 reasoning. We evaluate the model's performance on a simple addition\ntask, where two addends must be summed. The task can be solved by routing\ninformation sequentially through an Input module, an Increment module (multiple\ntimes), and finally an Output module. We consider two implementations of this\nsystem with increasing complexity. First, using hand-designed modules operating\non one-hot digit representations, the controller (a LSTM recurrent network)\nlearns to select the appropriate modules (input, increment, output) in the\nappropriate sequence. Second, we replace the hand-designed modules with learned\nrepresentation modules for MNIST images and an increment module trained on the\ntask objectives; here again, the controller learns the appropriate sequential\nmodule selection to solve the task. Finally, we show that the Global Workspace\nmodel, while having fewer parameters, outperforms LSTMs and Transformers when\ntested on unseen addition operations (both interpolations and extrapolations of\naddition operations seen during training).

NDAE models, favored in industry for their ability to\naccurately capture both dynamic and steady-state behaviors, provide a more\naccurate representation of power system behavior by coupling dynamic and\nalgebraic states. We propose novel FDIA strategies that simultaneously evade\nboth dynamic and static intrusion detection systems while respecting the\nalgebraic power flow and operational constraints inherent in NDAE models. We\ndemonstrate how the coupling between dynamic and algebraic states in NDAE\nmodels significantly restricts the attacker's ability to manipulate state\nestimates while maintaining stealthiness.

In Reinforcement\nLearning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in\nresponse to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization.\nHowever, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables\n(e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and\ncumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent\ndimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW)\nTheory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information\nbroadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient\ndeep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an\nRL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with\nvarious versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We\nshow that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the\nGW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an\nadditional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison\nbaselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation\nmodalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination\nof GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in\nRL agents.",

    "abstract": "Power amplifiers (PAs) are essential components in wireless communication\nsystems, and the design of their behavioral models has been an important\nresearch topic for many years. The widely used generalized memory polynomial\n(GMP) model suffers from rapid growth in the number of parameters with\nincreasing memory depths and nonlinearity order, which leads to a significant\nincrease in model complexity and the risk of overfitting. In this study, we\nintroduce tensor networks to compress the unknown coefficient tensor of the GMP\nmodel, resulting in three novel tensor-based GMP models. These models can\nachieve comparable performance to the GMP model, but with far fewer parameters\nand lower complexity. For the identification of these models, we derive the\nalternating least-squares (ALS) method to ensure the rapid updates and\nconvergence of model parameters in an iterative manner. In addition, we notice\nthat the horizontal slices of the third-order data tensor constructed from the\ninput signals are Vandermonde matrices, which have a numerically low-rank\nstructure. Hence, we further propose the RP-ALS algorithm, which first performs\na truncated higher-order singular value decomposition on the data tensor to\ngenerate random projections, then conducts the ALS algorithm for the\nidentification of projected models with downscaled dimensions, thus reducing\nthe computational effort of the iterative process. The experimental results\nshow that the proposed models outperform the full GMP model and sparse GMP\nmodel via LASSO regression in terms of the reduction in the number of\nparameters and running complexity.",

We propose 27 stable ferromagnetic\nsemiconductor monolayers of Janus XYZH (X = Sc, Y, La, Y = Cl, Br, I, and Z =\nS, Se, Te). All these monolayers exhibit spontaneous valley polarization,\nforming ferrovalley (FV) monolayers, showing anomalous valley Hall (AVH)\neffect. By applying external strain, the topological phase transitions\nincluding quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect can be introduced. In the ScBrSH\nbilayer system, AA and AB stacking configurations were constructed through\ninterlayer sliding and rotational operation. The bilayer system exhibits\ninterlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with spontaneous valley\npolarization differing from the FV observed in monolayers. The sliding\nferroelectricity observed in the AA stacking indicates that the system exhibits\nsignificant multiferroic characteristics. Further analysis shows that\ninterlayer sliding can introduce a layer polarization anomalous valley Hall\n(LPAVH) effect, which can be precisely controlled by tuning the direction of\nthe ferroelectric polarization. Upon applying external strain, the quantum\nlayer spin Hall (QLSH) effect observed during the topological phase transition\nin the bilayer can be regarded as the superposition of two QAH monolayers.\nFurthermore, applying a twisting operation to the bilayer induces unexpected\naltermagnetism.

    "abstract": "Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image\nclassification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to\nprocessing numerous patches from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). To\naddress this, we propose HDMIL, a hierarchical distillation multi-instance\nlearning framework that achieves fast and accurate classification by\neliminating irrelevant patches. HDMIL consists of two key components: the\ndynamic multi-instance network (DMIN) and the lightweight instance\npre-screening network (LIPN). DMIN operates on high-resolution WSIs, while LIPN\noperates on the corresponding low-resolution counterparts. During training,\nDMIN are trained for WSI classification while generating attention-score-based\nmasks that indicate irrelevant patches. These masks then guide the training of\nLIPN to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. During testing,\nLIPN first determines the useful regions within low-resolution WSIs, which\nindirectly enables us to eliminate irrelevant regions in high-resolution WSIs,\nthereby reducing inference time without causing performance degradation. In\naddition, we further design the first Chebyshev-polynomials-based\nKolmogorov-Arnold classifier in computational pathology, which enhances the\nperformance of HDMIL through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments\non three public datasets demonstrate that HDMIL outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving improvements of 3.13% in AUC while\nreducing inference time by 28.6% on the Camelyon16 dataset.",

Unlike the Ensemble Average Propagator indices or the\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging metrics, MPI indices are independent from the\nmesoscopic organization of the tissue such as the presence of multiple axonal\nbundle directions and orientation dispersion. As a consequence, MPI indices are\nmore specific to the volumes, sizes, and types of microstructures, like axons\nand cells, that are present in the tissue. Thus, changes in MPI indices can be\nmore directly linked to alterations in the presence and integrity of\nmicrostructures themselves.

The problem consists of finding a decomposition of a\nnetwork of dynamical systems into system units for which local controllers can\nbe designed. Unfortunately, despite its critical role, a generalized approach\nto partitioning applicable to every system is still missing from the\nliterature. This paper introduces a novel partitioning framework that\nintegrates an algorithmic selection of fundamental system units (FSUs),\nconsidered indivisible entities, with an aggregative procedure, either\nalgorithmic or optimization-based, to select composite system units (CSUs) made\nof several FSUs. A key contribution is the introduction of a global network\nmetric, the partition index, which quantitatively balances intra- and inter-CSU\ninteractions, with a granularity parameter accounting for the size of CSUs,\nallowing for their selection at different levels of aggregation. The proposed\nmethod is validated through case studies in distributed model predictive\ncontrol (DMPC) for linear and hybrid systems, showing significant reductions in\ncomputation time and cost while maintaining or improving control performance\nw.r.t. conventional strategies.",

In this study, we\ntheoretically identify the evolutionary pressures that may have driven this\ndivergence in genome length. We use a parameter-free model to study genome\nlength evolution under selection pressure to minimize replication time and\nmaximize information storage capacity. We show that prokaryotes tend to reduce\ngenome length, constrained by a single replication origin, while eukaryotes\nexpand their genomes by incorporating multiple replication origins. We propose\na connection between genome length and cellular energetics, suggesting that\nendosymbiotic organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts, evolutionarily\nregulate the number of replication origins, thereby influencing genome length\nin eukaryotes. We show that the above two selection pressures also lead to\nstrict equalization of the number of purines and their corresponding\nbase-pairing pyrimidines within a single DNA strand, known as Chagraff's second\nparity rule, a hitherto unexplained observation in genomes of nearly all known\nspecies. This arises from the symmetrization of replichore length, another\nobservation that has been shown to hold across species, which our model\nreproduces. The model also reproduces other experimentally observed phenomena,\nsuch as a general preference for deletions over insertions, and elongation and\nhigh variance of genome lengths under reduced selection pressure for\nreplication rate, termed the C-value paradox.

The temperature dependence of the resistivity of all samples has similar\nbehaviour and depicts the highest onset transition temperature of around 11.5\nK, but the zero resistivity is not reached until the measured temperature of 7\nK, which could be due to the presence of the impurity phases.

Whether non-trivial resource\nallocation approaches can be successfully applied in large-scale network\ninstances is still an open question that this paper aims to address. More\nspecifically, we consider a scenario in which Channel State Information (CSI)\nis used to improve spectrum allocation in a radio environment that experiences\nchannel time correlation.\n  Channel correlation allows the usage of CSI for longer time before an update,\nthus lowering the overhead burden. Following this intuition, we propose a\ndynamic pilot transmission allocation scheme in order to adaptively tune the\nCSI age.\n  We systematically analyze the improvement of this approach applied to a\nsophisticated, recently introduced graph-based resource allocation method that\nwe extend here to account for CSI.\n  The results show that, even in very dense networks and accounting for the\nhigher computational time of the graph-based approach, this algorithm is able\nto improve spectrum efficiency by over 12% as compared to a greedy heuristic,\nand that dynamic pilot transmissions allocation can further boost its\nperformance in terms of fairness, while concomitantly further increase spectrum\nefficiency of 3-5%. \\",

However, recent research on utilizing event data has\nprimarily focused on low-light image enhancement, neglecting image enhancement\nand brightness adjustment across a broader range of lighting conditions, such\nas normal or high illumination. Based on this, we propose a novel research\nquestion: how to employ events to enhance and adaptively adjust the brightness\nof images captured under broad lighting conditions? To investigate this\nquestion, we first collected a new dataset, SEE-600K, consisting of 610,126\nimages and corresponding events across 202 scenarios, each featuring an average\nof four lighting conditions with over a 1000-fold variation in illumination.\nSubsequently, we propose a framework that effectively utilizes events to\nsmoothly adjust image brightness through the use of prompts. Our framework\ncaptures color through sensor patterns, uses cross-attention to model events as\na brightness dictionary, and adjusts the image's dynamic range to form a broad\nlight-range representation (BLR), which is then decoded at the pixel level\nbased on the brightness prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod not only performs well on the low-light enhancement dataset but also\nshows robust performance on broader light-range image enhancement using the\nSEE-600K dataset.

Extremely large\nunsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) which is up to 1.9 * 10^4 % at 2 K and 14 T\nwas observed with magnetic field along the c-axis. The nonlinear magnetic field\ndependence of Hall resistivity indicates the multi-band features, and the\nelectron and hole are nearly compensated according to the analysis of the\ntwo-band model, which may account for the extremely large unsaturated MR at low\ntemperatures. The evident Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations at low\ntemperatures are observed and four distinct oscillation frequencies are\nextracted. The first principle calculations and angle-dependent SdH\noscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with\ndifferent anisotropy. The observed twofold symmetry MR with electric field\nalong the b-axis direction is consistent with our calculated Fermi surface\nstructures. Furthermore, the negative magnetoresistance (NMR) with magnetic\nfield in parallel with electric field is observed, which is an evident feature\nof the chiral anomaly.",

These defects typically have exceptional photophysical\nproperties and therefore been the focus of extensive research due to their\npotential to advance photonic quantum technologies. However, achieving scalable\nintegration of these emitters to arbitrary platforms with high yield while\nretaining their characteristics remains a significant challenge, particularly\nwhen the target substrate is not compatible with the fabrication method. In\nthis work, we introduce an all-dry transfer method aimed at addressing these\nchallenges with improved effectiveness compared to existing techniques. This\npolymer stamp-assisted transfer method maintains high output and preserves the\nfundamental characteristics of the emitters while eliminating wet chemical\nprocesses. A comprehensive post-transfer characterization verified not only the\nmaintenance of the defining characteristic of a single photon emitter, the\nsecond-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$, but also showed improvement by\nabout 46%. In contrast, the lifetime, emission spectrum, and the photostability\nshowed only negligible change, demonstrating that the characteristics of the\nemitters were retained during the transfer process. This transfer technique has\nsuccess rate of 81.8%, determined by the proportion of single photon emitters\nthat retain their optical and preserve physical structure post-transfer. This\nhigh success rate shows the potential to scale the integration of single photon\nemitters across diverse platforms.

In those studies, target multi-objective problems are not\nalways explicitly shown. It is well known in the EMO community that the\nperformance evaluation results of EMO algorithms depend on not only test\nproblems but also many other factors such as performance indicators, reference\npoint, termination condition, and population size.

However, existing approaches\npredominantly emphasize unrestricted collision scenarios, prompting non-player\ncharacter (NPC) vehicles to attack the ego vehicle indiscriminately. These\nworks overlook these scenarios' authenticity, rationality, and relevance,\nresulting in numerous extreme, contrived, and largely unrealistic collision\nevents involving aggressive NPC vehicles. To rectify this issue, we propose a\nthree-layer relative safety region model, which partitions the area based on\ndanger levels and increases the likelihood of NPC vehicles entering relative\nboundary regions. This model directs NPC vehicles to engage in adversarial\nactions within relatively safe boundary regions, thereby augmenting the\nscenarios' authenticity. We introduce AuthSim, a comprehensive platform for\ngenerating authentic and effective safety-critical scenarios by integrating the\nthree-layer relative safety region model with reinforcement learning. To our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to address the authenticity and\neffectiveness of autonomous driving system test scenarios comprehensively.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that AuthSim outperforms existing methods in\ngenerating effective safety-critical scenarios. Notably, AuthSim achieves a\n5.25% improvement in average cut-in distance and a 27.12% enhancement in\naverage collision interval time, while maintaining higher efficiency in\ngenerating effective safety-critical scenarios compared to existing methods.\nThis underscores its significant advantage in producing authentic scenarios\nover current methodologies.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes {\\sf AEPG-SPIDER}, an Adaptive Extrapolated Proximal\nGradient (AEPG) method with variance reduction for minimizing composite\nnonconvex finite-sum functions. It integrates three acceleration techniques:\nadaptive stepsizes, Nesterov's extrapolation, and the recursive stochastic\npath-integrated estimator SPIDER. Unlike existing methods that adjust the\nstepsize factor using historical gradients, {\\sf AEPG-SPIDER} relies on past\niterate differences for its update. While targeting stochastic finite-sum\nproblems, {\\sf AEPG-SPIDER} simplifies to {\\sf AEPG} in the full-batch,\nnon-stochastic setting, which is also of independent interest. To our\nknowledge, {\\sf AEPG-SPIDER} and {\\sf AEPG} are the first Lipschitz-free\nmethods to achieve optimal iteration complexity for this class of\n\\textit{composite} minimization problems. Specifically, {\\sf AEPG} achieves the\noptimal iteration complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N \\epsilon^{-2})$, while {\\sf\nAEPG-SPIDER} achieves $\\mathcal{O}(N + \\sqrt{N} \\epsilon^{-2})$ for finding\n$\\epsilon$-approximate stationary points, where $N$ is the number of component\nfunctions.

For utilitarian social cost, we show\nthat the voting rule that selects the $k$ middle agents achieves a distortion\nthat varies between $1$ and $2$ as $k$ varies from $1$ to $n$ when the cost of\nan individual is the sum of their distances to all selected candidates\n(additive aggregation). When the cost of an individual is their distance to\ntheir $q$th closest candidate ($q$-cost), we provide positive results for\n$q=k=2$ but mostly show that negative results for general elections carry over\nto our setting: No constant distortion is possible when $q\\leq k/2$ and no\ndistortion better than $3/2$ is possible for $q\\geq k/2+1$. For egalitarian\nsocial cost, selecting extreme agents achieves the best-possible distortion of\n$2$ for additive cost and $q$-cost with $q> k/3$, whereas no constant\ndistortion is possible for $q\\leq k/3$. Overall, having a common set of voters\nand candidates allows for better constants compared to the general setting, but\ncases in which no constant is possible in general remain hard in this setting.",

In the QSCI framework,\nelectronic configurations are sampled from the quantum state realized on a\nquantum computer. These configurations serve as basis states for constructing\nan effective Hamiltonian, which is then diagonalized to obtain the\ncorresponding eigenstate. Using this wave function, ph-AFQMC is performed to\nrecover the dynamical electron correlation across the whole orbital space. The\nuse of the QSCI trial wave function is expected to improve the feasibility of\nthe quantum-classical (QC) hybrid quantum Monte Carlo approach [Nature, 603,\n416 (2022)]. We call this integrated approach QC-QSCI-AFQMC, or QSCI-AFQMC for\nshort. This method is validated across several molecular systems. For H2O and a\nlinear H4 chain, we achieved chemical accuracy in most investigations relative\nto full configuration interaction while utilizing superconducting quantum\ncomputers at Osaka University and RIKEN. Additionally, the application of\nQSCI-AFQMC to the O-H bond dissociation in an organic molecule highlights the\ncomplementary synergy between capturing static correlation on quantum hardware\nand incorporating dynamical correlation via classical post-processing. For the\nN2, when QSCI-AFQMC is executed with a noiseless simulator, it ranks among the\nmost accurate methods compared to various multireference electronic structure\ntheories. Although the proposed method is demonstrated using small active\nspaces on current quantum devices, the concept is not limited to few-qubit\nproblems. The QSCI-AFQMC can compete with state-of-the-art classical\ncomputational techniques, particularly in larger active spaces, displaying\nconsiderable potential for resolving classically intractable problems in\nquantum chemistry.",

    "abstract": "The current development trend of wireless communications aims at coping with\nthe very stringent reliability and latency requirements posed by several\nemerging Internet of Things (IoT) application scenarios. Since the problem of\nrealizing Ultra Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) is becoming more\nand more important, it has attracted the attention of researchers, and new\nefficient resource allocation algorithms are necessary. In this paper, we\nconsider a challenging scenario where the available spectrum might be\nfragmented across non-adjacent portions of the band, and channels are\ndifferently affected by interference coming from surrounding networks.\nFurthermore, Channel State Information (CSI) is assumed to be unavailable, thus\nrequiring an allocation of resources based only on topology information and\nchannel statistics. To address this challenge in a dense smart factory scenario\nwhere devices periodically transmit their data to a common receiver, we present\na novel resource allocation methodology based on a graph-theoretical approach\noriginally designed to allocate mobility resources in on-demand, shared\ntransportation. The proposed methodology is compared with two benchmark\nallocation strategies, showing its ability of increasing spectral efficiency of\nas much as 50% with respect to the best performing benchmark. Contrary to what\nhappens in many resource allocation settings, this increase in spectrum\nefficiency does not come at the expense of fairness, which is also increased as\ncompared to benchmark algorithms.",

For instance, generating an 8-second 720p\nvideo (110K tokens) with HunyuanVideo takes about 600 PFLOPs, with around 500\nPFLOPs consumed by attention computations. To address this issue, we propose\nAdaSpa, the first Dynamic Pattern and Online Precise Search sparse attention\nmethod. Firstly, to realize the Dynamic Pattern, we introduce a blockified\npattern to efficiently capture the hierarchical sparsity inherent in DiTs. This\nis based on our observation that sparse characteristics of DiTs exhibit\nhierarchical and blockified structures between and within different modalities.\nThis blockified approach significantly reduces the complexity of attention\ncomputation while maintaining high fidelity in the generated videos. Secondly,\nto enable Online Precise Search, we propose the Fused LSE-Cached Search with\nHead-adaptive Hierarchical Block Sparse Attention. This method is motivated by\nour finding that DiTs' sparse pattern and LSE vary w.r.t. inputs, layers, and\nheads, but remain invariant across denoising steps. By leveraging this\ninvariance across denoising steps, it adapts to the dynamic nature of DiTs and\nallows for precise, real-time identification of sparse indices with minimal\noverhead. AdaSpa is implemented as an adaptive, plug-and-play solution and can\nbe integrated seamlessly with existing DiTs, requiring neither additional\nfine-tuning nor a dataset-dependent profiling. Extensive experiments validate\nthat AdaSpa delivers substantial acceleration across various models while\npreserving video quality, establishing itself as a robust and scalable approach\nto efficient video generation.",

The\nparameters to establish the relaxation model are allowed to be locally\ndetermined at each cell interface, improving the adaptability to diverse flow\nregions.

Since GWs are anticipated from cosmic strings, PTAs\noffer a viable approach to testing their existence. We present the results of\nthe first Bayesian search for gravitational-wave bursts from cosmic string\ncusps (GWCS) using the third PPTA data release for 30 millisecond pulsars. In\nthis data collection, we find no evidence for GWCS signals. We compare a model\nwith a GWCS signal to one with only noise, including a common spatially\nuncorrelated red noise (CURN), and find that our data is more consistent with\nthe noise-only model.We then establish upper limits on the strain amplitude of\nGWCS at the pulsar term, based on the analysis of 30 millisecond pulsars, after\nfinding no compelling evidence. We find the addition of a CURN with different\nspectral indices into the noise model has a negligible impact on the upper\nlimits. And the upper limit range of the amplitude of the pulsar-term GWCS is\nconcentrated between 10^{-12} and 10^{-11}. Finally, we set upper limits on the\namplitude of GWCS events, parametrized by width and event epoch, for a single\npulsar PSR J1857+0943. Moreover, we derive upper limit on the cosmic string\ntension as a function of burst width and compare it with previous results.",

    "abstract": "GUI prototyping serves as one of the most valuable techniques for enhancing\nthe elicitation of requirements and facilitating the visualization and\nrefinement of customer needs. While GUI prototyping has a positive impact on\nthe software development process, it simultaneously demands significant effort\nand resources. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with their\nimpressive code generation capabilities offers a promising approach for\nautomating GUI prototyping. Despite their potential, there is a gap between\ncurrent LLM-based prototyping solutions and traditional user-based GUI\nprototyping approaches which provide visual representations of the GUI\nprototypes and direct editing functionality. In contrast, LLMs and related\ngenerative approaches merely produce text sequences or non-editable image\noutput, which lacks both mentioned aspects and therefore impede supporting GUI\nprototyping. Moreover, minor changes requested by the user typically lead to an\ninefficient regeneration of the entire GUI prototype when using LLMs directly.\nIn this work, we propose GUIDE, a novel LLM-driven GUI generation decomposition\napproach seamlessly integrated into the popular prototyping framework Figma.\nOur approach initially decomposes high-level GUI descriptions into\nfine-granular GUI requirements, which are subsequently translated into Material\nDesign GUI prototypes, enabling higher controllability and more efficient\nadaption of changes. To efficiently conduct prompting-based generation of\nMaterial Design GUI prototypes, we propose a retrieval-augmented generation\napproach to integrate the component library. Our preliminary evaluation\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of GUIDE in bridging the gap between LLM\ngeneration capabilities and traditional GUI prototyping workflows, offering a\nmore effective and controlled user-based approach to LLM-driven GUI\nprototyping.

This ``top-down\" , approach\nrecovers the celebrated Boltzmann entropy in the limit $q \\rightarrow 1$ since\n$S_1 = k_B\\ln W$. However, for $q\\neq 1$ the entropy is non-additive and has\nbeen successfully applied for a variety of phenomena ranging from plasma\nphysics to cosmology. For a system of particles, Tsallis' formula predicts a\nlarge class of power-law velocity distributions reducing to the Maxwellian\nresult only for a particular case. Here a more pedagogical ``bottom-up\" path is\nadopted. We show that a large set of power-law distributions for an ideal gas\nin equilibrium at temperature T is derived by slightly modifying the seminal\nMaxwell approach put forward in 1860. The emergence of power-laws velocity\ndistribution is not necessarily related with the presence of long-range\ninteractions.

Although most\nMLLMs have undergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual\nmodality is still vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover\nthat by using flowcharts with partially harmful information, MLLMs can be\ninduced to provide additional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a\njailbreak attack method based on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack.\nSpecifically, FC-Attack first fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a\nstep-description generator based on benign datasets. The generator is then used\nto produce step descriptions corresponding to a harmful query, which are\ntransformed into flowcharts in 3 different shapes (vertical, horizontal, and\nS-shaped) as visual prompts. These flowcharts are then combined with a benign\ntextual prompt to execute the jailbreak attack on MLLMs. Our evaluations on\nAdvbench show that FC-Attack attains an attack success rate of up to 96% via\nimages and up to 78% via videos across multiple MLLMs. Additionally, we\ninvestigate factors affecting the attack performance, including the number of\nsteps and the font styles in the flowcharts. We also find that FC-Attack can\nimprove the jailbreak performance from 4% to 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the\nfont style. To mitigate the attack, we explore several defenses and find that\nAdaShield can largely reduce the jailbreak performance but with the cost of\nutility drop.",

While $H_\\infty$ control techniques are commonly used to design\nrobust controllers that mitigate the effects of disturbances, these methods\noften require complex and computationally intensive calculations. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm called\nRobust Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG), which formulates the $H_\\infty$\ncontrol problem as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game. In this formulation, one\nplayer (the user) aims to minimize the cost, while the other player (the\nadversary) seeks to maximize it. We then employ deterministic policy gradient\n(DPG) and its deep reinforcement learning counterpart to train a robust control\npolicy with effective disturbance attenuation. In particular, for practical\nimplementation, we introduce an algorithm called robust deep deterministic\npolicy gradient (RDDPG), which employs a deep neural network architecture and\nintegrates techniques from the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient\n(TD3) to enhance stability and learning efficiency. To evaluate the proposed\nalgorithm, we implement it on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasked with\nfollowing a predefined path in a disturbance-prone environment.

The dataset consists of 41,800 microwave holographic images (2D) and\ntheir holographic inverted scans (3D) of different types of buried objects,\nincluding landmines, clutter, and pottery objects, and is collected by means of\na microwave holography sensor.\n  We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art deep learning models\ntrained on our synthetic dataset for various classification tasks. While the\nresults do not yield yet high performances, showing the difficulty of the\nproposed task, we believe that our dataset has significant potential to drive\nprogress in the field of landmine detection thanks to the accuracy and\nresolution obtainable using holographic radars.\n  To the best of our knowledge, our dataset is the first of its kind and will\nhelp drive further research on computer vision methods to automatize mine\ndetection, with the overall goal of reducing the risks and the costs of the\ndemining process.",

Here we aim at detecting anomalies in 24h time\nseries of cow activity, with a view to detect cases of disease or oestrus.\nDeviations must be distinguished from noise which can be very high in case of\nbiological data. It is also important to detect the anomaly early, e.g. before\na farmer would notice it visually. Here, we investigate the benefit of using\nwavelet transforms to denoise data and we assess the performance of an anomaly\ndetection algorithm considering the timing of the detection. We developed\nfeatures based on the comparisons between the wavelet transforms of the mean of\nthe time series and the wavelet transforms of individual time series instances.\nWe hypothesized that these features contribute to the detection of anomalies in\nperiodic time series using a feature-based algorithm. We tested this hypothesis\nwith two datasets representing cow activity, which typically follows a daily\npattern but can deviate due to specific physiological or pathological\nconditions. We applied features derived from wavelet transform as well as\nstatistical features in an Isolation Forest algorithm. We measured the distance\nof detection between the days annotated abnormal by animal caretakers days and\nthe days predicted abnormal by the algorithm. The results show that\nwavelet-based features are among the features most contributing to anomaly\ndetection. They also show that detections are close to the annotated days, and\noften precede it. In conclusion, using wavelet transforms on time series of cow\nactivity data helps to detect anomalies related to specific cow states.

Despite these shortcomings, Lindblad dynamics\nwas successfully employed in heavy-ion physics (quarkonia) and also became of\ninterest in quantum-computer applications.\n  In this paper, we consider a problem borrowed from heavy-ion collisions,\nnamely the formation of bound states, as for example the deuteron, in the\nnon-relativistic regime by using the already well understood techniques of\nLindblad dynamics. However, only recently, we were able to extend this toolbox\nby showing, that the position-space Lindblad equation can be reformulated in\nterms of a diffusion-advection equation with sources and therefore provides a\nhydrodynamical formulation of a dissipative quantum master equation. Making use\nof this advanced machinery and insights, we describe the possible formation of\na bound state, which is realized by a P\\\"oschl-Teller-like potential, of a\nparticle in interaction with a heat bath in a 1-dim setting. We analyse the\npossibility of a thermalization and the time-scale of the formation, population\nand depopulation of the bound state.

We then test the generalization\nperformance of CNNs on a classic relational reasoning task: estimating bar\nlength ratios in a bar chart, by progressively perturbing the standard\nvisualizations. We further conduct a user study to compare the performance of\nCNNs and humans. Our results show that CNNs outperform humans only when the\ntraining and test data have the same visual encodings. Otherwise, they may\nperform worse. We also find that CNNs are sensitive to perturbations in various\nvisual encodings, regardless of their relevance to the target bars. Yet, humans\nare mainly influenced by bar lengths. Our study suggests that robust relational\nreasoning with visualizations is challenging for CNNs. Improving CNNs'\ngeneralization performance may require training them to better recognize\ntask-related visual properties.",

LoRA and its variants merge low-rank\nadapter matrices with pretrained weights during inference to avoid latency\noverhead, but during training, the pretrained weights remain frozen while the\nadapter matrices are continuously updated, preventing such merging. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Partial Connection Adaptation (PaCA), which fine-tunes\nrandomly selected partial connections within the pretrained weights instead of\nintroducing adapter layers in the model. PaCA not only enhances training speed\nby eliminating the time overhead due to the sequential processing of the\nadapter and pretrained layers but also reduces activation memory since only\npartial activations, rather than full activations, need to be stored for\ngradient computation. Compared to LoRA, PaCA reduces training time by 22% and\ntotal memory usage by 16%, while maintaining comparable accuracy across various\nfine-tuning scenarios, such as fine-tuning on the MMLU dataset and instruction\ntuning on the Oasst1 dataset. PaCA can also be combined with quantization,\nenabling the fine-tuning of large models such as LLaMA3.1-70B.

Preference-based feedback, often implemented as a\nbinary comparison between multiple completions, is an established method to\nacquire large-scale human feedback. However, human feedback in other contexts\nis often much more diverse. Such diverse feedback can better support the goals\nof a human annotator, and the simultaneous use of multiple sources might be\nmutually informative for the learning process or carry type-dependent biases\nfor the reward learning process. Despite these potential benefits, learning\nfrom different feedback types has yet to be explored extensively.

We present a process to generate\nhigh-quality simulated feedback of six different types. Then, we implement\nreward models and downstream RL training for all six feedback types.

    "abstract": "In the context of the Horizon Europe project, METASAT, a hardware platform\nwas developed as a prototype of future space systems. The platform is based on\na multiprocessor NOEL-V, an established space-grade processor, which is\nintegrated with the SPARROW AI accelerator and connected to a GPU, Vortex. Both\nprocessing systems follow the RISC-V specification. This is a novel hardware\narchitecture for the space domain as the use of massive parallel processing\nunits, such as GPUs, is starting to be considered for upcoming space missions\ndue to the increased performance required to future space-related workloads, in\nparticular, related to AI. However, such solutions are only currently adopted\nfor New Space, since their limitations come not only from the hardware, but\nalso from the software, which needs to be qualified before being deployed on an\ninstitutional mission. For this reason, the METASAT platform is one of the\nfirst endeavors towards enabling the use of high performance hardware in a\nqualifiable environment for safety critical systems. The software stack is\nbased on baremetal, RTEMS and the XtratuM hypervisor, providing different\noptions for applications of various degrees of criticality.",

Second, Artemis constructs\nboth explicit and implicit call graphs to infer functions' relationships.\nThird, Artemis performs taint analysis based on a set of rules that prevent\nover-tainting and pauses when SSRF exploitation is impossible. Fourth, Artemis\nanalyzes the compatibility of path conditions to prune false positives. We have\nimplemented a prototype of Artemis and evaluated it on 250 PHP web\napplications.

Traditional approaches such as\nBM25 and Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) focus on lexical or semantic similarity\nbut tend to neglect the temporal alignment between queries and documents, which\nis essential for time-sensitive tasks like temporal question answering (TQA).\nWe propose TempRetriever, a novel extension of DPR that explicitly incorporates\ntemporal information by embedding both the query date and document timestamp\ninto the retrieval process. This allows retrieving passages that are not only\ncontextually relevant but also aligned with the temporal intent of queries. We\nevaluate TempRetriever on two large-scale datasets ArchivalQA and\nChroniclingAmericaQA demonstrating its superiority over baseline retrieval\nmodels across multiple metrics. TempRetriever achieves a 6.63\\% improvement in\nTop-1 retrieval accuracy and a 3.79\\% improvement in NDCG@10 compared to the\nstandard DPR on ArchivalQA. Similarly, for ChroniclingAmericaQA, TempRetriever\nexhibits a 9.56\\% improvement in Top-1 retrieval accuracy and a 4.68\\%\nimprovement in NDCG@10.

    "abstract": "This paper provides sharp quantitative and constructive estimates of\nnonnegative solutions $u(t,x)\\geq 0$ to the nonlinear fractional diffusion\nequation, $$\\partial_t u +{\\mathcal L} F(u)=0,$$ also known as filtration\nequation, posed in a smooth bounded domain $x\\in \\Omega \\subset {\\mathbb R}^N$\nwith suitable homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Both the operator\n${\\mathcal L}$ and the nonlinearity $F$ belong to a general class. The\nassumption on ${\\mathcal L}$ are set in terms of the kernel of ${\\mathcal L}$\nand/or ${\\mathcal L}^{-1}$, and allow for operators with degenerate kernel at\nthe boundary of $\\Omega$. The main examples of ${\\mathcal L}$ are the three\ndifferent Dirichlet Fractional Laplacians on bounded domains, and the\nnonlinearity can be non-homogeneous, for instance, $F(u)=u^2+u^{10}$. Previous\nresult were known in the porous medium case, i.e. $F(u)=|u|^{m-1} u$ with\n$m>1$. Our aim here is to perform the next step: a delicate analysis of\nregularity through quantitative, constructive and sharp a priori estimates. Our\nmain results are global Harnack type inequalities $$H_0(t,u_0)\\, {\\rm dist}(x,\n\\partial \\Omega)^a\\leq F(u(t,x))\\leq H_1(t)\\, {\\rm dist}(x, \\partial\n\\Omega)^b\\qquad\\forall (t,x)\\in (0,\\infty)\\times \\overline{\\Omega},$$ where the\nexpressions of $H_0, H_1$ and $a,b$ are explicit and may change according to\n${\\mathcal L}$ and $F$. The sharpness of such estimates is proven by means of\nexamples and counterexamples: on the one hand, we can match the powers (i.e.\n$a=b$) when the operator has a non degenerate kernel. On the other hand, when\n${\\mathcal L}$ has a kernel that degenerates at the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$,\nthere appear an intriguing anomalous boundary behaviour: the size of the\ninitial data determines the sharp boundary behaviour of the solution, different\nfor ``small'' and ``large'' initial data.

The performance of UAD\ntechniques degrades significantly in the presence of a domain shift, difficult\nto avoid in a real-world setting. While UDA has contributed to solving this\nissue in binary and multi-class classification, such a strategy is ill-posed in\nUAD. This might be explained by the unsupervised nature of the two tasks,\nnamely, domain adaptation and anomaly detection. Herein, we first formulate\nthis problem that we call the two-fold unsupervised curse. Then, we propose a\npioneering solution to this curse, considered intractable so far, by assuming\nthat anomalies are rare. Specifically, we leverage clustering techniques to\nidentify a dominant cluster in the target feature space. Posed as the normal\ncluster, the latter is aligned with the source normal features. Concretely,\ngiven a one-class source set and an unlabeled target set composed mostly of\nnormal data and some anomalies, we fit the source features within a hypersphere\nwhile jointly aligning them with the features of the dominant cluster from the\ntarget set. The paper provides extensive experiments and analysis on common\nadaptation benchmarks for anomaly detection, demonstrating the relevance of\nboth the newly introduced paradigm and the proposed approach.

The limited class diversity inherent to\none-class classification tasks, combined with distribution biases caused by\nvariations in products across and within clients, poses significant challenges\nfor preserving data privacy with federated UAD. Thus, this article proposes an\nefficient federated learning method with dynamic memory and memory-reduce for\nunsupervised image anomaly detection, called FedDyMem. Considering all client\ndata belongs to a single class (i.e., normal sample) in UAD and the\ndistribution of intra-class features demonstrates significant skewness,\nFedDyMem facilitates knowledge sharing between the client and server through\nthe client's dynamic memory bank instead of model parameters. In the local\nclients, a memory generator and a metric loss are employed to improve the\nconsistency of the feature distribution for normal samples, leveraging the\nlocal model to update the memory bank dynamically. For efficient communication,\na memory-reduce method based on weighted averages is proposed to significantly\ndecrease the scale of memory banks. On the server, global memory is constructed\nand distributed to individual clients through k-means aggregation. Experiments\nconducted on six industrial and medical datasets, comprising a mixture of six\nproducts or health screening types derived from eleven public datasets,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of FedDyMem.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) offers new\nopportunities to explore the gene expression patterns within the spatial\nmicroenvironment. Current research integrates pathological images to infer gene\nexpression, addressing the high costs and time-consuming processes to generate\nspatial transcriptomics data. However, as spatial transcriptomics resolution\ncontinues to improve, existing methods remain primarily focused on gene\nexpression prediction at low-resolution spot levels. These methods face\nsignificant challenges, especially the information bottleneck, when they are\napplied to high-resolution HD data. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces\nMagNet, a multi-level attention graph network designed for accurate prediction\nof high-resolution HD data. MagNet employs cross-attention layers to integrate\nfeatures from multi-resolution image patches hierarchically and utilizes a\nGAT-Transformer module to aggregate neighborhood information. By integrating\nmultilevel features, MagNet overcomes the limitations posed by low-resolution\ninputs in predicting high-resolution gene expression. We systematically\nevaluated MagNet and existing ST prediction models on both a private spatial\ntranscriptomics dataset and a public dataset at three different resolution\nlevels. The results demonstrate that MagNet achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance at both spot level and high-resolution bin levels, providing a\nnovel methodology and benchmark for future research and applications in\nhigh-resolution HD-level spatial transcriptomics.

Motivated by emerging evidence of a\ncooling phase in the abyssal Indo-Pacific, likely linked to the last Little Ice\nAge, this study reinterprets the interior-downwelling paradox from the\nperspective of unsteady thermal states. Idealized numerical experiments were\nconducted to explore the abyssal overturning dynamics, with a focus on the\nbehavior of advective, adiabatic, and diffusive overturning circulation\nstreamfunctions in both cooling and warming scenarios. The results reveal that\nwhile the direction of diabatic overturning (upwelling or downwelling) depends\non the transient state of the ocean, advective overturning circulation\nconsistently exhibits an upwelling pattern, underscoring the inherent\nrobustness of upward water parcel movement within abyssal dynamics.",

However, what is yet very\nunderexplored is how these models process the source information in detail.\nMethods To this end, we implemented an occlusion-based both model and\nperformance agnostic modality contribution method that quantitatively measures\nthe importance of each modality in the dataset for the model to fulfill its\ntask.

    "abstract": "A key countermeasure in cybersecurity has been the development of\nstandardized computational protocols for modeling and sharing cyber threat\nintelligence (CTI) between organizations, enabling a shared understanding of\nthreats and coordinated global responses. However, while the cybersecurity\ndomain benefits from mature threat exchange frameworks, there has been little\nprogress in the automatic and interoperable sharing of knowledge about\ndisinformation campaigns. This paper proposes an open-source disinformation\nthreat intelligence framework for sharing interoperable disinformation\nincidents. This approach relies on i) the modeling of disinformation incidents\nwith the DISARM framework (MITRE ATT&CK-based TTP modeling of disinformation\nattacks), ii) a custom mapping to STIX2 standard representation (computational\ndata format), and iii) an exchange architecture (called DISINFOX) capable of\nusing the proposed mapping with a centralized platform to store and manage\ndisinformation incidents and CTI clients which consume the gathered incidents.\nThe microservice-based implementation validates the framework with more than\n100 real-world disinformation incidents modeled, stored, shared, and consumed\nsuccessfully. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first academic and\ntechnical effort to integrate disinformation threats in the CTI ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Future wireless networks will need to support diverse applications (such as\nextended reality), scenarios (such as fully automated industries), and\ntechnological advances (such as terahertz communications). Current wireless\nnetworks are designed to perform adequately across multiple scenarios so they\nlack the adaptability needed for specific use cases. Therefore, meeting the\nstringent requirements of next-generation applications incorporating technology\nadvances and operating in novel scenarios will necessitate wireless specialized\nnetworks which we refer to as SpecNets. These networks, equipped with cognitive\ncapabilities, dynamically adapt to the unique demands of each application,\ne.g., by automatically selecting and configuring network mechanisms. An enabler\nof SpecNets are the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning (AI/ML), which allow to continuously learn and react to changing\nrequirements and scenarios. By integrating AI/ML functionalities, SpecNets will\nfully leverage the concept of AI/ML-defined radios (MLDRs) that are able to\nautonomously establish their own communication protocols by acquiring\ncontextual information and dynamically adapting to it. In this paper, we\nintroduce SpecNets and explain how MLDR interfaces enable this concept. We\npresent three illustrative use cases for wireless local area networks (WLANs):\nbespoke industrial networks, traffic-aware robust THz links, and coexisting\nnetworks. Finally, we showcase SpecNets' benefits in the industrial use case by\nintroducing a lightweight, fast-converging ML agent based on multi-armed\nbandits (MABs). This agent dynamically optimizes channel access to meet varying\nperformance needs: high throughput, low delay, or fair access. Results\ndemonstrate significant gains over IEEE 802.11, highlighting the system's\nautonomous adaptability across diverse scenarios.",

To\naddress this issue, we introduce a realistic black-box attack based on the RAG\nparadox, a structural vulnerability arising from the system's effort to enhance\ntrust by revealing both the retrieved documents and their sources to users.\nThis transparency enables attackers to observe which sources are used and how\ninformation is phrased, allowing them to craft poisoned documents that are more\nlikely to be retrieved and upload them to the identified sources. Moreover, as\nRAG systems directly provide retrieved content to users, these documents must\nnot only be retrievable but also appear natural and credible to maintain user\nconfidence in the search results. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on\nimproving document retrievability, our attack method explicitly considers both\nretrievability and user trust in the retrieved content. Both offline and online\nexperiments demonstrate that our method significantly degrades system\nperformance without internal access, while generating natural-looking poisoned\ndocuments.",

Despite this potential, a robust\nand comprehensive benchmarking framework to assess the efficacy of LLMs in\nauthentic psychiatric clinical environments is absent. This has impeded the\nadvancement of specialized LLMs tailored to psychiatric applications. In\nresponse to this gap, by incorporating clinical demands in psychiatry and\nclinical data, we proposed a benchmarking system, PsychBench, to evaluate the\npractical performance of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings. We conducted a\ncomprehensive quantitative evaluation of 16 LLMs using PsychBench, and\ninvestigated the impact of prompt design, chain-of-thought reasoning, input\ntext length, and domain-specific knowledge fine-tuning on model performance.\nThrough detailed error analysis, we identified strengths and potential\nlimitations of the existing models and suggested directions for improvement.\nSubsequently, a clinical reader study involving 60 psychiatrists of varying\nseniority was conducted to further explore the practical benefits of existing\nLLMs as supportive tools for psychiatrists of varying seniority. Through the\nquantitative and reader evaluation, we show that while existing models\ndemonstrate significant potential, they are not yet adequate as decision-making\ntools in psychiatric clinical practice. The reader study further indicates\nthat, as an auxiliary tool, LLM could provide particularly notable support for\njunior psychiatrists, effectively enhancing their work efficiency and overall\nclinical quality.

    "abstract": "As social VR grows in popularity, understanding how to optimise interactions\nbecomes increasingly important. Interpersonal distance (the physical space\npeople maintain between each other) is a key aspect of user experience.\nPrevious work in psychology has shown that breaches of personal space cause\nstress and discomfort. Thus, effectively managing this distance is crucial in\nsocial VR, where social interactions are frequent. Teleportation, a commonly\nused locomotion method in these environments, involves distinct cognitive\nprocesses and requires users to rely on their ability to estimate distance.\nDespite its widespread use, the effect of teleportation on proximity remains\nunexplored. To investigate this, we measured the interpersonal distance of 70\nparticipants during interactions with embodied conversational agents, comparing\nteleportation to natural walking. Our findings revealed that participants\nmaintained closer proximity from the agents during teleportation. Female\nparticipants kept greater distances from the agents than male participants, and\nnatural walking was associated with higher agency and body ownership, though\nco-presence remained unchanged. We propose that differences in spatial\nperception and spatial cognitive load contribute to reduced interpersonal\ndistance with teleportation. These findings emphasise that proximity should be\na key consideration when selecting locomotion methods in social VR,\nhighlighting the need for further research on how locomotion impacts spatial\nperception and social dynamics in virtual environments.",

A similar trend can also be seen in\nTurkey, while another similarity is the high dependence on imports for the\ncontinuous NG supply. It is crucial to accurately forecast future NG demand\n(NGD) in Turkey, especially, for import contracts; in this respect, forecasts\nof monthly NGD for the following year are of utmost importance. In the current\nstudy, the historical monthly NG consumption data between 2014 and 2024\nprovided by SOCAR, the local residential NG distribution company for two cities\nin Turkey, Bursa and Kayseri, was used to determine out-of-sample monthly NGD\nforecasts for a period of one year and nine months using various time series\nmodels, including SARIMA and ETS models, and a novel proposed machine learning\nmethod. The proposed method, named Just-in-Time-Learning-Gaussian Process\nRegression (JITL-GPR), uses a novel feature representation for the past NG\ndemand values; instead of using past demand values as column-wise separate\nfeatures, they are placed on a two-dimensional (2-D) grid of year-month values.\nFor each test point, a kernel function, tailored for the NGD predictions, is\nused in GPR to predict the query point. Since a model is constructed separately\nfor each test point, the proposed method is, indeed, an example of JITL. The\nJITL-GPR method is easy to use and optimize, and offers a reduction in forecast\nerrors compared to traditional time series methods and a state-of-the-art\ncombination model; therefore, it is a promising tool for NGD forecasting in\nsimilar settings.",

In this paper,\nwe review the various initiatives to embed clinical knowledge into\ntraining-based, KG-supported, and RAG-assisted LLMs. We begin by gathering\nreliable knowledge sources from the medical domain, including databases and\ndatasets. Next, we evaluate implementations for integrating clinical knowledge\nthrough specialized datasets and collaborations with external knowledge sources\nsuch as KGs and relevant documentation. Furthermore, we discuss the\napplications of the developed medical LLMs in the industrial sector to assess\nthe disparity between models developed in academic settings and those in\nindustry. We conclude the survey by presenting evaluation systems applicable to\nrelevant tasks and identifying potential challenges facing this field.

For\nthat purpose, in its Wide component, galaxies targetted by WAVES will be\nflux-limited to $Z<21.1$ mag and will cover the redshift range of $z<0.2$, at a\nspectroscopic success rate of $\\sim95\\%$. Meeting this completeness\nrequirement, when the redshift is unknown a priori, is a challenge. We solve\nthis problem with supervised machine learning to predict the probability of a\ngalaxy falling within the WAVES-Wide redshift limit, rather than estimate each\nobject's redshift. This is done by training an XGBoost tree-based classifier to\ndecide if a galaxy should be a target or not. Our photometric data come from\n9-band VST+VISTA observations, including KiDS+VIKING surveys. The redshift\nlabels for calibration are derived from an extensive spectroscopic sample\noverlapping with KiDS and ancillary fields. Our current results indicate that\nwith our approach, we should be able to achieve the completeness of $\\sim95\\%$,\nwhich is the WAVES success criterion.",

This note presents\nan improved EFT signal reweighting method that addresses the limitations of\napproaches that rely solely on the invariant mass of the di-Higgs system\n$m_{hh}$, which fail to capture variations in kinematic variables such as the\nHiggs boson transverse momentum. We show that these limitations are\nparticularly pronounced in scenarios involving strong destructive interference.\nThe proposed method is developed for both EFTs for $hh$ ggF at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$\nand $13.6$ TeV at next-to-leading order in QCD. We demonstrate a reweighting\ntechnique that combines more than one EFT reference sample while incorporating\nmultiple key variables of ggF.

    "abstract": "Role-playing enables large language models (LLMs) to engage users in\nimmersive and personalized interactions, but it also introduces significant\nsafety risks. Existing role-play fine-tuning techniques improve role\nadaptability but may degrade safety performance, particularly for villainous\ncharacters. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive assessment of\nrole-play fine-tuning risks by training 95 role-specific LLMs using RoleBench.\nOur experiments reveal that role-play fine-tuning leads to a noticeable decline\nin safety performance, with safety risks varying based on character traits. To\ntackle this challenge, we propose Safety-Aware Role-Play Fine-Tuning (SaRFT), a\nnovel method designed to balance role-playing capabilities and safety.\nExtensive experiments on LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-it, and\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrate that SaRFT consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines under both LoRA and full-parameter fine-tuning\nsettings.

    "abstract": "Aiming towards the magnetorheological characterisation of whole human blood,\nwe evaluated the suitability of our experimental setup for steady shear\nmeasurements with low-viscosity fluids. Previous measurements with a rotational\nrheometer equipped with a magnetorheological cell returned low and inconsistent\napparent-viscosity values. In this work, a parametric study was conducted,\nexperimentally and numerically, to evaluate the possible error sources and\ndefine an experimentally reliable window. Steady shear measurements were\ncarried out with Newtonian fluids using two geometries: parallel-plates at\ndifferent gap heights, and cone-plate. A clear decrease in measured viscosity\nwith parallel-plate gap reduction was found, along with a slight overestimation\nof the cone-plate. Numerical results corroborated the experimental\nobservations, pointing towards a small inclination of the bottom plate (between\n0.1{\\deg} and 0.3{\\deg}). The numerical study has also shown that geometry\nnon-parallelism can lead to significant flow alterations, particularly for\ncone-plate geometries where contraction/expansion flow can be generated,\ncritically deviating from the canonical Couette flow and provoking\nnon-negligible errors. Additional experimental and numerical work was conducted\nto evaluate the effects of the non-parallelism on magnetorheological\nmeasurements. The geometrical asymmetry results in severe alterations of the\nmicrostructural dynamics, possibly leading to an underestimation of the\nmagnetorheological response. This work has shown that geometry non-parallelism\ncan have critical repercussions on simple shear flows, with fundamentally\ndifferent implications from a general gap-error, and can be identified through\ncomparative measurements with Newtonian fluids in different geometries\n(parallel-plates and cone-plate)",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, specialized computing and storage devices, such as\nGPUs, TPUs, and high-speed storage, have been increasingly integrated into\nserver nodes within Supercomputers and Data Centers. The advent of\nhigh-bandwidth memory (HBM) has facilitated a more compact design for these\ncomponents, enabling multiple units to be interconnected within a single server\nnode through intra-node networks like PCIe, NVLink, or Ethernet. These networks\nallow for scaling up the number of dedicated computing and storage devices per\nnode. Additionally, inter-node networks link these devices across thousands of\nserver nodes in large-scale computing systems. However, as communication\ndemands among accelerators grow-especially in workloads like generative AI-both\nintra- and inter-node networks risk becoming critical bottlenecks. Although\nmodern intra-node network architectures attempt to mitigate this issue by\nboosting bandwidth, we demonstrate in this paper that such an approach can\ninadvertently degrade inter-node communication. This occurs when high-bandwidth\nintra-node traffic interferes with incoming traffic from external nodes,\nleading to congestion. To evaluate this phenomenon, we analyze the\ncommunication behavior of realistic traffic patterns commonly found in\ngenerative AI applications. Using OMNeT++, we developed a general simulation\nmodel that captures both intra- and inter-node network interactions. Through\nextensive simulations, our findings reveal that increasing intra-node bandwidth\nand the number of accelerators per node can actually hinder overall inter-node\ncommunication performance rather than improve it.",

    "abstract": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) focuses on providing answers to natural\nlanguage questions by utilizing information from images. Although cutting-edge\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o achieve strong\nperformance on VQA tasks, they frequently fall short in accessing\ndomain-specific or the latest knowledge. To mitigate this issue,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) leveraging external knowledge bases (KBs),\nreferred to as KB-VQA, emerges as a promising approach. Nevertheless,\nconventional unimodal retrieval techniques, which translate images into textual\ndescriptions, often result in the loss of critical visual details. To address\nthese challenges, this study presents two key innovations. First, we introduce\nfine-grained knowledge units that consist of multimodal data fragments (e.g.\ntext fragments, entity images, and so on) in a structured manner. Rather than\nmerely refining retrieval mechanisms, we prioritize the systematic organization\nand management of these knowledge units, ensuring that the structuring process\nitself enhances retrieval quality. Second, we propose a knowledge unit\nretrieval-augmented generation framework (KU-RAG) that seamlessly integrates\nfine-grained retrieval with MLLMs. Our KU-RAG framework not only ensures\nprecise retrieval of relevant knowledge but also enhances reasoning\ncapabilities through a knowledge correction chain. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing KB-VQA methods\nacross four benchmarks, achieving an average improvement of approximately 3%\nand up to 11% in the best case.",

Robustness evaluation shows that our model maintains superior\naccuracy across different age groups, and knowledge learned from one group\ngeneralizes better to another. Evaluation on our sentence-based dataset further\ndemonstrates its potential in recognizing full sentences. Through comprehensive\nablation studies, we show that our design choices lead to a strong balance\nbetween performance and efficiency. These findings support the development of\nmore adaptable and scalable HWR systems for real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of Large Language Models across various\ndomains, their security issues have increasingly garnered significant attention\nfrom both academic and industrial communities. This study conducts sampling and\nnormalization of the parameters of the LLM to generate visual representations\nand heatmaps of parameter distributions, revealing notable discrepancies in\nparameter distributions among certain layers within the hidden layers. Further\nanalysis involves calculating statistical metrics for each layer, followed by\nthe computation of a Comprehensive Sensitivity Score based on these metrics,\nwhich identifies the lower layers as being particularly sensitive to the\ngeneration of harmful content. Based on this finding, we employ a Freeze\ntraining strategy, selectively performing Supervised Fine-Tuning only on the\nlower layers. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly\nreduces training duration and GPU memory consumption while maintaining a high\njailbreak success rate and a high harm score, outperforming the results\nachieved by applying the LoRA method for SFT across all layers. Additionally,\nthe method has been successfully extended to other open-source large models,\nvalidating its generality and effectiveness across different model\narchitectures. Furthermore, we compare our method with ohter jailbreak method,\ndemonstrating the superior performance of our approach. By innovatively\nproposing a method to statistically analyze and compare large model parameters\nlayer by layer, this study provides new insights into the interpretability of\nlarge models. These discoveries emphasize the necessity of continuous research\nand the implementation of adaptive security measures in the rapidly evolving\nfield of LLMs to prevent potential jailbreak attack risks, thereby promoting\nthe development of more robust and secure LLMs.",

To optimise the scientific outcome of the mission, such\nstars need to be homogeneously characterised beforehand. In this work, we focus\non a methodology based on spectral synthesis for the characterisation of\nFGK-type stars from the Ariel Tier 1 Mission Candidate Sample (MCS) which\nexhibit fast rotation. In addition, we analyse slow-rotating FGK-type stars,\nwith either new observations or archival spectra available, consistently as in\nour previous work using the equivalent width (EW) analysis. To ensure\nconsistency between our methods, we re-analysed a sample of FGK-type stars with\nthe spectral synthesis method and compared it to our previous work. The results\nof our analysis show excellent agreement with the previous set of derived\nparameters. We also computed their orbital parameters establishing whether they\nbelong to the Galactic thin or thick discs. With the current set of stellar\nparameters, we almost double the analysed hosts in the Ariel MCS to 353 stars\nin total. Using our homogeneous set of stellar parameters, we studied the\ncorrelations between stellar and planetary properties for the Ariel MCS\nanalysed so far. We confirmed a close relationship between stellar mass (up to\n1.8 solar masses) and giant planet radius, with more inflated planets at lower\nmetallicity. We confirm that giant planets are more frequent around more\nmetal-rich stars that belong to the thin disc, while lower-mass planets are\nalso found in more metal-poor environments, and are more frequent than giant\nplanets in the thick disc as also seen in other works in the literature.",

While powerful, these models are prone to adversarial attacks: a\nbenign targeted perturbation of input data leads to significant changes in a\nclassifier's output. However, formally small attacks in the time series domain\nbecome easily detected by the human eye or a simple detector model.\n  We develop a concealed adversarial attack for different time-series models:\nit provides more realistic perturbations, being hard to detect by a human or\nmodel discriminator. To achieve this goal, the proposed adversarial attack\nmaximizes an aggregation of a classifier and a trained discriminator loss. To\nmake the attack stronger, we also propose a training procedure for a\ndiscriminator that provides broader coverage of possible attacks. Extensive\nbenchmarking on six UCR time series datasets across four diverse architectures\n- including recurrent, convolutional, state-space, and transformer-based models\n- demonstrates the superiority of our attack for a concealability-efficiency\ntrade-off.

In particular, since the\nring intensity and radius at a given time depend on the amount of dust and on\nits distance, respectively XMM-Newton and Swift images allowed us to map the\nISM around the direction of the GRB with better resolution than in the existing\noptical and infrared-based 3D dust maps, both in the plane of the sky (few\narcminutes) and along the line of sight (from $\\simeq 1$ pc for dust clouds\nwithin 1 kpc to $\\simeq 100$ pc for structures at distances larger than 10\nkpc). As a consequence, we can revise prior estimates of the GRB soft X-ray\nfluence, obtaining a $\\sim$35\\% lower value, which, however, still indicates a\nsubstantial excess with respect to the extrapolation of the spectral models\nconstrained by hard X-ray observations.\n  Additionally, we detect significant spectral variability in two azimuthal\nsectors of the X-ray rings, which can be fully attributed to different Galactic\nabsorption in these two directions. The comparison of the total hydrogen column\ndensity inferred from spectral fitting, with the Galactic contribution derived\nfrom the intensity of the X-ray rings, in the same sectors, allowed us to more\nrobustly constrain the absorption in the host galaxy to $N_{\\rm{H,z=0.151}}=\n(3.7\\pm0.3)\\,\\times\\,10^{21}\\,\\rm{cm^{-2}}$.

Using a\nphenotypically structured model, we show that alterations in healthy\ndifferentiation dynamics are related to cell malignancy, and tumour volume\ngrowth. We use this model to analyse the evolution of malignant traits in a\ntumour. Our findings suggest that normal development dynamics make the\nembryonic sympathetic nervous system more robust to perturbations and\naccumulation of malignancies, and that the diversity of differentiation\ndynamics found in the neuroblastoma subtypes lead to unique risk profiles for\nneuroblastoma relapse after treatment.",

To achieve low\nlatency and high-quality video transmission over a bandwidth-constrained noisy\nwireless channel, we propose a stable diffusion (SD)-based goal-oriented\nsemantic communication (GSC) framework. In this framework, we first design a\nsemantic encoder that effectively identify the keyframes from video and extract\nthe relevant semantic information (SI) to reduce the transmission data size. We\nthen develop a semantic decoder to reconstruct the keyframes from the received\nSI and further generate the full video from the reconstructed keyframes using\nframe interpolation to ensure high-quality reconstruction. Recognizing the\nimpact of wireless channel noise on SI transmission, we also propose an\nSD-based denoiser for GSC (SD-GSC) condition on an instantaneous channel gain\nto remove the channel noise from the received noisy SI under a known channel.\nFor scenarios with an unknown channel, we further propose a parallel SD\ndenoiser for GSC (PSD-GSC) to jointly learn the distribution of channel gains\nand denoise the received SI. It is shown that, with the known channel, our\nproposed SD-GSC outperforms state-of-the-art ADJSCC, Latent-Diff DNSC, DeepWiVe\nand DVST, improving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by 69%, 58%, 33% and 38%,\nreducing mean squared error (MSE) by 52%, 50%, 41% and 45%, and reducing\nFr\\'echet Video Distance (FVD) by 38%, 32%, 22% and 24%, respectively.

    "abstract": "The intellectual property of deep image-to-image models can be protected by\nthe so-called box-free watermarking. It uses an encoder and a decoder,\nrespectively, to embed into and extract from the model's output images\ninvisible copyright marks. Prior works have improved watermark robustness,\nfocusing on the design of better watermark encoders. In this paper, we reveal\nan overlooked vulnerability of the unprotected watermark decoder which is\njointly trained with the encoder and can be exploited to train a watermark\nremoval network. To defend against such an attack, we propose the decoder\ngradient shield (DGS) as a protection layer in the decoder API to prevent\ngradient-based watermark removal with a closed-form solution. The fundamental\nidea is inspired by the classical adversarial attack, but is utilized for the\nfirst time as a defensive mechanism in the box-free model watermarking. We then\ndemonstrate that DGS can reorient and rescale the gradient directions of\nwatermarked queries and stop the watermark remover's training loss from\nconverging to the level without DGS, while retaining decoder output image\nquality. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of proposed method. Code\nof paper will be made available upon acceptance.",

Concretely, we obtain spinning boson star solutions for\na family of models parametrized by the curvature of their two-dimensional\ntarget manifold, as well as for various self-interaction potentials. We derive\nthe global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function\nof both the curvature of the target space and the strength of\nself-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target\nmanifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions,\nallowing for a range of notably different masses and degrees of compactness.\nHowever, we find that the relations between different multipoles are consistent\nwith those for the standard complex scalar stars, and hence the universality of\nsuch relations is extended to curved target spaces.",

    "abstract": "Will it be possible in the future to realize large, complex space missions\ndedicated to basic science like HST, Chandra and JWST? Or will their cost be\ntoo great? Today's space scene is completely different from that of even five\nyears ago, and certainly from that of the time when HST, Chandra and JWST were\nconceived and built. Space-related investments have grown exponentially in\nrecent years, with a monetary investment exceeding half a trillion dollars per\nyear since 2023. This boom is greatly aided by the rise of the so-called 'new\nspace' economy driven by private commercial funding, which for the first time\nlast year surpassed public investments in space. The establishment of a market\nlogic to space activities results in more competition and a resulting dramatic\ncost and schedule reduction. Can space science take advantage of the benefits\nof the new space economy to reduce cost and development time and at the same\ntime succeed in producing powerful missions in basic science? The prospects for\nEurope and the United States are considered here. We argue that this goal would\nbe achievable if the scientific community could take advantage of the three\npillars underlying the innovation of the new space economy: (1) technology\ninnovation proceeding through both incremental innovation and disruptive\ninnovation, (2) business innovation, through vertical integration, scale\nproduction, and service-oriented business model, and (3) cultural innovation,\nthrough openness to risk and iterative development.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, significantly\ncontributing to mortality, particularly in older populations. While pulmonary\nvein isolation is a standard treatment, its effectiveness is limited in\npatients with persistent AF. Recent research highlights the importance of\ntargeting additional atrial regions, particularly fibrotic areas identified via\nlate gadolinium-enhanced MRI (LGE-MRI). However, existing manual segmentation\nmethods are time-consuming and prone to variability. Deep learning techniques,\nparticularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in\nautomating segmentation. However, most studies focus solely on the left atrium\n(LA) and rely on small datasets, limiting generalizability. In this paper, we\npropose a novel two-stage framework incorporating ResNeXt encoders and a cyclic\nlearning rate to segment both the right atrium (RA) and LA walls and cavities\nin LGE-MRIs. Our method aims to improve the segmentation of challenging small\nstructures, such as atrial walls while maintaining high performance in larger\nregions like the atrial cavities. The results demonstrate that our approach\noffers superior segmentation accuracy and robustness compared to traditional\narchitectures, particularly for imbalanced class structures.",

In the proposed\ndevice, the unpaired nature of the Majorana edge modes inherently leads to the\nabsence of the charge current in the linear response regime, while the current\nfluctuation remains significant. Therefore, the divergence in the\nnoise-to-current ratio serves as unambiguous evidence for the presence of the\ndispersing Majorana edge modes.

Despite its\nbroad potential, the formation kinetics of DNA-templated silver nanowires\nremains unclear. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of the\nformation of silver nanowires with a diameter of 2.2+0.4 nm at the\nsingle-molecule level through chemical reduction. We conducted equilibrium and\nperturbation kinetic experiments to measure force spectroscopy during the\nformation of Ag+ -DNA complexes and Ag-DNA complexes, using optical tweezers\ncombined with microfluidics. The addition of AgNO3 resulted in an increase in\nforce of 5.5-7.5 pN within 2 minutes, indicating that Ag+ compacts the DNA\nstructure.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this issue by\ngrounding LLM responses with external knowledge. This study evaluates the\nrelationship between retriever effectiveness and hallucination reduction in\nLLMs using three retrieval approaches: sparse retrieval based on BM25 keyword\nsearch, dense retrieval using semantic search with Sentence Transformers, and a\nproposed hybrid retrieval module. The hybrid module incorporates query\nexpansion and combines the results of sparse and dense retrievers through a\ndynamically weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion score. Using the HaluBench dataset,\na benchmark for hallucinations in question answering tasks, we assess retrieval\nperformance with metrics such as mean average precision and normalised\ndiscounted cumulative gain, focusing on the relevance of the top three\nretrieved documents. Results show that the hybrid retriever achieves better\nrelevance scores, outperforming both sparse and dense retrievers. Further\nevaluation of LLM-generated answers against ground truth using metrics such as\naccuracy, hallucination rate, and rejection rate reveals that the hybrid\nretriever achieves the highest accuracy on fails, the lowest hallucination\nrate, and the lowest rejection rate. These findings highlight the hybrid\nretriever's ability to enhance retrieval relevance, reduce hallucination rates,\nand improve LLM reliability, emphasising the importance of advanced retrieval\ntechniques in mitigating hallucinations and improving response accuracy.",

Unfortunately, block encoding often results in significant\nsubnormalisation and increase in the matrix's effective condition number\n$\\kappa$, affecting the efficiency of solvers. Matrix preconditioning is a\nwell-established classical technique to reduce $\\kappa$ by multiplying $A$ by a\npreconditioner $P$. Here, we study quantum preconditioning for block encodings.\nWe consider four preconditioners and two encoding approaches: (a) separately\nencoding $A$ and its preconditioner $P$, followed by quantum multiplication,\nand (b) classically multiplying $A$ and $P$ before encoding the product in\n$U_{PA}$. Their impact on subnormalisation factors and condition number\n$\\kappa$ are analysed using practical matrices from Computational Fluid\nDynamics (CFD). Our results show that (a) quantum multiplication introduces\nexcessive subnormalisation factors, negating improvements in $\\kappa$. We\nintroduce preamplified quantum multiplication to reduce subnormalisation, which\nis of independent interest. Conversely, we see that (b) encoding of the\nclassical product can significantly improve the effective condition number\nusing the Sparse Approximate Inverse preconditioner with infill.

DexGraspVLA also, for the\nfirst time, simultaneously demonstrates free-form long-horizon prompt\nexecution, robustness to adversarial objects and human disturbance, and failure\nrecovery. Extended application to nonprehensile grasping further proves its\ngenerality. Project website: https://dexgraspvla.github.io.",

Here, we demonstrate a novel\nconcept for the implementation of these functionalites\n  through the electrical excitation of GHz membrane-like drum modes. Our\nconcept relies on the strong dependence of the frequency spectrum of Lamb\nacoustic modes on the thickness of the propagating medium. Lamb\n  modes generated by a piezoelectric resonator in a thicker (or thinner)\nsubstrate region remain confined in this region via reflections at the lateral\nboundaries with thinner (thicker) substrate regions. If the generation region\nis\n  disk-shaped, the lateral reflections form drum-like modes, which we\nexperimentally confirm by radio-frequency spectroscopy as well as by maps of\nthe surface displacements. Furthermore, we show that an array of sector shaped\npiezoelectric transducers powered with appropriate radio-frequency phases\ncreates helical modes with tunable helicity, which can then be transferred to\nan optical beam. Our analytical and finite-element models yield\n  useful insights into the acoustic coupling of bulk and surface modes that can\nguide adaptation to other material systems. The acoustic drum modes thus\nprovide a flexible platform for acousto-optical chiral functionalities in\n  the GHz frequency range.",

However, other lines (at 894, 964, 968 and 1055 GHz) in this system\nremained unexplored due to observational challenges. Using SOFIA/4GREAT\nobservations and Herschel/HIFI archival data, we analyzed the six HCN\ntransitions in eight C-rich AGB stars. We report new HCN transitions show laser\naction at 964, 968, and 1055 GHz. The 805, 891, and 964 GHz lasers were\ndetected in seven C-rich stars, the 968 GHz laser in six, and the 1055 GHz\nlaser in five, while the 894 GHz line was not detected in any target. Among the\ndetected lasers, the 891 GHz laser is always the strongest, and the 964 GHz\nlaser, like a twin of the 891 GHz line, is the second strongest. Towards\nIRC+10216, all five HCN laser transitions were observed in six to eight epochs\nand exhibited significant variations in line profiles and intensities. The\ncross-ladder lines at 891 and 964 GHz exhibit similar variations, and their\nintensity changes do not follow the near-infrared light curve (i.e.\nnon-periodic variations). In contrast, the variations of the rotational lines\nat 805, 968, and 1055 GHz appear to be quasi-periodic, with a phase lag of 0.1\n- 0.2 relative to the near-infrared light curve. A comparative analysis\nindicates that these HCN lasers may be seen as analogues to vibrationally\nexcited SiO and water masers in oxygen-rich stars. We suggest chemical pumping\nand radiative pumping could play an important role in the production of the\ncross-ladder HCN lasers, while the quasi-periodic behavior of the rotational\nHCN laser lines may be modulated by additional collisional and radiative\npumping driven by periodic shocks and variations in infrared luminosity.\n[abridged]",

    "abstract": "Understanding the chemistry of molecular clouds is pivotal to elucidate star\nformation and galaxy evolution. As one of the important molecular ions, HCNH+\nplays an important role in this chemistry. Yet, its behavior and significance\nunder extreme conditions, such as in the CMZs of external galaxies, are still\nlargely unexplored. We aim to reveal the physical and chemical properties of\nthe CMZ in the starburst galaxy NGC253 with multiple HCNH+ transitions to shed\nlight on the molecule's behavior under the extreme physical conditions of a\nstarburst. We employ molecular line data including results for four rotational\ntransitions of HCNH+ from the ALCHEMI large program to investigate underlying\nphysical and chemical processes. Despite weak intensities, HCNH+ emission is\nwidespread throughout NGC253's CMZ, which suggests that this molecular ion can\neffectively trace large-scale structures within molecular clouds. Using the\nquantum mechanical coupled states approximation, we computed rate coefficients\nfor collisions of HCNH+ with para-H2 and ortho-H2 at kinetic temperatures up to\n500 K. Using these coefficients in a non-LTE modeling framework and employing a\nMonte Carlo Markov chain analysis, we find that HCNH+ emission originates from\nregions with H2 number densities of $\\sim10^{2.80}-10^{3.55}$~cm$^{-3}$,\nestablishing HCNH+ as a tracer of low-density environments. Our analysis\nreveals that most of the HCNH+ abundances in the CMZ of NGC253 are higher than\nall reported values in the Milky Way. We performed static, PDR, and shock\nmodeling, and found that recurrent shocks could potentially account for the\nelevated HCNH+ abundances observed in this CMZ. We propose that the\nunexpectedly high HCNH+ abundances may result from chemical enhancement,\nprimarily driven by the elevated gas temperatures and cosmic ray ionization\nrates of shocked, low-density gas in the nuclear starburst regions of NGC253.",

We then\napply the proposed new method to study the impact of domain changes on multiple\nsolutions of certain nonlinear elliptic equations. When the domain varies from\na circular disk to an elliptical disk, the corresponding functional value\nchanges dramatically for some particular solutions, which indicates that these\nnontrivial solutions in the circular domain may become unstable in the\nelliptical domain. Moreover, several theoretical results on multiple solutions\nin existing literature are verified. For the nonlinear Sine-Gordon equation\nwith parameter $\\lambda$, nontrivial solutions are found for $\\lambda >\n\\lambda_2$, here $\\lambda_2$ is the second eigenvalue of the corresponding\nlinear eigenvalue problem.

While graph machine learning\nholds great promise across various domains, the design of effective pretext\ntasks for self-supervised graph representation learning remains challenging.\nContrastive learning, a popular approach in graph self-supervised learning,\nleverages positive and negative pairs to compute a contrastive loss function.\nHowever, current graph contrastive learning methods often struggle to fully use\nstructural patterns and node similarities. To address these issues, we present\na new method called Fused Gromov Wasserstein Subgraph Contrastive Learning\n(FOSSIL). Our model integrates node-level and subgraph-level contrastive\nlearning, seamlessly combining a standard node-level contrastive loss with the\nFused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. This combination helps our method capture\nboth node features and graph structure together. Importantly, our approach\nworks well with both homophilic and heterophilic graphs and can dynamically\ncreate views for generating positive and negative pairs. Through extensive\nexperiments on benchmark graph datasets, we show that FOSSIL outperforms or\nachieves competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.",

Specifically, we\ndesign a spatial feature differential handling block (SFDHBlock), with the core\nbeing the spatial domain feature enhancement module (SFEM). Through the feature\ndifference operation, SFEM not only helps the model focus on the key\ninformation in the blurred regions but also eliminates the interference of\nimplicit noise. Additionally, based on the fact that the difference between\nsharp and blurred images primarily lies in the high-frequency components, we\npropose a high-frequency feature selection block (HFSBlock). The HFSBlock first\nuses learnable filters to extract high-frequency features and then selectively\nretains the most important ones. To fully leverage the decoder's potential, we\nuse a pre-trained model as the encoder and incorporate the above modules only\nin the decoder.

To train and validate PulseFormer, we collected\na dataset of 13+ hours of eye tracking videos from Project Aria and\ncontact-based PPG signals as well as an electrocardiogram (ECG) for\nground-truth HR values.

Notably, our results show that, if $t$ is close to the hitting\ntime for a partial $F$-factor, then the budget $b$ cannot be substantially\nlower than $t$. These results give negative answers to questions of Frieze,\nKrivelevich and Michaeli.\n  Conversely, we also exhibit a simple strategy for constructing (partial)\n$F$-factors, in particular showing that our general lower bound is tight up to\nconstant factors. The ideas from this strategy can be exploited for other\nproperties. As an example, we obtain an essentially optimal strategy for powers\nof Hamilton cycles. In order to formally prove that this strategy succeeds, we\ndevelop novel tools for analysing multi-stage strategies, which may be of\ngeneral interest for studying other properties.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of computational pathology, many AI-assisted\ndiagnostic tasks have emerged. Cellular nuclei segmentation can segment various\ntypes of cells for downstream analysis, but it relies on predefined categories\nand lacks flexibility. Moreover, pathology visual question answering can\nperform image-level understanding but lacks region-level detection capability.\nTo address this, we propose a new benchmark called Pathology Visual Grounding\n(PathVG), which aims to detect regions based on expressions with different\nattributes. To evaluate PathVG, we create a new dataset named RefPath which\ncontains 27,610 images with 33,500 language-grounded boxes. Compared to visual\ngrounding in other domains, PathVG presents pathological images at multi-scale\nand contains expressions with pathological knowledge. In the experimental\nstudy, we found that the biggest challenge was the implicit information\nunderlying the pathological expressions. Based on this, we proposed Pathology\nKnowledge-enhanced Network (PKNet) as the baseline model for PathVG. PKNet\nleverages the knowledge-enhancement capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to convert pathological terms with implicit information into explicit\nvisual features, and fuses knowledge features with expression features through\nthe designed Knowledge Fusion Module (KFM). The proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the PathVG benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Sound event detection (SED) has significantly benefited from self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) approaches, particularly masked audio transformer for SED\n(MAT-SED), which leverages masked block prediction to reconstruct missing audio\nsegments. However, while effective in capturing global dependencies, masked\nblock prediction disrupts transient sound events and lacks explicit enforcement\nof temporal order, making it less suitable for fine-grained event boundary\ndetection. To address these limitations, we propose JiTTER (Jigsaw Temporal\nTransformer for Event Reconstruction), an SSL framework designed to enhance\ntemporal modeling in transformer-based SED. JiTTER introduces a hierarchical\ntemporal shuffle reconstruction strategy, where audio sequences are randomly\nshuffled at both the block-level and frame-level, forcing the model to\nreconstruct the correct temporal order. This pretraining objective encourages\nthe model to learn both global event structures and fine-grained transient\ndetails, improving its ability to detect events with sharp onset-offset\ncharacteristics. Additionally, we incorporate noise injection during block\nshuffle, providing a subtle perturbation mechanism that further regularizes\nfeature learning and enhances model robustness. Experimental results on the\nDESED dataset demonstrate that JiTTER outperforms MAT-SED, achieving a 5.89%\nimprovement in PSDS, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit temporal\nreasoning in SSL-based SED. Our findings suggest that structured temporal\nreconstruction tasks, rather than simple masked prediction, offer a more\neffective pretraining paradigm for sound event representation learning.",

    "abstract": "The movable antenna (MA) technology has attracted great attention recently\ndue to its promising capability in improving wireless channel conditions by\nflexibly adjusting antenna positions. To reap maximal performance gains of MA\nsystems, existing works mainly focus on MA position optimization to cater to\nthe instantaneous channel state information (CSI). However, the resulting\nreal-time antenna movement may face challenges in practical implementation due\nto the additional time overhead and energy consumption required, especially in\nfast time-varying channel scenarios. To address this issue, we propose in this\npaper a new approach to optimize the MA positions based on the users'\nstatistical CSI over a large timescale. In particular, we propose a general\nfield response based statistical channel model to characterize the random\nchannel variations caused by the local movement of users. Based on this model,\na two-timescale optimization problem is formulated to maximize the ergodic sum\nrate of multiple users, where the precoding matrix and the positions of MAs at\nthe base station (BS) are optimized based on the instantaneous and statistical\nCSI, respectively. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, a log-barrier\npenalized gradient ascent algorithm is developed to optimize the MA positions,\nwhere two methods are proposed to approximate the ergodic sum rate and its\ngradients with different complexities. Finally, we present simulation results\nto evaluate the performance of the proposed design and algorithms based on\npractical channels generated by ray-tracing. The results verify the performance\nadvantages of MA systems compared to their fixed-position antenna (FPA)\ncounterparts in terms of long-term rate improvement, especially for scenarios\nwith more diverse channel power distributions in the angular domain.",

Existing\noverviews remain at a conceptual level that is undiscerning to the underlying\nalgorithms, representations, and their respective success.\n  Methods: We address this gap by performing an explorative systematic review.\nReports were included if they described techniques enabling Computational\nMetacognitive Architectures (CMAs) to model, store, remember, and process their\nepisodic metacognitive experiences, one of Flavell's (1979a) three foundational\ncomponents of metacognition.

Data were extracted using a 20-item\nframework considering pertinent aspects.\n  Results: A total of 101 reports on 35 distinct CMAs were included. Our\nfindings show that metacognitive experiences may boost system performance and\nexplainability, e.g., via self-repair. However, lack of standardization and\nlimited evaluations may hinder progress: only 17% of CMAs were quantitatively\nevaluated regarding this review's focus, and significant terminological\ninconsistency limits cross-architecture synthesis. Systems also varied widely\nin memory content, data types, and employed algorithms.\n  Discussion: Limitations include the non-iterative nature of the search query,\nheterogeneous data availability, and an under-representation of emergent,\nsub-symbolic CMAs.

    "abstract": "For robots to operate in general environments like households, they must be\nable to perform non-prehensile manipulation actions such as toppling and\nrolling to manipulate ungraspable objects. However, prior works on\nnon-prehensile manipulation cannot yet generalize across environments with\ndiverse geometries. The main challenge lies in adapting to varying\nenvironmental constraints: within a cabinet, the robot must avoid walls and\nceilings; to lift objects to the top of a step, the robot must account for the\nstep's pose and extent. While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated\nimpressive success in non-prehensile manipulation, accounting for such\nvariability presents a challenge for the generalist policy, as it must learn\ndiverse strategies for each new combination of constraints. To address this, we\npropose a modular and reconfigurable architecture that adaptively reconfigures\nnetwork modules based on task requirements. To capture the geometric\nvariability in environments, we extend the contact-based object representation\n(CORN) to environment geometries, and propose a procedural algorithm for\ngenerating diverse environments to train our agent. Taken together, the\nresulting policy can zero-shot transfer to novel real-world environments and\nobjects despite training entirely within a simulator. We additionally release a\nsimulation-based benchmark featuring nine digital twins of real-world scenes\nwith 353 objects to facilitate non-prehensile manipulation research in\nrealistic domains.",

The distance\nto distant M giants can be determined by using the color-magnitude relation\n(CMR), which is derived from color-magnitude diagrams of specific systems in\nprevious studies. In this work, we aimed to achieve more accurate distance\ndetermination for M giants by focusing on open clusters (OCs) with a large\nnumber of member stars and thus improve the CMR. For the first time, we\ncompiled a census of OCs harboring M giants using Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and\nLarge Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 9. We\nidentified 58 M giants associated with 43 OCs and obtained their astrometric\nand photometric parameters from Gaia DR3. Using the distances of these OCs, we\nderived the CMR for M giants as a linear correlation, expressed as\n$M_{Ks}=3.85-8.26(J-K_s$). This linear relation proved superior to the\nempirical distance relation in characterizing the CMR of M giants. The\nphotometric distances of M giants derived from the CMR are consistent with the\nparallax distances from Gaia and known spectroscopic distances, with median\ndeviations of 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Using the distances of M giants\nderived from the CMR, we computed their radial velocity ($V_R$), azimuthal\nvelocity ($V{\\phi}$), and vertical velocity ($V_Z$), respectively. The\ndistributions of these velocities revealed key features of the Galactic disk,\nincluding oscillation, north-south rotational asymmetry, and warp. These\nfindings are consistent with previous studies and further validate the\nreliability of the derived CMR.",

Yet, standard $(n,t)$-DKG requires a known set of $n$ participants\nand a fixed threshold $t$, making it impractical for public or decentralized\nsettings where membership and availability can change. We introduce Federated\nDistributed Key Generation (FDKG), which relaxes these constraints by allowing\neach participant to select its own guardian set, with a local threshold to\nreconstruct that participant's partial key. FDKG generalizes DKG and draws\ninspiration from Federated Byzantine Agreement, enabling dynamic trust\ndelegation with minimal message complexity (two rounds). The protocol's\nliveness can tolerate adversary that controls up to $k - t + 1$ nodes in every\nguardian set. The paper presents a detailed protocol, a formal description of\nliveness, privacy, and integrity properties, and a simulation-based evaluation\nshowcasing the efficacy of FDKG in mitigating node unreliability.

One of the\ncurrent de-facto solutions to this problem is compositional data augmentation,\nwhich aims to introduce additional compositional inductive bias. However,\nexisting handcrafted augmentation strategies offer limited improvement when\nsystematic generalization of neural language models requires multi-grained\ncompositional bias (i.e., not limited to either lexical or structural biases\nalone) or when training sentences have an imbalanced difficulty distribution.\nTo address these challenges, we first propose a novel compositional\naugmentation strategy called Component Substitution (CompSub), which enables\nmulti-grained composition of substantial substructures across the entire\ntraining set. Furthermore, we introduce the Learning Component Substitution\n(LCS) framework. This framework empowers the learning of component substitution\nprobabilities in CompSub in an end-to-end manner by maximizing the loss of\nneural language models, thereby prioritizing challenging compositions with\nelusive concepts and novel contexts. We extend the key ideas of CompSub and LCS\nto the recently emerging in-context learning scenarios of pre-trained large\nlanguage models (LLMs), proposing the LCS-ICL algorithm to enhance the few-shot\ncompositional generalization of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Theoretically, we\nprovide insights into why applying our algorithms to language models can\nimprove compositional generalization performance.

In\nthis case it turns out that there is a precise equivalence between the extreme\nand periodic $L_2$-discrepancy which follows from a much broader result about\ngeneralized energies for weighted point sets.\n  Motivated by this we study the asymptotics of the optimal $L_2$-discrepancy\nof weak Latin hypercubes. We determine asymptotically tight bounds for $d \\geq\n3$ and even the precise (dimension dependent) constant in front of the\ndominating term for $d \\geq 4$.",

In doing so, we use the\ninstantaneous Stokes parameters to incorporate the polarization state of the\nsignal. While the first formulation exploits the statistics of the Stokes\nrepresentation in a Bayesian setting, the second uses a kernel regression\nformulation to impose locally smooth time-varying polarization properties. In\nturn, we obtain two formulations that allow us to use both signal and\npolarization domain regularization for denoising a bivariate signal. The\nsolutions to them exploit the polarization information efficiently as\ndemonstrated in the numerical simulations",

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images by\nintegrating information from a composed query (reference image and modification\ntext) without training samples. Existing methods primarily combine caption\nmodels and large language models (LLMs) to generate target captions based on\ncomposed queries but face various issues such as incompatibility, visual\ninformation loss, and insufficient reasoning. In this work, we propose CoTMR, a\ntraining-free framework crafted for ZS-CIR with novel Chain-of-thought (CoT)\nand Multi-scale Reasoning. Instead of relying on caption models for modality\ntransformation, CoTMR employs the Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to achieve\nunified understanding and reasoning for composed queries. To enhance the\nreasoning reliability, we devise CIRCoT, which guides the LVLM through a\nstep-by-step inference process using predefined subtasks. Considering that\nexisting approaches focus solely on global-level reasoning, our CoTMR\nincorporates multi-scale reasoning to achieve more comprehensive inference via\nfine-grained predictions about the presence or absence of key elements at the\nobject scale. Further, we design a Multi-Grained Scoring (MGS) mechanism, which\nintegrates CLIP similarity scores of the above reasoning outputs with candidate\nimages to realize precise retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nCoTMR not only drastically outperforms previous methods across four prominent\nbenchmarks but also offers appealing interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Automating cloud configuration and deployment remains a critical challenge\ndue to evolving infrastructures, heterogeneous hardware, and fluctuating\nworkloads. Existing solutions lack adaptability and require extensive manual\ntuning, leading to inefficiencies and misconfigurations. We introduce LADs, the\nfirst LLM-driven framework designed to tackle these challenges by ensuring\nrobustness, adaptability, and efficiency in automated cloud management. Instead\nof merely applying existing techniques, LADs provides a principled approach to\nconfiguration optimization through in-depth analysis of what optimization works\nunder which conditions. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Few-Shot\nLearning, Chain-of-Thought, and Feedback-Based Prompt Chaining, LADs generates\naccurate configurations and learns from deployment failures to iteratively\nrefine system settings. Our findings reveal key insights into the trade-offs\nbetween performance, cost, and scalability, helping practitioners determine the\nright strategies for different deployment scenarios. For instance, we\ndemonstrate how prompt chaining-based adaptive feedback loops enhance fault\ntolerance in multi-tenant environments and how structured log analysis with\nexample shots improves configuration accuracy. Through extensive evaluations,\nLADs reduces manual effort, optimizes resource utilization, and improves system\nreliability. By open-sourcing LADs, we aim to drive further innovation in\nAI-powered DevOps automation.",

    "abstract": "Smartphone cameras have become ubiquitous imaging tools, yet their small\nsensors and compact optics often limit spatial resolution and introduce\ndistortions. Combining information from multiple low-resolution (LR) frames to\nproduce a high-resolution (HR) image has been explored to overcome the inherent\nlimitations of smartphone cameras. Despite the promise of multi-frame\nsuper-resolution (MFSR), current approaches are hindered by datasets that fail\nto capture the characteristic noise and motion patterns found in real-world\nhandheld burst images. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a novel\nsynthetic data engine that uses multi-exposure static images to synthesize\nLR-HR training pairs while preserving sensor-specific noise characteristics and\nimage motion found during handheld burst photography. We also propose MFSR-GAN:\na multi-scale RAW-to-RGB network for MFSR. Compared to prior approaches,\nMFSR-GAN emphasizes a \"base frame\" throughout its architecture to mitigate\nartifacts. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrates\nthat MFSR-GAN trained with our synthetic engine yields sharper, more realistic\nreconstructions than existing methods for real-world MFSR.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of foundation models in computational pathology has transformed\nhistopathological image analysis, with whole slide imaging (WSI) diagnosis\nbeing a core application. Traditionally, weakly supervised fine-tuning via\nmultiple instance learning (MIL) has been the primary method for adapting\nfoundation models to WSIs. However, in this work we present a key experimental\nfinding: a simple nonlinear mapping strategy combining mean pooling and a\nmultilayer perceptron, called SiMLP, can effectively adapt patch-level\nfoundation models to slide-level tasks without complex MIL-based learning.\nThrough extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate\nthe superior performance of SiMLP with state-of-the-art methods. For instance,\non a large-scale pan-cancer classification task, SiMLP surpasses popular\nMIL-based methods by 3.52%. Furthermore, SiMLP shows strong learning ability in\nfew-shot classification and remaining highly competitive with slide-level\nfoundation models pretrained on tens of thousands of slides. Finally, SiMLP\nexhibits remarkable robustness and transferability in lung cancer subtyping.\nOverall, our findings challenge the conventional MIL-based fine-tuning\nparadigm, demonstrating that a task-agnostic representation strategy alone can\neffectively adapt foundation models to WSI analysis. These insights offer a\nunique and meaningful perspective for future research in digital pathology,\npaving the way for more efficient and broadly applicable methodologies.",

The BF of the inclusive decay $\\Lambda_{c}^{+} \\to\n\\overline{K}^{0} / K^{0} X$ is calculated to be $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_{c}^{+}\n\\to \\overline{K}^{0} / K^{0} X)=(21.8 \\pm0.4 \\pm0.2 \\pm1.1)\\%$, where the third\nuncertainty accounts for a possible difference between\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_{c}^{+} \\to K_{S}^{0} X)$ and $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_{c}^{+}\n\\to K_{L}^{0} X)$.

    "abstract": "We present polarization pulse profiles for 56 millisecond pulsars (MSPs)\nmonitored by the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) collaboration using the\nFive-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The observations\ncentered at 1.25 GHz with a raw bandwidth of 500 MHz. Due to the high\nsensitivity ($\\sim$16 K/Jy) of the FAST telescope and our long integration\ntime, the high signal-to-noise ratio polarization profiles show features hardly\ndetected before. Among 56 pulsars, the polarization profiles of PSRs\nJ0406$+$3039, J1327$+$3423, and J2022$+$2534 were not previously reported. 80\\%\nof MSPs in the sample show weak components below 3\\% of peak flux, 25\\% of\npulsars show interpulse-like structures, and most pulsars show linear\npolarization position angle jumps. Six pulsars seem to be emitting for full\nrotation phase, with another thirteen pulsars being good candidates for such a\n360$^\\circ$ radiator. We find that the distribution of the polarization\npercentage in our sample is compatible with the normal pulsar distribution. Our\ndetailed evaluation of the MSP polarization properties suggests that the wave\npropagation effects in the pulsar magnetosphere are important in shaping the\nMSP polarization pulse profiles.",

    "abstract": "Gradient-based methods are well-suited for derivative-free optimization\n(DFO), where finite-difference (FD) estimates are commonly used as gradient\nsurrogates. Traditional stochastic approximation methods, such as\nKiefer-Wolfowitz (KW) and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation\n(SPSA), typically utilize only two samples per iteration, resulting in\nimprecise gradient estimates and necessitating diminishing step sizes for\nconvergence. In this paper, we first explore an efficient FD estimate, referred\nto as correlation-induced FD estimate, which is a batch-based estimate. Then,\nwe propose an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically determines the batch\nsize at each iteration. By combining these two components, we develop an\nalgorithm designed to enhance DFO in terms of both gradient estimation\nefficiency and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we establish the consistency of\nour proposed algorithm and demonstrate that, despite using a batch of samples\nper iteration, it achieves the same convergence rate as the KW and SPSA\nmethods. Additionally, we propose a novel stochastic line search technique to\nadaptively tune the step size in practice. Finally, comprehensive numerical\nexperiments confirm the superior empirical performance of the proposed\nalgorithm.",

    "abstract": "Modern applications span multiple clouds to reduce costs, avoid vendor\nlock-in, and leverage low-availability resources in another cloud. However,\nstandard object stores operate within a single cloud, forcing users to manually\nmanage data placement across clouds, i.e., navigate their diverse APIs and\nhandle heterogeneous costs for network and storage. This is often a complex\nchoice: users must either pay to store objects in a remote cloud, or pay to\ntransfer them over the network based on application access patterns and cloud\nprovider cost offerings. To address this, we present SkyStore, a unified object\nstore that addresses cost-optimal data management across regions and clouds.\nSkyStore introduces a virtual object and bucket API to hide the complexity of\ninteracting with multiple clouds. At its core, SkyStore has a novel TTL-based\ndata placement policy that dynamically replicates and evicts objects according\nto application access patterns while optimizing for lower cost. Our evaluation\nshows that across various workloads, SkyStore reduces the overall cost by up to\n6x over academic baselines and commercial alternatives like AWS multi-region\nbuckets. SkyStore also has comparable latency, and its availability and fault\ntolerance are on par with standard cloud offerings. We release the data and\ncode of SkyStore at https://github.com/skyplane-project/skystore.",

    "abstract": "Underwater vehicles have emerged as a critical technology for exploring and\nmonitoring aquatic environments. The deployment of multi-vehicle systems has\ngained substantial interest due to their capability to perform collaborative\ntasks with improved efficiency. However, achieving precise localization of a\nleader underwater vehicle within a multi-vehicle configuration remains a\nsignificant challenge, particularly in dynamic and complex underwater\nconditions. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel tri-modal sensor\nfusion neural network approach that integrates optical, acoustic, and pressure\nsensors to localize the leader vehicle. The proposed method leverages the\nunique strengths of each sensor modality to improve localization accuracy and\nrobustness. Specifically, optical sensors provide high-resolution imaging for\nprecise relative positioning, acoustic sensors enable long-range detection and\nranging, and pressure sensors offer environmental context awareness. The fusion\nof these sensor modalities is implemented using a deep learning architecture\ndesigned to extract and combine complementary features from raw sensor data.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a custom-designed\ntesting platform. Extensive data collection and experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that the tri-modal approach significantly improves the accuracy and\nrobustness of leader localization, outperforming both single-modal and\ndual-modal methods.",

Previous methods typically rely\non feature matching (FM) with stored descriptors or use a single network to\nencode both points and lines. While FM-based methods perform well in\nlarge-scale environments, they become computationally expensive with a growing\nnumber of mapping points and lines. Conversely, approaches that learn to encode\nmapping features within a single network reduce memory footprint but are prone\nto overfitting, as they may capture unnecessary correlations between points and\nlines. We propose that these features should be learned independently, each\nwith a distinct focus, to achieve optimal accuracy.

    "abstract": "The classical Jacobi polynomials on the interval $[-1,1]$ are eigenfunctions\nof a second order differential operator. It is well known that this operator\ngenerates a diffusion process on $[-1,1]$. Further, this fact admits an\nextension to $N$ dimensions (Demni (2010), Remling-R\\\"osler (2011)) leading to\na $3$-parameter family of diffusion processes $X_N$ on the space of\n$N$-particle configurations in $[-1,1]$. The generators of the processes $X_N$\nare related to Heckman-Opdam's Jacobi polynomials attached to the root system\n$BC_N$.\n  The first result of the paper shows that the processes $X_N$ have a\n$q$-analog, the $N$-dimensional $q$-Jacobi processes. These are Feller Markov\nprocesses related to the $N$-variate symmetric big $q$-Jacobi polynomials. The\nlater polynomials were introduced and studied by Stokman (1997) and\nStokman-Koornwinder (1997); they depend on two Macdonald parameters $(q,t)$ and\n$4$ extra continuous parameters.\n  The $N$-dimensional $q$-Jacobi processes are still defined on a space of\n$N$-particle configurations, only now the particles live not on $[-1,1]$ but on\ncertain one-dimensional $q$-grids.\n  The second result (the main one) asserts that the $N$-dimensional $q$-Jacobi\nprocesses survive a limit transition as $N$ goes to infinity and two of the\nextra parameters vary together with $N$ in a certain way. In the limit, one\nobtains a family of Feller Markov processes which are infinite-dimensional in\nthe sense that they live on configurations with infinitely many particles. The\nproof uses a lifting of the multivariate big $q$-Jacobi polynomials to the\nalgebra of symmetric functions -- a construction that does not hold for the\nHeckman-Opdam's Jacobi polynomials.\n  Note also that the large-$N$ limit transition is carried out without any\nspace scaling, which would be impossible in the continuous case.",

    "abstract": "Solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental\nchallenge in physics and chemistry. Recent advancements in quantum hardware\nhave opened new avenues for addressing this challenge. Inspired by the\nquantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) algorithm [Nature, 619,\n282-287 (2023)], which was originally designed for sampling the Boltzmann\ndistribution of classical spin models using quantum computers, we introduce a\nquantum-assisted variational Monte Carlo (QA-VMC) algorithm for solving the\nground state of quantum many-body systems by adapting QeMCMC to sample the\ndistribution of a (neural-network) wave function in VMC. The central question\nis whether such quantum-assisted proposal can potentially offer a computational\nadvantage over classical methods. Through numerical investigations for the\nFermi-Hubbard model and molecular systems, we demonstrate that the\nquantum-assisted proposal exhibits larger absolute spectral gaps and reduced\nautocorrelation times compared to conventional classical proposals, leading to\nmore efficient sampling and faster convergence to the ground state in VMC as\nwell as more accurate and precise estimation of physical observables. This\nadvantage is especially pronounced for specific parameter ranges, where the\nground-state configurations are more concentrated in some configurations\nseparated by large Hamming distances. Our results underscore the potential of\nquantum-assisted algorithms to enhance classical variational methods for\nsolving the ground state of quantum many-body systems.",

By systematically exploring the parameter space of specific\nenergy and angular momentum that permits shock formation in advective accretion\nflows, we demonstrate that quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) naturally emerge\nin perturbed systems. Our spectral analysis reveals characteristic QPO\nfrequencies spanning 0.44-146.57 Hz, effectively bridging the observed\nlow-frequency (LFQPOs) and high-frequency QPOs (HFQPOs) in black hole X-ray\nbinaries. The quality factors of these oscillations range from 1.66 to 203.58,\nwith multiple Lorentzian components indicating distinct oscillation modes.\nThrough wavelet analysis and cross-validation with recent observations (e.g.,\nSwift J1727.8-1613 and GX 339-4), we establish that shock instabilities driven\nby acoustic wave interactions between the non-axisymmetric perturbation and the\nshock location can quantitatively explain the temporal features observed in\naccreting black hole systems.

Here, we present a\ncombined infrared spectroscopy and first-principles band structure calculation\nstudy of the $3d$-electron HF compound YFe$_2$Ge$_2$. The infrared response\nexhibits several charge-dynamical hallmarks of HF and a corresponding scaling\nbehavior that resemble those of the $f$-electron HF systems. In particular, the\nlow-temperature spectra reveal a dramatic narrowing of the Drude response along\nwith the appearance of a hybridization gap ($\\Delta \\sim$ 50 meV) and a\nstrongly enhanced quasiparticle effective mass. Moreover, the temperature\ndependence of the infrared response indicates a crossover around $T^{\\ast}\n\\sim$ 100 K from a coherent state at low temperature to a quasi-incoherent one\nat high temperature. Despite of these striking similarities, our band structure\ncalculations suggest that the mechanism underlying the HF behavior in\nYFe$_2$Ge$_2$ is distinct from the Kondo scenario of the $f$-electron HF\ncompounds and even from that of the $d$-electron iron-arsenide superconductor\nKFe$_2$As$_2$. For the latter, the HF state is driven by orbital-selective\ncorrelations due to a strong Hund's coupling. Instead, for YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ the HF\nbehavior originates from the band flatness near the Fermi level induced by the\ncombined effects of kinetic frustration from a destructive interference between\nthe direct Fe-Fe and indirect Fe-Ge-Fe hoppings, band hybridization involving\nFe $3d$ and Y $4d$ electrons, and electron correlations. This highlights that\nrather different mechanisms can be at the heart of the HF state in $d$-electron\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "The stock assessment model SAM contains a large number of age-dependent\nparameters that must be manually grouped together to obtain robust inference.\nThis can make the model selection process slow, non-extensive and highly\nsubjective, while producing unrealistic looking parameter estimates with\ndiscrete jumps. We propose to model age-dependent SAM parameters using\nsmoothing spline functions. This can lead to more smooth parameter estimates,\nwhile speeding up and making the model selection process more automatic and\nless subjective. We develop different spline models and compare them with\nalready existing SAM models for a selection of 17 different fish stocks, using\ncross- and forward-validation methods. The results show that our automated\nspline models overall outcompete the officially developed SAM models. We also\ndemonstrate how the developed spline models can be employed as a diagnostics\ntool for improving and better understanding properties of the officially\ndeveloped SAM models.",

In fact, the PoC convergence\nrate is well understood for MV-SDEs with coefficients linearly dependent on the\nmeasure, but the rate deteriorates with dimension $d$ under the\n$L^p$-Wasserstein metric for nonlinear measure-dependent coefficients, even\nwhen Lipschitz continuity with respect to the measure is assumed.

For every source symbol, the length of its mapping\nsub-interval is exactly equal to its probability. With this symbol-interval\nmapping rule, the interval [0,1) will be fully covered and there is neither\noverlapped sub-interval (corresponds to more than one source symbol) nor\nforbidden sub-interval (does not correspond to any source symbol).\n  It is well-known that there is a duality between source coding and channel\ncoding, so every good source code may also be a good channel code meanwhile,\nand vice versa. Inspired by this duality, arithmetic codes can be easily\ngeneralized to address many coding problems beyond source coding by redefining\nthe source-interval mapping rule. If every source symbol is mapped to an\nenlarged sub-interval, the mapping sub-intervals of different source symbols\nwill be partially overlapped and we obtain overlapped arithmetic codes, which\ncan realize distributed source coding. On the contrary, if every source symbol\nis mapped to a narrowed sub-interval, there will be one or more forbidden\nsub-intervals in [0, 1) that do not correspond to any source symbol and we\nobtain forbidden arithmetic codes, which can implement joint source-channel\ncoding.

    "abstract": "Indirect reciprocity explains the evolution of cooperation by considering how\nour cooperative behavior toward someone is reciprocated by someone else who has\nobserved us. A cohesive society has a shared norm that prescribes how to assess\nobserved behavior as well as how to behave toward others based on the\nassessments, and the eight social norms that are evolutionarily stable against\nthe invasion of mutants with different behavioral rules are referred to as the\nleading eight, whose member norms are called L1 to L8, respectively. Among the\nleading eight, L8 (also known as `Judging') has been deemed mostly irrelevant\ndue to its poor performance in maintaining cooperation when each person may\nhave a different opinion about someone instead of forming a public consensus.\nIn this work, we propose that L8 can nevertheless be best protected from\nassessment errors among the leading eight if we take into account the intrinsic\nheterogeneity of error proneness among individuals because this norm heavily\npunishes those who are prone to errors in following its assessment rule. This\nfinding suggests that individual differences should be explicitly taken into\naccount as quenched randomness to obtain a thorough understanding of a social\nnorm working in a heterogeneous environment.",

Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face\nlimitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns\nwhile simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information\nBottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework\nthat applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity\nmodeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two\ncomplementary components.

The second is the Information\nBottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs\nmeta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency\nconstraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic\ndata.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer the knowledge of a more capable\nyet cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model. In recent years,\nrelation-based KD methods have fallen behind, as their instance-matching\ncounterparts dominate in performance. In this paper, we revive relational KD by\nidentifying and tackling several key issues in relation-based methods,\nincluding their susceptibility to overfitting and spurious responses.\nSpecifically, we transfer novelly constructed affinity graphs that compactly\nencapsulate a wealth of beneficial inter-sample, inter-class, and inter-view\ncorrelations by exploiting virtual views and relations as a new kind of\nknowledge. As a result, the student has access to richer guidance signals and\nstronger regularisation throughout the distillation process. To further\nmitigate the adverse impact of spurious responses, we prune the affinity graphs\nby dynamically detaching redundant and unreliable edges. Extensive experiments\non CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed virtual relation matching (VRM) method, where it\nconsistently sets new state-of-the-art records over a range of models,\narchitectures, tasks, and set-ups. For instance, VRM for the first time hits\n74.0% accuracy for ResNet50-to-MobileNetV2 distillation on ImageNet, and\nimproves DeiT-T by 14.44% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet56 teacher.",

    "abstract": "When two non-relativistic particles interact resonantly in three dimensions,\nan infinite tower of three-body bound states emerges, exhibiting a discrete\nscale invariance. This universal phenomenon, known as the Efimov effect, has\ngarnered extensive attention across various fields, including atomic, nuclear,\ncondensed matter, and particle physics. In this letter, we demonstrate that the\nEfimov effect also manifests in long-range quantum spin chains. The long-range\ncoupling modifies the low-energy dispersion of magnons, enabling the emergence\nof continuous scale invariance for two-magnon states at resonance. This\ninvariance is subsequently broken to discrete scale invariance upon imposing\nshort-range boundary conditions for the three-magnon problem, leading to the\ncelebrated Efimov bound states. Using effective field theory, we theoretically\ndetermine how the ratio of two successive binding energies depends on the\ninteraction range, which agrees with the numerical solution of the bound-state\nproblem. We further discuss generalizations to arbitrary spatial dimensions,\nwhere the traditional Efimov effect serves as a special case. Our results\nreveal universal physics in dilute quantum gases of magnons that can be\nexperimentally tested in trapped-ion systems.",

While a substantial\namount of work has been done on this topic, only recently, minimax optimal\ntwo-sample tests have been constructed that incorporate, unlike MMD, both the\nmean element and a regularized version of the covariance operator. However, as\nwith most kernel algorithms, the computational complexity of the optimal test\nscales cubically in the sample size, limiting its applicability. In this paper,\nwe propose a spectral regularized two-sample test based on random Fourier\nfeature (RFF) approximation and investigate the trade-offs between statistical\noptimality and computational efficiency. We show the proposed test to be\nminimax optimal if the approximation order of RFF (which depends on the\nsmoothness of the likelihood ratio and the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the\nintegral operator) is sufficiently large. We develop a practically\nimplementable permutation-based version of the proposed test with a\ndata-adaptive strategy for selecting the regularization parameter and the\nkernel. Finally, through numerical experiments on simulated and benchmark\ndatasets, we demonstrate that the proposed RFF-based test is computationally\nefficient and performs almost similar (with a small drop in power) to the exact\ntest.",

To\ninvestigate fundamental principles of neural computation, we studied\ndissociated neuronal cultures, one of the most primitive living neural\nnetworks, on high-resolution CMOS microelectrode arrays and tested whether the\ndissociated culture exhibits regularity sensitivity beyond mere\nstimulus-specific adaptation and deviance detection. In oddball electrical\nstimulation paradigms, we confirmed that the neuronal culture produced mismatch\nresponses (MMRs) with true deviance detection beyond mere adaptation. These\nMMRs were dependent on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, similar to\nmismatch negativity (MMN) in humans, which is known to have true deviance\ndetection properties. Crucially, we also showed sensitivity to the statistical\nregularity of stimuli, a phenomenon previously observed only in intact brains:\nthe MMRs in a predictable, periodic sequence were smaller than those in a\ncommonly used sequence in which the appearance of the deviant stimulus was\nrandom and unpredictable. These results challenge the traditional view that a\nhierarchically structured neural network is required to process complex\ntemporal patterns, suggesting instead that deviant detection and regularity\nsensitivity are inherent properties arising from the primitive neural network.\nThey also suggest new directions for the development of neuro-inspired\nartificial intelligence systems, emphasizing the importance of incorporating\nadaptive mechanisms and temporal dynamics in the design of neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to high ambient temperatures is a significant driver of preventable\nmortality, with non-linear health effects and elevated risks in specific\nregions. To capture this complexity and account for spatial dependencies across\nsmall areas, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates non-linear\nfunctions with the Besag, York, and Mollie (BYM2) model. Applying this\nframework to all-cause mortality data in Switzerland, we quantified spatial\ninequalities in heat-related mortality. We retrieved daily all-cause mortality\nat small areas (2,145 municipalities) for people older than 65 years from the\nSwiss Federal Office of Public Health and daily mean temperature at\n1km$\\times$1km grid from the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology. By fully\npropagating uncertainties, we derived key epidemiological metrics, including\nheat-related excess mortality and minimum mortality temperature (MMT).\nHeat-related excess mortality rates were higher in northern Switzerland, while\nlower MMTs were observed in mountainous regions. Further, we explored the role\nof the proportion of individuals older than 85 years, green space, average\ntemperature, deprivation, urbanicity, and language regions in explaining these\ndiscrepancies. We found that spatial disparities in heat-related excess\nmortality were primarily driven by population age distribution, green space,\nand vulnerabilities associated with elevated temperature exposure.",

To address this, we propose Structured Preference\nOptimization (SPO), which aims to enhance reasoning and action selection in\nlong-horizon task planning through structured preference evaluation and\noptimized training strategies. Specifically, SPO introduces: 1)\nPreference-Based Scoring and Optimization, which systematically evaluates\nreasoning chains based on task relevance, visual grounding, and historical\nconsistency; and 2) Curriculum-Guided Training, where the model progressively\nadapts from simple to complex tasks, improving its generalization ability in\nlong-horizon scenarios and enhancing reasoning robustness. To advance research\nin vision-language long-horizon task planning, we introduce ExtendaBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark covering 1,509 tasks across VirtualHome and Habitat\n2.0, categorized into ultra-short, short, medium, and long tasks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that SPO significantly improves reasoning quality and final\ndecision accuracy, outperforming prior methods on long-horizon tasks and\nunderscoring the effectiveness of preference-driven optimization in\nvision-language task planning.

Here,\nwe report the discovery of spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance which\nintertwines with the superconducting gap, facilitated by the introduction of\nmagnetic Cr impurities into the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. In addition to\nthe gradual suppression of long-ranged charge-density-wave orders, dilute Cr\ndopants induce local magnetic moments, giving rise to the emergence of Kondo\nresonances. In addition, the Kondo resonance forms spatially anisotropic\nripple-like structures around the Cr dopants, breaking all local mirror\nsymmetries. This anisotropy arises from the antiferromagnetic coupling between\nitinerant electrons and the Cr-induced spin-up electrons. Remarkably, as the\nKondo screening develops, the coherence peak and depth of superconducting gap\nwith finite zero-energy conductance significantly enhances. It indicates that\nnon-superconducting pairs at the Fermi surface in the parent compound\nparticipate in the Kondo effect, effectively screening the magnetic moments of\nCr dopants while simultaneously enhancing the superfluid density.

This ZBCP coexists with trivial YSR states within the\nsuperconducting gap and does not split in energy with increasing tunneling\ntransmission, tending instead to saturate. This behavior is reminiscent of\nsignature of Majorana zero modes, which could be trapped by a sign-change\nboundary in the superconducting order parameter near a V vacancy, consistent\nwith a surface topological superconducting state.

To further advance the design of complex engineering solutions, we\npropose a novel system, SolutionRAG, that leverages the tree-based exploration\nand bi-point thinking mechanism to generate reliable solutions. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that SolutionRAG achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance on the SolutionBench, highlighting its potential to enhance\nthe automation and reliability of complex engineering solution design in\nreal-world applications.",

However, many benchmarks for neuromorphic\nalgorithms primarily focus on spatial features, neglecting the temporal\ndynamics that are inherent to most sequence-based tasks. This gap may lead to\nevaluations that fail to fully capture the unique strengths and characteristics\nof neuromorphic systems. In this paper, we present NeuroMorse, a temporally\nstructured dataset designed for benchmarking neuromorphic learning systems.\nNeuroMorse converts the top 50 words in the English language into temporal\nMorse code spike sequences. Despite using only two input spike channels for\nMorse dots and dashes, complex information is encoded through temporal patterns\nin the data. The proposed benchmark contains feature hierarchy at multiple\ntemporal scales that test the capacity of neuromorphic algorithms to decompose\ninput patterns into spatial and temporal hierarchies. We demonstrate that our\ntraining set is challenging to categorise using a linear classifier and that\nidentifying keywords in the test set is difficult using conventional methods.\nThe NeuroMorse dataset is available at Zenodo, with our accompanying code on\nGitHub at https://github.com/Ben-E-Walters/NeuroMorse.",

    "abstract": "Generating realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) holds\ntremendous promise for accelerating healthcare research, facilitating AI model\ndevelopment and enhancing patient privacy. However, existing generative methods\ntypically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach\noverlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of\nclinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code\ndescriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high\nclinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT),\na novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for\nthe generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode\nparent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph\nneural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with\nsemantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g.,\nClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately\nmodel the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive\nexperiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT\nsignificantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real\npatient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as\nchronic disease classification. By addressing the limitations of conventional\nraw code-based generative models, HiSGT represents a significant step toward\nclinically high-fidelity synthetic data generation and a general paradigm\nsuitable for interpretable medical code representation, offering valuable\napplications in data augmentation and privacy-preserving healthcare analytics.",

    "abstract": "Glioma, a prevalent and heterogeneous tumor originating from the glial cells,\ncan be differentiated as Low Grade Glioma (LGG) and High Grade Glioma (HGG)\naccording to World Health Organization's norms. Classifying gliomas is\nessential for treatment protocols that depend extensively on subtype\ndifferentiation. For non-invasive glioma evaluation, Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI) offers vital information about the morphology and location of the the\ntumor. The versatility of MRI allows the classification of gliomas as LGG and\nHGG based on their texture, perfusion, and diffusion characteristics, and\nfurther for improving the diagnosis and providing tailored treatments.\nNevertheless, the precise classification is complicated by tumor heterogeneity\nand overlapping radiomic characteristics. Thus, in this work, wavelet based\nnovel fusion algorithm were implemented on multi-sequence T1, T1-contrast\nenhanced (T1CE), T2 and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI images\nto compute the radiomics features. Furthermore, principal component analysis is\napplied to reduce the feature space and XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and\nRandom Forest Classifier are used for the classification. The result shows that\nthe SVM algorithm performs comparatively well with an accuracy of 90.17%,\nprecision of 91.04% and recall of 96.19%, F1-score of 93.53%, and AUC of 94.60%\nwhen implemented on BraTS 2018 dataset and with an accuracy of 91.34%,\nprecision of 93.05% and recall of 96.13%, F1-score of 94.53%, and AUC of 93.71%\nfor BraTS 2018 dataset. Thus, the proposed algorithm could be potentially\nimplemented for the computer-aided diagnosis and grading system for gliomas.",

However, current\nfederated unlearning methods face several challenges, including indiscriminate\nunlearning of cross-client knowledge, irreversibility of unlearning, and\nsignificant unlearning costs. To this end, we propose a method named FUSED,\nwhich first identifies critical layers by analyzing each layer's sensitivity to\nknowledge and constructs sparse unlearning adapters for sensitive ones. Then,\nthe adapters are trained without altering the original parameters, overwriting\nthe unlearning knowledge with the remaining knowledge. This knowledge\noverwriting process enables FUSED to mitigate the effects of indiscriminate\nunlearning. Moreover, the introduction of independent adapters makes unlearning\nreversible and significantly reduces the unlearning costs.

In the present study, we investigate\nfirst passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of\nstochastic DCs that are positive and non-zero. We show that for diffusion in\none-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, the eventual\nabsorption is certain. We also show that compared to diffusion whose DC is the\nensemble average of a stochastic DC, in diffusion with the stochastic DC, there\nare particles that reach the absorbing boundary earlier. The approximate\nproportion of preceding particles is determined by the probability distribution\nof the time average of a stochastic DC for a given distance to the absorbing\nboundary. In addition, when particles begin to reach the absorbing boundary\nbefore the time change in a stochastic DC occurs, a stochastic DC with a larger\nsupremum leads to an earlier arrival of particles at the absorbing boundary\neven if the ensemble averages of stochastic DCs are the same. For ergodic DCs,\nthree more properties are revealed. The mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if\nparticles take a long time to reach the absorbing boundary, the exact\nproportion of preceding particles is almost zero and the FPT distribution can\nbe approximated by the L\\'evy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three\nproperties of diffusion with an ergodic DC result from the convergence of the\ntime average of the DC to the ensemble average.

Our model reveals that\nexplanation can fail even under theoretically ideal conditions - when actors\nare rational, honest, motivated, can communicate perfectly, and possess\noverlapping knowledge. This is because successful explanation requires not just\nthe existence of shared knowledge but also finding the connection path within\ntime constraints, and it can therefore be rational to cease attempts at\nexplanation before the shared knowledge is discovered. This result has\nimportant implications for human-AI interaction: as AI systems, particularly\nLarge Language Models, become more sophisticated and able to generate\nsuperficially compelling but spurious explanations, humans may default to trust\nrather than demand genuine explanations. This creates risks of both misplaced\ntrust and imperfect knowledge integration.",

We first give a rigorous\ndifferential privacy analysis of the algorithm, and establish the quantitative\nrelationship between the added noises and the privacy-preserving level when the\nsystem is asymptotically stable. The asymptotic stability of the system is\nnecessary for ensuring the differential privacy of the algorithm. We then give\nan estimation error analysis of the algorithm under the general and possible\nweakest excitation condition without requiring the boundedness, independence\nand stationarity on the regression vectors. Particularly, when there is no\nregression term in the system output and the differential privacy only on the\nsystem output is considered, $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy and almost sure\nconvergence of the algorithm can be established simultaneously. To minimize the\nestimation error of the algorithm with $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy, the\nexistence of the noise intensity is proved. Finally, two examples are given to\nshow the efficiency of the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In differential geometry, the existence of pullbacks is a delicate matter,\nsince the category of smooth manifolds does not admit all of them. When\npullbacks are required, often submersions are employed as an ideal class of\nmaps which behaves well under this operation and the tangent bundle functor.\nThis issue is reflected in tangent category theory, which aims to axiomatize\nthe tangent bundle functor of differential geometry categorically. Key\nconstructions such as connections, tangent fibrations, or reverse tangent\ncategories require one to work with pullbacks preserved by the tangent bundle\nfunctor. In previous work, this issue has been left as a technicality and\nsolved by introducing extra structure to carry around. This paper gives an\nalternative to this by focusing on a special class of maps in a tangent\ncategory called tangent display maps; such maps are well-behaved with respect\nto pullbacks and applications of the tangent functor. We develop some of the\ngeneral theory of such maps, show how using them can simplify previous work in\ntangent categories, and show that in the tangent category of smooth manifolds,\nthey are the same as the submersions. Finally, we consider a subclass of\ntangent display maps to define open subobjects in any tangent category,\nallowing one to build a canonical split restriction tangent category in which\nthe original one naturally embeds.",

In\nthis study, we extend the previously proposed Quantum-EEGNet (QEEGNet), a\nhybrid neural network incorporating quantum layers into EEGNet, to investigate\nits generalization ability across multiple EEG datasets. Our evaluation spans a\ndiverse set of cognitive and motor task datasets, assessing QEEGNet's\nperformance in different learning scenarios. Experimental results reveal that\nwhile QEEGNet demonstrates competitive performance and maintains robustness in\ncertain datasets, its improvements over traditional deep learning methods\nremain inconsistent. These findings suggest that hybrid quantum-classical\narchitectures require further optimization to fully leverage quantum advantages\nin EEG processing. Despite these limitations, our study provides new insights\ninto the applicability of QML in EEG research and highlights challenges that\nmust be addressed for future advancements.",

This is an aspect\nthat foundational LLMs have yet to fully address such that a single call of\nfoundational models might be insufficient.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage solution. In this work, we focus\non the first stage, introducing a multi-module framework designed to replicate\nthe key aspects of human intelligence involved in conversations. This framework\ncomprises thinking modules for reasoning, resource modules for managing\nknowledge and external information, and response modules for generating\ncontextually appropriate interactions.

First, the reliance on BN layers for\nadaptation necessitates large batch sizes, leading to high memory usage.\nSecond, updating all BN layers requires storing the activations of all BN\nlayers for backpropagation, exacerbating the memory demand. Both factors lead\nto substantial memory costs, making existing solutions impractical for IoT\ndevices. In this paper, we present FoCTTA, a low-memory CTTA strategy.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) models extract global\ndescriptors using the powerful foundation model DINOv2 as backbone. These\nmodels either explore the cross-image correlation or propose a time-consuming\ntwo-stage re-ranking strategy to achieve better performance. However, existing\nworks only utilize the final output of DINOv2, and the current cross-image\ncorrelation causes unstable retrieval results. To produce both discriminative\nand constant global descriptors, this paper proposes stable cross-image\ncorrelation enhanced model for VPR called SciceVPR. This model explores the\nfull potential of DINOv2 in providing useful feature representations that\nimplicitly encode valuable contextual knowledge. Specifically, SciceVPR first\nuses a multi-layer feature fusion module to capture increasingly detailed\ntask-relevant channel and spatial information from the multi-layer output of\nDINOv2. Secondly, SciceVPR considers the invariant correlation between images\nwithin a batch as valuable knowledge to be distilled into the proposed\nself-enhanced encoder. In this way, SciceVPR can acquire fairly robust global\nfeatures regardless of domain shifts (e.g., changes in illumination, weather\nand viewpoint between pictures taken in the same place). Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the base variant, SciceVPR-B, outperforms SOTA one-stage\nmethods with single input on multiple datasets with varying domain conditions.\nThe large variant, SciceVPR-L, performs on par with SOTA two-stage models,\nscoring over 3% higher in Recall@1 compared to existing models on the\nchallenging Tokyo24/7 dataset.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided vehicle-to-everything (V2X)\ncommunication has emerged as a crucial solution for providing reliable data\nservices to vehicles on the road. However, in delay-sensitive or high-mobility\ncommunications, the rapid movement of vehicles can lead to random scattering in\nthe environment and time-selective fading in the channel. In view of this, we\ninvestigate in this paper an innovative linear model with low-complexity\ntransmitter signal design and receiver detection methods, which boost stability\nin fast-fading environments and reduce channel training overhead. Specifically,\nconsidering the differences in hardware design and signal processing at the\nreceiving end between uplink and downlink communication systems, distinct\nsolutions are proposed. Accordingly, we first integrate the Rician channel\nintroduced by the RIS with the corresponding signal processing algorithms to\nmodel the RIS-aided downlink communication system as a Doppler-robust linear\nmodel. Inspired by this property, we design a precoding scheme based on the\nlinear model to reduce the complexity of precoding. Then, by leveraging the\nlinear model and the large-scale antenna array at the base station (BS) side,\nwe improve the linear model for the uplink communication system and derive its\nasymptotic performance in closed-form. Simulation results demonstrate the\nperformance advantages of the proposed RIS-aided high-mobility communication\nsystem compared to other benchmark schemes.",

    "abstract": "Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a widely used quantum error mitigation\ntechnique that artificially amplifies circuit noise and then extrapolates the\nresults to the noise-free circuit. A common ZNE approach is Richardson\nextrapolation, which relies on polynomial interpolation. Despite its\nsimplicity, efficient implementations of Richardson extrapolation face several\nchallenges, including approximation errors from the non-polynomial behavior of\nnoise channels, overfitting due to polynomial interpolation, and exponentially\namplified measurement noise. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of\nthese challenges, presenting bias and variance bounds that quantify\napproximation errors. Additionally, for any precision $\\varepsilon$, our\nresults offer an estimate of the necessary sample complexity. We further extend\nthe analysis to polynomial least squares-based extrapolation, which mitigates\nmeasurement noise and avoids overfitting. Finally, we propose a strategy for\nsimultaneously mitigating circuit and algorithmic errors in the Trotter-Suzuki\nalgorithm by jointly scaling the time step size and the noise level.

As a result, the need for labeled\nsurgical datasets continues to grow. In this work, we introduce a\ndifferentiable rendering framework for material and lighting estimation from\nendoscopic images and known geometry.

To\ndisambiguate the training process, we formulate domain-specific properties\ninherent in surgical scenes. Specifically, we model the scene lighting as a\nsimple spotlight and material properties as a bidirectional reflectance\ndistribution function, parameterized by a neural network. By grounding color\npredictions in the rendering equation, we can generate photorealistic images at\narbitrary camera poses. We evaluate our method with various sequences from the\nColonoscopy 3D Video Dataset and show that our method produces competitive\nnovel view synthesis results compared with other approaches.

This study intends to partially close this\ngap by introducing a novel approach based on fine-tuned generative models to\ngenerate dynamic, scalable, and precise images from textual descriptions.\nParticularly, our system integrates fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth\nmodels, as well as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), to generate high-fidelity\nmedical images.

Brenner, J. Colloid Interface Sci., 71(2):\n189-208, 1979). In this work, we extend the theory to a non-centrosymmetric,\naxisymmetric particle whose centers of mass and buoyancy are offset from its\nhydrodynamic center, so that the gravitational torque acts in addition to the\nnet gravitational force. We study the Taylor dispersion of such particles as a\nfunction of non-dimensional parameter $\\alpha$ representing the strength of the\ngravitational torque: $\\alpha$ is zero when the centers of mass and buoyancy\nare at the hydrodynamic center and increases when they are offset from it.\nAnalytical calculations show that for small $\\alpha$, the Taylor dispersion is\nalways amplified: the effective diffusivities created by sedimentation always\nincrease as $\\alpha^2$, but they start to decrease at certain values of\n$\\alpha$ and approach to zero for large values of $\\alpha$. We further analyze\nthe transient regime of the mean-square displacement (MSD). At short times, the\nMSD grows quadratically with time before crossing over to the diffusive regime.\nThe ballistic regime persists to relatively high sedimentation P\\'eclet numbers\n(the ratio of the rotational relaxation time to the sedimentation time), even\nin the presence of a gravitational torque, indicating that such a torque does\nnot considerably alter sustained ballistic motion.",

The results show that the CMR method has achieving\nhigher accuracy than other widely used methods. This method is not only very\neffective for narrow resonances, but also can be reliably applied to broad\nresonances.",

    "abstract": "This tutorial focuses on the fundamental architectures of Variational\nAutoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), disregarding\ntheir numerous variations, to highlight their core principles. Both VAE and GAN\nutilize simple distributions, such as Gaussians, as a basis and leverage the\npowerful nonlinear transformation capabilities of neural networks to\napproximate arbitrarily complex distributions. The theoretical basis lies in\nthat a linear combination of multiple Gaussians can almost approximate any\nprobability distribution, while neural networks enable further refinement\nthrough nonlinear transformations. Both methods approximate complex data\ndistributions implicitly. This implicit approximation is crucial because\ndirectly modeling high-dimensional distributions explicitly is often\nintractable. However, the choice of a simple latent prior, while\ncomputationally convenient, introduces limitations. In VAEs, the fixed Gaussian\nprior forces the posterior distribution to align with it, potentially leading\nto loss of information and reduced expressiveness. This restriction affects\nboth the interpretability of the model and the quality of generated samples.",

Among various methods, distribution\nmatching-based approaches stand out for their balance of computational\nefficiency and strong performance. However, existing distance metrics used in\ndistribution matching often fail to accurately capture distributional\ndifferences, leading to unreliable measures of discrepancy. In this paper, we\nreformulate dataset distillation as a minmax optimization problem and introduce\nNeural Characteristic Function Discrepancy (NCFD), a comprehensive and\ntheoretically grounded metric for measuring distributional differences. NCFD\nleverages the Characteristic Function (CF) to encapsulate full distributional\ninformation, employing a neural network to optimize the sampling strategy for\nthe CF's frequency arguments, thereby maximizing the discrepancy to enhance\ndistance estimation. Simultaneously, we minimize the difference between real\nand synthetic data under this optimized NCFD measure. Our approach, termed\nNeural Characteristic Function Matching (\\mymethod{}), inherently aligns the\nphase and amplitude of neural features in the complex plane for both real and\nsynthetic data, achieving a balance between realism and diversity in synthetic\nsamples. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant\nperformance gains over state-of-the-art methods on both low- and\nhigh-resolution datasets.

However, according to current\nresearch, DMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which allow attackers to\ncontrol the model's output by inputting data containing covert triggers, such\nas a specific visual patch or phrase. Existing defense strategies are well\nequipped to thwart such attacks through backdoor detection and trigger\ninversion because previous attack methods are constrained by limited input\nspaces and low-dimensional triggers. For example, visual triggers are easily\nobserved by defenders, text-based or attention-based triggers are more\nsusceptible to neural network detection. To explore more possibilities of\nbackdoor attack in DMs, we propose Gungnir, a novel method that enables\nattackers to activate the backdoor in DMs through style triggers within input\nimages. Our approach proposes using stylistic features as triggers for the\nfirst time and implements backdoor attacks successfully in image-to-image tasks\nby introducing Reconstructing-Adversarial Noise (RAN) and Short-Term\nTimesteps-Retention (STTR). Our technique generates trigger-embedded images\nthat are perceptually indistinguishable from clean images, thus bypassing both\nmanual inspection and automated detection neural networks.

By reformulating the PDE as a\nsystem of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and leveraging Chebyshev\nseries in time, we reduce the problem to a zero-finding task for\nFourier-Chebyshev coefficients. A key theoretical contribution is the\nderivation of an explicit decay estimate for the inverse of the linear part of\nthe PDE, enabling larger time steps. This allows the construction of an\napproximate inverse for the Fr\\'echet derivative and the application of a\nNewton-Kantorovich theorem to establish solution existence within explicit\nerror bounds. Building on prior work, our method is extended to more complex\npartial differential equations, including the 2D Navier-Stokes equations, for\nwhich we establish global existence of the solution of the IVP for a given\nnontrivial initial condition.",

Second, the unsigned line-of-sight velocities in the Mg\nII k line generally increase with height in both regions, although the unsigned\nvelocities in QS increase with height stronger than CH. Third, the Mg II k line\nwidths increase just above the limb and then decrease with height in both CH\nand QS but are overall larger for CH than for QS, especially at the lower\naltitudes.

In practical FL systems, clients\n(e.g., edge servers, smartphones, and wearables) typically have disparate\nsystem resources. Conventional FL, however, adopts a one-size-fits-all\nsolution, where a homogeneous large global model is transmitted to and trained\non each client, resulting in an overwhelming workload for less capable clients\nand starvation for other clients. To address this issue, we propose FedConv, a\nclient-friendly FL framework, which minimizes the computation and memory burden\non resource-constrained clients by providing heterogeneous customized\nsub-models. FedConv features a novel learning-on-model paradigm that learns the\nparameters of the heterogeneous sub-models via convolutional compression.\nUnlike traditional compression methods, the compressed models in FedConv can be\ndirectly trained on clients without decompression. To aggregate the\nheterogeneous sub-models, we propose transposed convolutional dilation to\nconvert them back to large models with a unified size while retaining\npersonalized information from clients. The compression and dilation processes,\ntransparent to clients, are optimized on the server leveraging a small public\ndataset. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that FedConv\noutperforms state-of-the-art FL systems in terms of model accuracy (by more\nthan 35% on average), computation and communication overhead (with 33% and 25%\nreduction, respectively).",

The scaling of these models, accomplished by increasing the\nnumber of parameters and the magnitude of the training datasets, has been\nlinked to various so-called emergent abilities that were previously unobserved.\nThese emergent abilities, ranging from advanced reasoning and in-context\nlearning to coding and problem-solving, have sparked an intense scientific\ndebate: Are they truly emergent, or do they simply depend on external factors,\nsuch as training dynamics, the type of problems, or the chosen metric? What\nunderlying mechanism causes them? Despite their transformative potential,\nemergent abilities remain poorly understood, leading to misconceptions about\ntheir definition, nature, predictability, and implications. In this work, we\nshed light on emergent abilities by conducting a comprehensive review of the\nphenomenon, addressing both its scientific underpinnings and real-world\nconsequences. We first critically analyze existing definitions, exposing\ninconsistencies in conceptualizing emergent abilities. We then explore the\nconditions under which these abilities appear, evaluating the role of scaling\nlaws, task complexity, pre-training loss, quantization, and prompting\nstrategies. Our review extends beyond traditional LLMs and includes Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs), which leverage reinforcement learning and\ninference-time search to amplify reasoning and self-reflection.

Recently, Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs), driven by\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), are designed to\nautomate the entire lifecycle of network operations with minimal human\nintervention, presenting a promising solution for enhancing automation in 5G/6G\nnetworks.

AI/ML algorithms are widely used to develop cybersecurity\nmechanisms, but require substantial specialized expertise and encounter model\ndrift issues, posing significant challenges in developing autonomous\ncybersecurity measures. Therefore, this paper proposes an automated security\nframework targeting Physical Layer Authentication (PLA) and Cross-Layer\nIntrusion Detection Systems (CLIDS) to address security concerns at multiple\nInternet protocol layers. The proposed framework employs drift-adaptive online\nlearning techniques and a novel enhanced Successive Halving (SH)-based\nAutomated ML (AutoML) method to automatically generate optimized ML models for\ndynamic networking environments. Experimental results illustrate that the\nproposed framework achieves high performance on the public Radio Frequency (RF)\nfingerprinting and the Canadian Institute for CICIDS2017 datasets, showcasing\nits effectiveness in addressing PLA and CLIDS tasks within dynamic and complex\nnetworking environments.

Although sophisticated 3D object detection\nand tracking methods have been investigated and developed thoroughly in the\nfields of computer vision and autonomous driving, their demands on expensive\nand high-accuracy sensor setups and substantial computational resources from\nlarge neural networks make them unsuitable for indoor robotics. Recently, more\nlightweight perception algorithms leveraging onboard cameras or LiDAR sensors\nhave emerged as promising alternatives. However, relying on a single sensor\nposes significant limitations: cameras have limited fields of view and can\nsuffer from high noise, whereas LiDAR sensors operate at lower frequencies and\nlack the richness of visual features. To address this limitation, we propose a\ndynamic obstacle detection and tracking framework that uses both onboard camera\nand LiDAR data to enable lightweight and accurate perception. Our proposed\nmethod expands on our previous ensemble detection approach, which integrates\noutputs from multiple low-accuracy but computationally efficient detectors to\nensure real-time performance on the onboard computer. In this work, we propose\na more robust fusion strategy that integrates both LiDAR and visual data to\nenhance detection accuracy further. We then utilize a tracking module that\nadopts feature-based object association and the Kalman filter to track and\nestimate detected obstacles' states. Besides, a dynamic obstacle classification\nalgorithm is designed to robustly identify moving objects.

If the modern environment\ninterferes with internal synchrony or generates different masking for different\ninternal system's outputs, then real world data reflecting these outputs ought\nto reveal relatively low correlations, reflecting environmental interference.\nAt the other extreme, if there is no behavior or tissue specific interference,\nthen different internal system outputs should all be equally predicted from\ndata modalities capturing their different outputs.

Our evaluation shows that Llama 3.1 8B and GPT-3.5 Turbo achieve\nthe lowest percentage errors of 1.55\\% and 3.68\\%, respectively, producing meal\nplans that closely align with user-defined caloric targets while minimizing\ndeviation and improving precision. Additionally, we compared the performance of\nDeepSeek V3 against several established models to evaluate its potential in\npersonalized nutrition planning.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution and global impact of coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV-1\nand SARS-CoV-2, underscore the importance of understanding their molecular\nmechanisms in detail. This study focuses on the receptor-binding motif (RBM)\nwithin the Spike protein of these viruses, a critical element for viral entry\nthrough interaction with the ACE2 receptor. We investigate the sequence\nvariations in the RBM across SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and its early variants of\nconcern (VOCs). Utilizing multicanonical simulations and microcanonical\nanalysis, we examine how these variations influence the folding dynamics,\nthermostability, and solubility of the RBMs. Our methodology includes\ncalculating the density of states (DoS) to identify structural phase\ntransitions and assess thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, we solve the\nPoisson-Boltzmann equation to model the solubility of the RBMs in aqueous\nenvironments. This methodology is expected to elucidate structural and\nfunctional differences in viral evolution and pathogenicity, likely improving\ntargeted treatments and vaccines.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a modified Newton dynamics (MOND) model to study the\nrotation curves of galaxies. The model is described by an arctangent\ninterpolating function and it fits the rotation curves of several galaxies\nwithout invoking the presence of dark matter. We took from the literature the\nrotation curve data of fifteen spiral galaxies, and used it to constrain the\nmodel parameter, $a_0$, as around $5\\times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$. This parameter is\nalso called the acceleration constant once it gives the acceleration scale\nwhere Newton's dynamics fails. The model can be further tested in different\nastrophysical scenarios, such as, the missing mass problem of galaxy clusters\nand the accelerated expansion of the Universe, thus leading to a more robust\nand well constrained model.",
