    "abstract": "Confidential virtual machines (CVMs) based on trusted execution environments\n(TEEs) enable new privacy-preserving solutions. Yet, they leave side-channel\nleakage outside their threat model, shifting the responsibility of mitigating\nsuch attacks to developers. However, mitigations are either not generic or too\nslow for practical use, and developers currently lack a systematic, efficient\nway to measure and compare leakage across real-world deployments. In this\npaper, we present FARFETCH'D, an open-source toolkit that offers configurable\nside-channel tracing primitives on production AMD SEV-SNP hardware and couples\nthem with statistical and machine-learning-based analysis pipelines for\nautomated leakage estimation. We apply FARFETCH'D to three representative\nworkloads that are deployed on CVMs to enhance user privacy - private\ninformation retrieval, private heavy hitters, and Wasm user-defined functions -\nand uncover previously unnoticed leaks, including a covert channel that\nexfiltrated data at 497 kbit/s. The results show that FARFETCH'D pinpoints\nvulnerabilities and guides low-overhead mitigations based on oblivious memory\nand differential privacy, giving practitioners a practical path to deploy CVMs\nwith meaningful confidentiality guarantees.",

However, current benchmarks inadequately\nassess model performance in biologically challenging contexts, especially those\ninvolving intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), limiting their utility in\napplications such as drug discovery, disease variant interpretation, and\nprotein interface design. We introduce DisProtBench, a comprehensive benchmark\nfor evaluating protein structure prediction models (PSPMs) under structural\ndisorder and complex biological conditions. DisProtBench spans three key axes:\n(1) Data complexity, covering disordered regions, G protein-coupled receptor\n(GPCR) ligand pairs, and multimeric complexes; (2) Task diversity, benchmarking\ntwelve leading PSPMs across structure-based tasks with unified classification,\nregression, and interface metrics; and (3) Interpretability, via the\nDisProtBench Portal, which provides precomputed 3D structures and visual error\nanalyses. Our results reveal significant variability in model robustness under\ndisorder, with low-confidence regions linked to functional prediction failures.\nNotably, global accuracy metrics often fail to predict task performance in\ndisordered settings, emphasizing the need for function-aware evaluation.\nDisProtBench establishes a reproducible, extensible, and biologically grounded\nframework for assessing next-generation PSPMs in realistic biomedical\nscenarios.",

These formations also\nfacilitated hydrodynamic drafting, allowing weaker individuals to conserve\nenergy and remain integrated within the group. The trident's structure, though\ninefficient for solitary lift or combat, functioned effectively in cooperative\nformations, suggesting that its original selective advantage lay not in\nindividual performance but in enhancing group cohesion and efficiency.

To\nsystematically study the pre-flare phase, we constructed a\nHinode/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) flare catalog of 1,449\nflares from 2011-2024. This enabled a large-scale analysis of flare loop\nfootpoint non-thermal velocity evolution across different flare magnitudes (C,\nM, X-classes). Analyzing Fe VIII - Fe XXIV emission lines formed at log(T/K)\n~5.7-7.3 with piecewise linear fits in the pre-flare period, we find that\nnon-thermal velocities consistently increase 4-25 minutes before GOES soft\nX-ray start in C and M-class flares. Onset timing patterns vary with flare\nmagnitude: smaller flares show temperature-dependent progression, while larger\nflares exhibit more compressed, near-simultaneous onsets across temperatures.\nWhile our limited X-class sample (N=18) also show onset before GOES, larger\nstatistics are needed to confirm its behavior. M-class flares show a systematic\nprecursor non-thermal velocity onset ~30-60 minutes before GOES peak. In a\nsubset of M-class flares (2011-2018), eruptive events show even earlier\nnon-thermal velocity increases ($>$1 hour before GOES peak) than confined\nevents, suggesting a link between extended pre-flare non-thermal broadening and\nsuccessful eruptions.

    "abstract": "With the increasing availability of data from historical studies and\nreal-world data sources, hybrid control designs that incorporate external data\ninto the evaluation of current studies are being increasingly adopted. In these\ndesigns, it is necessary to pre-specify during the planning phase the extent to\nwhich information will be borrowed from historical control data. However, if\nsubstantial differences in baseline covariate distributions between the current\nand historical studies are identified at the final analysis, the amount of\neffective borrowing may be limited, potentially resulting in lower actual power\nthan originally targeted. In this paper, we propose two sample size\nre-estimation strategies that can be applied during the course of the blinded\ncurrent study. Both strategies utilize inverse probability weighting (IPW)\nbased on the probability of assignment to either the current or historical\nstudy. When large discrepancies in baseline covariates are detected, the\nproposed strategies adjust the sample size upward to prevent a loss of\nstatistical power. The performance of the proposed strategies is evaluated\nthrough simulation studies, and their practical implementation is demonstrated\nusing a case study based on two actual randomized clinical studies.",

In all the aforementioned scenarios, the HGO algorithm outperforms\nthe existing algorithms. Particularly, in the ambient environment, the HGO\nalgorithm achieves a 39.3% reduction in transportation cost and a 16.8%\nreduction in computational time as compared to the PSO algorithm.

The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients\ndiagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria.

PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using\nDice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance\n(HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W\nscans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years)\nand 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved\nDSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98\nmm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86\n(controls), 0.82 (pancreatitis), and intra-observer agreement reached 0.88 and\n0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 =\n0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability.\nConclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for\npancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy\nand diseased states.

In this paper, we contradict\nthis expectation with constructions for both hypergraph product codes and\nbalanced product codes, although these first examples have weak properties. We\nfind qLDPC codes with transversal phase gates that have a number of logical\nqubits that grows linearly with $n$, the number of physical qubits.

Moreover, existing distance rebalancing techniques are\none-sided; we show that they only preserve the transversality when rebalancing\nto increase the asymmetry, not decrease it.\n  We also collate a toolbox of techniques that identify a single transversal\ngate from which we can individuate a large range of different transversal\ngates.

Data preprocessing involved\nmedian/mode imputation, z-score normalization, and early temporal feature\nengineering. A two-step feature selection pipeline-univariate filtering (ANOVA\nF-test) and Random Forest-based multivariate ranking-yielded 19 interpretable\nfeatures. Seven ML models were trained with stratified 5-fold cross-validation\nand SMOTE oversampling. Interpretability was assessed via ablation and\nAccumulated Local Effects (ALE) analysis.\n  Results: Logistic regression achieved the best performance (AUROC: 0.825; 95%\nCI: 0.779-0.867), surpassing more complex models. Key predictors included RAS,\nage, bilirubin, and extubation.

As a fundamental task in\ntrajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role\nin a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based\nmethods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS\nand grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful\ntrajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well\nas the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion\npatterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on\npoint-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking\ninformation obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity\nto a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a\nnovel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff.\nSpecifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an\nattention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating\nsemantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified\nrepresentation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training\nintroduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model\ntraining process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall\nranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global\nperspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among\ntrajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show\nthat TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In\nparticular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three\nevaluation metrics and datasets.",

However, accurately\nforecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due\nto the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of\niceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg\nmotion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a\nhighly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex.

We present a\nmesh morphing approach that deforms a reference mesh into geometrically varying\nconfigurations while preserving mesh connectivity. This enables the automated\ngeneration of large ensembles of geometrically variable meshes with minimal\nuser input. Importantly, the preserved connectivity allows for the application\nof data-driven, non-intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs) to perform robust\nsensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate mesh\nmorphing in two geophysical applications: (i) 3D dynamic rupture simulations\nwith fault dip angles varying across a 40{\\deg} range, and (ii) 2D thermal\nmodels of subduction zones incorporating realistic slab interface curvature and\ndepth uncertainties informed by the Slab2 geometry dataset. In both cases,\nmorphed meshes retain high quality and lead to accurate simulation results that\nclosely match those obtained using exactly generated meshes. For the dynamic\nrupture case, we further construct ROMs that efficiently predict surface\ndisplacement and velocity time series as functions of fault geometry, achieving\nspeedups of up to $10^9 \\times$ relative to full simulations.

The presence of these challenges is not\nsurprising given that a review of the literature considering both datasets and\nproposed ML models suggests this is the first sUAS-based ML system for disaster\ndamage assessment actually deployed as a part of real-world operations. The\nsUAS-based ML system was applied by the State of Florida to Hurricanes Helene\n(2 orthomosaics, 3.0 gigapixels collected over 2 sorties by a Wintra WingtraOne\nsUAS) and Debby (1 orthomosaic, 0.59 gigapixels collected via 1 sortie by a\nWintra WingtraOne sUAS) in Florida.

Here, we show\nthat a similar enhancement can be realized using a slow-light augmented\nFabry-Perot Cavity (SLAFPC), due to the fact that an FPC is inherently\nunbalanced, since different bounces of the field traverse different path\nlengths before interfering with the other bounces. We show how the degree of\nenhancement in sensitivity depends on the spectral width of the laser and the\nfinesse of the FPC. We also show how the sensitivity enhancement factor (SEF)\nfor the SLAFPC is much larger than the same for the SLAUMZI for comparable\nconditions and the same group index, under lossless conditions. In general, the\neffect of the loss caused by the medium that produces the slow-light process is\nmore prominent for the SLAFPC than the SLAUMZI. However, if the attenuation per\npass can be kept low enough while producing a high group index, using cold\natoms for generating the slow-light effect, for example, then the SEF for the\nSLAFPC can be much higher than that for the SLAUMZI. For potentially realizable\nconditions, we show that an SEF of ~1.4*10^5 can be achieved using a SLAFPC.",

The\nscore matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for\nunderstanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain\nplausible while differing significantly from their training images. In\nparticular, as explained in (Kamb \\& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,\n(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we\nwould only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.\nHowever, as shown by Kamb \\& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the\nscore is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself\n(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples\nthat globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise\n`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role\nof self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in\nthis direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose\nscore is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that\nour theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent\narrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and\nwe verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.",

We\nfound that the EOP errors are scaled with an increase in duration of an\nobserving session as a broken power law with the power of -0.3 at durations\nlonger than 2-4 hours, which we explain as manifestation of the presence of\ncorrelations in the atmospheric noise.",

    "abstract": "This work demonstrates the tendency of two model PANH isomers to dimerize\nunder pure ambient evaporative conditions and then undergo complex intracluster\nion-molecule reactions to produce rich chemistry. Despite the population of\nsuch dimers at room temperature is found to be relatively low, they are found\nto produce observable effects in typical stellar radiation conditions. It is\nalso demonstrated that various types of energetic radiation (UV radiation at\n266 nm, synchrotron VUV radiation and high-energy protons) can induce\nintracluster ion-molecule reactions in the dimers. The existence of such dimers\nis confirmed via the analysis of the mass-selected photoelectron spectra of\nvarious species observed in the mass spectra. The signal from such processes is\nenhanced by UV multiphoton ionization/dissociation and is analysed using\nenergy-correlated time-of-flight mass spectrometry. These measurements,\ntogether with the dependence on laser intensity, disclose the reaction\nenergetics as well as the hierarchy of the decay of the reaction products. The\nfindings of this work on dimer-driven ion-molecular reactions in quinoline and\nisoquinoline provide an alternative to the path for molecular growth in the\nastrochemical environment through cluster dynamics, which is otherwise\nattributed to dust and ice-driven processes.",

In recent years, mutational signature analysis has become a\nprominent field of study within cancer research, commonly with Nonnegative\nMatrix Factorization (NMF) and Bayesian NMF. However, current methods assume\nindependence across mutation types in the signatures matrix. This paper expands\nupon current Bayesian NMF methodologies by proposing novel methods that account\nfor the dependencies between the mutation types. First, we implement the\nBayesian NMF specification with a Multivariate Truncated Normal prior on the\nsignatures matrix in order to model the covariance structure using external\ninformation, in our case estimated from the COSMIC signatures database. This\nmodel converges in fewer iterations, using MCMC, when compared to a model with\nindependent Truncated Normal priors on elements of the signatures matrix and\nresults in improvements in accuracy, especially on small sample sizes. In\naddition, we develop a hierarchical model that allows the covariance structure\nof the signatures matrix to be discovered rather than specified upfront, giving\nthe algorithm more flexibility. This flexibility for the algorithm to learn the\ndependence structure of the signatures allows a better understanding of\nbiological interactions and how these change across different types of cancer.\nThe code for this project is contributed to an open-source R software package.\nOur work lays the groundwork for future research to incorporate dependency\nstructure across mutation types in the signatures matrix and is also applicable\nto any use of NMF beyond just single-base substitution (SBS) mutational\nsignatures.",

Furthermore, to mitigate the\ndependency on costly human monitoring, this learning process should be\nperformed in a safe and autonomous manner. We present SafeMimic, a framework to\nlearn new mobile manipulation skills safely and autonomously from a single\nthird-person human video. Given an initial human video demonstration of a\nmulti-step mobile manipulation task, SafeMimic first parses the video into\nsegments, inferring both the semantic changes caused and the motions the human\nexecuted to achieve them and translating them to an egocentric reference. Then,\nit adapts the behavior to the robot's own morphology by sampling candidate\nactions around the human ones, and verifying them for safety before execution\nin a receding horizon fashion using an ensemble of safety Q-functions trained\nin simulation. When safe forward progression is not possible, SafeMimic\nbacktracks to previous states and attempts a different sequence of actions,\nadapting both the trajectory and the grasping modes when required for its\nmorphology.

Employing this approach enables\nsimultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while\nproviding a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The\nproposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,\ntreating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input\nsamples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to\nestimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and\noptimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves\na two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training\nphase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step\nestimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the\nimprovement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI\nestimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is\nused to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto\n(HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding\nto enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and\nfinite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nparticularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution\nis non-uniform. For these cases, we show significant improvements in MI and bit\nerror rates (BERs) over those achieved by uniform and independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) input distributions, validating our method for\nblock lengths up to 1024.

Such an integrability lives on the space of\nnon-abelian electric and magnetic charges, and is based on flat connections in\ngeneralized loop spaces, presenting an R-matrix, and Sklyanin relation. We\npresent two novel symmetries of Yang-Mills theories. The first one corresponds\nto global transformations generated by the infinity of those conserved charges\nunder the Poisson brackets. The gauge and matter fields, as well as Wilson\nlines and fluxes have interesting transformation laws under such a global\nsymmetry. The second one corresponds to symmetries of the integral Yang-Mills\nequations, which lead to the conserved charges. They generate an infinite\ndimensional group, where the elements are holonomies of connections on the loop\nspace of functions from the circle $S^1$ to the space-time.

The\nconserved charges are gauge invariant, and so, in the case of QCD they are\ncolor singlets, and perhaps are not confined. Therefore, the hadrons may carry\nsuch charges.

    "abstract": "The presence of concept drift poses challenges for anomaly detection in time\nseries. While anomalies are caused by undesirable changes in the data,\ndifferentiating abnormal changes from varying normal behaviours is difficult\ndue to differing frequencies of occurrence, varying time intervals when normal\npatterns occur, and identifying similarity thresholds to separate the boundary\nbetween normal vs. abnormal sequences. Differentiating between concept drift\nand anomalies is critical for accurate analysis as studies have shown that the\ncompounding effects of error propagation in downstream tasks lead to lower\ndetection accuracy and increased overhead due to unnecessary model updates.\nUnfortunately, existing work has largely explored anomaly detection and concept\ndrift detection in isolation. We introduce AnDri, a framework for Anomaly\ndetection in the presence of Drift. AnDri introduces the notion of a dynamic\nnormal model where normal patterns are activated, deactivated or newly added,\nproviding flexibility to adapt to concept drift and anomalies over time. We\nintroduce a new clustering method, Adjacent Hierarchical Clustering (AHC), for\nlearning normal patterns that respect their temporal locality; critical for\ndetecting short-lived, but recurring patterns that are overlooked by existing\nmethods. Our evaluation shows AnDri outperforms existing baselines using real\ndatasets with varying types, proportions, and distributions of concept drift\nand anomalies.",

Unlike in accreting white dwarfs,\nthe $\\gtrsim10^{8} \\mathrm{K}$ envelope temperature forces hydrogen burning to\nproceed via the $\\beta$-limited, thermally stable hot CNO cycle. Recent\nobservations of weak X-ray bursts from SAX J1808.4-3658 occurring within 1-3\ndays of the onset of an accretion outburst have raised the question that these\nbursts were triggered by thermally unstable hydrogen ignition, analogously to\nclassical novae. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we explore the unstable\nignition of hydrogen on slowly accreting neutron stars. For solar\nmetallicities, the burning is insufficiently vigorous to launch convection and\nthe burst rise is on the envelope thermal timescale, with the hydrogen being\nconsumed over hours. For elevated metallicities ($Z\\gtrsim0.06$), however, the\ninitial proton captures onto CNO nuclei heat the envelope enough to drive\nconvection and produce a sharp peak in the luminosity. This peak can match that\nof the SAX J1808.4-3658 burst, for sufficient enrichment. Following this peak,\nthe hydrogen burning stabilizes at a rate set solely by the ignition depth and\nCNO abundance in the accreted matter. This quasi-steady-state burning produces\nan extended tail of elevated emission that lasts until the hydrogen is\nexhausted. Observations of the tail's luminosity and duration measure the\nhydrogen and metallicity abundance of the accreted material, while the\ndistance-independent ratio of peak-to-tail luminosities would suggest the\npresence of significant metallicity gradients prior to convection.",

We\ndevelop a framework to incorporate these strongly anharmonic vibrational modes\ninto first-principles thermodynamic calculations. By explicitly modeling the\ncage potential and solving the associated Schr\\\"odinger equation numerically,\nwe compute the full anharmonic free energy contribution and demonstrate its\nimpact on thermodynamic phase stability. Our results reproduce key experimental\nsignatures, including the anomalous rise in the thermal expansion coefficient\nand specific heat at low temperatures, and reveal that the presence of guest\natoms is essential to stabilizing the Al$_{10}$V phase at elevated\ntemperatures.",

    "abstract": "The mean first passage time (MFPT) is a key metric for understanding\ntransport, search, and escape processes in stochastic systems. While well\ncharacterized for passive Brownian particles, its behavior in active\nsystems-such as active Brownian particles (ABPs)-remains less understood due to\ntheir self-propelled, nonequilibrium dynamics. In this paper, we formulate and\nanalyze an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) to characterize the\nMFPT of ABPs in two-dimensional domains, including circular, annular, and\nelliptical regions. For annular regions, we analyze the MFPT of ABPs under\nvarious boundary conditions. Our results reveal rich behaviors in the MFPT of\nABPs that differ fundamentally from those of passive particles. Notably, the\nMFPT exhibits non-monotonic dependence on the initial position and orientation\nof the particle, with maxima often occurring away from the domain center. We\nalso find that increasing swimming speed can either increase or decrease the\nMFPT depending on the geometry and initial orientation. Asymptotic analysis of\nthe PDE in the weak-activity regime provides insight into how activity modifies\nescape statistics of the particles in different geometries. Finally, our\nnumerical solutions of the PDE are validated against Monte Carlo simulations.",

However, the intricate relationships between\nthe signal carrier wavelength and the transceiver region size lead to\ninaccuracies in traditional far-field 6DMA channel model, causing discrepancies\nbetween the model predictions and the hybrid-field channel characteristics in\npractical 6DMA systems, where users might be in the far-field region relative\nto the antennas on the same 6DMA surface, while simultaneously being in the\nnear-field region relative to different 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, due to the\nhigh-dimensional channel and the coupled position and rotation constraints, the\nestimation of the 6DMA channel and the joint design of the 6DMA positions and\nrotations and the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) incur extremely\nhigh computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose an efficient\nhybrid-field generalized 6DMA channel model, which accounts for planar-wave\npropagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical-wave propagation\namong different 6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, by leveraging directional sparsity,\nwe propose a low-overhead channel estimation algorithm that efficiently\nconstructs a complete channel map for all potential antenna position-rotation\npairs while limiting the training overhead incurred by antenna movement. In\naddition, we propose a low-complexity design leveraging deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL), which facilitates the joint design of the 6DMA positions,\nrotations, and beamforming in a unified manner.

For isolated resonances with a Lorentzian\nlineshape, the deviations amount to an enhancement of the resonance linewidth\nby the Petermann factor (PF), given by the overlap of left and right eigenmodes\nof the underlying effectively non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The PF diverges at\nexceptional points (EPs), where resonance frequencies degenerate, and right and\nleft eigenmodes are orthogonal to each other. This divergence signifies a\nqualitative departure from a Lorentzian lineshape, which has gained recent\nattention. In this work, we extend this concept to EPs, and describe how this\nEP PF manifests in a variety of physical scenarios. Firstly, we identify this\nPF in physical terms as an enhancement of the response of a system to external\nor parametric perturbations. Utilizing two natural orthogonally projected\nreference systems based on the right and left eigenvectors, we show that each\nchoice carries a precise geometric interpretation that naturally extends the\nnotion of the PF for isolated resonances to EPs. The two choices can be\ncombined into an overall EP PF, which again can be expressed in purely\ngeometric terms. Secondly, we illuminate the geometric mechanisms that\ndetermine the size of the EP PF, by considering the role of modes participating\nin the degeneracy and those that remain spectrally separated. Thirdly, we\ndesign a system to study the EP PF in a specific physical setup, consisting of\ntwo microrings coupled to a waveguide with embedded semitransparent mirrors.\nThis example shows our approach yields a more accurate spectral response\nstrength than conventional truncation. These results complete the description\nof systems at EPs in the same way as the original PF does for isolated\nresonances.",

This representation serves as the input\nof an U-Net style architecture, SPArc_dl, which is trained using a\ntri-objective function: maximizing spot-counts on target, minimizing\nspot-counts on OAR, and reducing ELS time. The model is evaluated on 35\nnasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is compared to\nSPArc_particle_swarm (SPArc_ps). SPArc_dl produces EL pre-selection that\nsignificantly improves both plan quality and delivery efficiency.

    "abstract": "Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved\nimpressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where\ninitial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel\nopen-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically\nrequire collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their\nbehavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy\nimprovement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of\nsamples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast\nautonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL.\nFocusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC\nmethodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL):\nadapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that\nDSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC\npolicy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement.\nFurthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning\ndiffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy\nat all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks,\nand for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample\nefficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.",

    "abstract": "Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics tells us that the\ndescription of a system in the formalism of quantum mechanics is not an\nabsolute, but it is relative to the observer itself. The interpretation goes\nfurther and proposes a set of axioms. In standard non relational language, one\nof them states that an observer can only retrieve finite amount information\nfrom a system by means of measurement. Our contribution starts with the\nobservation that quantum mechanics, i.e. quantum field theory (QFT) in\ndimension 1, radically differs from QFT in higher dimensions. In higher\ndimensions boundary data (or initial data) cannot be specified by means of\nfinitely many measurements. This calls for a notion of measuring scale, which\nwe provide. At a given measuring scale the observer has partial information\nabout the system. Our notion of measuring scale generalizes the one implicitly\nused in Wilsonian QFT, where at each measuring scale there are effective\ntheories, which may be corrected, and if the theory turns out to be\nrenormalizable the mentioned corrections converge to determine a completely\ncorrected (or renormalized) theory at the given measuring scale. The notion of\na measuring scale is the cornerstone of Wilsonian QFT. This notion tells us\nthat we are not describing a system from an absolute perspective. An effective\ntheory at that scale describes the system with respect to the observer, which\nmay retrieve information from the system by means of measurement in a specific\nway determined by our notion of measuring scale.

We use a sample of 19\ngalaxies with stellar masses $\\approx 400 - 40,000~{\\rm M}_\\odot$ simulated\nwith FIRE-2 physics and baryonic mass resolution of $30~M_{\\odot}$. The surface\nbrightness cut leads to smaller sizes, lower stellar masses, and lower stellar\nvelocity dispersions than the values inferred without the cut. However, by\nimposing this realistic limit, our inferred galaxy properties lie closer to\nobserved populations in the mass-size plane, better match observed velocity\ndispersions as a function of stellar mass, and better reproduce derived\ncircular velocities as a function of half-light radius. For the most massive\ngalaxies in our sample, the surface brightness cut leads to higher mean $\\rm\n[Fe/H]$ values, but the increase is not enough to match the observed MZR.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the common Wolf et al. (2010) mass estimator is\nless accurate when the surface brightness cut is applied. For our lowest-mass\ngalaxies, in particular, excluding the low-surface brightness outskirts causes\nus to overestimate their central dark-matter densities and virial masses.

However, extracting critical information like oxidation states from\nthe experimental spectra requires expensive and time-consuming simulations.\nBuilding upon a recent proposal to simulate XAS using quantum computers, this\nwork proposes a highly-optimized implementation of the time-domain algorithm\nfor X-ray absorption. Among a host of improvements to Hamiltonian\nrepresentation, circuit implementation, and measurement strategies, three\noptimizations are key to the efficiency of the algorithm. The first is the use\nof product formulas with the compressed double factorized form of the\nHamiltonian. The second is recognizing that for spectroscopy applications, it\nis sufficient to control the error in the eigenvalues of the (approximate)\nHamiltonian being implemented by the product formula, rather than the generic\nerror on the full time evolution operator. Using perturbation theory to\nestimate this eigenvalue error, we find that significantly fewer Trotter steps\nare needed than expected from the time evolution error bound. The third is the\nchoice of an optimized distribution of samples that takes advantage of the\nexponentially decaying Lorentzian kernel. Through constant factor resource\nestimates, we show that a challenging model Li$_4$Mn$_2$O cluster system with\n18 spatial orbitals and 22 electrons in the active space can be simulated with\n100 logical qubits and less than $4 \\times 10^8$ T gates per circuit. Finally,\nthe algorithm is implemented on a simulator, and the reconstructed spectrum is\nverified against a classical computational reference.

The Koopman operator acts on a function\nspace and is most commonly studied on the space of square-integrable functions.\nHowever, defining it on a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)\noffers numerous practical advantages, including pointwise predictions with\nerror bounds, improved spectral properties that facilitate computations, and\nmore efficient algorithms, particularly in high dimensions. We introduce the\nfirst general, provably convergent, data-driven algorithms for computing\nspectral properties of Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators on RKHSs. These\nmethods efficiently compute spectra and pseudospectra with error control and\nspectral measures while exploiting the RKHS structure to avoid the large-data\nlimits required in the $L^2$ settings. The function space is determined by a\nuser-specified kernel, eliminating the need for quadrature-based sampling as in\n$L^2$ and enabling greater flexibility with finite, externally provided\ndatasets. Using the Solvability Complexity Index hierarchy, we construct\nadversarial dynamical systems for these problems to show that no algorithm can\nsucceed in fewer limits, thereby proving the optimality of our algorithms.\nNotably, this impossibility extends to randomized algorithms and datasets. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on challenging,\nhigh-dimensional datasets arising from real-world measurements and\nhigh-fidelity numerical simulations, including turbulent channel flow,\nmolecular dynamics of a binding protein, Antarctic sea ice concentration, and\nNorthern Hemisphere sea surface height.

    "abstract": "The existence of $\\sim10^{7-8}{\\rm M}_\\odot$ supermassive black holes at\n$z\\gtrsim 8$ challenges conventional growth channels. One attractive\npossibility is that light seeds ($M_{\\rm BH}\\lesssim10^{3}{\\rm M}_\\odot$)\nundergo short, super-Eddington episodes when they cross, and are captured by,\ndense massive gas clumps. We revisit this ``BH-clump-capture'' model using\nanalytic arguments supported by toy-model simulations that follow Bondi-scale\ninflow, radiative feedback, gas dynamical friction and the recently discovered\nforward acceleration effect caused by the ionised bubble. For substantial\ngrowth the black hole must remain trapped for many dynamical times, which\nimposes three simultaneous constraints. The clump must be heavier than the\nblack hole (mass doubling condition); its cooling time must exceed the\nsuper-Eddington growth time (lifetime condition); and dynamical friction must\ndominate shell acceleration (BH-trapping condition). These requirements confine\nviable clumps to a narrow density-temperature region, $n_{\\rm\nH}\\simeq10^{7-8}{\\rm cm}^{-3}$ and $T\\simeq(2-6)\\times10^{3}{\\rm K}$, for a\n$10^{3}{\\rm M}_\\odot$ seed. Even inside this sweet spot a $10^{3}{\\rm M}_\\odot$\nseed grow up at most $4\\times10^{3}{\\rm M}_\\odot$; the maximum growth ratio\n$M_{\\rm BH, fin}/M_{\\rm BH}$ falls approximately as $M_{\\rm BH}^{-0.4}$ and is\nnegligible once $M_{\\rm BH}\\gtrsim10^{4}{\\rm M}_\\odot$. The\nforward-acceleration effect is essential, expelling the black hole whenever\nphoton trapping fails. We conclude that BH-clump-capture model, and potentially\nbroad super-Eddington models, cannot produce the $>10^{4}{\\rm M}_\\odot$ seeds\nrequired for subsequent Eddington-limited growth, suggesting that alternative\npathways, such as heavy seed formation, remain necessary.",

While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities\ntoward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck.\nTraditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account\nfor crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to\nreduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use\nneural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity.

We present an\nalternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir\ncomputing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and\nmaps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly\nparallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in\nneural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation,\nadaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our\nreservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination\nfidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error\nreductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets,\nrespectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit\ndataset.

In this context, the resultant GW spectrum\nscales quadratically with the right-handed neutrino mass, while its peak\nfrequency scales inversely with the Yukawa coupling. Detecting such a spectrum\nwould provide strong evidence for leptogenesis and the existence of heavy\nright-handed neutrinos. We also discuss how the GW spectrum emitted from the\nthermal plasma is altered by an era of early matter domination. We show that it\ncan mimic the effects of additional relativistic degrees of freedom and a\nhigher reheating temperature, and that information from the graviton\nbremsstrahlung GW spectrum can break this degeneracy.",

We present a hybrid cooling model for\ncosmological simulations that incorporates a comprehensive treatment of\nradiative processes, including parameterizations of the interstellar radiation\nfield, cosmic ray rates, and dust physics. The model uses the chimes chemical\nnetwork and combines on-the-fly non-equilibrium calculations with\nquasi-equilibrium cooling rates. The quasi-equilibrium rates account for the\ntime-dependent free electron fractions of elements tracked in non-equilibrium,\nbalancing computational efficiency with physical accuracy. We evaluate the\nperformance under various conditions, including the thermal evolution of\nprimordial gas at the cosmic mean density, the properties of the warm and cold\nneutral media in Milky Way-like galaxies, and the atomic-to-molecular hydrogen\ntransition. We demonstrate that thermal equilibrium predictions for the neutral\nphases of the ISM underestimate the median gas pressures in simulations of\nisolated galaxies by up to 0.5 dex. Finally we find that the\natomic-to-molecular hydrogen transition is shifted to lower densities by up to\n1 dex if oxygen is not included in the chemical network.

    "abstract": "AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast\namount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with\nthe physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but\nrarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require\nintegrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online\nrecipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks\nusing web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI\nagents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To\noperationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task\nenvironments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic\n3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building\nupon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,\nwhich encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,\nshopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across\nphysical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain\nintelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between\nstate-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both\nchallenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and\nweb-scale knowledge access.

    "abstract": "Following genetic ancestry in eukaryote populations poses several open\nproblems due to sexual reproduction and recombination. The history of extant\ngenetic material is usually modeled backwards in time, but tracking chromosomes\nat a large scale is not trivial, as successive recombination events break them\ninto several segments. For this reason, the behavior of the distribution of\ngenetic segments across the ancestral population is not fully understood.\nMoreover, as individuals transmit only half of their genetic content to their\noffspring, after a few generations, it is possible that ghosts arise, that is,\ngenealogical ancestors that transmit no genetic material to any individual.\n  While several theoretical predictions exist to estimate properties of\nancestral segments or ghosts, most of them rely on simplifying assumptions such\nas an infinite population size or an infinite chromosome length. It is not\nclear how well these results hold in a finite universe, and current simulators\neither make other approximations or cannot handle the scale required to answer\nthese questions. In this work, we use an exact back-in-time simulator of large\ndiploid populations experiencing recombination that tracks genealogical and\ngenetic ancestry, without approximations. We focus on the distinction between\ngenealogical and genetic ancestry and, additionally, we explore the effects of\ngenome structure on ancestral segment distribution and the proportion of\ngenetic ancestors. Our study reveals that some of the theoretical predictions\nhold well in practice, but that, in several cases, it highlights discrepancies\nbetween theoretical predictions assuming infinite parameters and empirical\nresults in finite populations, emphasizing the need for cautious application of\nmathematical models in biological contexts.",

Through probing and\nagentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,\nparticularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing\nthe budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in\ntheir final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more\nin their own thinking.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of\nfractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time\nsettings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,\ninput-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for\nlearning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector\nfield, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along\nwith the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to\nestimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are\nthen reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed\napproach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.\nThe results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the\nsystem dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn\nequivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that\nfractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting\nthe limitations of integer-order representations.",

A range of randomised algorithms,\nincluding eigenstate property estimation by spectral filters, Hamiltonian\nsimulation, and perturbative quantum simulation, though motivated and designed\nfor different applications, share common features in the use of unitary\ndecomposition and Hadamard-test-based implementation. In this work, we start by\nanalysing the role of randomised linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) in\nquantum simulations, and present several quantum circuits that realise the\nrandomised composite LCU. A caveat of randomisation, however, is that the\nresulting state cannot be deterministically prepared, which often takes an\nunphysical form $U \\rho V^\\dagger$ with unitaries $U$ and $V$. Therefore,\nrandomised LCU algorithms are typically restricted to only estimating the\nexpectation value of a single Pauli operator. To address this, we introduce a\nquantum instrument that can realise a non-completely-positive map, whose\nfeature of frequent measurement and reset on the ancilla makes it particularly\nsuitable in the fault-tolerant regime. We then show how to construct an\nunbiased estimator of the effective (unphysical) state $U \\rho V^\\dagger$ and\nits generalisation. Moreover, we demonstrate how to effectively realise the\nstate prepared by applying an operator that admits a composite LCU form. Our\nresults reveal a natural connection between randomised LCU algorithms and\nshadow tomography, thereby allowing simultaneous estimation of many observables\nefficiently. As a concrete example, we construct the estimators and present the\nsimulation complexity for three use cases of randomised LCU in Hamiltonian\nsimulation and eigenstate preparation tasks.",

Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers\nto compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as\nan auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy\noptimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\\%\nrelative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a\n6.1\\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,\ncompared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but\nwithout the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the\nextracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that\nAutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model\nwhen run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted\nrules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted\nrules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.",

We introduce \\textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based\nReward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency\nand output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a\nmargin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to\nidentify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second\nstage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or\nexhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded\nevaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence\ncontinuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions\nthat are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and\nexplanatory, while achieving over 4$\\times$ speedup compared to existing\nvalue-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA\nMistral-7B, \\textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger\nunseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation\nin LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption\nquality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model\ngeneralization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as\na scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy.

In this study, we address this challenge by exploring the\nlinkages between sea ice retreat and Antarctic ice shelf (AIS) melt. Although\natmospheric forcing and basal melting have been widely studied, the direct\nimpact of sea ice retreat on AIS mass loss remains underexplored. Traditional\nmodels treat sea ice and AIS as separate systems. It limits their ability to\ncapture localized linkages and cascading feedback. To overcome this, we propose\nSpatial-Link, a novel graph-based framework that quantifies spatial\nheterogeneity to capture linkages between sea ice retreat and AIS melt. Our\nmethod constructs a spatial graph using Delaunay triangulation of\nsatellite-derived ice change matrices, where nodes represent regions of\nsignificant change and edges encode proximity and directional consistency. We\nextract and statistically validate linkage paths using breadth-first search and\nMonte Carlo simulations. Results reveal non-local, spatially heterogeneous\ncoupling patterns, suggesting sea ice loss can initiate or amplify downstream\nAIS melt. Our analysis shows how sea ice retreat evolves over an oceanic grid\nand progresses toward ice shelves-establishing a direct linkage.

First, it is shown that the onset of flow separation inside\na serpentine diffuser may likely experience strong, non-local history effects.\nA grid refinement study consisting of five grids (from 30 million to 3 billion\ncells) is conducted for all Mach numbers. The recently proposed dynamic\ntensor-coefficient Smagorinsky subgrid-scale and sensor-aided non-equilibrium\nwall models compare favorably with experimental measurements for the pressure\nrecovery and azimuthal flow distortion at all Mach numbers. The pressure\nrecovery and azimuthal flow distortion are predicted to within 0.3% and 7%,\nrespectively, which are both within the experimental error bounds. However, the\nsimulations underpredict the maximum azimuthal distortion in comparison to the\nexperiments for all conditions. Statistical comparisons of the dynamic\nazimuthal flow distortions suggest that the present LES reasonably captures the\nring-averaged mean distortions, and the statistical distributions of the\ndistortion around the mean.

Using the same \\textit{HST} images and the new\nimaging data from the \\textit{Euclid} survey, we report the detection of\nextremely faint but significant diffuse emission around the four GCs of CDG-2.\nWe thus have exceptionally strong evidence that CDG-2 is a galaxy.

In addition, if the previously observed GC-to-halo mass\nrelations apply to CDG-2, it would have a minimum dark matter halo mass\nfraction of $99.94\\%$ to $99.98\\%$. If it has a canonical GCLF, then the dark\nmatter halo mass fraction is $\\gtrsim 99.99\\%$.

We confirm this\nbehavior through simulations across paradigmatic non-Markovian models and\nobserve it in real-world systems, without relying on model assumptions,\nincluding biological tracer motion, DNA sequences, and financial market\ndynamics.

In this case, the quantum statistical\nmodel becomes sloppy, and the quantum Fisher information matrix turns singular.\nHowever, estimation of both parameters becomes feasible if the quantum state is\nsubjected to an appropriate scrambling operation between the two squeezing\noperations. In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of a phase-shift\nscrambling transformation, optimized to reduce sloppiness and maximize the\noverall estimation precision.

    "abstract": "The $h$-version of the finite-element method ($h$-FEM) applied to the\nhigh-frequency Helmholtz equation has been a classic topic in numerical\nanalysis since the 1990s. It is now rigorously understood that (using piecewise\npolynomials of degree $p$ on a mesh of a maximal width $h$) the conditions\n\"$(hk)^p \\rho$ sufficiently small\" and \"$(hk)^{2p} \\rho$ sufficiently small\"\nguarantee, respectively, $k$-uniform quasioptimality (QO) and bounded relative\nerror (BRE), where $\\rho$ is the norm of the solution operator with $\\rho\\sim\nk$ for non-trapping problems. Empirically, these conditions are observed to be\noptimal in the context of $h$-FEM with a uniform mesh. This paper demonstrates\nthat QO and BRE can be achieved using certain non-uniform meshes that violate\nthe conditions above on $h$ and involve coarser meshes away from trapping and\nin the perfectly matched layer (PML). The main theorem details how varying the\nmeshwidth in one region affects errors both in that region and elsewhere. One\nnotable consequence is that, for any scattering problem (trapping or\nnontrapping), in the PML one only needs $hk$ to be sufficiently small; i.e.\nthere is no pollution in the PML.\n  The motivating idea for the analysis is that the Helmholtz data-to-solution\nmap behaves differently depending on the locations of both the measurement and\ndata, in particular, on the properties of billiards trajectories (i.e. rays)\nthrough these sets. Because of this, it is natural that the approximation\nrequirements for finite-element spaces in a subset should depend on the\nproperties of billiard rays through that set. Inserting this behaviour into the\nlatest duality arguments for the FEM applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz\nequation allows us to retain detailed information about the influence of\n$\\textit{both}$ the mesh structure $\\textit{and}$ the behaviour of the true\nsolution on local errors in FEM.",

The key challenge is the\npresence of a singular matrix which makes the numerical integration hard and\nheavy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel numerical scheme based on\nsemi-implicit method for the drift component of the SDAEs. More precisely we\nsplit the drift term as the sum of a linear term and a nonlinear term. The\nlinear part is approximated implicitly, while the nonlinear part is\napproximated explicitly. The linear component's role is to handle the\nsingularity issues during the numerical integration without the resolution of\nnonlinear algebraic equations in the constraint equations. This novel scheme is\ntherefore very efficient for SDAEs in high dimension that come after the\nspatial discretisation of stochastic partial differential algebraic equations\n(SPDAEs). To prove the pathwise convergence of our novel scheme, we first\nderive a equivalent scheme called dual scheme, suitable for mathematical\nanalysis and linked to the inherent stochastic differential equation resulting\nfrom the elimination of constraints in the initial SDAEs. We prove that our\nnovel scheme converges to the exact solution with rate $\\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon$,\nfor arbitrary $\\epsilon>0$ in the pathwise sense.

Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken\nan ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact\nof state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability\nbetween studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods\nof state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the\nextent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward\ninformativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes\nrewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,\nthe extent to which the full text history is summarized).\n  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it\nadmits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments\n\\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find\nthat there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language\nstate representation. In particular, we observe that representations which\nprovide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language\nrepresentations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw\npayoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior\nthat more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more\nstable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit\neither large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play\nover time, or both.",

Both nuclei have a prominent ring or shell\naround them, giving the galaxy the appearance of a figure eight or an $\\infty$\nsymbol. The morphology resembles that of the nearby system II Hz 4, where the\nhead-on collision of two galaxies with parallel disks led to the formation of\ncollisional rings around both of their bulges. Keck spectroscopy, VLA radio\ndata, and Chandra X-ray data show that the $\\infty$ galaxy hosts an actively\naccreting supermassive black hole (SMBH), with quasar-like radio and X-ray\nluminosity. Remarkably, the SMBH is not associated with either of the two\nnuclei, but is in between them in both position and radial velocity.\nFurthermore, from excess emission in the NIRCAM F150W filter we infer that the\nSMBH is embedded in an extended distribution of H$\\alpha$-emitting gas, with a\nrest-frame equivalent width ranging from 400 - 2000 Angstrom. The gas spans the\nentire width of the system and was likely shocked and compressed at the\ncollision site, in a galaxy-scale equivalent of what happened in the bullet\ncluster. We suggest that the SMBH formed within this gas in the immediate\naftermath of the collision, when it was dense and highly turbulent.

Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model\nreliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.\nTo understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in\nmodel outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis\nrequires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing\noccurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the\nabsence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of\nmetrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of\nmetrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these\nlimitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret\ndataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised\nCompression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret\nrepresentation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to\nidentify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze\nactivation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the\noptimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly\nenhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we\ndiscovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how\ninformation processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.\nThrough the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional\ngroups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.",

Conventional TTS training pipelines require well-curated corpora with\nhigh acoustic quality and accurate text-speech alignment, which severely limits\nscalability, speaker diversity, and real-world applicability. While recent\nstudies have proposed acoustic-quality-based data selection techniques, they\noften overlook two critical aspects: (1) the inherent robustness of modern TTS\nmodels to noise, and (2) the potential contribution of perceptually low-quality\nyet informative samples. To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a\ndata-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1)\nautomated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic\nselection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3)\nevaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean\nopinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance.\nFurthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a\nclosed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data\ncleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model.

Existing\ndetection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point\ncloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and\nmemory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To\naddress this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored\nfor memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection.

To\nfuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we\nemploy an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an\noptimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance\npredicted in multi-views.

Despite\nsubstantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models\ncan still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -\neven when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we\nempirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of\nsafety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building\non this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank\nExtrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety\nsubspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness\nof LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both\nbenign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's\nadaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute\nreductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning\nattacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the\nsuccess of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter\nzone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

    "abstract": "In modern AI clusters, the performance of parallel computing critically\ndepends on the communication bandwidth among the allocated GPUs. Existing GPU\ndispatchers rely on static, locality-based heuristics that prioritize resource\ncompactness. However, this approach proves suboptimal as it overlooks key\nperformance factors. We introduce BandPilot, a performance-aware GPU\ndispatching system that maximizes effective communication bandwidth while\neliminating manual topology configuration. BandPilot addresses the dispatching\nproblem in two stages: i) a hierarchical Transformer model that accurately\npredicts end-to-end NCCL bandwidth for arbitrary GPU configurations, and ii) a\nlightweight search algorithm combining an Equilibrium-driven Heuristic with\nPruned Tree Search to identify near-optimal GPU allocations. We implement and\nevaluate BandPilot on a real-world AI cluster and in trace-driven simulations.\nExperimental results demonstrate that BandPilot consistently achieves high\nbandwidth efficiency with negligible overhead, outperforming state-of-the-art\ntopology-aware dispatchers by $12\\sim 31\\%$ across diverse AI cluster\nconfigurations.",

While vision-language\nlarge models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their\neffectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This\npaper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice\nquestions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and\ncharts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.\nUnlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring\nmodels to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12\nstate-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary\nmodels achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their\nperformance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is\nrequired. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this\nsetting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum\naccuracy of 27%.

Existing SD-based\nReal-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,\nresulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to\neffectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the\nlow-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining\nthe extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA\nLearning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion\nmodel, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency\nsimultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module\nto aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a\nConsistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from\ndegraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules\nand train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with\nthe temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases\nalternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent\nand detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged\ninto the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a\nsingle diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance\nin both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.",

Computational applications typically use a\nfinite-dimensional approximation to the KO.

In principle, the potential benefits\nprovided by the KO, and the way that it facilitates the use of game theory via\nits linearity, would suggest it as a powerful approach for dealing with\nmulti-agent control problems. In practice, though, there has not been much work\nin this space: most multi-agent KO work has treated those agents as different\ncomponents of a single system rather than as distinct decision-making entities.\nThis paper develops a KO formulation for multi-agent systems that structures\nthe interactions between decision-making agents and extends this formulation to\nsystems in which the agents have hierarchical control structures and time scale\nseparated dynamics. We solve the multi-agent control problem in both cases as\nboth a centralized optimization and as a general-sum game theory problem.

Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces\nthree key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)\nrandom Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is\napplied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for\ncostly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to\nimproved utility.

Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE\ncan reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or\ntraining time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when\npre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as\ncompared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance.

The\nlinearity of the KO facilitates the use of linear tools and theories on\nnonlinear dynamical systems without relying on local approximations.\nAdditionally, the KO has the ability to incorporate forms of domain knowledge\nsuch as stability and known variable interactions. It therefore constitutes\npart of the broader interest in domain-aware or physics-informed machine\nlearning.

    "abstract": "Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon\nstorage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural\nModel (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree\nstructural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant\nlimitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on\nhigh-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also\nrequire multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical\ndeployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables\nend-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative\ngraph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree\nsegmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through\ndedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology\nreasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf\nconditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and\ndata sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results\ndemonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in\nleaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with\npartial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the\nproposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,\nnon-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on\nspecialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to\nTLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,\nend-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement\nsubstantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the\nway for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.",

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation is emerging as a powerful paradigm that directly\ngenerates item predictions, moving beyond traditional matching-based\napproaches. However, current methods face two key challenges: token-item\nmisalignment, where uniform token-level modeling ignores item-level granularity\nthat is critical for collaborative signal learning, and semantic-collaborative\nsignal entanglement, where collaborative and semantic signals exhibit distinct\ndistributions yet are fused in a unified embedding space, leading to\nconflicting optimization objectives that limit the recommendation performance.\nTo address these issues, we propose DiscRec, a novel framework that enables\nDisentangled Semantic-Collaborative signal modeling with flexible fusion for\ngenerative Recommendation. First, DiscRec introduces item-level position\nembeddings, assigned based on indices within each semantic ID, enabling\nexplicit modeling of item structure in input token sequences. Second, DiscRec\nemploys a dual-branch module to disentangle the two signals at the embedding\nlayer: a semantic branch encodes semantic signals using original token\nembeddings, while a collaborative branch applies localized attention restricted\nto tokens within the same item to effectively capture collaborative signals. A\ngating mechanism subsequently fuses both branches while preserving the model's\nability to model sequential dependencies. Extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that DiscRec effectively decouples these\nsignals and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

However, most existing\nmethods focus on 1 m imagery and rely heavily on large-scale annotations, while\nUHSR data remain scarce and difficult to annotate, limiting practical\napplicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Baltimore Atlas, a\nUHSR land cover classification framework that reduces reliance on large-scale\ntraining data and delivers high-accuracy results. Baltimore Atlas builds on\nthree key ideas: (1) Baltimore Atlas Dataset, a 0.3 m resolution dataset based\non aerial imagery of Baltimore City; (2) FreqWeaver Adapter, a\nparameter-efficient adapter that transfers SAM2 to this domain, leveraging\nfoundation model knowledge to reduce training data needs while enabling\nfine-grained detail and structural modeling; (3) Uncertainty-Aware Teacher\nStudent Framework, a semi-supervised framework that exploits unlabeled data to\nfurther reduce training dependence and improve generalization across diverse\nscenes. Using only 5.96% of total model parameters, our approach achieves a\n1.78% IoU improvement over existing parameter-efficient tuning strategies and a\n3.44% IoU gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing\nsegmentation methods on the Baltimore Atlas Dataset.",

The Standard Model (SM) of white matter\naims to disentangle dMRI signal contributions from intra- and extra-axonal\nwater compartments. However, due to the model its high-dimensional nature,\nextensive acquisition protocols with multiple b-values and diffusion tensor\nshapes are typically required to mitigate parameter degeneracies. Even then,\naccurate estimation remains challenging due to noise. This work introduces a\nnovel estimation framework based on implicit neural representations (INRs),\nwhich incorporate spatial regularization through the sinusoidal encoding of the\ninput coordinates. The INR method is evaluated on both synthetic and in vivo\ndatasets and compared to parameter estimates using cubic polynomials,\nsupervised neural networks, and nonlinear least squares. Results demonstrate\nsuperior accuracy of the INR method in estimating SM parameters, particularly\nin low signal-to-noise conditions. Additionally, spatial upsampling of the INR\ncan represent the underlying dataset anatomically plausibly in a continuous\nway, which is unattainable with linear or cubic interpolation. The INR is fully\nunsupervised, eliminating the need for labeled training data. It achieves fast\ninference ($\\sim$6 minutes), is robust to both Gaussian and Rician noise,\nsupports joint estimation of SM kernel parameters and the fiber orientation\ndistribution function with spherical harmonics orders up to at least 8 and\nnon-negativity constraints, and accommodates spatially varying acquisition\nprotocols caused by magnetic gradient non-uniformities.

Carbon cycle extremes represent large anomalies in\nthe carbon cycle that are associated with gains or losses in carbon uptake.\nCarbon cycle extremes could be continuous in space and time and cross political\nboundaries. Here, we present a methodology to identify large spatiotemporal\nextremes (STEs) in the terrestrial carbon cycle using image processing tools\nfor feature detection. We characterized the STE events based on neighborhood\nstructures that are three-dimensional adjacency matrices for the detection of\nspatiotemporal manifolds of carbon cycle extremes.

    "abstract": "Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling\nalternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training\nand inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a\nPareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but\noffer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller\nwindows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and\nMistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining\nlength) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift\nthis Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains\neven in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic\nlimitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the\ndefined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated\nwith a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information\nfrom these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B\nscales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between\nperformance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of\njust 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across\ndiverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear\nattention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context\nperformance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements\ndo not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel\nimplementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training\nspeeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

Using a combination of scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM), DC and AC magnetization, and magneto-transport\nmeasurements, we reveal that intrinsic Mn Bi antisite defects induce strong\ninterlayer exchange coupling, giving rise to a robust exchange bias observed in\nboth magnetic and Hall responses. The exchange bias undergoes a transition from\nasymmetric to symmetric behavior between 2 K and 6 K, indicating a temperature\ndriven dynamical reconfiguration of interfacial spin structures. The training\neffect analysis revealed a stronger contribution of frozen spins at 2 K\ncompared to 6 K, with relaxation amplitude shift from -264 Oe to 306 Oe. This\nsign reversal indicates a field-induced change in interfacial coupling. The\ntemperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity and magnetization reveals\ncomplementary behavior, indicating the coexistence of two distinct spin states\nnear the magnetic transition temperature. The phase fraction based resistivity\nmodel captures the distinct scattering mechanisms that govern electronic\ntransport across different magnetic regimes. Our findings offer a direct link\nbetween microscopic disorder, interfacial magnetism and macroscopic topological\nphenomena in magnetic topological insulators.",

    "abstract": "The workspace limits the operational capabilities and range of motion for the\nsystems with robotic arms. Maximizing workspace utilization has the potential\nto provide more optimal solutions for aerial manipulation tasks, increasing the\nsystem's flexibility and operational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel planning framework for aerial grasping that maximizes workspace\nutilization. We formulate an optimization problem to optimize the aerial\nmanipulator's trajectory, incorporating task constraints to achieve efficient\nmanipulation. To address the challenge of incorporating the delta arm's\nnon-convex workspace into optimization constraints, we leverage a Multilayer\nPerceptron (MLP) to map position points to feasibility\nprobabilities.Furthermore, we employ Reversible Residual Networks (RevNet) to\napproximate the complex forward kinematics of the delta arm, utilizing\nefficient model gradients to eliminate workspace constraints. We validate our\nmethods in simulations and real-world experiments to demonstrate their\neffectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in\nneural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.\nCurrent feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited\nrobustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single\nconcept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often\npolysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature\ndescriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors\nencoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe\nIdentification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the\ninherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that\nassign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced\ndescriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to\nlanguage models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,\ndemonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature\ndescriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description\nscore) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is\npresent (via a polysemanticity score).",

    "abstract": "In the interstellar medium (ISM), polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are\nbelieved to be an important carbon reservoir, accounting for up to a quarter of\nall interstellar carbon in our galaxy. This makes the investigation of their\npotential formation precursors highly relevant in the context of ISM chemistry.\nThis, in turn, includes knowing the abundance of the precursor species. One of\nthe possible precursor molecules for PAHs is the recently detected\ncyanocyclopentadiene, c-C$_5$H$_5$CN. Given the physical conditions of the\ndense dark molecular cloud TMC-1 where the cyclic species was detected, it is\ncrucial to consider that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions may not be\nsatisfied. In such case an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance\ninvolves taking into account the competition between the radiative and\ncollisional processes, which requires the knowledge of rotational excitation\ndata for collisions with the most abundant interstellar species - He or H$_2$.\nIn this paper the first potential energy surface (PES) for the interaction of\nthe most stable isomer of cyanocyclopentadiene (1-cyano-1,3-cyclopentadiene)\nwith He atoms is computed using the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster\ntheory [CCSD(T)-F12]. The obtained PES demonstrates a high anisotropy and is\ncharacterized by a global potential well of -101.8 cm$^{-1}$. Scattering\ncalculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of 1-cyano-cyclopentadiene\ninduced by He atoms are performed with the quantum mechanical close-coupling\nmethod for total energies up to 125 cm$^{-1}$. The resulting rotational\nstate-to-state cross sections are used to compute the corresponding rate\ncoefficients for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favoring the transitions\nwith $\\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.",

However, controlling the generation\nprocess to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.\nEven a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can\ndrastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the\napplication of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.\nSpecifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained\ntext-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the\nunderlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the\noverall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,\nand finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen\nintermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a\nbalance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the\ndesired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the\ntext-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's\nspeed.",

We review the infinite-spin limit of three-point\namplitudes along the leading Regge trajectory, which differ from\n$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Kerr}}$, and we provide evidence that any sub-leading trajectory\nparallel to the leading one give the same result. We extend the above\ninvestigation to the simplest sub-leading trajectory not parallel to the\nleading one, containing physical states with the first two harmonics. We\ncompute all three-point amplitudes involving two such states and a massless\nvector, using both covariant and DDF formalism, and we extract the associated\nclassical infinite-spin limit. Inspired by the leading Regge case, where this\nlimit reproduces the classical electromagnetic current sourced by a rigid\nrotating string, we derive new classical string solutions containing the first\ntwo harmonics and compare the currents they source to the infinite-spin\namplitude of the two-harmonic state. We do not see a matching between the two\napproaches, and we find that the classical behaviour is instead reproduced by\nthe amplitude involving coherent string states. We conclude this paper by\ndiscussing common patterns between the different amplitudes we considered, and\nwe conjecture how they can be generalised to reproduce $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Kerr}}$.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary graph theory is the study of evolutionary dynamics in structured\npopulations. A well-known problem in evolutionary graph theory is that the\nspread of mutation (measured by fixation probability) is impacted by the graph\ntype chosen and the update rule. For example, the star graph is an amplifier of\nnatural selection under the birth-death with fitness on birth (Bd) update rule\nbut a suppressor of natural selection under the death-birth with fitness on\nbirth (dB) update rule. A continuous-time EGT model has been found to replicate\nBd and dB results as special cases. Using this model, we show that changing the\nnatural (intrinsic) death rate can cause a shift from Bd to dB dynamics.\nAssuming the mutant is advantageous, we show that if the natural death rate is\ngreater than $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$ the star is a suppressor, where $N$ is the\nnumber of nodes. As $N \\longrightarrow \\infty$, the natural death rate required\nto drive the star to a suppressor tends towards zero, so as the size of the\ngraph increases, the star graph is likely to be suppressing for any non-zero\nnatural death rate.",

Given their vast scale, even minor performance enhancements can\nlead to significant cost reductions. In this paper, we introduce Atys1, an\nefficient profiling framework specifically designed to identify hotspot\nfunctions within large-scale distributed services. Atys presents four key\nfeatures. First, it implements a language-agnostic adaptation mechanism for\nmultilingual microservices. Second, a two-level aggregation method is\nintroduced to provide a comprehensive overview of flamegraphs. Third, we\npropose a function selective pruning (FSP) strategy to enhance the efficiency\nof aggregating profiling results. Finally, we develop a frequency dynamic\nadjustment (FDA) scheme that dynamically modifies sampling frequency based on\nservice status, effectively minimizing profiling cost while maintaining\naccuracy. Cluster-scale experiments on two benchmarks show that the FSP\nstrategy achieves a 6.8% reduction in time with a mere 0.58% mean average\npercentage error (MAPE) in stack traces aggregation. Additionally, the FDA\nscheme ensures that the mean squared error (MSE) remains on par with that at\nhigh sampling rates, while achieving an 87.6% reduction in cost.",

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with\ncitation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently\nfail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,\nciting incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we\nexplore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance\ngrounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method\nto train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer\ncorrectness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold\nreasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments\nacross ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented\nmodels significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in\nhandling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage\ntraining setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,\nfurther improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we\nrevisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it\nwith GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our\nfindings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and\noutcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.",

While extensively studied theoretically, direct experimental\nevidence of 2D KPZ scaling has remained limited to interface growth so far.\nHere, we report the observation of universal scaling consistent with the KPZ\nuniversality class in 2D exciton-polariton condensates -- quantum fluids of\nlight that are inherently driven and dissipative, thus breaking equilibrium\nconditions. Using momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as\nspace- and time-resolved interferometry, we probe the phase correlations across\nmicroscopically different systems, varying drive conditions in two distinct\nlattice geometries. Our analysis reveals correlation dynamics and scaling\nexponents in excellent agreement with 2D KPZ predictions.

In contrast, time-bin\nencoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD\nsystems using weak coherent laser pulses.

First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement\nwith inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound\n$\\text{K}_2\\text{Co}(\\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a\nroton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory,\naccompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\\Gamma$\npoint, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral\nweight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the\nobserved features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i)\nan effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii)\nperturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a\nself-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework\nis based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined\nwith a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the\n$M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\\Gamma$, whereas the QDM\nreproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near\n$\\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state\nexhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse\nphoton-like excitations.

    "abstract": "Automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) remains a challenging task in the field\nof music information retrieval, despite great advances in automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) brought about by transformer-based architectures in recent\nyears. One of the major challenges in ALT is the high amplitude of interfering\naudio signals relative to conventional ASR due to musical accompaniment. Recent\nadvances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of\nhigh-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance.\nHowever, the effect of source separation has not been systematically\ninvestigated in order to establish best practices for its use. This work\nexamines the impact of source separation on ALT using Whisper, a\nstate-of-the-art open source ASR model. We evaluate Whisper's performance on\noriginal audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems across short-form and\nlong-form transcription tasks. For short-form, we suggest a concatenation\nmethod that results in a consistent reduction in Word Error Rate (WER). For\nlong-form, we propose an algorithm using source separation as a vocal activity\ndetector to derive segment boundaries, which results in a consistent reduction\nin WER relative to Whisper's native long-form algorithm. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art results for an open source system on the Jam-ALT long-form ALT\nbenchmark, without any training or fine-tuning. We also publish MUSDB-ALT, the\nfirst dataset of long-form lyric transcripts following the Jam-ALT guidelines\nfor which vocal stems are publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for\nupdating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external\ninformation. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass\nthe retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce\nRetrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects\nsuch behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two\ninference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a\nretrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by\ncomputing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output\ndistributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal\nimpact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,\nrequires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single\nadditional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the\nKL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the\nPrompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result\noutperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping\nlatency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,\nblack-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages\nretrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a sequential ensemble methodology for epidemic modeling\nthat integrates discrete-time Hawkes processes (DTHP) and\nSusceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) models. Motivated by the need for\naccurate and reliable epidemic forecasts to inform timely public health\ninterventions, we develop a flexible model averaging (MA) framework using\nSequential Monte Carlo Squared. While generating estimates from each model\nindividually, our approach dynamically assigns them weights based on their\nincrementally estimated marginal likelihoods, accounting for both model and\nparameter uncertainty to produce a single ensemble estimate. We assess the\nmethodology through simulation studies mimicking abrupt changes in epidemic\ndynamics, followed by an application to the Irish influenza and COVID-19\noutbreaks. Our results show that combining the two models can improve both\nestimates of the infection trajectory and reproduction number compared to using\neither model alone. Moreover, the MA consistently produces more stable and\ninformative estimates of the time-varying reproduction number, with credible\nintervals that maintain appropriate coverage. These features are particularly\nvaluable in high-uncertainty contexts where reliable situational awareness is\nessential. This research contributes to pandemic preparedness by enhancing\nforecast reliability and supporting more informed public health responses.",

Here, we overcome this\ndichotomy by introducing a high-resolution scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy (HRSTEM) method that enables full structural discrimination of\ninclined stacking faults in fcc and $L1_2$ crystals. This approach eliminates a\nlong-standing geometric constraint on high-resolution analysis, providing\ncomprehensive access to stacking faults on all glide planes along the widely\nused [001] and [110] zone axes. We demonstrate the robustness of the method in\na CoNi-based superalloy, achieving clear discrimination of fault types even in\noverlapping configurations and foil thicknesses exceeding 100 nm. Simulations\nreveal that fault-induced de-channeling is key to contrast formation and is\nstrongly governed by the fault's depth within the sample. Leveraging this\neffect, we further establish a route to artificially generate ultrathin TEM\nlamellae - bounded by the stacking fault itself - thereby enhancing contrast\nfor atomic-scale studies of long-range ordering, compositional fluctuations,\nand nanoclustering.",

    "abstract": "At the moment, one of the main ways to infer the disk mass is to use a\ncombination of CO isotopologue line observations. A number of theoretical\nstudies have concluded that CO must be a reliable gas tracer as its relative\nabundance depends on disk parameters only weakly. However, the observed line\nfluxes cannot always be easily used to infer the column density, much less the\nabundance of CO. The aim of this work is to study the dependence of the CO\nisotopologue millimeter line fluxes on the astrochemical model parameters of a\nstandard protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star and to conclude whether they\nor their combinations can be reliably used to determine disk parameters. Our\ncase is set apart from earlier studies in the literature by the usage of a\ncomprehensive chemical network with grain surface chemistry together with line\nradiative transfer. We use the astrochemical model ANDES together with the\nradiative transfer code RADMC-3D to simulate CO isotopologue line fluxes from a\nset of disks with varying key parameters (disk mass, disk radius, stellar mass,\nand inclination). We study how these values change with one parameter varying\nand others fixed and approximate the dependences log-linearly. We describe the\ndependences of CO isotopologue fluxes on all chosen disk parameters. Physical\nand chemical processes responsible for these dependences are analyzed and\nexplained for each parameter. We show that using a combination of the $^{13}$CO\nand C$^{18}$O line fluxes, the mass can be estimated only within two orders of\nmagnitude uncertainty and characteristic radius within one order of magnitude\nuncertainty. We find that inclusion of grain surface chemistry reduces\n$^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O fluxes which can explain the underestimation of disk\nmass in the previous studies.",

Our method uses\na novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive\nestimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between\nrealizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants.\nSignificantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent\nprobability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value\nof the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally,\nthe input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a\nsecond-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of\nthe logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the\ntime-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic\nexcitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a\nrandom vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we\ngenerate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants.\nSubsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte\nCarlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the\nnecessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit\napproximation to the time-dependent probability density function through\napplications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical\nexperiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex\ntime-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively\nto moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among\nreal-world data.",

To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation\nwith Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that\nenables efficient per-step annotation by jointly aligning solution steps to\nreference solutions and determine its accuracy with explicit reasoning in\nsingle generation. We demonstrate SPARE's effectiveness across four diverse\ndatasets spanning mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH), multi-hop question\nanswering (MuSiQue-Ans), and spatial reasoning (SpaRP), showing consistent\nimprovements in two applications: (1) training Process Reward Models (PRMs) for\nranking and aggregating multiple generations, and (2) fine-tuning models via\noffline reinforcement learning for greedy decoding. On ProcessBench, SPARE\ndemonstrates data-efficient out-of-distribution generalization, using only\n$\\sim$16% of training samples compared to human-labeled and other synthetically\ntrained baselines. Additionally, it achieves competitive performance with\nMCTS-based methods while offering 2.3$\\times$ speedup in terms of total token\ncount.

As a consequence, competition happens between shortening\nthe gate time and decreasing the excitation probability of Rydberg states. For\nthe case of Rydberg blockade, it is found that the gate time is irrelevant of\nthe Rydberg interaction strength. In contrast, for the case of weak Rydberg\ninteractions, the interactions will help to accelerate the two-qubit gates.\nThis implies that the scheme of weak Rydberg interactions will be faster than\nthe Rydberg blockade one to realize the two-qbuit gates under the same Rabi\nfrequencies of Rydberg excitation.

In the\ninitial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct\nsparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI\ndatasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.\nSubsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the\nsecond stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely\ntemporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D\nHOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to\nextract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention\nto effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.\nExperimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the\npublicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong\ngeneralization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI\ngeneration.",

Our experiments\ndemonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both\ntextual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In\nthe text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11\ninformation-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding\ntechniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's\nLLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four\nbenchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.\nThis improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Accurate volumetric velocity estimation in ultrasound imaging is crucial for\napplications in diagnostic and therapeutic medicine. Traditional ultrasound\nsystems, while effective in two-dimensional imaging, face significant\nchallenges in achieving 3D imaging due to hardware and computational demands.\nRow-column addressed (RCA) ultrasound probes present a promising alternative,\nreducing hardware complexity, thus contributing to bridge the gap between\nresearch and clinical systems. Yet, this usually comes at the cost of lower\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduced sensitivity and stronger sidelobes\ncompared to 3D matrices, even though recent methods have tried to tackle the\nlater issue. In this study, we introduce a method to use the phase of the\nsignals acquired by rows and columns of RCA arrays to compute a new velocity\nestimator based on cross correlation of orthogonal apertures, extending the\nXDoppler scheme initially introduced for power Doppler imaging to the\nestimation of velocities. Our results indicate that XDoppler estimator can\nmeasure faithfully axial velocities (RMSE=9.21%, R2=0.88) and outperforms the\ntraditional phase shift autocorrelator with a theoretical Nyquist velocity\ntwice higher. Moreover, the in vitro data indicate a better sensitivity to flow\nvelocities below 10mm/s and a lower bias for flow rate estimation (-0.17mL/min\nas opposed to -9.33mL/min for reference method). In vivo data acquired on a\ncarotid artery confirm the reduced sensitivity to aliasing effects and show\nthat this new technique can dynamically follow blood velocity evolutions linked\nto arterial pulsatility. This suggests that this new estimator could be of use\nfor improved volumetric blood velocity imaging with a RCA probe.",

Unlike traditional\nAI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the\nchallenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We\nempirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the\nMetropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference\nmechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention\nnaming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,\nalways-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that\nhuman-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization\naccuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared\nsign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the\nMH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical\nevidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based\ninteraction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that\nlearn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual\nexperiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.",

DF and FBR remain constant with the varying number of quantization bits.\nAdditionally, SDN is shown to be frequency-independent, however, it increases\nwith increasing quantization bit depths, enhancing interference suppression.\nThe study also examines the effect of steering nulls across the azimuthal\nrange, showing that SDN degrades as the null moves closer to the source look\ndirection (0 degree), indicating reduced interference suppression.",

The atmospheric and asteroseismic\nparameters were sourced from the recently released KEYSTONE catalogue and\nmatched to Gaia DR3 and TESS Input Catalog v8.2. We computed SBCR-based radii\nusing two different SBCRs, and estimated their relative differences with\nrespect to radius estimates from asteroseismic grid-based methods. We find a\ngood agreement between SBCR and asteroseismic radii, with mean relative\ndifferences in radii ($E_g$) in the range 2% to 3% and a standard deviation of\nabout 3%. We find no dependence on parallax, and a mild dependence on [Fe/H]\nfor one of the SBCRs tested. We find a negative correlation between $E_g$ and\nthe stellar mass, with a slope varying from $-0.051\\pm0.016$ to\n$-0.039\\pm0.014$ per solar mass. This change in slope led to a roughly 1.5%\nlarger discrepancy in the $E_g$ estimates for stars with masses below 1.0\n$M_{\\odot}$. This larger discrepancy at the low-mass end supports conclusions\ndrawn from giant star studies. This result is independently corroborated by the\nLEGACY sample, which uses Kepler photometry. For the LEGACY sample we measure a\nmean relative offset in $E_g$ of -1.4% with a standard deviation of 2.3%, and a\ndependence of $E_g$ on mass with a slope of $-0.052\\pm0.011$ per mass unit,\nboth fully consistent with the KEYSTONE analysis. The [...] apparent mass\ndependence still requires closer examination. This result is reassuring as it\ndemonstrates the great accuracy and reliability of the radius estimates\nobtained through SBCRs, which, moreover, offer the significant advantage of\nbeing applicable to a large sample of stars with substantially lower time and\ncosts compared to what is required by asteroseismology.",

    "abstract": "Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple\non-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization.\nThe inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the\noperator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the\nmodel. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use\ncheckpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an\nadditional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield\nsignificant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases\nand scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,\nCheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by\na weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state\nof the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,\nbecause of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover\nfailures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+\nwith out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last\nstages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is\nmimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by\nsimply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover\nthe (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring\nstages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively\nevaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with\nvarying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates\n(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant\ncomputation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%.

However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise\nfrom true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by\nthe ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,\ninterventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a\nframework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside\nan automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the\nhierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,\nRE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using\nmemorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across\nreasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our\nframework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,\nand observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem\nvariations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical\nrecall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting\nskills across the reasoning hierarchy.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of three dominant parallel\nprogramming models in High Performance Computing (HPC): Message Passing\nInterface (MPI), Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), and Compute Unified Device\nArchitecture (CUDA). Selecting optimal programming approaches for modern\nheterogeneous HPC architectures has become increasingly critical. We\nsystematically analyze these models across multiple dimensions: architectural\nfoundations, performance characteristics, domain-specific suitability,\nprogramming complexity, and recent advancements. We examine each model's\nstrengths, weaknesses, and optimization techniques. Our investigation\ndemonstrates that MPI excels in distributed memory environments with\nnear-linear scalability for communication-intensive applications, but faces\ncommunication overhead challenges. OpenMP provides strong performance and\nusability in shared-memory systems and loop-centric tasks, though it is limited\nby shared memory contention. CUDA offers substantial performance gains for\ndata-parallel GPU workloads, but is restricted to NVIDIA GPUs and requires\nspecialized expertise. Performance evaluations across scientific simulations,\nmachine learning, and data analytics reveal that hybrid approaches combining\ntwo or more models often yield optimal results in heterogeneous environments.\nThe paper also discusses implementation challenges, optimization best\npractices, and emerging trends such as performance portability frameworks,\ntask-based programming, and the convergence of HPC and Big Data.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal surfing aquatic-aerial vehicle, SurfAAV, which efficiently\nintegrates underwater navigation, surface gliding, and aerial flying\ncapabilities. Thanks to the design of the novel differential thrust vectoring\nhydrofoil, SurfAAV can achieve efficient surface gliding and underwater\nnavigation without the need for a buoyancy adjustment system. This design\nprovides flexible operational capabilities for both surface and underwater\ntasks, enabling the robot to quickly carry out underwater monitoring\nactivities. Additionally, when it is necessary to reach another water body,\nSurfAAV can switch to aerial mode through a gliding takeoff, flying to the\ntarget water area to perform corresponding tasks. The main contribution of this\nletter lies in proposing a new solution for underwater, surface, and aerial\nmovement, designing a novel hybrid prototype concept, developing the required\ncontrol laws, and validating the robot's ability to successfully perform\nsurface gliding and gliding takeoff. SurfAAV achieves a maximum surface gliding\nspeed of 7.96 m/s and a maximum underwater speed of 3.1 m/s.

In this paper, we concentrate in the\ncase where the deformation term dominates the collision term for large times\n(hyperbolic-dominated regime).

In such a\nhyperbolic-dominated regime, it appears challenging to provide a clear\ndescription of the long-term asymptotics of the solutions.

Furthermore, we provide a probabilistic interpretation\ndescribing a stochastic process consisting in a combination of collisions and\nshear flows.

Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a\nsimilar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent\nthe homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does\nnot hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in\nreal-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily\nLearning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns.

AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters\nthat capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with\nvarying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node\nattributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise\nand cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned\nby the filters in the two views.

Despite the\ndevelopment of several groundbreaking models that have revolutionized 3D\ngeneration, the field remains largely accessible only to researchers,\ndevelopers, and designers due to the complexities involved in collecting,\nprocessing, and training 3D models. To address these challenges, we introduce\nHunyuan3D 2.1 as a case study in this tutorial. This tutorial offers a\ncomprehensive, step-by-step guide on processing 3D data, training a 3D\ngenerative model, and evaluating its performance using Hunyuan3D 2.1, an\nadvanced system for producing high-resolution, textured 3D assets. The system\ncomprises two core components: the Hunyuan3D-DiT for shape generation and the\nHunyuan3D-Paint for texture synthesis. We will explore the entire workflow,\nincluding data preparation, model architecture, training strategies, evaluation\nmetrics, and deployment. By the conclusion of this tutorial, you will have the\nknowledge to finetune or develop a robust 3D generative model suitable for\napplications in gaming, virtual reality, and industrial design.",

To overcome this limitation, we introduce\n$lm$-SCMs and $lm$-graphs, which extend $m$-graphs by integrating a label set\nthat represents relevant context-specific independencies (CSI), accounting for\nmechanism shifts induced by missingness. We define two causal effects within\nthese systems: the Full Average Treatment Effect (FATE), which reflects the\neffect in a hypothetical scenario had no data been missing, and the Natural\nAverage Treatment Effect (NATE), which captures the effect under the unaltered\nCSIs in the system. We propose recovery criteria for these queries and present\ndoubly-robust estimators for a graphical model inspired by a real-world\napplication. Simulations highlight key differences between these estimands and\nestimation methods.

    "abstract": "Developing accurate and reliable Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures is\nbecoming a key research focus to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks\non hardware, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In that regard, there\nhas been significant interest in analog and mixed-signal CIM architectures\naimed at increasing the efficiency of data storage and computation to handle\nthe massive amount of data needed by DNNs. Specifically, resistive mixed-signal\nCIM cores are pushed by recent progresses in emerging Non-Volatile Memory\n(eNVM) solutions. Yet, mixed-signal CIM computing cores still face several\nintegration and reliability challenges that hinder their large-scale adoption\ninto end-to-end AI computing systems. In terms of integration, resistive and\neNVM-based CIM cores need to be integrated with a control processor to realize\nend-to-end AI acceleration. Moreover, SRAM-based CIM architectures are still\nmore efficient and easier to program than their eNVM counterparts. In terms of\nreliability, analog circuits are more susceptible to variations, leading to\ncomputation errors and degraded accuracy. This work addresses these two\nchallenges by proposing a self-calibrated mixed-signal CIM accelerator SoC,\nfabricated in 22-nm FDSOI technology. The integration is facilitated by (1) the\nCIM architecture, combining the density and ease of SRAM-based weight storage\nwith multi-bit computation using linear resistors, and (2) an open-source\nprogramming and testing strategy for CIM systems. The accuracy and reliability\nare enabled through an automated RISC-V controlled on-chip calibration,\nallowing us to improve the compute SNR by 25 to 45% across multiple columns to\nreach 18-24 dB. To showcase further integration possibilities, we show how our\nproof-of-concept SoC can be extended to recent high-density linear resistor\ntechnologies for enhanced computing performance.",

To mitigate this issue, we propose Sonic4D, a novel framework that\nenables spatial audio generation for immersive exploration of 4D scenes.\nSpecifically, our method is composed of three stages: 1) To capture both the\ndynamic visual content and raw auditory information from a monocular video, we\nfirst employ pre-trained expert models to generate the 4D scene and its\ncorresponding monaural audio. 2) Subsequently, to transform the monaural audio\ninto spatial audio, we localize and track the sound sources within the 4D\nscene, where their 3D spatial coordinates at different timestamps are estimated\nvia a pixel-level visual grounding strategy. 3) Based on the estimated sound\nsource locations, we further synthesize plausible spatial audio that varies\nacross different viewpoints and timestamps using physics-based simulation.\nExtensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method generates\nrealistic spatial audio consistent with the synthesized 4D scene in a\ntraining-free manner, significantly enhancing the immersive experience for\nusers.

A key challenge\nis achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like\ntranslation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces\nTargeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.\nWe first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits\nstrong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its\nearly internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine\nsimilarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its\nfinal output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).\nTLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a\ncontrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting\nembeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our\nexperiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical\nalignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine\nsimilarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More\nimportantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control\nword pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17\nx 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve\nand propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a\nparameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in\nLRL-focused LLMs.",

Second, it necessitates a\nquantum-to-classical transition in which fluctuations of a homogeneous quantum\nstate become the classical inhomogeneities seen in the CMB. Recently, an\nalternative paradigm has been proposed in which such inhomogeneities are\npresent from the very beginning, emerging from the assumed discreteness of\nspacetime at the Planck scale predicted by certain approaches to quantum\ngravity. Within this framework, scale-invariant scalar perturbations are\ngenerated naturally, without relying on trans-Planckian assumptions or invoking\na quantum-to-classical transition. Specifically, inhomogeneities in the quantum\nstate at the Planck scale propagate into semiclassical inhomogeneities on CMB\nscales.

However, to ensure their usefulness and\ntrustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the\ngrowing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation\nprotocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct\na systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for\nSystematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a\nunified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant\npublications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar\nmetric groups.

The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven\nto be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical\nimaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag\npotential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD\ndetection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works\nsuggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,\nwe propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages\nneuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster\nneuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form\nrepresentative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify\na new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.\nAdditionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the\nbias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable\nOOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning\narchitectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and\nGastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection\nmethods.",

While\nprevious works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked\nto the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that\nthe graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we\nconsider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled\nby an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and\nonly the infection states of the vertices are observed.

Furthermore, we prove that the initial data of these\n\\textit{admissible} solutions are dense in $B^{\\gamma}_{\\infty,r<\\infty}$.\n  Our approach introduces a new class of traveling waves, refining the\ntraditional temporal oscillation function first proposed by Cheskidov and Luo\n[Invent. Math., 229(3), 2022], to effectively modulate energy on any time\nintervals. Additionally, we propose a novel ``multiple iteration scheme''\ncombining Newton-Nash iteration with a Picard-type iteration to generate an\nenergy corrector for controlling total kinetic energy during the perturbation\nstep. This framework enables us to construct dissipative weak solutions below\nthe Onsager critical exponent in any dimension $d \\geq 2$.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced\noperational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while\nsubstantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,\nsingle-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor\nmeasuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical\ndiagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures\nassociated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections\ncaused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,\nthe limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,\nrequiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.\nIn high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a\nconstrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture\ndetails in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain\nis required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog\nsignal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors\ncollectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic\nimages. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image\nsensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:\nfixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.\nBuilding on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that\nsynergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced\nlearning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine\ndetail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA\nplatforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test\ndataset.",

Majority of the existing\nefforts to construct an approximate kinetic energy density for atomic systems\nuses homogeneous electron gas as the bedrock of their formalism.

    "abstract": "We study the unconstrained and the minimax saddle point variants of the\nconvex multi-stage stochastic programming problem, where consecutive decisions\nare coupled through the objective functions, rather than through the\nconstraints. Based on the analysis of deterministic mirror descent algorithms\nwith inexact gradients, we introduce the idea of \\textit{stochastic conditional\ngradient oracles}, a multi-stage analog of the stochastic gradient oracles used\nin (classical) stochastic programming. We show one approach to construct such\noracles and prove the convergence of the (accelerated) mirror descent\nstochastic approximation, both in expectation and with high probability. To\nfurther reduce the oracle complexity, we view the problem from a\n\\textit{semi-online} perspective, where the stage $t$ decision variables are\nconstructed $s$ stages in advance, instead of before stage $1$. We show that\nthe delay in decision making allows an asynchronous implementation of the\nmirror descent stochastic approximation algorithms. By avoiding computing\nsolutions for scenarios that are inconsistent with information available during\nstage $t$, the complexity is reduced from exponential to linear in the number\nof stages.",

    "abstract": "An effective microscopic model for plasmonic sensing is developed and studied\nin this work. The model is applied to a reference sensor made from a plasmonic\nmetasurface comprised of an array of nanoholes 150 nm in diameter patterned in\na 150 nm thick gold film. The sensor is functionalized to detect plasmodium\nlactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a malaria biomarker. The biochemistry above the\nsensor's metasurface is modelled as stacks of closely packed adlayers. Using\nthe Maxwell Garnett effective medium theory we link the refractive index of the\npLDH biomarker adsorbed layer to the bulk concentration of the biomarker in the\nbuffer. The effective microscopic model we then develop accounts for the\ncombined optical properties of the biochemistry matrix, bound pLDH, and the\nbuffer medium. By simulating the sensor using the finite element method and an\napproximate analytical method, the effective model allows us to determine the\nsensor response, predict binding interactions, and quantify concentration\nchanges on the sensor surface. We calculate the sensor sensitivity for the\nreference sensor and the theoretical limit of detection (LOD) based on spectral\nand transmission sensing interrogation. The lowest LOD calculated based on the\nmodel is 0.02 nM of pLDH, equivalent to 0.70 ng/mL. The effective model is\nquite general and could be applied to other types of plasmonic biosensors and\nbiomarkers of different diseases. It may therefore aid in the design of new\noptical biosensors with improved performance.",

In this case, the question of whether the spin vortex\nground state still exists remains unresolved. The present study aims to explore\nthe impact of microgravity on the formation of the spin vortex state with the\nassistance of an optical plug. To this end, a simple model has been employed to\nprovide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. The Gross-Pitaevskii\nequations are solved by setting the optical plug intensity, adjusting the\noptical plug width, and adjusting the microgravity strength.

Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take\nadvantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the\ncommunication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can\ncommunicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These\nthree desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual\nformulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in\nLan et al.

Here, $\\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of\nupdates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients\nof) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds\non $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive\nanswer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for\nnon-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).",

The analysis is based on a probabilistic approach assuming that\nthe underlying asset price follows the Schwartz one-factor model, where the\nvolatility of log-returns is time-varying. A difficult challenge in this\npricing problem is to solve an analytical formula under the assumption of\ntime-varying log-return volatility, resulting in the realized variance being\ndistributed according to a linear combination of independent noncentral\nchi-square random variables with weighted parameters. By utilizing the\nprobability density function, we analytically compute the expectation of the\nsquare root of the realized variance and derive pricing formulas for volatility\nswaps.

Its\nexistence remains elusive -- even for four agents with additive utility\nfunctions, it is unknown whether an EFX allocation always exists.\nUnsurprisingly, restricted settings to delineate tractable and intractable\ncases have been explored. Christadolou, Fiat et al.[EC'23] introduced the\nnotion of EFX-orientation, where the agents form the vertices of a graph and\nthe items correspond to edges, and an agent values only the items that are\nincident to it. The goal is to allocate items to one of the adjacent agents\nwhile satisfying the EFX condition.\n  Building on the work of Zeng and Mehta'24, which established a sharp\ncomplexity threshold based on the structure of the underlying graph --\npolynomial-time solvability for bipartite graphs and NP-hardness for graphs\nwith chromatic number at least three -- we further explore the algorithmic\nlandscape of EFX-orientation using parameterized graph algorithms.\n  Specifically, we show that bipartiteness is a surprisingly stringent\ncondition for tractability: EFX orientation is NP-complete even when the\nvaluations are symmetric, binary and the graph is at most two edge-removals\naway from being bipartite. Moreover, introducing a single non-binary value\nmakes the problem NP-hard even when the graph is only one edge removal away\nfrom being bipartite. We further perform a parameterized analysis to examine\nstructures of the underlying graph that enable tractability. In particular, we\nshow that the problem is solvable in linear time on graphs whose treewidth is\nbounded by a constant and that the complexity of an instance is closely tied to\nthe sizes of acyclic connected components on its one-valued edges.",

While Transformer-based models utilizing channel-independence (CI)\nstrategies have demonstrated strong performance in various time series tasks,\nthey often overlook the inter-channel correlations that are critical in\nmultivariate EEG signals. This omission can lead to information degradation and\nreduced prediction accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as neurological\noutcome prediction. To address these challenges, we propose Biaxialformer,\ncharacterized by a meticulously engineered two-stage attention-based framework.\nThis model independently captures both sequence-specific (temporal) and\nchannel-specific (spatial) EEG information, promoting synergy and mutual\nreinforcement across channels without sacrificing CI. By employing joint\nlearning of positional encodings, Biaxialformer preserves both temporal and\nspatial relationships in EEG data, mitigating the interchannel correlation\nforgetting problem common in traditional CI models. Additionally, a\ntokenization module with variable receptive fields balance the extraction of\nfine-grained, localized features and broader temporal dependencies. To enhance\nspatial feature extraction, we leverage bipolar EEG signals, which capture\ninter-hemispheric brain interactions, a critical but often overlooked aspect in\nEEG analysis.

    "abstract": "Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate\ncomplex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within\nNavigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated\nfrom preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically\nprocess all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal\nassociation structure within the data, which may limit the potential for\nfurther improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the\nunique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,\nintroducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional\nsequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware\nNavigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance\nthe agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show\nthat our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and\nsimulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to\nthe Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both\nReinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are widely employed as ans\\\"atze for solving\nvariational problems, where their expressivity directly impacts performance.\nYet, accurately characterizing QNN expressivity remains an open challenge,\nimpeding the optimal design of quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce the\neffective rank, denoted as $\\kappa$, as a novel quantitative measure of\nexpressivity. Specifically, $\\kappa$ captures the number of effectively\nindependent parameters among all the variational parameters in a parameterized\nquantum circuit, thus reflecting the true degrees of freedom contributing to\nexpressivity. Through a systematic analysis considering circuit architecture,\ninput data distributions, and measurement protocols, we demonstrate that\n$\\kappa$ can saturate its theoretical upper bound, $d_n=4^n-1$, for an\n$n$-qubit system when each of the three factors is optimally expressive. This\nresult provides a rigorous framework for assessing QNN expressivity and\nquantifying their functional capacity. Building on these theoretical insights,\nand motivated by the vast and highly structured nature of the circuit design\nspace, we employ $\\kappa$ as a guiding metric for the automated design of\nhighly expressive quantum circuit configurations. To this end, we develop a\nreinforcement learning framework featuring a self-attention transformer agent\nthat autonomously explores and optimizes circuit architectures. By integrating\ntheoretical characterization with practical optimization, our work establishes\n$\\kappa$ as a robust tool for quantifying QNN expressivity and demonstrates the\neffectiveness of reinforcement learning in designing high-performance quantum\ncircuits. This study paves the way for building more expressive QNN\narchitectures, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of quantum machine\nlearning.",

We commence by constructing an analog of a\ntraversable wormhole utilizing the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in conjunction\nwith the Thermofield Double (TFD) state framework, implemented within a quantum\ncircuit. Subsequently, we manipulate various parameters, including temperature\n($\\beta$) and the location of the message qubit, and compare the fidelity\nresult with that of the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM)-based\nwormhole-inspired teleportation protocol. Our findings demonstrate that the\nSYK-based protocol achieves a higher fidelity of states in comparison to the\nTFIM counterpart. We further analyze the protocol for different values of\n$\\beta$ and the SWAP operator. These findings are attributed to the emergence\nof random matrix ensembles via random phase theory within the dynamics of the\nSYK model, which is characterized by pronounced chaotic behavior. A significant\noutcome of our investigation is initializing the message as a two-qubit Bell\nstate, followed by teleportation across the system. We introduce a Pauli\nstabilizer-based fidelity measure to diagnose the teleportation\ncharacteristics. This yields a considerable enhancement in fidelity relative to\nthe single-qubit variant of the protocol.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes RecBayes, a novel approach for ad hoc teamwork under\npartial observability, a setting where agents are deployed on-the-fly to\nenvironments where pre-existing teams operate, that never requires, at any\nstage, access to the states of the environment or the actions of its teammates.\nWe show that by relying on a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained using past\nexperiences, an ad hoc agent is effectively able to identify known teams and\ntasks being performed from observations alone. Unlike recent approaches such as\nPO-GPL (Gu et al., 2021) and FEAT (Rahman et al., 2023), that require at some\nstage fully observable states of the environment, actions of teammates, or\nboth, or approaches such as ATPO (Ribeiro et al., 2023) that require the\nenvironments to be small enough to be tabularly modelled (Ribeiro et al.,\n2023), in their work up to 4.8K states and 1.7K observations, we show RecBayes\nis both able to handle arbitrarily large spaces while never relying on either\nstates and teammates' actions. Our results in benchmark domains from the\nmulti-agent systems literature, adapted for partial observability and scaled up\nto 1M states and 2^125 observations, show that RecBayes is effective at\nidentifying known teams and tasks being performed from partial observations\nalone, and as a result, is able to assist the teams in solving the tasks\neffectively.",

We considered, as a first step, a\nthree-level atom with zero natural broadening. In this work, we present a new\nnumerical scheme. Its initialisation relies on the classic, multi-level\napproximate Lambda-iteration (MALI) method for the standard non-LTE problem.\nThe radiative transfer equations, the kinetic equilibrium equations for atomic\npopulations, and the Boltzmann equations for the velocity distribution\nfunctions were simultaneously iterated in order to obtain self-consistent\nparticle distributions. During the process, the observer's frame absorption and\nemission profiles were re-computed at every iterative step by convolving the\natomic frame quantities with the relevant velocity distribution function. We\nvalidate our numerical strategy by comparing our results with the standard\nnon-LTE solutions in the limit of a two-level atom with Hummer's partial\nredistribution in frequency, and with a three-level atom with complete\nredistribution. In this work, we considered the so-called cross-redistribution\nproblem.

However, in the\nmore practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during\ntraining and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that\nthere is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical\nupper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches\nfor stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in\nthe black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on\nCIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes\nquantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially\nmaintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.",

    "abstract": "Digital Twins (DTs) are becoming increasingly vital for future industrial\napplications, enhancing monitoring, control, and optimization of physical\nassets. This enhancement is made possible by integrating various Digital Models\n(DMs) within DTs, which must interoperate to represent different system aspects\nand fulfill diverse application purposes. However, industry perspectives on the\nchallenges and research needs for integrating these models are rarely obtained.\nThus, this study conducts an expert survey across multiple application domains\nto identify and analyze the challenges in utilizing diverse DMs within DTs. The\nresults reveal missing standardized interfaces, high manual adaptation effort,\nand limited support for model reuse across lifecycle phases, highlighting\nfuture research needs in automated model composition and semantics-based\ninteroperability.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full\nWaveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior\ndistributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these\nmethods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise\nunattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based\nsolutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from\ndiffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting\nfactors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the\napproximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains\nunclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We\naddress the issue by employing a Schr\\\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between\nthe distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate\nthe learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we\nextend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\\\"odinger Bridge\n($\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional\nImage-to-Image Schr\\\"odinger Bridge (c$\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) framework. To\nvalidate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the\nreference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the\nobserved seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion\nmodel suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function\nevaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with\nsupervised learning-based approach.

    "abstract": "We present the first statistical observational study detecting small-scale\nfilaments in the immediate surroundings of galaxies, i.e. the local web of\ngalaxies. Simulations predict that cold gas, the fuel for star formation, is\nchanneled through filamentary structures into galaxies. Yet, direct\nobservational evidence for this process has been limited by the challenge of\nmapping the cosmic web at small scales. Using miniJPAS spectro-photometric data\ncombined with spectroscopic DESI redshifts when available, we construct a\nhigh-density observational galaxy sample spanning 0.2<z<0.8. Local filaments\nare detected within a 3 Mpc physical radius of each galaxy with stellar mass M*\n$> 10^9$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, using other nearby galaxies as tracers and a\nprobabilistic adaptation of the DisPerSE algorithm, designed to overcome\nlimitations due to photometric redshift uncertainties. Our methodology is\ntested and validated using mock catalogues built with random forest models and\nreference lightcone simulations. We recover the expected increase in galaxy\nconnectivity, defined as the number of filaments attached to a galaxy, with\nstellar mass. Interestingly, we find a persistent correlation between\nconnectivity and star formation in medium mass galaxies (M* $= 10^{10-11}$\n$\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$) in the low redshift bins. These results are consistent with\nthe cosmic web detachment scenario, suggesting that reduced connectivity to\nlocal filaments hinders the inflow of star-forming material. We propose galaxy\nconnectivity to local (small-scale) filaments as a powerful and physically\nmotivated metric of environment, offering new insights into the role of cosmic\nstructure in galaxy evolution.",

Our thin-film\nmodel allows for the rupture of films as well as the coalescence of bubbles.\nThe objective is to find the optimal distributed force acting on the topography\nthat minimises the differences between actual and desired thin-film profiles. A\nnonlinear lubrication equation governing the fluid dynamics and appropriate\nfunctional settings for this model are presented. It is also shown that this\nsystem satisfies a global energy-dissipation law for a suitable energy\nfunctional. Optimality conditions are derived for the solution of the\nminimisation problem of a specified cost function across a time horizon. These\nconditions are formulated at a continuous level as a system of coupled,\nforward-backward PDEs, which are subsequently discretised for numerical\ninvestigation. To ensure computational efficiency and stability, first-order\nImplicit-Explicit (IMEX) time-stepping schemes are employed to handle the\nnonlinearities in the model, and a reduced gradient descent algorithm is\napplied to obtain a numerical approximation of the optimal control signal.\nNumerical results illustrate that controlling the thin film, even during\nrupture, achieves a precise film profile. This control strategy accelerates\nconvergence towards a steady state, reduces instabilities, stabilises dewetting\nprocesses, and meets the desired profile specifications.",

When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in\nreal-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous\ntemporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful\napplications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus\non preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order\ngroup interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world\nnetworks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static\nhomogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in\nHTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order\ninteraction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of\nheterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge\nconstruction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a\nnovel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to\nfully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs. HTHGN contains a hierarchical\nattention mechanism module that simultaneously performs temporal\nmessage-passing between heterogeneous nodes and hyperedges to capture rich\nsemantics in a wider receptive field brought by hyperedges. Furthermore, HTHGN\nperforms contrastive learning by maximizing the consistency between low-order\ncorrelated heterogeneous node pairs on HTG to avoid the low-order structural\nambiguity issue. Detailed experimental results on three real-world HTG datasets\nverify the effectiveness of the proposed HTHGN for modeling high-order\ninteractions in HTGs and demonstrate significant performance improvements.",

    "abstract": "Academic paper review typically requires substantial time, expertise, and\nhuman resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising method for\nautomating the review process due to their extensive training data, broad\nknowledge base, and relatively low usage cost. This work explores the\nfeasibility of using LLMs for academic paper review by proposing an automated\nreview system. The system integrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the\nAutoGen multi-agent system, and Chain-of-Thought prompting to support tasks\nsuch as format checking, standardized evaluation, comment generation, and\nscoring. Experiments conducted on 290 submissions from the WASA 2024 conference\nusing GPT-4o show that LLM-based review significantly reduces review time\n(average 2.48 hours) and cost (average \\$104.28 USD). However, the similarity\nbetween LLM-selected papers and actual accepted papers remains low (average\n38.6\\%), indicating issues such as hallucination, lack of independent judgment,\nand retrieval preferences. Therefore, it is recommended to use LLMs as\nassistive tools to support human reviewers, rather than to replace them.",

    "abstract": "We study the Griffiths heights associated to the middle-dimensional\ncohomology of pencils of projective hypersurfaces, by comparing them to heights\ndefined by means of geometric invariant theory (GIT). Kato and Koshikawa have\nconjectured a Northcott property for the Kato heights attached to motives over\nnumber fields, and investigated its consequences. Bounding these Griffiths\nheights in terms of the GIT heights would constitute a geometric counterpart,\nvalid over function fields of characteristic zero, of Kato and Koshikawa's\nconjecture.\n  Part of our results follows from our earlier works on the computation of\nthese Griffiths heights in the case of pencils with generic singularities, and\non semistability criteria for singular projective hypersurfaces, combined with\na general formalism of GIT heights over function fields.\n  We also establish estimates between the Griffiths and GIT heights associated\nto pencils of projective hypersurfaces, which are valid beyond the case of\ngeneric singularities. To achieve this, we establish diverse results of\nindependent interest. Notably we extend our previous computations of Griffiths\nheights to pencils of projective hypersurfaces with semihomogeneous\nsingularities, and we show the lower semicontinuity of the stable Griffiths\nheight attached to polarized variations of Hodge structures over complex\nalgebraic curves.",

They are strictly related to\nthe superposition principle for measure-valued solutions to the continuity\nequation. This paper addresses the extension of these results to the case\n$p=1$, and to curves $\\mu:[0,+\\infty)\\to\\mathcal{P}_1(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ that are\nonly of bounded variation in time: in the corresponding continuity equation,\nthe flux measure\n$\\nu\\in\\mathcal{M}_{loc}([0,+\\infty)\\times\\mathbb{R}^{d};\\mathbb{R}^{d})$ thus\npossesses a non-trivial singular part w.r.t. $\\mu$ in addition to the\nabsolutely continuous part featuring the velocity field. Firstly, we carefully\naddress the relation between curves in ${\\rm\nBV}_{loc}([0,+\\infty);\\mathcal{P}_1(\\mathbb{R}^d))$ and solutions to the\nassociated continuity equation, among which we select those with minimal\nsingular (contribution to the) flux $\\nu$. We show that, with those\ndistinguished solutions it is possible to associate an `auxiliary' continuity\nequation, in an augmented phase space, solely driven by its velocity field. For\nthat continuity equation, a standard version of the superposition principle can\nbe thus obtained. In this way, we derive a first probabilistic representation\nof the pair $(\\mu,\\nu)$ solutions by projection over the time and space\nmarginals. This representation involves Lipschitz trajectories in the augmented\nphase space, reparametrized in time and solving the characteristic system of\nODEs. Finally, for the same pair $(\\mu,\\nu)$ we also prove a superposition\nprinciple in terms of BV curves on the actual time interval, providing a fine\ndescription of their behaviour at jump points.",

We provide a comprehensive theoretical\nstudy to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models\nrecover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit\nunlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can\neffectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of\nthe form $\\sum_{i\\ge 0} a_i (X^\\top X)^iX^\\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting\nfeatures and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero).

Six of these galaxies\nreside in overdense filaments, while the remaining four may trace new distinct\nstructures which will have to be spectroscopically confirmed. These few dusty\ngalaxies dominate the star formation within the overdensity, contributing more\nthan the numerous H$_{\\alpha}$ emitters, and surpassing the cosmic average star\nformation rate density for this epoch. Their properties suggest an accelerated\nevolution that current models and simulations have difficulty reproducing.",

    "abstract": "Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical\ndiagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this\ntask typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both\nexpensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution\nby iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby\nreducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the\nassumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to\ntarget classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often\ncontains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low\nefficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing\nAL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a\nsignificant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these\nchallenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for\npathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language\nModel (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine\ntarget and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select\nIn-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In\nsubsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes\nPrototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic\nSampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a\nquery, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public\npathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's\nperformance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties\nas a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a\nfamily of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm\n(SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to\ntheir sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of\ncoefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal\noperator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite\noptimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish\nbetween two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the\nproximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where\ncomputing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial\nproblem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how\nthe Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal\noperator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that\na slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to\ntackle the computation of the proximal operator.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their\nadaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as\nhealthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training\ndata due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation\n(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to\nprotect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has\nbeen largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant\ncomputational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward\npropagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary\nobstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the\nsubstantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)\nthe inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To\naddress these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework\ndesigned for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a\nforward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations\nand employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax\nattention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and\ncomputational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers\nsubstantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling\nscalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the treatment of varicose veins with aqueous foams, we determine\nthe velocity profiles and yield surface positions for pressure-driven flows of\na Bingham fluid in curved channels, incorporating Navier wall slip to capture\nthe slip behavior of aqueous foams. Assuming a constant pressure gradient --\nconsistent with syringe-driven injection in sclerotherapy -- we reproduce a\nclosed-form analytic solution for the flow in a straight channel, and extend\nthis to a uniformly curved channel consisting of a section of an annulus. We\nfind that increasing the slip length in the curved channel moves the unyielded\nfluid, or plug, towards the inside of the channel and slightly decreases the\nplug width. Channels with a change in curvature are tackled numerically, with a\nprocedure that is validated against the analytic results. We solve for the flow\nof a Bingham fluid in the transition region between a straight and a uniformly\ncurved channel and in a non-uniform sinusoidal channel where the wall curvature\nchanges continuously. We find that there is greater yielding of the fluid in\ncurved channels, caused by an increase in the shear stresses. As the slip\nlength increases, there is a reduction in the area of unyielded fluid in\nregions of high wall curvature. In the context of varicose vein sclerotherapy,\nour results suggest that slip has both positive and negative consequences: it\nreduces the possibility of static regions of foam developing in areas of high\ncurvature in the vein, but also reduces the plug width in general, reducing the\nefficacy with which the foam displaces blood from the vein.",

Magnetization measurements suggest\nthat the ferromagnetically ordered moments of Ho$^{3+}$ ions are oriented at a\ndirection tilted by 50 degrees from the ab-plane at 2K, which rotate largely\ntoward the ab-plane direction upon application of a magnetic field, but hardly\ntoward the c-axis direction. Heat capacity and electrical resistivity\nmeasurements clearly demonstrate that the low-temperature phase transition at\n11 K occurs even under high magnetic fields along the ab-plane direction,\nwhereas it disappears immediately by magnetic fields along the c-axis\ndirection. Moreover, the field-induced crossover phenomenon between FM and PM\nphases near 15 K is found to be more promoted when applying a magnetic field\nalong the ab-plane direction. The resulting magnetic phase diagram reveals that\nin-plane magnetic anisotropy is predominant in the present system, which\ncontradicts the previous report of a spin reorientation phenomenon toward the\nc-axis direction between 11 K and 15 K. Taken together, the present findings\nsuggest the presence of strong competition between in-plane and out-of-plane\nmagnetic anisotropies in HoB$_{2}$, giving rise to the unique FM spin\narrangement.",

Using this picture, we derive that the $n$-point level-$N$\nscattering amplitude shares the same set of zeros as the $n$-point tachyon\namplitude as well as those inherited from it's prescaffold image, i.e.\n$(2^N)n$-point. Doing the same for the super-tachyon amplitude, exposes new\nzeros for the open super-string, which can be viewed as the avatar of\nsupersymmetry.

To achieve key economic goals such as stability of the\nloan market, they devise instead trustless on-chain mechanisms, such as\nrewarding liquidators who repay the loans of under-collateralized borrowers by\nawarding them part of the borrower's collateral. The complexity of these\nincentive mechanisms, combined with their entanglement in low-level\nimplementation details, makes it challenging to precisely assess the structural\nand economic properties of lending protocols, as well as to analyze user\nstrategies and attacks. Crucially, since participation is open to anyone, any\nweaknesses in the incentive mechanism may give rise to unintended emergent\nbehaviours, or even enable adversarial strategies aimed at making profits to\nthe detriment of legit users, or at undermining the stability of the protocol.\nIn this work, we propose a formal model of lending protocols that captures the\nessential features of mainstream platforms, enabling us to identify and prove\nkey properties related to their economic and strategic dynamics.",

It is thereby common to compare\ninterventions among each other and with a control across several, potentially\nhighly correlated, outcome variables. In this context, researchers are\ninterested in identifying effects at both, the global level (across all outcome\nvariables) and the local level (for specific variables). At the same time,\npotential confounding must be accounted for. This leads to the need for\npowerful multiple contrast testing procedures (MCTPs) capable of handling\nmultivariate outcomes and covariates.

Benefiting from the\nchain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning\nproblem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges\nwhen applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms\nbecause they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model\nhallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors,\nleading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose\nPathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology\nexpert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates\nself-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides\nthe MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides\ncomprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By\nincorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT\nreasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that\nassesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through\nCoT, finally determining the reliable answer.

Moreover, we find\nevidence of shock excitation in the nuclear region based on MIR line ratios.

It is crucial to understand the interaction between globular\nclusters (GCs) and the Oort cloud, as close flybys of such massive objects can\nsignificantly disturb the cloud's structure and redirect comets towards the\ninner Solar System. This increases the risk of impacts on Earth. Studying such\nevents can teach us about the evolution and stability of the Solar System, as\nwell as the effect of external gravitational forces on its dynamics over time.\nAims. In our study of the gravitational effects of the flyby of the NGC 7078 or\nM 15 GC on the Oort cloud, we focus on two types of approximation. First, we\ninvestigate the impact on the Sun's orbit during close passages, treating the\nGC as a point mass. At the second stage, we use a complete N-body system\nrepresentation of the GC comprising over one million particles. Methods. We\ncarried out a dynamical study of the gravitational interaction between Oort\ncloud particles and galactic GCs within the time-varying galactic external\npotential. Initially, the GCs are represented as point masses orbiting the\nGalaxy alongside the Sun and the Oort cloud system. Results. Our study reveals\nsignificant variations in the impact of NGC 7078 on the Oort cloud, depending\non whether it is modelled as a point mass or a complete N-body system. The\nN-body system results in much greater stripping of Oort cloud particles, with\nover 52% stripped during a close pass, compared to a few percent in the point\nmass model for a flyby at a large distance (>200 pc) and 36% for a closer 10 pc\npoint mass flyby. The N-body system also causes substantial expansion, with\nparticles spreading over 50 pc from the Sun within 30 Myr after the GC's\ncrossing. This creates a twisted and flattened cloud structure with extended\nouter tails. These stripped cloud particles (more than 10%) spread across the\ngalaxy, reaching distances of up to 16 kpc from the Sun.",

Vu (2006), Uwe Schauz (2008) and Micha\\l{}\nLaso\\'n (2010) exclude more monomials, and recently, Bogdan Nica (2023)\nimproved the result for grids with additional symmetries in their side edges.\nSimeon Ball and Oriol Serra (2009) incorporated the multiplicity of zeros and\ngave Nullstellens\\\"atze for punctured grids, which are sets of the form $X\n\\setminus Y$ with both $X,Y$ grids.\n  We generalize some of these results; in particular, we provide a common\ngeneralization to the results of Schauz and Nica. To this end, we establish\nthat during multivariate polynomial division, certain monomials are unaffected.\nThis also allows us to generalize Pete L. Clark's proof of the nonzero counting\ntheorem by Alon and F\\\"uredi to punctured grids.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopic liver surgery, while minimally invasive, poses significant\nchallenges in accurately identifying critical anatomical structures. Augmented\nreality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on\n2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical\nnavigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise\ndetection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this\npaper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that\nsignificantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery\nprimarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a\nMulti-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture\nsemantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization\n(ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for\nreliable initial proposals. Additionally, we design the Hierarchical Curve\nRefinement (HCR) mechanism to enhance these proposals iteratively through a\nmulti-stage process, capturing fine-grained contextual details from multi-scale\npixel-level features for precise Bezier curve adjustment. Extensive evaluations\non the L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that BCRNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving significant performance improvements. Code\nwill be available.",

This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal\nnetwork features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network\ndesign. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion\nframework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we\nenhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the\nvideo into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used\nfor background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial\ndecoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and\nmulti-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we\nintroduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features. We\nevaluate MSNeRV on HEVC ClassB and UVG datasets for video representation and\ncompression.

The starburst contributes only\n2.9$\\pm$0.5\\% of the total stellar mass, and VCC 479's global star formation\nrate is 0.3 dex lower than typical dwarfs of similar mass. The galaxy is highly\nHI deficient, with most HI gas concentrated within the central 1 kpc and little\nextended HI envelope. The misalignment of the HI velocity field with the\nstellar body is best explained by merger-triggered gas inflow, as seen in our\nsimulations. Our analysis is consistent with a scenario that the majority of HI\ngas of the progenitor galaxies was removed by the cluster environment prior to\nthe final coalescence. The merger concentrates the remaining gas toward the\ngalaxy center, triggering a central starburst. The combined effect of\nenvironment stripping and galaxy merger has transformed VCC 479 into a\nblue-core dwarf undergoing morphological transition from a late-type to an\nearly-type galaxy.",

The argument proceeds\nthrough textual analysis, comparative architecture review, and synthesis of\nneuroscience findings on integration and prediction. Methodologically, the\nstudy combines conceptual analysis, case studies, and normative risk assessment\ninformed by phenomenology and embodied cognition. Technical examples, including\ntransformer self-attention, meta-cognitive agents, and neuromorphic chips,\nillustrate how functional self-modeling can arise without subjective\nexperience. By distinguishing functional from phenomenal consciousness, the\npaper argues that symbol grounding, embodiment, and affective qualia remain\nunresolved barriers to attributing sentience to current AI. Ethical analysis\nexplores risks of premature anthropomorphism versus neglect of future sentient\nsystems; legal implications include personhood, liability, authorship, and\nlabor impacts. Future directions include quantum architectures, embodied\nrobotics, unsupervised world modeling, and empirical tests for non-biological\nphenomenality. The study reframes the \"hard problem\" as a graded and\nincreasingly testable phenomenon, rather than a metaphysical impasse. It\nconcludes that recursive self-referential design enhances capability but does\nnot entail consciousness or justify moral status.

However, modern\nrecommendation systems still struggle to address item cold-start challenges due\nto the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions, which are\nnon-trivial for cold-start items lacking sufficient exposure and feedback.\nLookalike algorithms provide a promising solution by extending feedback for new\nitems based on lookalike users. Traditional lookalike algorithms face such\nlimitations: (1) failing to effectively model the lookalike users and further\nimprove recommendations with the existing rule- or model-based methods; and (2)\nstruggling to utilize the interaction signals and incorporate diverse features\nin modern recommendation systems.\n  Inspired by lookalike algorithms, we propose Next-User Retrieval, a novel\nframework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user\nmodeling. Specifically, we employ a transformer-based model to capture the\nunidirectional relationships among recently interacted users and utilize these\nsequences to generate the next potential user who is most likely to interact\nwith the item. The additional item features are also integrated as prefix\nprompt embeddings to assist the next-user generation. The effectiveness of\nNext-User Retrieval is evaluated through both offline experiments and online\nA/B tests.

Significant recent research\nestablished the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee\nconvergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the\naggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in\nwhether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and\ninvestigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions\nfrom distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone\ndo not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that\nreaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings\ndue to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower\nbound of $\\min\\{\\frac{n-t}{t},\\sqrt{d}\\}$ on the centroid approximation under\nbox validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the\nnumber of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and\n$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower\nbound by an upper bound of $2\\min\\{n,\\sqrt{d}\\}$, by providing a new analysis\nfor the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a\n$\\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the\nexisting lower bound in the literature is tight.

Our method integrates a\ngenerative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict\nstructural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model\npushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to\nlow-vibration solutions.

The prediction of concentration statistics below the\nvelocity length scale is an open problem. Here, we show that when fluid\nagitation is caused by a smooth chaotic flow with weak persistence, the\nevolution of scalar variance can be uniquely related to the stirring and\nspreading properties of the flow and the diffusivity of the scalar. Using the\nspectral description of microscale scalar fluctuations in presence of a\nlarge-scale forcing by Kraichnan (1974), we uncover the link between variance\nproduction and dissipation in a dispersing front. This provides a universal\nclosure for the scalar fluctuation microscale whenever there exists a clear\nseparation between macroscale dispersive forcing and microscale dissipation. We\nvalidate the closure model on high-resolution direct numerical simulation of\nadvection-diffusion in chaotic flows of variable strength and persistence.\nThese findings open a new avenue to predict both conservative and reactive\ntransport in incompletely mixed environments, ranging from porous media flows\nto engineered flows in microfluidic devices.",

The incoherent\nbremsstrahlung is very sensitive to the magnetic moments of nucleons in nuclei.\n(2) According to the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, the nucleon magnetic\nmoments in nuclei are enhanced relative to those in vacuum, originating from\nthe quark structure of nucleons. \\textbf{Purpose} Investigate possibilities of\nobserving quark effects in nuclei by the analysis of bremsstrahlung in nuclear\nreactions. \\textbf{Methods} Analyse the bremsstrahlung cross sections with\nestablished model in proton-nucleus scattering, by extending with inclusion of\nin-medium modified nucleon magnetic moments in nuclei by the QMC model.\n\\textbf{Results} (1) After calibrating the model without the quark effects for\nexperimental data (TAPS Collaboration data for $p + \\isotope[197]{Au}$), we\ncalculate the cross sections and observe the slight difference between the\nspectra for models with and without quark effects. Such result is found for the\nfirst time, confirming possibilities of observing the quark effects in the\nspectra of bremsstrahlung. (2) As found, quark effects are not enough to be\nobserved in middle and heavy nuclei, as they have dominant incoherent\ncontributions. (3) \\isotope[18]{C} has minimal incoherent contribution\nconcerning other carbon isotopes, where the quark effects should be minimal. In\nratios between the spectra for \\isotope[18]{C} and \\isotope[12]{C} with and\nwithout the quark effects the difference is clearly observed.\n\\textbf{Conclusions} We establish the new physical observable for the quark\neffects in nuclei in the bremsstrahlung accompanied in the nuclear reactions,\nwhich can be measured.

RAS-Eval comprises 80\ntest cases and 3,802 attack tasks mapped to 11 Common Weakness Enumeration\n(CWE) categories, with tools implemented in JSON, LangGraph, and Model Context\nProtocol (MCP) formats. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse\nscenarios, revealing significant vulnerabilities: attacks reduced agent task\ncompletion rates (TCR) by 36.78% on average and achieved an 85.65% success rate\nin academic settings. Notably, scaling laws held for security capabilities,\nwith larger models outperforming smaller counterparts. Our findings expose\ncritical risks in real-world agent deployments and provide a foundational\nframework for future security research.

In this paper,\nwe describe a diagrammatic representation of 3-periodic tangled networks that\nallows the definition of the untangling number, which can be used as a measure\nof entanglement complexity. The untangling number, first defined elsewhere for\n3-periodic entanglements of filaments and reminiscent of the unknotting number\nin knot theory, quantifies the minimum distance between a given 3-periodic\nstructure and its least tangled version, called ground state.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of\ntask-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce\ninference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence\n(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may\nnot match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).\n  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that\ncombines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization\nand spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)\nprocedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact\nKronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses\nenergy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.\n  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal\nmathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires\nonly 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or\nexceeding baseline performance.

    "abstract": "Controlling a robot based on physics-consistent dynamic models, such as Deep\nLagrangian Networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and\ninterpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,\nthe number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical\nproperties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a\nsingle global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system\nidentification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant\naspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation\nof energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility\nfor any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,\nparticularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as model\npredictive control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it\ncontext-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system\nidentification, and integrate it with an MPC for adaptive, physics-consistent\ncontrol. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the\nfact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our\nmethod on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our\nmethod reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%\nimprovement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.",

The study employs an in-house two-phase supersonic\nreactive flow solver based on the rhocentralfoam framework of OpenFOAM. The\nfindings emphasize the essential role of transverse jets in enabling successful\nODW formation under conditions where detonation would otherwise fail.\nSpecifically, the jet-inflow momentum ratio significantly influences the\nmechanisms of ODW formation. At lower momentum ratios, the oblique shock wave\n(OSW) induced by the jet is insufficient to directly initiate detonation.\nInstead, the atomized n-heptane jet increases the local fuel mass fraction,\npromoting low- and intermediate-temperature chemical reactions, which\neventually lead to detonation. At higher momentum ratios, the OSW generated by\nthe transverse jet is sufficiently strong to directly trigger detonation\nthrough intermediate-temperature chemistry, with the jet acting primarily as a\ncombustion stabilizer rather than directly enhancing combustion. Comparative\nstudies with non-reactive jets and wedge-strip configurations demonstrate that\nat higher momentum ratios, the dominant mechanism is the physical blocking\neffect of the jet, which generates a strong OSW capable of initiating\ndetonation.",

In this paper, we propose a\nrecall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates\ncamouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical\nknowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training\nparadigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct,\nupdate, and utilize memory representations effectively.

In the\nrecall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference\npattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent\nrelationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to\nreconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly\nimproving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes.

The terrestrial\nTrappist-1 exoplanets are excellent targets to study the impact of CMEs on\nclose-in planets and their atmospheres. We study the role of planetary magnetic\nfields in shielding the planet from external forcing. We expand on recent\nstudies of CME-induced Joule heating of planetary interiors and atmospheres by\nincluding a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of the interaction. We study the\ninteraction of CMEs with Tr-1b & e using MHD simulations. We consider magnetic\nflux rope and density pulse CMEs. We calculate induction heating in the\nplanetary interior and ionospheric Joule heating for various intrinsic magnetic\nfield strengths and CME energies. Magnetospheric compression is the main driver\nof magnetic variability. Planetary magnetic fields enhance induction heating in\nthe interior although the effect is weaker with flux rope CMEs. Single event\ndissipation rates with 1-hour CMEs amount to 20 TW and 1 TW for Trappist-1b and\ne, respectively. Taking CME occurrence rates into account, annual average\nheating rates are ~10 TW (b) and ~1 TW (e), which are placed near the lower end\nof previous estimates. Within the range of studied planetary magnetic field\nstrengths $B_p$, magnetospheric Poynting fluxes scale with $B_p^3$. Thus,\nstronger magnetic fields increase CME energy absorption. Ionospheric Joule\nheating rates amount to $10^{3-4}$ TW and decrease for stronger magnetic fields\n$B_p$. These heating rates exceed the average stellar XUV input by 1-2 orders\nof magnitude and might severely impact atmospheric erosion.

In this paper,\nwe measure the time difference (TD) between GPS and eLoran using a time\ninterval counter and analyze the correlations between eLoran/GPS TD and eleven\nmeteorological factors. Accurate estimation of eLoran/GPS TD could enable\neLoran to achieve timing accuracy comparable to that of GPS. We propose two\nestimation models for eLoran/GPS TD and compare their performance with existing\nTD estimation methods. The proposed WLR-AGRNN model captures the linear\nrelationships between meteorological factors and eLoran/GPS TD using weighted\nlinear regression (WLR) and models nonlinear relationships between outputs from\nexpert networks through an anisotropic general regression neural network\n(AGRNN). The model incorporates terrain elevation to appropriately weight\nmeteorological data, as elevation influences signal propagation delay.\nExperimental results based on four months of data demonstrate that the\nWLR-AGRNN model outperforms other models, highlighting its effectiveness in\nimproving eLoran/GPS TD estimation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents experimental results that allow for the performance\nevaluation of a straight-line reference alignment system based on\npseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams. Sensors, developed specifically for this\nsystem, feature four linear CMOS chips and a square aperture. This allows for\nsimultaneous measurements along the beam path without disrupting the laser\nreference. Measurements, conducted over a distance of 2 m from the first to the\nlast sensor, were compared with a laser tracker measurement to assess the\nsensor performance. The alignment reference generated by the Layer Beams\nexhibited a repeatability and reproducibility root-mean-square error (RMSE) of\nless than 30 ${\\mu}$m. The relative alignment precision for a known\ndisplacement was validated with a standard deviation of 4.3 ${\\mu}$m. The\nresults highlight the underlying sources of noise, which are induced mainly by\nthe cover glass, the protective film of the pixels, and the dark noise of the\nCMOS chips. Solutions to address these challenges are proposed. Additionally, a\nproof-of-concept for future development of a radiation-hard sensor utilizing\noptical fiber matrices is demonstrated. The RMSE of the reference position\ndetection introduced by the fiber matrix remained below 1.3 ${\\mu}$m. This\nwould allow the sensor to be used reliably in high-radiation environments\ntypical for accelerator facilities.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature enhancement\nand fusion framework named C-AFBiFPN.

    "abstract": "The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100\nM$_\\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars\n(VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially\nproduce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The\nevolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1,\nR136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by\nrotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply\na Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations.\nThe nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM\ncoupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from\nour fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type\nmass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass\nand luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can\nonly be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the\nsurface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous\nstar, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this\ncan be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than\nR136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to\nspectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of\n346$\\pm41$ M$_\\odot$ for R136a1, and $\\gtrsim$500 M$_\\odot$ for R136a2 and\nR136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr\nof age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC\nmetallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after\ntheir drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core\ncollapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]",

    "abstract": "Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate\ndescriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In\nthis paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language\nmodel (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with\npaired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We\npropose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video\ndescriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we\npropose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically\nupdating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module\nas a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and\nincorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the\nprocess. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances\nvideo-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by\n28\\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,\nsurpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning\ntasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art\non widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar\nsize.

    "abstract": "Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful\ninformation from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and\naccurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful\nbalance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused\nimages effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the\nfunctional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited\ncapacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer\nfrom insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused\nimage quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage\ndiffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In\nStage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet\ncaptures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents\nmultilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the\nsubsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input\ninto the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.\nThree key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from\ndifferent modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a\nhybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,\ncolor, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The\nexperimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the\nproposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation\nmetrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive\ndistribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges.

    "abstract": "Enterprise deployments of large-language model (LLM) demand continuously\nchanging document collections with sub-second latency and predictable GPU cost\nrequirements that classical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines only\npartially satisfy. We present PentaRAG, a five-layer module that routes each\nquery through two instant caches (fixed key-value and semantic), a\nmemory-recall mode that exploits the LLM's own weights, an adaptive session\nmemory, and a conventional retrieval-augmentation layer. Implemented with\nMistral-8B, Milvus and vLLM, the system can answer most repeated or\nsemantically similar questions from low-latency caches while retaining full\nretrieval for novel queries. On the TriviaQA domain, LoRA fine-tuning combined\nwith the memory-recall layer raises answer similarity by approximately 8% and\nfactual correctness by approximately 16% over the base model. Under a\nnine-session runtime simulation, cache warming reduces mean latency from\nseveral seconds to well below one second and shifts traffic toward the fast\npaths. Resource-efficiency tests show that PentaRAG cuts average GPU time to\n0.248 seconds per query, roughly half that of a naive RAG baseline, and\nsustains an aggregate throughput of approximately 100,000 queries per second on\nour setup. These results demonstrate that a layered routing strategy can\ndeliver freshness, speed, and efficiency simultaneously in production-grade RAG\nsystems.",

We\nhave achieved this by using the Sleeping Expert Framework (SEF) [Freund et al.,\n1997, Devaine et al., 2013], which allows the more efficient use of biased\nexperts (bad on average but which may be good at some point). To deal with the\nfact that, unlike in Devaine et al.

Compared to closed-ended QA, it\ndemands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse\nexpressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial\nand challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to\ncapture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses\nand reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as\npairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive\ninterpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some\ndescriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most\nnotably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and\nnon-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose\n\\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes\nopen-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different\nevaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point\nscoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware\nlistwise ranking strategy.

Since many nearly transparent cells in marine environments have\ncomplex, often non-axisymmetric shapes, this observation raises fundamental,\nyet little-explored questions in biological optics about light refraction by\nthe bodies of microorganisms. There are two distinct contexts for such\nquestions: the $absorption$ problem for $incoming$ light, typified by\nphotosynthetic activity taking place in the chloroplasts of green algae, and\nthe $emission$ problem for $outgoing$ light, where the paradigm is\nbioluminescence emitted from scintillons within dinoflagellates.

Analytical and numerical results are developed for\nthe distribution of light intensities inside and outside the body, and we\nestablish certain duality relationships that connect the incoming and outgoing\nproblems.

These\nprototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly\ndiverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this\nhypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning\nability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical\nrepresentations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for\nplanning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction\npipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;\n(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through\nProlog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems\narbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive\nexperiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline\nmodels on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning\ntasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics\n(AIME24).

Traditional\noptimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making\ndemands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we\ninvestigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling\nsingle-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations\nusing MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data\nstorage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the\ncomplexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By\nleveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the\ntraining stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,\nincluding PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can\neffectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing\nnon-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.\nThe insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous\nsatellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy\nlearning in decentralised EO missions.",

Consequently, it is essential to construct\nreduced order models from such discretizations to significantly lower\ncomputational costs while ensuring validity across the specified time and\nparameter domains. Preserving the Hamiltonian structure in these reduced models\nis also crucial, as it helps maintain long-term stability.

Our approach relies on a two-step projection\nframework: an initial linear projection based on the Proper Symplectic\nDecomposition, followed by a nonlinear projection learned via an autoencoder\nneural network. The reduced dynamics are then modeled using a Hamiltonian\nneural network. The offline phase of the method is split into two stages:\nfirst, constructing the linear projection using full-order model snapshots;\nsecond, jointly training the autoencoder and the Hamiltonian neural network to\nsimultaneously learn the encoder-decoder mappings and the reduced dynamics.

Moreover,\nthese species of mosquitoes compete with each other in the larval stage. Based\non these observations, we introduce a simple mathematical model to account for\nthis phenomenon. This model consists of a system of reaction-diffusion\nequations describing the dynamics of the aquatic and aerial phases of each\nspecies in a spatially heterogeneous environment.

    "abstract": "Modern low-carbon power systems come with many challenges, such as increased\ninverter penetration and increased uncertainty from renewable sources and\nloads. In this context, the microgrid concept is a promising approach, which is\nbased on a segmentation of the grid into independent smaller cells that can run\neither in grid-connected or standalone mode.In microgrids, droop control is\nwidely used for primary control. It enables proportional power sharing,\ndepending on the droop gains. Operation control schemes considering droop\ncontrol often assume fixed droop gains. However, using adaptive droop gains for\ngrid-forming units allow to shape power sharing in presence of fluctuations,\nenhancing flexibility while maintaining a safe microgrid operation,\nparticularly under uncertainty. This work introduces a bilinear formulation for\nmicrogrid operation control that finds optimal power setpoints and droop gains\non a timescale of minutes by solving a finite horizon optimization problem. In\ndetail, a robust minmax model predictive control scheme is designed for a\nstandalone microgrid, comprising a fuel cell, a photovoltaic system and an\nenergy storage. Closed-loop simulations are performed with and without variable\ndroop gains. The results show an increase in renewable utilization of up to 7.5\n% while reducing the power output of the fuel cell by 6 %, when allowing\nvariable droop gains.",

To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative\npost-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight\ncompression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance\ndegradation.

DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving\nsuperior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization.\nFor example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of\n14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly\noutperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its\npotential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications.",

Similarly, for the LMC FO Cepheids, we find a break-point in\nthe PC/PL/AC relations near P = 0.58 d. The slopes of the PC relations for LMC\nFO Cepheids are found to be shallow for 0.58 < P(d) < 2.5 but steeper for P <\n0.58 d and P > 2.5 d.

    "abstract": "The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is an ambitious\nmultipurpose neutrino experiment designed to determine the neutrino mass\nordering, with an impressive energy resolution goal of at least 3% at 1 MeV. To\nachieve a photon detection coverage of approximately 75%, JUNO will utilize two\ntypes of 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs): the large PMT (LPMT) and the\nmicrochannel plate PMT (MCP-PMT). A significant concern in high-precision\nneutrino measurements is the dark count rate (DCR) of PMTs, which introduces\nnoise that can adversely affect energy measurement accuracy. During the mass\ntesting phase of the JUNO 20-inch PMTs, comprehensive measurements of the DCR\nwere undertaken. These measurements not only captured the DCR values of\nindividual PMTs but also examined the stability and temperature dependence of\nthe DCR at an operating gain of (1x10^7). This paper presents a detailed\ncharacterization of the DCR of the JUNO 20-inch PMTs, investigating factors\nsuch as cooling time, temperature variations, and long-term stability using the\nJUNO Pan-Asia PMT testing facilities. The results reveal distinct DCR\ncharacteristics between the two types of PMTs, providing valuable insights into\nthe nature of DCR and its implications for JUNO's scientific objectives. In\naddition to performance characterization, we implemented a monitoring system to\ntrack DCR stability over time. Notably, several spikes in DCR were identified,\nprompting a preliminary investigation into their causes. Potential factors\ncontributing to these spikes, such as flasher events, were explored using\ncoincidence rate analysis and complementary imaging techniques. The findings\nfrom this study are crucial for optimizing the performance of PMTs in JUNO,\nultimately aiding the experiment in achieving its goals related to neutrino\nphysics.",

This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel\narchitecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual\nprogramming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank\nadaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules.

During\ninference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module\ncorresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.\nOur experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency\ncompared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a\nsingle shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.",

In particular, it has been suggested that the nucleosynthesis flow\nin such low-metallicity nova explosions extends up to the Cu-Zn region, much\nbeyond the expected endpoint, around Ca, predicted for solar-metallicity\nclassical novae. This behavior resembles a weak rp-process, and such nuclear\nactivity has never been observed in accreting white dwarf binaries with typical\naccretion flows.

Although some works\naddress this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit\nmodeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct\ngeometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and\nnoise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point\nDistribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the\nhigh-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation,\nwhich improves the computational efficiency and robustness.

Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the\ncomputational overhead.

Recently, a variant of IL, called\nIn-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant\npolicies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform\na new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale\ndemonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined\nby hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally\ngenerates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success\nrates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

While static weights\nare constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV\ncaches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for\nefficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle\nruntime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory\nmanagement relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a\npage table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction.\nThis virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory\nfragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime\nmemory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization\nunder dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.\n  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management\nframework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating\nsystems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction,\nwhich decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU\nmemory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory\nMechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory\ninflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3)\na Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize\nmemory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under\nstringent SLO constraints.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns\nregarding their potential misuse, particularly in generating fake news and\nmisinformation. To address these risks, watermarking techniques for\nautoregressive language models have emerged as a promising means for detecting\nLLM-generated text. Existing methods typically embed a watermark by increasing\nthe probabilities of tokens within a group selected according to a single\nsecret key. However, this approach suffers from a critical limitation: if the\nkey is leaked, it becomes impossible to trace the text's provenance or\nattribute authorship. To overcome this vulnerability, we propose a novel nested\nwatermarking scheme that embeds two distinct watermarks into the generated text\nusing two independent keys. This design enables reliable authorship\nidentification even in the event that one key is compromised. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves high detection accuracy for both\nwatermarks while maintaining the fluency and overall quality of the generated\ntext.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in safety-critical settings, it\nis essential to ensure that their responses comply with safety standards. Prior\nresearch has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe\nbehaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the\ngeneration of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we\npropose $\\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\\textbf{former}$ model that updates an\ninitial $\\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM\ninput embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM\nparameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of\nharmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our\nfindings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future\ninvestigations into designing variable system prompts.",

In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines.

By\nmaking a division between atoms in the different layers of the model system we\ncan considerably improve the accuracy of the model, suggesting a dissimilarity\nbetween the electronic structure due to an alternating compression and\nexpansion of atomic layers in the near-surface region. We find that our model\naccurately and effectively provides valuable insights into the distribution and\nstability of nanoparticle surfaces.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly\ntransformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly\nchallenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.\nDetecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on\ndigital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the\nspread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS\nresearch. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on\nidentifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face\nchallenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This\nlimitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the\nnumber of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of\ndomains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a\ntwin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module\nto detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using\nreal-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case\nstudies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection\nmethods.

    "abstract": "This paper develops the concept of the Adjacent Deviation Subspace (ADS), a\nnovel framework for reducing infinite-dimensional functional data into\nfinite-dimensional vector or scalar representations while preserving critical\ninformation of functional change points. To identify this functional subspace,\nwe propose an efficient dimension reduction operator that overcomes the\ncritical limitation of information loss inherent in traditional functional\nprincipal component analysis (FPCA). Building upon this foundation, we first\nconstruct a test statistic based on the dimension-reducing target operator to\ntest the existence of change points. Second, we present the MPULSE criterion to\nestimate change point locations in lower-dimensional representations. This\napproach not only reduces computational complexity and mitigates false\npositives but also provides intuitive graphical visualization of change point\nlocations. Lastly, we establish a unified analytical framework that seamlessly\nintegrates dimension reduction with precise change point detection.

Analyzing 60 million alignment measurements\nreveals that higher-performing models spontaneously develop stronger brain\nalignment without explicit neural constraints, with language models showing\nmarkedly stronger correlation (r=0.89, p<7.5e-13) than vision models (r=0.53,\np<2.0e-44). Crucially, longitudinal analysis demonstrates that brain alignment\nconsistently precedes performance improvements during training, suggesting that\ndeveloping brain-like representations may be a necessary stepping stone toward\nhigher capabilities. We find systematic patterns: language models exhibit\nstrongest alignment with limbic and integrative regions, while vision models\nshow progressive alignment with visual cortices; deeper processing layers\nconverge across modalities; and as representational scale increases, alignment\nsystematically shifts from primary sensory to higher-order associative regions.\nThese findings provide compelling evidence that optimization for task\nperformance naturally drives AI systems toward brain-like computational\nstrategies, offering both fundamental insights into principles of intelligent\ninformation processing and practical guidance for developing more capable AI\nsystems.",

These events share key observational features and belong to a family\nof objects similar to the prototypical Type Ibn SN 2006jc. The SNe exhibit rise\ntimes of approximately 10 days and peak absolute magnitudes ranging from\n$-$16.5 to $-$19 mag. Notably, SN 2023utc is the faintest Type Ibn supernova\ndiscovered to date, with an exceptionally low r-band absolute magnitude of\n$-16.4$ mag. The pseudo-bolometric light curves peak at $(1-10) \\times 10^{42}$\nerg s$^{-1}$, with total radiated energies on the order of $(1-10) \\times\n10^{48}$ erg. Spectroscopically, these SNe display relatively slow spectral\nevolution; the early spectra are characterised by a hot blue continuum and\nprominent He I emission lines. Early spectra show blackbody temperatures\nexceeding $10000~\\mathrm{K}$, with a subsequent decline in temperature during\nlater phases. Narrow He I lines, indicative of unshocked circumstellar material\n(CSM), show velocities of approximately $1000~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$. The spectra\nsuggest that the progenitors of these SNe underwent significant mass loss prior\nto the explosion, resulting in a He-rich CSM. Light curve modelling yields\nestimates for the ejecta mass ($M_{\\rm ej}$) in the range $1-3~M_{\\odot}$, with\nkinetic energies ($E_{\\rm Kin}$) of $(0.1-1) \\times 10^{50}$ erg.

    "abstract": "Multi-user millimeter-wave communication relies on narrow beams and dense\ncell deployments to ensure reliable connectivity. However, tracking optimal\nbeams for multiple mobile users across multiple base stations (BSs) results in\nsignificant signaling overhead. Recent works have explored the capability of\nout-of-band (OOB) modalities in obtaining spatial characteristics of wireless\nchannels and reducing pilot overhead in single-BS single-user/multi-user\nsystems. However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense\ncell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing\noverhead and high latency in data exchange. How to leverage OOB modalities to\neliminate pilot overhead and achieve efficient multi-BS coordination in\nmulti-BS systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel\nOOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize\nmulti-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB\nmodalities, i.e., vision and location. Specifically, mobile users are initially\nidentified via spatial alignment of visual sensing and location feedback, and\nthen tracked according to the temporal correlation in image sequence.\nSubsequently, a binary encoding map based gain and beam prediction network\n(BEM-GBPN) is designed to predict beamforming gains and optimal beams for\nmobile users at each BS, such that a central unit can control the BSs to\nperform user handoff and beam switching. Simulation results indicate that the\nproposed OMS-based mobility management scheme enhances beam prediction and BS\nselection accuracy and enables users to achieve 91% transmission rates of the\noptimal with zero pilot overhead and significantly improve multi-BS\ncoordination efficiency compared to existing methods.",

Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for\nthis uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework\nfor veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to\naddressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated\nand streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with\nguided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS\nframework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the\nuncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data\ncleaning stage.",

Despite\nprior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,\nmost modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we\nmodel the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key\ntasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),\nwhich entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse\nhigh-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a\nsingle response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and\nPS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the\no2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.\nLeveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning\nstrategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a\nmodel-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the\nproposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall\nresponse diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response\nquality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.",

The method\nnavigates the latent space of a diffusion model using a Stochastic Differential\nEquation (SDE), governed by balancing a classifier-informed boundary drive with\na manifold constraint.

Furthermore, force feedback\ndevices utilizing motors and gear reducers generally compromise backdrivability\nand pose safety risks to operators due to active force output. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a semi-active force feedback strategy based on MR\nclutches. Dynamic magnetic field control enables precise adjustment of joint\nstiffness and damping, thereby providing smooth and high-resolution force\nfeedback. The designed MR clutch exhibits outstanding performance across key\nmetrics, achieving a torque-to-mass ratio (TMR) of 93.6 Nm/kg, a\ntorque-to-volume ratio (TVR) of 4.05 x 10^5 Nm/m^3, and a torque-to-power ratio\n(TPR) of 4.15 Nm/W.

These I/O\nlibraries store the metadata such as data types and dimensionality along with\nthe raw data in the same files. While these libraries are well-optimized for\nconcurrent access to the raw data, they are designed neither to handle a large\nnumber of data objects efficiently nor to create different data objects\nindependently by multiple processes, as they require applications to call data\nobject creation APIs collectively with consistent metadata among all processes.\nApplications that process data gathered from remote sensors, such as particle\ncollision experiments in high-energy physics, may generate data of different\nsizes from different sensors and desire to store them as separate data objects.\nFor such applications, the I/O library's requirement on collective data object\ncreation can become very expensive, as the cost of metadata consistency check\nincreases with the metadata volume as well as the number of processes.

Recent studies combining relativistic\nhydrodynamic simulations with Monte Carlo particle transport have demonstrated\nthat UHECRs can be accelerated to energies beyond $10^{20}$ eV through shocks,\nturbulence, and relativistic shear in jet-induced flows of Fanaroff-Riley (FR)\ntype RGs. The resulting time-asymptotic UHECR spectrum is well modeled by a\ndouble power law with an ``extended'' exponential cutoff, primarily shaped by\nrelativistic shear acceleration. In this study, we adopt this novel source\nspectrum and simulate the propagation of UHECRs from nearby RGs using the\nCRPropa code. We focus on Virgo A, Centaurus A, Fornax A, and Cygnus A,\nexpected to be the most prominent UHECR sources among RGs. We then analyze the\nenergy spectrum and mass composition of UHECRs arriving at Earth. We find that,\ndue to the extended high-energy tail in the source spectrum, UHECRs from Virgo\nA, which has a higher Lorentz factor, exhibit a higher flux at the highest\nenergies and a lighter mass composition at Earth, compared to those from\nCentaurus A and Fornax A with lower Lorentz factors. Despite Cygnus A having an\neven higher Lorentz factor, the large distance limits its contribution.

    "abstract": "At room temperature, low frequency vibrations at far-infrared frequencies are\nthermally excited ($k_B T > h \\nu$) and not restricted to harmonic fluctuations\naround a single potential energy minimum. For folded proteins, these\nintrinsically anharmonic vibrations can contain information on slow\nconformational transitions. Recently, we have developed FREquency-SElective\nANharmonic (FRESEAN) mode analysis, a method based on time correlation\nfunctions that isolates low-frequency vibrational motions from molecular\ndynamics simulation trajectories without relying on harmonic approximations. We\nrecently showed that low-frequency vibrations obtained from FRESEAN mode\nanalysis are effective collective variables in enhanced sampling simulations of\nconformational ensembles. However, FRESEAN mode analysis is based on velocity\ntime correlations between all degrees of freedom, which creates computational\nchallenges for large biomolecules. To facilitate future applications, we\ndemonstrate here how coarse-graining of all-atom simulation trajectories can be\ncombined with FRESEAN mode analysis to extract information on low-frequency\nvibrations at minimal computational cost.",

    "abstract": "Dissipation is traditionally regarded as a disruptive factor in quantum\nsystems because it often leads to decoherence and delocalization. However,\nrecent insights into engineered dissipation reveal that it can be tuned to\nfacilitate various quantum effects, from state stabilization to phase\ntransitions. In this work, we identify aperiodic dissipation as a mechanism for\ninducing steady-state localization, independent of disorder or a quasiperiodic\npotential in the Hamiltonian. This localization arises from long-range phase\ncorrelations introduced by a spatially varying dissipation phase parameter,\nwhich enables nontrivial interference in the steady-state. By systematically\ncomparing two classes of aperiodic dissipation (defined as commensurate and\nincommensurate cases), we find that incommensurate modulation plays the most\nefficient role in stabilizing a localized steady-state. Our analysis, based on\ncoherence measures, purity, and participation ratio, reveals a direct link\nbetween eigenstate coherence and real-space localization, showing that\ndissipation can actively shape localization rather than simply causing\ndecoherence. These findings highlight aperiodic dissipation as a viable\napproach to controlling localization in open quantum systems, potentially\nenabling new ways to manipulate quantum states and design dissipation-driven\nphases.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have\nsignificantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While\nexisting methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with\nlong-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video\ncontent, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly\nused. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of\ncrucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar\nframes. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions\naccurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video\nsegments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model\nto guide the frame sampling process. We propose \"moment sampling\", a novel,\nmodel-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant\nframes according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a\nlightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing\non the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances\nlong-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on\nfour long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "While the use of social robots for language teaching has been explored, there\nremains limited work on a task-specific synthesized voices for language\nteaching robots. Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe\nconsequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We\naddress this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1.\nWe address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a\nfine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an\nexpressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can\nrun in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found\nthis voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods\nof expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a\nrobot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices\nin various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy\nand high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate\nand makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an\nEnglish TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known\nlinguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used\na data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use\nduration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax\n(short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly\ninfluences the perception for L2 listeners and created an \"L2 clarity mode\" for\nMatcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels\nunchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and\nencouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these\nchallenging tense/lax minimal pairs.",

    "abstract": "Distributed aggregative optimization underpins many cooperative optimization\nand multi-agent control systems, where each agent's objective function depends\nboth on its local optimization variable and an aggregate of all agents'\noptimization variables. Existing distributed aggregative optimization\napproaches typically require access to accurate gradients of the objective\nfunctions, which, however, are often hard to obtain in real-world applications.\nFor example, in machine learning, gradients are commonly contaminated by two\nmain sources of noise: the randomness inherent in sampled data, and the\nadditional variability introduced by mini-batch computations. In addition to\nthe issue of relying on accurate gradients, existing distributed aggregative\noptimization approaches require agents to share explicit information, which\ncould breach the privacy of participating agents. We propose an algorithm that\ncan solve both problems with existing distributed aggregative optimization\napproaches: not only can the proposed algorithm guarantee mean-square\nconvergence to an exact optimal solution when the gradients are subject to\nnoise, it also simultaneously ensures rigorous differential privacy, with the\ncumulative privacy budget guaranteed to be finite even when the number of\niterations tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nalgorithm able to guarantee both accurate convergence and rigorous differential\nprivacy in distributed aggregative optimization. Besides characterizing the\nconvergence rates under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex conditions, we also\nrigorously quantify the cost of differential privacy in terms of convergence\nrates.

When the incident laser travels in the\nwaveguide, electrons on the wall are extracted into the vacuum core and\naccelerated by the longitudinal field of the waveguide mode. Using 3D\nparticle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that high energy (~100 MeV)\nelectron beams with extremely high charge (~10 nC), ultrashort duration (~30\nfs) and small divergence (~1 deg) can be produced by a 100-TW, few-Joule class\nlaser system. In particular, when the drive Laguerre-Gaussian pulse is\ncircularly polarized, it excites high-order waveguide modes that exhibit\nhelical longitudinal electric fields. The 3D profile of this accelerating field\nis imprinted into the high energy electron beam, leading to helical\nmicro-bunching. This process can be controlled by the spin and orbital angular\nmomentum of the drive pulse.

Recent ultracold quantum gas experiments,\nhowever, demonstrate its emergence in higher dimensions through precise tuning\nof intra- to interspecies interaction ratios, inspiring exploration of how\ndimensionality and interatomic interactions govern quantum correlations. We\ninvestigate this in two-component bosonic mixtures with finite-range\ninteractions, probing 1D and three-dimensional (3D) dynamics. Using effective\nfield theory within the one-loop approximation, we derive analytical\nexpressions for zero-temperature ground-state energy and quantum depletion,\nseamlessly recovering contact interaction results in the contact limit. By\ncrafting an effective action for decoupled density and spin modes, we compute\ndynamic structure factors (DSFs), revealing how finite-range interactions\nsculpt spin-density separation. A pivotal finding is the dimensionality-driven\ndivergence in DSF peak dynamics: in 1D, peaks ascend to higher frequencies with\nincreasing interaction strength, yielding sharp responses; in 3D, peaks descend\nto lower frequencies, with broader density wave profiles. These insights\nhighlight dimensionality's critical role in collective excitations and provide\na robust theoretical blueprint for probing interaction-driven quantum phenomena\nvia Bragg spectroscopy, paving new pathways for exploring dimensionally tuned\nquantum correlations in ultracold quantum gases.",

While this\nbehavior is seen in both parametric and non-parametric reconstructions,\ncomparing reconstructions that support such behavior (such as the best fit of\nCPL) with those that maintain $w>-1$ (like the best fit algebraic quintessence)\nis not straightforward, as they differ in flexibility and structure, and are\nnot necessarily nested within one another. Thus, the question remains as to\nwhether the crossing behavior that we observe, suggested by the data, truly\nrepresents a dark energy model that crosses the phantom divide line, or if it\ncould instead be a result of data fluctuations and the way the data are\ndistributed. We investigate the likelihood of this possibility. For this\nanalysis we perform 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations based on a fiducial algebraic\nquintessence model.

Their X-ray observations reveal important physical\nproperties and movements of the baryonic cycle of galactic ecosystems. However,\nthe measured emissions toward a target at a cosmological distance would always\ninclude contributions from hot gases along the entire line of sight to the\ntarget. Observationally, such contaminations are routinely subtracted via\ndifferent strategies. In this work, we aim at answering an interesting\ntheoretical question regarding the amount of soft X-ray line emissions from\nintervening hot gases of different origins. We tackle this problem with the aid\nof the TNG100 simulation. We generated typical wide-field lightcone and\nestimated their impacts on spectral and flux measurements toward X-ray-emitting\ngalaxy-, group- and cluster-halo targets at lower redshifts. We split the\nintervening hot gases into three categories, that is, the hot gas that is\ngravitationally bound to either star-forming or quenched galaxy halos, and the\ndiffuse gas which is more tenuously distributed permeating the cosmic web\nstructures. We find that along a given line of sight, the diffuse gas that\npermeates the cosmic web structures produces strong oxygen and iron line\nemissions at different redshifts. The diffuse gas emission in the soft X-ray\nband can be equal to the emission from hot gases that are gravitationally bound\nto intervening galaxy halos. While the hot gas emission from the quiescent\ngalaxy halos can be significantly less than that from star-forming halos along\nthe line of sight. The fluxes from all of the line-of-sight emitters as\nmeasured in the energy band of 0.4--0.85 keV can reach ~20--200 % of the\nemission from the target galaxy, group, and cluster halos.",

Furthermore,\nwe introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the\nrisk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO\nenables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM\nand provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and\nalignment with the parser's requirements.

In\naddition, we prove that when the nonlinear detection on the two copies of the\ncoherent state fails, the nonlinear detection on the three copies may be\nsuccessful. Finally, due to the difficulty in calculating robustness of\ncoherence for general states, we introduce a lower bound for coherent\nrobustness based on the witness operator, and after comparing our lower bound\nwith the currently known lower bound, one show that our lower bound is better.\nCoherence is believed to play a crucial role in quantum information tasks,\nmaking the detection and quantization of coherence particularly significant.\nTherefore, these results help to open up new avenues for advancement in quantum\ntheory.",

    "abstract": "As the complexity of integrated circuit designs continues to escalate, the\nfunctional verification becomes increasingly challenging. Reference models,\ncritical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming\nmore intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by\nlarge language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating\ncomplex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce ChatModel, the first LLM-aided agile reference model\ngeneration and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from\ndesign specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating\ndesign standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a\nbuilding-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design\ncapabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts\nverification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying\ncomplexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and\nquality of reference model generation. ChatModel achieved a peak performance\nimprovement of 55.02% compared to alternative methods, with notable\nenhancements in generation stability, and delivered a 9.18x increase in its\ncapacity to produce reference model designs. Furthermore, it accelerated the\niterative process of reference model design and validation by an average of\n5.90x compared to traditional approaches. These results highlight the potential\nof ChatModel to significantly advance the automation of reference model\ngeneration and validation.",

Here, we discover that\nferroelectric order resides at the interface of two oxides, LaAlO3/KTaO3(111)\n(LAO/KTO), where two seemingly mutually exclusive orders-ferroelectricity and\nsuperconductivity-coexist. Moreover, manipulating ferroelectricity can change\nthe interfacial conductivity by more than 1000 times, simultaneously causing\nsuperconductivity to diminish and reappear due to the coupling between these\nphenomena. The ferroelectricity is confirmed by scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy (STEM), second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy, and\npiezoelectric force microscopy (PFM). STEM reveals K ions are displaced\nrelative to Ta ions, with the help of oxygen vacancies at the LAO/KTO\ninterface. The resultant electric polarization is locally switchable by\napplying a voltage between the PFM tip and the LAO film. The ferroelectric\nhysteresis correlates with hysteresis change in interfacial conductivity and\nthe superconducting transition temperature (Tc). The loss and reentrance of\nsuperconductivity are accounted for by orders of magnitude change in the Hall\nmobility induced by the polarization switching.

The package comprises three main\nmodules: data preprocessing, ideal data cube generation, and mock observation.\nSpecifically, the preprocessing module extracts necessary properties of star\nand gas particles for a selected subhalo from hydrodynamical simulations and\ncreates the execution file for the following radiative transfer procedure.\nSubsequently, building on the above information, the ideal data cube generation\nmodule executes a widely used radiative transfer project, specifically the\nSKIRT, to perform the SED assignment for each particle and the radiative\ntransfer procedure to produce an IFU-like ideal data cube. Lastly, the mock\nobservation module takes the ideal data cube and applies the throughputs of\naiming telescopes, while also incorporating the relevant instrumental effects,\npoint spread functions (PSFs), and background noise to generate the required\nmock observational images of galaxies. To showcase the outcomes of\nGalaxyGenius, we created a series of mock images of galaxies based on the\nIllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations for both space and ground-based surveys,\nspanning ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) wavelength coverage, including CSST,\nEuclid, HST, JWST, Roman, and HSC. GalaxyGenius offers a flexible framework to\ngenerate mock galaxy images with customizable recipes.

As\ndemonstrated by many groups, the kinematic signature reflects the Galactic\nstellar disc's response to a dynamical disturbance some 0.3-3 Gyr ago. However,\nprevious controlled simulations did not consider the impact of the multi-phase\ninterstellar medium (ISM) on the existence of the PS. This is crucial because\nit has been suggested that this weak signal is highly susceptible to scattering\nby small-scale density fluctuations typical of the ISM. This has motivated us\nto explore the formation and fate of the PS in a suite of high-resolution,\nN-body/hydrodynamical simulations of an idealised Galaxy analogue bearing a\nrealistic ISM that interacts impulsively with a massive perturber. In our\nmodels, high gas surface densities within the disc encourage vigorous star\nformation, which in turn couples with the gas via feedback to drive turbulence.\nWe find that the PS is almost non-existent if the disc potential is too strong\nor the ISM is highly structured on sub-kiloparsec scales. This can happen in\nthe absence of stellar feedback when the gas is allowed to cool. In the\npresence of turbulent gas maintained by stellar feedback, the PS has a patchy\nspatial distribution and a high degree of intermittency on kiloparsec scales.\nWe anticipate that future studies of the phase-spiral behaviour on all scales\nwill provide crucial information on star-gas dynamics.",

The Kubo formula, decomposed into intra- and interband particle-hole\nand particle-particle channels, provides two key constraints: at zero\ntemperature, only particle-particle terms contribute, while at the critical\ntemperature $T_c$, only particle-hole terms remain, ensuring $\\chi(T_c^{-}) =\n\\chi_N$ for continuous phase transitions. For $s$-wave pairing, a Zeeman field\nreduces $T_c$, whereas Rashba SOC preserves $T_c$ but yields a residual zero\ntemperature spin susceptibility $\\chi(0)$ which approaches $2\\chi_N/3$ in the\nstrong SOC limit; combined fields create a Bogoliubov Fermi surface, resulting\nin a kink in $\\chi(0)$.

This perspective not only\ndemystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to\nnatural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\\mathcal{K}$,\nallowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and\nconstrained optimization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The geometric spin Hall effect of light (GSHEL), which is associated with\nnonzero transverse angular momentum, has been demonstrated to occur without the\nneed for light-matter interaction and is characterized by a transverse shift.\nRecently, there has been a surge in research on spatiotemporal optical vortices\n(STOV) that carry pure transverse angular momentum. In this study, we examine\nthe transverse shift of STOV in a tilted reference frame with respect to the\noptical axis. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we\nestablish a linear relationship between this shift and the topological charge.\nOur findings reveal that only \"spatial STOV\" exhibits a GSHEL shift, this\nphenomenon is contingent upon the spatial distribution of their angular\nmomentum density. When present, the shift direction is consistently\nperpendicular to the angular momentum vector, and its magnitude is found to be\ninversely proportional to the cosine of the tilt angle. We explore a maximum\nshift value, which is proportional to $\\sqrt{l{{x}_{0}}/{{k}_{0}}}$. These\ndiscoveries open up new avenues for the application in the realms of ultrafast\noptics and nanotechnology, offering a fresh perspective on the manipulation and\nmeasurement of light at the micro and nanoscales.",

To address the hardware and computational cost\nof gigantic MIMO, several strategies are available that shift processing from\nthe digital to the analog domain. Among them, microwave linear analog computers\n(MiLACs) offer a compelling solution by enabling fully analog beamforming\nthrough reconfigurable microwave networks. Prior work has focused on\nfully-connected MiLACs, whose ports are all interconnected to each other via\ntunable impedance components. Although such MiLACs are capacity-achieving,\ntheir circuit complexity, given by the number of required impedance components,\nscales quadratically with the number of antennas, limiting their practicality.\nTo solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a graph theoretical model of\nMiLAC facilitating the systematic design of lower-complexity MiLAC\narchitectures. Leveraging this model, we propose stem-connected MiLACs as a\nfamily of MiLAC architectures maintaining capacity-achieving performance while\ndrastically reducing the circuit complexity. Besides, we optimize\nstem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution.

As a crucial component for developing\nthese reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through\ntrial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent\non-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.\nIn this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a\nnovel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy\nupdate and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of\nlow hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized\nlong-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting\nperiods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we\npropose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage\nestimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of\npolicy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that\nallows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By\nselectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces\nredundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing\nconvergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO\non AIME 2024 with a 32B base model.

ISAC designs\nfacilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving.\nSuch applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication\n(URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive\ntargets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability\nconstraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of\nURLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station\n(BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is\ndeployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS\nregularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to\nthe UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a\ntarget of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional\nURLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper\ncoding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and\nsensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for\nhandling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive\ninterference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the\nrate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by\nevaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of\nthe URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our\nnumerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly\noutperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes.

As special cases, we obtain sharp\nphase transitions for the Vietoris-Rips complex, the Cech complex, and the\nBoolean model, allowing us to identify which properties of these well-known\npercolation models are actually required.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the relationship between a spin-glass three-dimensional (3D)\nIsing model with the lattice size N = mnl and the traveling salesman problem\n(TSP) in a 3D lattice is studied. In particular, the mathematical structures of\nthe two systems are investigated in details. In both the hard problems, the\nnontrivial topological structures, the non-planarity graphs, the nonlocalities\nand/or the long-range spin entanglements exist, while randomness presents,\nwhich make the computation very complicated. It is found that an absolute\nminimum core (AMC) model exists not only in the spin-glass 3D Ising model but\nalso in the 3D TSP for determining the lower bound of their computational\ncomplexities, which can be mapped each other. It is verified that the\nspin-glass AMC model equals to the difference between a two-level (l = 2) grid\nspin-glass 3D Ising model and a spin-glass 2D Ising model, which is\nNP-complete. Furthermore, according to the mapping between the spin-glass 3D\nIsing model and the TSP, it is proven that the AMC model for the TSP identifies\nto the difference between a two-level (l = 2) grid TSP model and a 2D TSP\nmodel, which is NP-complete also. The AMC models in both models are proven to\nbe at the border between the NP-complete problems and the NP-intermediate\nproblems. Because the lower bound of the computational complexity of the\nspin-glass 3D Ising model is the computational complexity by brute force search\nof the AMC model, the lower bound of the computational complexity of the TSP in\na 3D lattice is the computational complexity by brute force search of the AMC\nmodel for the TSP. All of them are in subexponential and superpolynomial. The\npresent work provides some implications on numerical algorithms for the\nNP-complete problems, for instance, one cannot develop a polynomial algorithm,\nbut may develop a subexponential algorithm for the 3D spin-glass problem or\nTSP.",

This framework is designed to\nrevolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven\nstylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that\nuses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of\nthe style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove\nstyle-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.\nThis gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free\ninjection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy\nbased on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in\nthe fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive\nlearning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a\ntraining-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which\nmanipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the\ncross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and\nvalue of the content-related process are replaced with those of the\nstyle-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the\nmodel. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the\noriginal content.

KUL-KT adapts the\nprinciple of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by\nintroducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that\nenables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target\n(LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning\nwithout backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast\nHebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative\nupdate, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through\ngradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural\nforgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training.\nOperating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured\n(tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT\noutperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive\nmetrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT\npersonalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved\nlearner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05).

    "abstract": "We use the stellar intensity interferometry system implemented with the Very\nEnergetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) at Fred Lawrence\nWhipple Observatory (FLWO) as a light collector to obtain measurements of the\nrapid rotator star $\\gamma$ Cassiopeiae, at a wavelength of 416 nm. Using data\nfrom baselines sampling different position angles, we extract the size,\noblateness, and projected orientation of the photosphere. Fitting the data with\na uniform ellipse model yields a minor-axis angular diameter of $0.43\\pm0.02$\nmas, a major-to-minor-radius ratio of $1.28\\pm0.04$, and a position angle of\n$116^\\circ\\pm5^\\circ$ for the axis of rotation. A rapidly-rotating stellar\natmosphere model that includes limb and gravity darkening describes the data\nwell with a fitted angular diameter of $0.604^{+0.041}_{-0.034}$ mas\ncorresponding to an equatorial radius of 10.9$^{+0.8}_{-0.6}~R_\\odot$, a\nrotational velocity with a $1~\\sigma$ lower limit at $97.7\\%$ that of breakup\nvelocity, and a position angle of $114.7^{+6.4}_{-5.7}$ degrees. These\nparameters are consistent with H$\\alpha$ line spectroscopy and\ninfrared-wavelength Michelson interferometric measurements of the star's\ndecretion disk. This is the first measurement of an oblate photosphere using\nintensity interferometry.",
