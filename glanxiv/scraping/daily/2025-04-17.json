    "abstract": "We present a numerical framework for solving neural field equations on\nsurfaces using Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation and quadrature. Neural\nfield models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling\nstudies often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains.\nTraditional numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can\nbe computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains.\nIn contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering\ninterpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary\ngeometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based\ninterpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces.\nQuadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring\nhigh-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis\nfunctions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical\nexperiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its\nadvantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We\nconclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity\non complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave\npropagation patterns.",

    "abstract": "Generating high-quality, photorealistic textures for 3D human avatars remains\na fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision and multimedia field.\nHowever, real paired front and back images of human subjects are rarely\navailable with privacy, ethical and cost of acquisition, which restricts\nscalability of the data. Additionally, learning priors from image inputs using\ndeep generative models, such as GANs or diffusion models, to infer unseen\nregions such as the human back often leads to artifacts, structural\ninconsistencies, or loss of fine-grained detail. To address these issues, we\npresent SMPL-GPTexture (skinned multi-person linear model - general purpose\nTexture), a novel pipeline that takes natural language prompts as input and\nleverages a state-of-the-art text-to-image generation model to produce paired\nhigh-resolution front and back images of a human subject as the starting point\nfor texture estimation. Using the generated paired dual-view images, we first\nemploy a human mesh recovery model to obtain a robust 2D-to-3D SMPL alignment\nbetween image pixels and the 3D model's UV coordinates for each views. Second,\nwe use an inverted rasterization technique that explicitly projects the\nobserved colour from the input images into the UV space, thereby producing\naccurate, complete texture maps. Finally, we apply a diffusion-based inpainting\nmodule to fill in the missing regions, and the fusion mechanism then combines\nthese results into a unified full texture map.

That is, researchers\nmust determine whether treatment effects are homogeneous across studies. We\nbegin by analyzing scenarios with a specified reference effect, such as testing\nwhether all studies show the treatment is effective 80% of the time, and\ndescribe how the critical separation depends on the reference effect.

A\nstrong accretion outburst was observed with Spitzer-IRS in 2008 in EX Lup, the\nprototype of EXor variables, and found to increase the mid-infrared water and\nOH emission and decrease organic emission, suggesting large chemical changes.\nWe present here two JWST-MIRI epochs of quiescent EX Lup in 2022 and 2023\nobtained over a decade after the 2008 outburst and several months after a\nmoderate burst in 2022. With JWST's sharper spectral view, we can now analyze\nwater emission as a function of temperature in the two MIRI epochs and,\napproximately, also in the previous Spitzer epochs. This new analysis shows a\nstrong cold water vapor ``burst\" in low-energy lines during the 2008 outburst,\nwhich we consider clear evidence for enhanced ice sublimation due to a\nrecession of the snowline, as found in protostellar envelopes. JWST shows that\nEX Lup still has an unusually strong emission from cold water in comparison to\nother T Tauri disks, suggesting > 10-yr-long freeze-out timescales in the inner\ndisk surface. EX Lup demonstrates that outbursts can significantly change the\nobserved organic-to-water ratios and increase the cold water reservoir,\nproviding chemical signatures to study the recent accretion history of disks.\nThis study provides an unprecedented demonstration of the chemical evolution\ntriggered by accretion outbursts in the Class II phase and of the high\npotential of time-domain experiments to reveal processes that may have\nfundamental implications on planet-forming bodies near the snowline.",

The primary\nmotivation stems from the observed performance disparity of quantum annealers\nwhen solving problems suited to the processor's architecture versus those with\nnon-hardware-native topologies. Our research has two main objectives: i) to\nanalyze the impact of embedding quality on the performance of D-Wave Systems\nquantum annealers, and ii) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings generated\nby Minorminer, the standard minor-embedding technique in the quantum annealing\nliterature, provided by D-Wave. Regarding the first objective, our experiments\nreveal a clear correlation between the average chain length of embeddings and\nthe relative errors of the solutions sampled. This underscores the critical\ninfluence of embedding quality on quantum annealing performance. For the second\nobjective, we evaluate Minorminer's embedding capabilities, the quality and\nrobustness of its embeddings, and its execution-time performance. We also\ncompare its performance with Clique Embedding, another algorithm developed by\nD-Wave, which is deterministic and designed to embed fully connected Ising\nmodels into quantum annealing processors, serving as a worst-case scenario. The\nresults demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement for\nMinorminer, suggesting that more effective embedding strategies could lead to\nmeaningful gains in quantum annealing performance.",

Counterintuitively, we find that in a competitive market, firms\nthat improve overall accuracy do not necessarily improve their profits. Rather,\neach firm's optimal decision is to invest further on the error dimension where\nit has a competitive advantage. By decomposing model errors into false positive\nand false negative rates, firms can reduce errors in each dimension through\ninvestments.

    "abstract": "Multilayer perceptrons (MLP), or fully connected artificial neural networks,\nare known for performing vector-matrix multiplications using learnable weight\nmatrices; however, their practical application in many machine learning tasks,\nespecially in computer vision, can be limited due to the high dimensionality of\ninput-output pairs at each layer. To improve efficiency, convolutional\noperators have been utilized to facilitate weight sharing and local\nconnections, yet they are constrained by limited receptive fields. In this\npaper, we introduce Multiscale Tensor Summation (MTS) Factorization, a novel\nneural network operator that implements tensor summation at multiple scales,\nwhere each tensor to be summed is obtained through Tucker-decomposition-like\nmode products. Unlike other tensor decomposition methods in the literature, MTS\nis not introduced as a network compression tool; instead, as a new backbone\nneural layer. MTS not only reduces the number of parameters required while\nenhancing the efficiency of weight optimization compared to traditional dense\nlayers (i.e., unfactorized weight matrices in MLP layers), but it also\ndemonstrates clear advantages over convolutional layers. The proof-of-concept\nexperimental comparison of the proposed MTS networks with MLPs and\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrates their effectiveness across\nvarious tasks, such as classification, compression, and signal restoration.\nAdditionally, when integrated with modern non-linear units such as the\nmulti-head gate (MHG), also introduced in this study, the corresponding neural\nnetwork, MTSNet, demonstrates a more favorable complexity-performance tradeoff\ncompared to state-of-the-art transformers in various computer vision\napplications. The software implementation of the MTS layer and the\ncorresponding MTS-based networks, MTSNets, is shared at\nhttps://github.com/mehmetyamac/MTSNet.",

By training a\ncompact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across\ndifferent farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead.\nExperimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the\nperformance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead.

While full cooperation between sensing and communication can result\nin significant performance gains, achieving optimal performance requires\nefficient designs of unified waveforms and beamformers for joint sensing and\ncommunication. Sophisticated statistical signal processing and multi-objective\noptimization techniques are necessary to balance the competing design\nrequirements of joint sensing and communication tasks. Since model-based\nanalytical approaches may be suboptimal or overly complex, deep learning\nemerges as a powerful tool for developing data-driven signal processing\nalgorithms, particularly when optimal algorithms are unknown or when known\nalgorithms are too complex for real-time implementation. Unified waveform and\nbeamformer design problems for ISAC fall into this category, where fundamental\ndesign trade-offs exist between sensing and communication performance metrics,\nand the underlying models may be inadequate or incomplete.

Evaluating\nthis tradeoff requires metrics that account for both performance and costs. We\npropose a framework grounded in production theory for evaluating language\nmodels by combining accuracy and inference cost. We introduce \"cost-of-pass\",\nthe expected monetary cost of generating a correct solution. We then define the\n\"frontier cost-of-pass\" as the minimum cost-of-pass achievable across available\nmodels or the \"human-expert, using the approximate cost of hiring an expert.\nOur analysis reveals distinct economic insights. First, lightweight models are\nmost cost-effective for basic quantitative tasks, large models for\nknowledge-intensive ones, and reasoning models for complex quantitative\nproblems, despite higher per-token costs. Second, tracking this frontier\ncost-of-pass over the past year reveals significant progress, particularly for\ncomplex quantitative tasks where the cost has roughly halved every few months.\nThird, to trace key innovations driving this progress, we examine\ncounterfactual frontiers: estimates of cost-efficiency without specific model\nclasses. We find that innovations in lightweight, large, and reasoning models\nhave been essential for pushing the frontier in basic quantitative,\nknowledge-intensive, and complex quantitative tasks, respectively. Finally, we\nassess the cost-reductions afforded by common inference-time techniques like\nmajority voting and self-refinement, finding that their marginal accuracy gains\nrarely justify their costs. Our findings underscore that complementary\nmodel-level innovations are the primary drivers of cost-efficiency, and our\neconomic framework provides a principled tool for measuring this progress and\nguiding deployment.",

However, the\npotential of RC to operate in noisy regimes and distinguish noise from the\nprimary smooth or non-smooth deterministic dynamics of the system has not been\nfully explored. This paper presents a novel RC method for noise filtering and\nreconstructing unobserved nonlinear dynamics, offering a novel learning\nprotocol associated with hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the RC\nin terms of noise intensity, noise frequency content, and drastic shifts in\ndynamical parameters is studied in two illustrative examples involving the\nnonlinear dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and the adaptive exponential\nintegrate-and-fire system. It is demonstrated that denoising performance\nimproves by truncating redundant nodes and edges of the reservoir, as well as\nby properly optimizing hyperparameters, such as the leakage rate, spectral\nradius, input connectivity, and ridge regression parameter. Furthermore, the\npresented framework shows good generalization behavior when tested for\nreconstructing unseen and qualitatively different attractors. Compared to the\nextended Kalman filter, the presented RC framework yields competitive accuracy\nat low signal-to-noise ratios and high-frequency ranges.",

We introduce contextual lariat deletion\noperations under three energy models - linear loop penalty, logarithmic loop\npenalty, and constantly bounded loop length - as well as bracketed contextual\ndeletion, where deletion occurs solely based on context matching, without any\nstructural constraints from hairpin loops.

This presentation is a digest of the first quantitative\nexploration of corrections to this picture when pions are included [1] (see\nthere for a more comprehensive list of references). Since the pion mass and\ndecay constant introduce dimensionful scales in the NN system, they explicitly\nbreak the symmetries of the Unitarity fixed point.

In\naddition, for FRBs, there is a significant uncertainty in the redshifts\nobtained from the observed dispersion measures (DMs). To correct for the\ntruncation we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron-Petrosian and\nLynden-Bell methods, which give unbiased distributions of luminosities and\nredshifts and their cosmological evolution. To quantify the redshift\nuncertainty, we use a data set which accounts for uncertainties of contribution\nto the DM of the host galaxy, and DM uncertainties due to fluctuation in the\nintergalactic medium. This data, in addition to a mean redshift, gives the\none-sigma errors. We construct three samples with lower, mean, and upper\nredshifts and apply the above methods to each. For the three samples, we find\nsimilar (1) $\\sim 3\\sigma$ evidence for luminosity evolution, (2) a luminosity\nfunction that can be fit by a simple broken power law, and (3) a comoving\ndensity formation rate that decreases rapidly with redshift unlike the cosmic\nstar formation rate (SFR).

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a\nso-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a\nrange of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the\nmodel. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation\nof menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained\nas a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was\nunable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\\pm0.03$,\ncompared to $0.87\\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set. When fine-tuning SAM\nend-to-end, a Dice score of $0.87\\pm0.03$ was achieved. The performance of both\nthe end-to-end trained SAM configuration and the 3D U-Net were comparable to\nthe winning Dice score ($0.88\\pm0.03$) in the IWOAI Knee MRI Segmentation\nChallenge 2019. Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both\nconfigurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus\nmorphology. Results demonstrated that, despite its generalisability, SAM was\nunable to outperform a basic 3D U-Net in meniscus segmentation, and may not be\nsuitable for similar 3D medical image segmentation tasks also involving fine\nanatomical structures with low contrast and poorly-defined boundaries.",

    "abstract": "While HPC resources are increasingly being used to produce adaptively refined\nor unstructured volume datasets, current research in applying machine\nlearning-based representation to visualization has largely ignored this type of\ndata. To address this, we introduce Volume Encoding Gaussians (VEG), a novel 3D\nGaussian-based representation for scientific volume visualization focused on\nunstructured volumes. Unlike prior 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that\nstore view-dependent color and opacity for each Gaussian, VEG decouple the\nvisual appearance from the data representation by encoding only scalar values,\nenabling transfer-function-agnostic rendering of 3DGS models for interactive\nscientific visualization. VEG are directly initialized from volume datasets,\neliminating the need for structure-from-motion pipelines like COLMAP. To ensure\ncomplete scalar field coverage, we introduce an opacity-guided training\nstrategy, using differentiable rendering with multiple transfer functions to\noptimize our data representation. This allows VEG to preserve fine features\nacross the full scalar range of a dataset while remaining independent of any\nspecific transfer function. Each Gaussian is scaled and rotated to adapt to\nlocal geometry, allowing for efficient representation of unstructured meshes\nwithout storing mesh connectivity and while using far fewer primitives. Across\na diverse set of data, VEG achieve high reconstruction quality, compress large\nvolume datasets by up to 3600x, and support lightning-fast rendering on\ncommodity GPUs, enabling interactive visualization of large-scale structured\nand unstructured volumes.",

The\nrole of cluster dynamical states in shaping the physical and morphological\nproperties of member galaxies remains an open question. We aim to assess the\nimpact of the dynamical state of massive ($M_{500} \\geq 1.5 \\times 10^{14}\nM_{\\odot}$) galaxy clusters on the physical and structural properties of their\nmember galaxies, and also in their fundamental relations in the redshift range\n$0.10 < z < 0.35$. We use a mass-matched sample of galaxies from relaxed and\ndisturbed clusters. Morphological types are assigned using both parametric and\nnon-parametric methods, while physical properties are derived through SED\nfitting. Galaxies are further divided into subpopulations to investigate trends\nwith cluster dynamical states. The dynamical state of galaxy clusters does not\nalter their fundamental relations at low redshift (such as color-magnitude,\nmass-size, morphology-density, and SF-density relations), nor does it\nsignificantly affect the mean or dispersion of galaxy properties. However, it\ndoes impact the distributions at the level of third and fourth order moments,\nintroducing asymmetries and heavier tails in the properties of galaxies. The\ngreatest effects are observed in low-mass and red sequence galaxies. These\nfindings suggest that, at low redshift, the fundamental relations of massive\ngalaxy clusters are already well-established and resilient to recent dynamical\nactivity. Nonetheless, the influence of the dynamical state on the higher-order\nmoments of galaxy properties indicates that environmental processes associated\nwith disturbed clusters still leave measurable imprints, particularly on\nlow-mass and red sequence galaxies. This is consistent with the idea that\ngalaxy evolution is shaped both by early pre-processing and by subsequent\ninteractions within dynamically active environments.",

While standard implementations relying on Gaussian\napproximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture\nchanges in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with\nscore-based generative modeling to estimate the system's score function\ndirectly from data. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by employing two\ncomplementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system's\ncharacteristics: (i) a clustering-based algorithm (KGMM) for systems with\nlow-dimensional effective dynamics, and (ii) a denoising score matching method\nimplemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially-extended\nsystems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated\non several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order\nmodels of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier--Stokes model representing a\nturbulent flow with a localized perturbation.

Current model-based SOH estimation methods typically rely on low\nC-rate constant current tests to extract health parameters like solid phase\nvolume fraction and lithium-ion stoichiometry, which are often impractical in\nreal-world scenarios due to time and operational constraints. Additionally,\nthese methods are susceptible to modeling uncertainties that can significantly\ndegrade the estimation accuracy, especially when jointly estimating multiple\nparameters. In this paper, we present a novel reference voltage-based method\nfor robust battery SOH estimation. This method utilizes the voltage response of\na battery under a predefined current excitation at the beginning of life (BOL)\nas a reference to compensate for modeling uncertainty. As the battery degrades,\nthe same excitation is applied to generate the voltage response, which is\ncompared with the BOL trajectory to estimate the key health parameters\naccurately. The current excitation is optimally designed using the Particle\nSwarm Optimization algorithm to maximize the information content of the target\nparameters. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method\nsignificantly improves parameter estimation accuracy under different\ndegradation levels, compared to conventional methods relying only on direct\nvoltage measurements. Furthermore, our method jointly estimates four key SOH\nparameters in only 10 minutes, making it practical for real-world battery\nhealth diagnostics, e.g., fast testing to enable battery repurposing.",

We furthermore conducted a positioning measurement\ncampaign in the ocean by deploying three autonomous acoustic pingers on the\nseafloor, as well as a cabled acoustic interrogator and a P-ONE prototype\nmodule deployed from a ship. Using a simple peak-finding detection algorithm,\nwe observe high accuracy in the tracking of relative ranging times at\napproximately $230-280\\,\\mu$s at distances of up to $1600\\,$m, which is\nsufficient for positioning detectors in a cubic-kilometer detector and which\ncan be further improved with more involved detection algorithms. The tracking\naccuracy is further confirmed by independent ranging of the Sonardyne system\nand closely follows the ship's drift in the wind measured by GPS. The absolute\npositioning shows the same tracking accuracy with its absolute precision only\nlimited by the large uncertainties of the deployed pinger positions on the\nseafloor.",

    "abstract": "To improve ATR identification of ships at sea requires an advanced ISAR\nprocessor - one that not only provides focused images but can also determine\nthe pose of the ship. This tells us whether the image shows a profile (vertical\nplane) view, a plan (horizontal plane) view or some view in between. If the\nprocessor can provide this information, then the ATR processor can try to match\nthe images with known vertical or horizontal features of ships and, in\nconjunction with estimated ship length, narrow the set of possible\nidentifications. This paper extends the work of Melendez and Bennett [M-B, Ref.\n1] by combining a focus algorithm with a method that models the angles of the\nship relative to the radar. In M-B the algorithm was limited to a single angle\nand the plane of rotation was not determined. This assumption may be fine for a\nshort time image where there is limited data available to determine the pose.\nHowever, the present paper models the ship rotation with two angles - aspect\nangle, representing rotation in the horizontal plane, and tilt angle,\nrepresenting variations in the effective grazing angle to the ship.",

However, in some rare instances, a 'reverse' ET can happen\nfrom the lower-to-higher bandgap material, depending on the strong overlap\nbetween the acceptor photoluminescence (PL) and the donor absorption spectra.\nIn this work, we report a reverse ET process from the lower bandgap MoS2 to the\nhigher bandgap WS2, due to a near 'resonant' overlap between the MoS2 B and WS2\nA excitonic levels. Changing the MoS2 bandgap from direct to indirect by\nincreasing the layer number results in a reduced ET rate, evidenced by the\nquenching of the WS2 PL emission. Our work shows at 300 K, the ET timescale of\n~33 fs is faster than the reported thermalization of the MoS2 excitonic\nintervalley scattering (K to K') time and competing with the ultrafast charge\ntransfer timescale.

    "abstract": "Object detection in satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery\nholds immense potential in tasks such as urban monitoring and disaster\nresponse. However, the inherent complexities of SAR data and the scarcity of\nannotations present significant challenges in the advancement of object\ndetection in this domain. Notably, the detection of small objects in\nsatellite-borne SAR images poses a particularly intricate problem, because of\nthe technology's relatively low spatial resolution and inherent noise.\nFurthermore, the lack of large labelled SAR datasets hinders the development of\nsupervised deep learning-based object detection models. In this paper, we\nintroduce TRANSAR, a novel self-supervised end-to-end vision transformer-based\nSAR object detection model that incorporates masked image pre-training on an\nunlabeled SAR image dataset that spans more than $25,700$ km\\textsuperscript{2}\nground area. Unlike traditional object detection formulation, our approach\ncapitalises on auxiliary binary semantic segmentation, designed to segregate\nobjects of interest during the post-tuning, especially the smaller ones, from\nthe background. In addition, to address the innate class imbalance due to the\ndisproportion of the object to the image size, we introduce an adaptive\nsampling scheduler that dynamically adjusts the target class distribution\nduring training based on curriculum learning and model feedback. This approach\nallows us to outperform conventional supervised architecture such as DeepLabv3\nor UNet, and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning-based arhitectures such\nas DPT, SegFormer or UperNet, as shown by extensive evaluations on benchmark\nSAR datasets.",

    "abstract": "The Faraday rotation measure (RM) is a commonly used tool to trace electron\nnumber density and magnetic fields in hot accretion flows, particularly in\nlow-luminosity accreting supermassive black holes. We focus on the nuclear\nregion of M87, which was observed at 230 GHz (1.3 mm) by the Event Horizon\nTelescope in 2019. It remains unclear whether this emission originates from the\naccretion flow, the jet base, or both. To probe the presence of an accretion\nflow, we explore the scenario where the linearly polarized emission from the\ncounter-jet, visible at 43 GHz (7 mm), is Faraday-rotated by the accretion\nflow. We calculate theoretical predictions for counter-jet polarization using\nanalytical and numerical models. In all cases, we find a Faraday-thick flow at\n43 GHz (7 mm), with $\\mathrm{RM} \\sim 10^6$ rad m$^{-2}$, and a polarization\nangle that follows a linear relationship with wavelength squared, consistent\nwith external Faraday rotation. The more realistic model, which includes\nturbulence and magnetic field fluctuations, predicts that the polarization\npattern should be time-dependent, and that the counter-jet emission is\ndepolarized due to Faraday depth fluctuations across the accretion flow.\nDespite the Faraday thick regime and strong depolarization, the linear\nrelationship persists, enabling us to constrain the flow's physical properties.\nComparing the counter-jet and forward-jet linear polarization states should\nenable detection of M87's accretion flow and provide lower limits on electron\ndensity, magnetic field strength, and mass accretion rate.",

Building\nupon our previous stability framework, which was developed to analyze the\neffect of spanwise confinement on the stability, we now incorporate wetting\nphenomena to develop a more comprehensive theoretical model. This extended\nmodel captures the interplay of gravity, inertia, surface tension, viscous\ndissipation, static meniscus, and moving contact lines. The base state exhibits\ntwo key features: a curved meniscus and a velocity overshoot near the side\nwalls. A biglobal linear stability analysis is conducted based on the\nlinearized Navier-Stokes equations. Unlike classical stability theory, our\nresults reveal that surface tension, when strong, suppresses the long-wave\ninstability ($k \\rightarrow 0$), significantly increasing the critical Reynolds\nnumber as it increases. Notably, this effect is more pronounced for smaller\ncontact angles. Moreover, stabilization is present across all wavenumbers at\nsmall Reynolds numbers, however, at large Reynolds numbers, the stabilization\neffect weakens, even for small contact angles. Furthermore, this stabilization\nis governed by the ratio of the capillary length to channel width, where\ncomplete stabilization occurs when this ratio exceeds a critical value\ndependent on the contact angle. We attribute this behavior to a capillary\nattenuation mechanism that dominates at smaller contact angles. No\ndestabilization due to velocity overshoot was observed in the linear regime.\nAdditionally, the introduction of wetting effects results in vortical\nstructures in the vicinity of the side walls.

    "abstract": "Empirical research in economics often examines the behavior of agents located\nin a geographic space. In such cases, statistical inference is complicated by\nthe interdependence of economic outcomes across locations. A common approach to\naccount for this dependence is to cluster standard errors based on a predefined\ngeographic partition. A second strategy is to model dependence in terms of the\ndistance between units. Dependence, however, does not necessarily stop at\nborders and is typically not determined by distance alone. This paper\nintroduces a method that leverages observations of multiple outcomes to adjust\nstandard errors for cross-sectional dependence. Specifically, a researcher,\nwhile interested in a particular outcome variable, often observes dozens of\nother variables for the same units. We show that these outcomes can be used to\nestimate dependence under the assumption that the cross-sectional correlation\nstructure is shared across outcomes. We develop a procedure, which we call\nThresholding Multiple Outcomes (TMO), that uses this estimate to adjust\nstandard errors in a given regression setting. We show that adjustments of this\nform can lead to sizable reductions in the bias of standard errors in\ncalibrated U.S. county-level regressions. Re-analyzing nine recent papers, we\nfind that the proposed correction can make a substantial difference in\npractice.",

By leveraging hardware-algorithm co-design, TAXI offers\nimprovements in solution quality, speed, and energy-efficiency on TSPs up to\n85,900 cities (the largest TSPLIB instance). TAXI produces solutions that are\nonly 22% and 20% longer than the Concorde solver's exact solution on 33,810 and\n85,900 city TSPs, respectively.

While intriguing, this delayed\ngeneralization phenomenon compromises predictability and efficiency. Ideally,\nmodels should generalize directly without delay. To this end, this paper\nproposes GrokTransfer, a simple and principled method for accelerating grokking\nin training neural networks, based on the key observation that data embedding\nplays a crucial role in determining whether generalization is delayed.\nGrokTransfer first trains a smaller, weaker model to reach a nontrivial (but\nfar from optimal) test performance. Then, the learned input embedding from this\nweaker model is extracted and used to initialize the embedding in the target,\nstronger model. We rigorously prove that, on a synthetic XOR task where delayed\ngeneralization always occurs in normal training, GrokTransfer enables the\ntarget model to generalize directly without delay. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat, across empirical studies of different tasks, GrokTransfer effectively\nreshapes the training dynamics and eliminates delayed generalization, for both\nfully-connected neural networks and Transformers.",

However, when it comes\nto the photon up-conversion process of high-order harmonic generation the\ndescription has focused on semi-classical methods for decades. In this work, we\novercome this limitation and establish a quantum optical theory of field\ncorrelations for the process of high harmonic generation (HHG). In effect, we\nintroduce the notion of optical coherence at the intersection of quantum optics\nand strong laser-driven processes, and obtain the harmonic field correlation\nfunctions. In particular, we focus on the first and second order field\ncorrelation, which allow to understand the origin of the classical properties\nof the HHG spectrum, and its departure into the quantum regime. Further, we\ndevelop the theory for two-time intensity correlation functions of the harmonic\nfield, and demonstrate the onset of anti-bunching signatures in HHG. We study\nthe correlation functions in the regime of a single, few and many emitters in\natomic HHG, showing the transition from quantum to classical signatures in the\ncorrelations.

    "abstract": "The fine-tuning paradigm has emerged as a prominent approach for addressing\nlong-tail learning tasks in the era of foundation models. However, the impact\nof fine-tuning strategies on long-tail learning performance remains unexplored.\nIn this work, we disclose that existing paradigms exhibit a profound misuse of\nfine-tuning methods, leaving significant room for improvement in both\nefficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we reveal that heavy fine-tuning\n(fine-tuning a large proportion of model parameters) can lead to non-negligible\nperformance deterioration on tail classes, whereas lightweight fine-tuning\ndemonstrates superior effectiveness. Through comprehensive theoretical and\nempirical validation, we identify this phenomenon as stemming from inconsistent\nclass conditional distributions induced by heavy fine-tuning. Building on this\ninsight, we propose LIFT+, an innovative lightweight fine-tuning framework to\noptimize consistent class conditions. Furthermore, LIFT+ incorporates\nsemantic-aware initialization, minimalist data augmentation, and test-time\nensembling to enhance adaptation and generalization of foundation models. Our\nframework provides an efficient and accurate pipeline that facilitates fast\nconvergence and model compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIFT+\nsignificantly reduces both training epochs (from $\\sim$100 to $\\leq$15) and\nlearned parameters (less than 1%), while surpassing state-of-the-art approaches\nby a considerable margin.

In promoting\nbrightness and enriching the functionalities of the downshifting luminescence\nof RENPs, numerous studies have exploited inert shell to protect rare-earth\ndopants from surface quenchers. However, internal concentration quenching\nremains an unsolved puzzle when using higher dopant concentrations of\nrare-earth ions in an attempt to obtain brighter emission. Following a plethora\nof research involving core-shell structures, the interface has shown to be\ncontrollable, ranging from a well-defined, abrupt boundary to an obscure one\nwith cation intermixing. By utilizing this inter-mixed core-shell property for\nthe first time, we design a new architecture to create a homogeneous\ndouble-layer core-shell interface to extend the active layer, allowing more\nluminescent centers without severe concentration quenching. By systematically\ndeploying the crystallinity of the starting core, shell growth dynamics, and\ndopant concentrations, the downshifting luminescence intensity of new\narchictecture achieves a 12-fold enhancement surpassing the traditional\ncore-shell structure.

To solve jointly the control policy and its\ntrigger, we formulate the attack planning problem as a constrained optimal\nplanning problem in an MDP with augmented state space, with the objective to\nmaximize the attacker's total rewards in the system with an activated trigger,\nsubject to the constraint that the control policy is near optimal in the\noriginal MDP.

This paper shows that a thresholded version of the\nstandard doubly robust estimator is asymptotically normal with well-calibrated\nWald confidence intervals even when constructed using nonparametric estimates\nof the propensity score and conditional mean outcome. The analysis implies a\ncost of weak overlap in terms of black-box nuisance rates, borne when the\nsemiparametric bound is infinite, and the contribution of outcome smoothness to\nthe outcome regression rate, which is incurred even when the semiparametric\nbound is finite. As a byproduct of this analysis, I show that under weak\noverlap, the optimal global regression rate is the same as the optimal\npointwise regression rate, without the usual polylogarithmic penalty. The\nhigh-level conditions yield new rules of thumb for thresholding in practice. In\nsimulations, thresholded AIPW can exhibit moderate overrejection in small\nsamples, but I am unable to reject a null hypothesis of exact coverage in large\nsamples.

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, traffic congestion has continuously plagued the\nnation's transportation system creating several negative impacts including\nlonger travel times, increased pollution rates, and higher collision risks. To\novercome these challenges, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) aim to\nimprove mobility and vehicular systems, ensuring higher levels of safety by\nutilizing cutting-edge technologies, sophisticated sensing capabilities, and\ninnovative algorithms. Drivers' participatory sensing, current/future location\nreporting, and machine learning algorithms have considerably improved real-time\ncongestion monitoring and future traffic management. However, each driver's\nsensitive spatiotemporal location information can create serious privacy\nconcerns. To address these challenges, we propose in this paper a secure,\nprivacy-preserving location reporting and traffic forecasting system that\nguarantees privacy protection of driver data while maintaining high traffic\nforecasting accuracy. Our novel k-anonymity scheme utilizes functional\nencryption to aggregate encrypted location information submitted by drivers\nwhile ensuring the privacy of driver location data. Additionally, using the\naggregated encrypted location information as input, this research proposes a\ndeep learning model that incorporates a Convolutional-Long Short-Term Memory\n(Conv-LSTM) module to capture spatial and short-term temporal features and a\nBidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) module to recover long-term\nperiodic patterns for traffic forecasting. With extensive evaluation on real\ndatasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with less\nthan 10% mean absolute error for a 60-minute forecasting horizon, all while\nprotecting driver privacy.",

It was argued that the overall contributions of\nspectrally unstable quasinormal modes conspire to produce stable observables\nthrough collective interference effects. In this regard, the present study\ninvestigates the Regge poles, the underlying quantities of the greybody factor\ngoverned by the singularities in the complex angular momentum plane, for\nperturbed black hole metrics. To this end, we generalize the matrix method to\nevaluate the Regge poles in black hole metrics with discontinuities. To verify\nour approach, the numerical results are compared with those obtained using a\nmodified version of the continued fraction method. The obtained Regge pole\nspectrum is then used to calculate the scattering amplitude and cross-section.\nWe show that the stability of these observables at moderate frequencies can be\nreadily interpreted in terms of the stability of the Regge pole spectrum,\nparticularly the low-lying modes. Nonetheless, destabilization still occurs at\nhigher frequencies, characterized by the emergence of a bifurcation in the\nspectrum. The latter further evolves, leading to more significant deformation\nin the Regge poles, triggered by ultraviolet metric perturbations moving\nfurther away from the black hole. However, based on the validity of the WKB\napproximation, it is argued that such an instability in the spectrum is not\nexpected to cause significant observable implications.",

    "abstract": "An optical lattice is a periodic light crystal constructed from the\nstanding-wave interference patterns of laser beams. It can be used to store and\nmanipulate quantum degenerate atoms and is an ideal platform for the quantum\nsimulation of many-body physics. A principal feature is that optical lattices\nare flexible and possess a variety of multidimensional geometries with\nmodifiable band-structure. An even richer landscape emerges when control\nfunctions can be applied to the lattice by modulating the position or amplitude\nwith Floquet driving. However, the desire for realizing high-modulation\nbandwidths while preserving extreme lattice stability has been difficult to\nachieve. In this paper, we demonstrate an effective solution that consists of\noverlapping two counterpropagating lattice beams and controlling the phase and\nintensity of each with independent acousto-optic modulators. Our phase\ncontroller mixes sampled light from both lattice beams with a common optical\nreference. This dual heterodyne locking method allows exquisite determination\nof the lattice position, while also removing parasitic phase noise accrued as\nthe beams travel along separate paths. We report up to 50dB suppression in\nlattice phase noise in the 0.1Hz - 1Hz band along with significant suppression\nspanning more than four decades of frequency. When integrated, the absolute\nphase diffusion of the lattice position is only 10\\r{A} over 10 s. This method\npermits precise, high-bandwidth modulation (above 50kHz) of the optical lattice\nintensity and phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by executing\nintricate time-varying phase profiles for atom interferometry.",

Using causal pixel models\nto extract light curves and the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram to identify\nrotation signals, we quantify the empirical uncertainties, reliability, and\ncompleteness of TESS rotation period measurements.

    "abstract": "We present a novel way in which effective field theory (EFT) can break down\nin cosmological string backgrounds depending on the behavior of the quantum\ngravity cutoff in infinite distance limits, known as the species scale\n$\\Lambda_s$. Namely, EFT can break down if the species scale $\\Lambda_s$ falls\noff so rapidly as the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) scale factor grows from\nsome initial value $a_i$ to some final value $a_f$ that the physical momentum\nof an initial Hubble-sized perturbation $\\sim H_i^{-1}$ grows to exceed the\nspecies scale. For EFT to remain valid, a new condition $H_i \\frac{a_i}{a_f}\n\\ll \\Lambda_{s,f}$ must hold, which is distinct from Trans-Planckian conditions\ndiscussed in the literature. Using the universal relation $\\frac{\\nabla m}{m}\n\\cdot \\frac{\\nabla \\Lambda_s}{\\Lambda_s} = \\frac{1}{d-2}$ in the infinite\ndistance limits of moduli space where $m$ is the mass scale of the lightest\ntower and $\\nabla$ measures variations with respect to the canonical metric on\nmoduli space, we show that spatially flat FRW solutions in the string landscape\nviolate this condition or at best marginally satisfy it. However, we find that\nsufficiently large negative spatial curvature always avoids a breakdown. To\navoid EFT breakdown, we derive an upper bound on the duration of quasi-de\nSitter expansion that classically evolves to decelerated expansion. Our bound\nis proportional to the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) bound, with\nthe advantage that it applies to any FRW solution in the string landscape.\nFinally, we distinguish EFT breakdown from TCC violation, the latter being a\nquantum gravity constraint rather than an EFT limitation. Perhaps our most\nsurprising finding is that in any flat FRW solution that develops a weakly\ncoupled string at future infinity the EFT inevitably breaks down.",

    "abstract": "The epoch of reionisation is a key phase in the cosmic history, characterised\nby the ionisation of the intergalactic medium by the first luminous sources. In\nthis work, we constrain the reionisation history of the Universe using data\nfrom the cosmic microwave background, more specifically the latest Planck\ndataset (Public Data Release 4, PR4). We investigate a wide range of\nreionisation models, from simple parametric descriptions to more flexible\nnon-parametric approaches, systematically evaluating their impact on the\ninferred constraints. Special attention is given to implicit priors introduced\nby each model and their influence on the derived reionisation optical depth\n$\\tau$. To achieve this, we employ both Bayesian and frequentist methods to\nderive robust constraints. We obtain consistent estimates of $\\tau$ across\nmodels, highlighting the robustness of the constraints on the integrated\noptical depth derived from Planck PR4 data. The posterior mean averaged across\nmodels is $\\tau = 0.0576 \\pm 0.0060$, while the average best-fit value, $\\tau =\n0.0581$, reflects the presence of small volume effects. Based on our analysis,\nwe estimate that an additional uncertainty, associated with the modelling of\nreionisation, contributes an error of approximately\n$\\sigma_\\tau\\!\\sim\\!0.0006$. Beyond the integrated optical depth, our analysis\nreveals that the inferred ionisation fraction as a function of redshift is\nhighly model-dependent. While current CMB data do not favour significant early\nionisation, they are consistent with a modest contribution from ionised gas at\nvery early times ($z>15$). Although indicative upper bounds can be placed on\nsuch contributions, these limits remain strongly dependent on the assumed\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "The phasing for compact binary systems on circular orbits was obtained in\narXiv:2304.11185 at fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order thanks to\ntwo main ingredients: the 4PN conservative energy (associated to a nonradiative\nspacetime) in terms of the orbital frequency and the 4.5PN flux in terms of the\nwaveform frequency (i.e., the half-frequency of the $(\\ell,m)=(2,2)$ mode).\nWhen obtaining the phasing, a key physical postulate was made: the expression\nof the binding energy in terms of the waveform frequency was assumed to be\nidentical to the expression of the conservative energy in terms of the orbital\nfrequency. This postulate was necessary to ensure that the frequency evolution\nobtained through the flux-balance law (which involves the binding energy) was\nindependent of the choice of spacetime foliation. In this work, I show that the\nbinding energy entering the flux-balance law differs from the 4PN conservative\nenergy by a 4PN pseudo-Schott term, associated with radiation-reaction effects\ndue to gravitational tails. Unlike the usual Schott terms (at 2.5PN, 3.5PN and\n4.5PN), the pseudo-Schott term is not a total derivative and is in fact\nhereditary, so it does not vanish for circular orbits. Remarkably, the binding\nenergy thus obtained is in perfect agreement with the one obtained using the\naforementioned physical postulate, which confirms that the 4.5PN phasing\nassociated to the waveform frequency computed in arXiv:2304.11185 is indeed\ncorrect. This result is extended to the other Poincar\\'e invariants, and\n`thermodynamic' relations between the binding energy and angular momentum are\nestablished. Finally, the chirp and phasing associated to the orbital frequency\nare presented at 4.5PN, including horizon-absorption effects.",

Our goal\nis to determine if Class 0/I disks reach the conditions needed to form\nplanetesimals ($\\sim 100$km planet building blocks) by the streaming\ninstability (SI). We focus on a recent suggestion that early infall causes an\n``inflationary'' phase in which dust grains are advected outward. We modified\nthe \\texttt{DustPy} code to build a 1D disk that includes dust evolution,\ninfall, and heating and cooling sources. We ran six models and examined the\nimplications for the SI, taking into account recent works on how the SI\nresponds to external turbulence. In line with other works, we find that grains\nare advected outward, which leads to ``advection-condensation-drift'' loop that\ngreatly enhances the dust density at the water snowline. However, we do not see\nthis process at the silicate line. Instead, we find a new pile up at the edge\nof the expanding disk. However, despite these localized enhancements, even a\nmodest amount of turbulence ($\\alpha = 10^{-3}$) leaves planetesimal formation\nfar out of reach. The midplane dust-to-gas ratio is at least an order of\nmagnitude below the SI threshold, even taking into account recent results on\nhow dust coagulation boosts the SI.

Our key innovation lies in leveraging a visual model as its backbone\nand performing feasibility checking and test-time optimization based on\nphysical constraints derived from tactile and proprioceptive observations.\nSpecifically, we model the gripper-object interaction as a spring-mass system,\nwhere tactile sensors induce attractive forces, and proprioception generates\nrepulsive forces. We validate our framework through experiments on a real-world\nrobot setup, demonstrating its effectiveness across representative visual\nbackbones and manipulation scenarios, including grasping, object picking, and\nbimanual handover. Compared to the visual models, our approach overcomes some\ndrastic failure modes while tracking the in-hand object pose. In our\nexperiments, our approach shows an average increase of 55% in AUC of ADD-S and\n60% in ADD, along with an 80% lower position error compared to FoundationPose.",

We design\na spatially multiplexed pattern of polarization that can be robustly and\nuniquely decoded for shape reconstruction by quantizing the AoLP values. At the\nsame time, our spatial-multiplexing enables single-shot ellipsometry of linear\npolarization by projecting differently polarized light within a local region,\nwhich separates the specular and diffuse reflections for BRDF estimation. We\nachieve this spatial polarization multiplexing with a constrained de Bruijn\nsequence.

    "abstract": "We present a topological mechanism for superconductivity emerging from\nChern-2 insulators. While, naively, time-reversal symmetry breaking is expected\nto prevent superconductivity, it turns out that the opposite is the case: An\nexplicit model calculation for a generalized attractive-U Haldane-Hubbard model\ndemonstrates that superconductivity is only stabilized near the quantum\nanomalous Hall state, but not near a trivial, time-reversal symmetric band\ninsulator. As standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like mean-field theory fails\nto capture any superconducting state, we explain this using an effective\nfractionalized field theory involving fermionic chargeons, bosonic colorons and\nan emergent U(1) gauge field. When the chargeons form a gapped topological band\nstructure, the proliferation of single monopoles of this gauge field is\nforbidden. However, long-ranged monopole-antimonopole correlations emerge, and\nwe argue that those correspond to superconducting order. Using random phase\napproximation on top of extensive slave-rotor mean-field calculations we\ncharacterize coherence length and stiffness of the superconductor. Thereby, we\ndeduce the phase diagram in parameter space and furthermore discuss the effect\nof doping, temperature and an external magnetic field. We complement the\nfractionalized theory with calculations using an effective spin model and\nGutzwiller projected wavefunctions. While mostly based on a simple toy model,\nwe argue that our findings contribute to a better understanding of\nsuperconductivity emerging out of spin- and valley polarized rhombohedral\ngraphene multilayers in a parameter regime with nearby quantum anomalous Hall\ninsulators.",

In this survey, we systematically\nintroduce the field of tabular representation learning, covering the\nbackground, challenges, and benchmarks, along with the pros and cons of using\nDNNs. We organize existing methods into three main categories according to\ntheir generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general\nmodels. Specialized models focus on tasks where training and evaluation occur\nwithin the same data distribution. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy for\nspecialized models based on the key aspects of tabular data -- features,\nsamples, and objectives -- and delve into detailed strategies for obtaining\nhigh-quality feature- and sample-level representations. Transferable models are\npre-trained on one or more datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on downstream\ntasks, leveraging knowledge acquired from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources,\nor even cross-modalities such as vision and language. General models, also\nknown as tabular foundation models, extend this concept further, allowing\ndirect application to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. We group these\ngeneral models based on the strategies used to adapt across heterogeneous\ndatasets. Additionally, we explore ensemble methods, which integrate the\nstrengths of multiple tabular models.

Consequently, identifying an optimal\npre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its\nsignificant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges,\nwe propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an\nautomated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a\npre-training setting.

Such data\nis difficult to assemble precisely because it is difficult to reconstruct in a\nscalable way. To overcome this challenge, we propose a scalable framework\ncombining pseudo-synthetic renderings from 3D city-wide meshes (e.g., Google\nEarth) with real, ground-level crowd-sourced images (e.g., MegaDepth). The\npseudo-synthetic data simulates a wide range of aerial viewpoints, while the\nreal, crowd-sourced images help improve visual fidelity for ground-level images\nwhere mesh-based renderings lack sufficient detail, effectively bridging the\ndomain gap between real images and pseudo-synthetic renderings.

For\nexample, we observe that baseline DUSt3R localizes fewer than 5% of\naerial-ground pairs within 5 degrees of camera rotation error, while\nfine-tuning with our data raises accuracy to nearly 56%, addressing a major\nfailure point in handling large viewpoint changes.

Observing this background is\nchallenging due to the weakness of the signal and the simultaneous presence of\nan astrophysical background generated by many unresolved late-time sources. One\npossible way to distinguish between the two is to examine their anisotropies.\nIn this paper we calculate the primordial correlation function of gravitational\nwave anisotropies in the cosmological background generated by axion inflation,\nwhere the inflaton is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson coupled to gauge fields.\nIn this scenario, tensor modes arise not only from the standard amplification\nof vacuum fluctuations present in any inflationary model, but also from the\ninverse decay process of the produced gauge fields. The correlator of\ngravitational wave anisotropies consists therefore of two main components: the\ncontribution from vacuum tensor modes and the contribution from tensor modes\nsourced by the gauge fields. Our analysis shows that, while the former,\npreviously studied in the literature, is negligible, the one arising from the\nsourced tensor modes, normalized by the fractional energy density at\ninterferometer frequencies, can reach values as large as\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$.

While recent advances in 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) have enabled fast and high-quality scene reconstruction,\nresearch has also explored incorporating open-vocabulary understanding into\n3DGS. However, most existing methods require iterative optimization over\nper-view 2D semantic feature maps, which not only results in inefficiencies but\nalso leads to inconsistent 3D semantics across views. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a training-free framework that constructs a\nsuperpoint graph directly from Gaussian primitives. The superpoint graph\npartitions the scene into spatially compact and semantically coherent regions,\nforming view-consistent 3D entities and providing a structured foundation for\nopen-vocabulary understanding. Based on the graph structure, we design an\nefficient reprojection strategy that lifts 2D semantic features onto the\nsuperpoints, avoiding costly multi-view iterative training. The resulting\nrepresentation ensures strong 3D semantic coherence and naturally supports\nhierarchical understanding, enabling both coarse- and fine-grained\nopen-vocabulary perception within a unified semantic field. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nopen-vocabulary segmentation performance, with semantic field reconstruction\ncompleted over $30\\times$ faster.

The circuit\nlocalization track compares methods that locate the model components - and\nconnections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g.,\nattribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable\nlocalization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g.,\nsparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and align\nthose features to a task-relevant causal variable. Using MIB, we find that\nattribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit localization.\nFor causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS method\nperforms best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e.,\nnon-featurized hidden vectors.

The framework assumes a set of source tasks\n(cultivars) where each has associated primary labels (cold hardiness) and\nauxiliary labels (phenology).

The goal of TAL is to predict\nprimary labels for the target task via transfer from the source tasks.\nSurprisingly, despite the vast literature on transfer learning, to our\nknowledge, the TAL formulation has not been previously addressed.

Ensuring interpretability is crucial, especially for\nreal-world applications requiring transparency and accountability. Existing\nvideo XAI methods primarily rely on feature attribution or static textual\nconcepts, both of which struggle to capture motion dynamics and temporal\ndependencies essential for action understanding. To address these challenges,\nwe propose Pose Concept Bottleneck for Explainable Action Recognition (PCBEAR),\na novel concept bottleneck framework that introduces human pose sequences as\nmotion-aware, structured concepts for video action recognition. Unlike methods\nbased on pixel-level features or static textual descriptions, PCBEAR leverages\nhuman skeleton poses, which focus solely on body movements, providing robust\nand interpretable explanations of motion dynamics. We define two types of\npose-based concepts: static pose concepts for spatial configurations at\nindividual frames, and dynamic pose concepts for motion patterns across\nmultiple frames. To construct these concepts, PCBEAR applies clustering to\nvideo pose sequences, allowing for automatic discovery of meaningful concepts\nwithout manual annotation. We validate PCBEAR on KTH, Penn-Action, and HAA500,\nshowing that it achieves high classification performance while offering\ninterpretable, motion-driven explanations.

    "abstract": "A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to\nsyntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally\nframed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting\ndistribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution\n-- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for\ncontrolled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC\nframework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific\nconstraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational\nresources in light of new information during the course of generation. By\ncomparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains\n-- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and\nmolecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach\nallows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger,\nas well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic\nperspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better\napproximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework\nof Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic\nprogramming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a\nbroad variety of controlled generation problems.",

    "abstract": "Data visualisation is a fundamental tool in statistical analysis, enabling\nthe identification of patterns and relationships that might otherwise remain\nhidden in raw data. One of the most famous historical examples is John Snow's\n1854 cholera map, which demonstrated the spatial clustering of cholera cases\naround a contaminated water pump in London. This study explores how Snow's\nvisualisation can be effectively incorporated into statistics education as an\ninteractive case study. Using R, we outline the steps involved in reproducing\nSnow's cholera map, demonstrating geospatial data manipulation, visualisation\ntechniques, and spatial analysis. We discuss the pedagogical benefits of\nhistorical case studies in statistics courses, emphasising their role in\nfostering curiosity, critical thinking, and technical proficiency.\nAdditionally, we explore how these methods can be extended beyond epidemiology\nto applications in public health, urban analytics and environmental science. By\nintegrating historical datasets with modern computational tools, educators can\ncreate engaging, hands-on learning experiences that reinforce core statistical\nprinciples while illustrating the real-world impact of data analysis.",

Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to\na 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard\nRMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined\nrewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking.

First predicted in 1998, electronic nematicity has been established\nin a variety of materials, including two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in\nmagnetic fields, copper-oxide superconductors, and Fe-based superconductors. A\nlong-standing open question is what physical mechanisms drive electronic\nnematic order. In BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and highly underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$,\nstrong evidence suggests that nematicity arises from vestigial\nspin-density-wave (SDW) order. However, evidence for nematicity associated with\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) order has been less conclusive, particularly in\nsystems near a superconducting state. Here, we present direct evidence for\nCDW-driven nematic fluctuations in the pnictide superconductor\nBa$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$ (BSNA), a Ni-based homologue of Fe-based\nsuperconductors that exhibits CDW rather than SDW order. Previous\nelastoresistance studies have shown that BSNA displays a large nematic\nsusceptibility-linked to a six-fold enhancement of superconductivity-within a\nregion of the phase diagram occupied by an incommensurate CDW. Using x-ray\nscattering under uniaxial strain, we demonstrate that even minimal strain\nlevels ($\\epsilon \\sim 10^{-4}$) significantly break the fourfold symmetry of\nthe CDW. Within a Ginzburg-Landau framework, we define a nematic susceptibility\nbased on the asymmetric response of symmetry-related CDW superlattice\nreflections, showing strong agreement with elastoresistivity measurements. Our\nstudy provides the first clear demonstration of a direct link between charge\norder and a nematic state, offering key insights into the intertwined\nsuperconducting phases of these materials.",

This\npaper derives surface density distributions for circumplanetary disks during\nthe final stage of evolution when most of the mass is accreted. This approach\ngeneralizes previous treatments to include the angular momentum bias for the\ninfalling material, more accurate solutions for the incoming trajectories,\ncorrections to the outer boundary condition of the circumplanetary disk, and\nthe adjustment of newly added material as it becomes incorporated into the\nKeplerian flow of the pre-existing disk. These generalizations lead to smaller\ncentrifugal radii, higher column density for the surrounding envelopes, and\nhigher disk accretion efficiency. In addition, we explore the consequences of\ndifferent angular distributions for the incoming material at the outer\nboundary, with the concentration of the incoming flow varying from polar to\nisotropic to equatorial. These geometric variations modestly affect the disk\nsurface density, but also lead to substantial modification to the location in\nthe disk where the mass accretion rate changes sign. This paper finds analytic\nsolutions for the orbits, source functions, surface density distributions, and\nthe corresponding disk temperature profiles over the expanded parameter space\noutlined above.",

FreshStack conducts the following steps: (1) automatic\ncorpus collection from code and technical documentation, (2) nugget generation\nfrom community-asked questions and answers, and (3) nugget-level support,\nretrieving documents using a fusion of retrieval techniques and hybrid\narchitectures. We use FreshStack to build five datasets on fast-growing,\nrecent, and niche topics to ensure the tasks are sufficiently challenging. On\nFreshStack, existing retrieval models, when applied out-of-the-box,\nsignificantly underperform oracle approaches on all five topics, denoting\nplenty of headroom to improve IR quality. In addition, we identify cases where\nrerankers do not improve first-stage retrieval accuracy (two out of five\ntopics) and oracle context helps an LLM generator generate a high-quality RAG\nanswer. We hope FreshStack will facilitate future work toward constructing\nrealistic, scalable, and uncontaminated IR and RAG evaluation benchmarks.",

To overcome these\nlimitations, this work proposes MemFormer, a lightweight and memory-enhanced\ntransformer. MemFormer introduces a memory-enhanced multi-head attention\nmechanism that iteratively refines a dynamic memory module, enhancing feature\nextraction while reducing redundancy across layers. Additionally, a dynamic\nmemory enrichment strategy progressively captures complex spatial and spectral\ndependencies, leading to more expressive feature representations. To further\nimprove structural consistency, we incorporate a spatial-spectral positional\nencoding (SSPE) tailored for HSI data, ensuring continuity without the\ncomputational burden of convolution-based approaches.

However, existing training\nparadigms for multimodal large language models heavily rely on high-quality\nimage-text pairs. As models and data scales grow exponentially, the\navailability of such meticulously curated data has become increasingly scarce\nand saturated, thereby severely limiting further advancements in this domain.\nThis study investigates scalable caption generation techniques for\nvision-language model pre-training and demonstrates that large-scale\nlow-hallucination synthetic captions can serve dual purposes: 1) acting as a\nviable alternative to real-world data for pre-training paradigms and 2)\nachieving superior performance enhancement when integrated into vision-language\nmodels through empirical validation. This paper presents following key\ncontributions: 1) a novel pipeline for generating high-quality,\nlow-hallucination, and knowledge-rich synthetic captions. Our continuous DPO\nmethodology yields remarkable results in reducing hallucinations. Specifically,\nthe non-hallucination caption rate on a held-out test set increases from 48.3%\nto 77.9% for a 7B-size model. 2) Comprehensive empirical validation reveals\nthat our synthetic captions confer superior pre-training advantages over their\ncounterparts. Across 15 vision language tasks, the model trained with our data\nachieves a significant performance gain of at least 6.2% compared to identical\nimages with alt-text. In 20 common cognitive domains, the model trained with\nour data outperforms the alt-text data by at least 7.5%. Meanwhile, it also\noffers considerable support in the text-to-image domain.

This oversimplification overlooks the contextual\nsignificance of object relationships-for example, a wedding ring on a\nnightstand might suggest marital conflict, yet is treated as just \"two objects\"\nin space. To address this, we explored integrating Vision Language Models\n(VLMs) into AR pipelines. However, several challenges emerged: First, stories\ngenerated with simple prompt guidance lacked narrative depth and spatial usage.\nSecond, spatial semantics were underutilized, failing to support meaningful\nstorytelling. Third, pre-generated scripts struggled to align with AR\nFoundation's object naming and coordinate systems. We propose a scene-driven AR\nstorytelling framework that reimagines environments as active narrative agents,\nbuilt on three innovations: 1. State-aware object semantics: We decompose\nobject meaning into physical, functional, and metaphorical layers, allowing\nVLMs to distinguish subtle narrative cues between similar objects. 2.\nStructured narrative interface: A bidirectional JSON layer maps VLM-generated\nmetaphors to AR anchors, maintaining spatial and semantic coherence. 3.

Our\nfindings show that the system can generate stories from the environment itself,\nnot just place them on top of it.

In this study, we\nevaluate the performance of a range of machine learning algorithms, including\nbinary classification and anomaly detection techniques, for predicting\nBVD-positive herds using highly imbalanced herd-level data. We conduct an\nextensive simulation study to assess model performance across varying sample\nsizes and class imbalance ratios, incorporating resampling, class weighting,\nand appropriate evaluation metrics (sensitivity, positive predictive value,\nF1-score and AUC values). Random forests and XGBoost models consistently\noutperformed other methods, with the random forest model achieving the highest\nsensitivity and AUC across scenarios, including real-world prediction of 2023\nherd status, correctly identifying 219 of 250 positive herds while halving the\nnumber of herds that require compared to a blanket-testing strategy.",

Additionally, the polarization intensity of the EMWs may be\nweakened due to depolarization effects. In this study, we calculate the\nenhanced GW-EMW conversion in inhomogeneous magnetized plasma during the\npropagation of GWs through the Universe and our galaxy. We analyze the\npolarization states of the EMWs generated by polarized GWs and discuss the\ndepolarization effects induced by the medium's irregularities, as well as the\ndifferential Faraday rotation occurring in multilayer polarized radiation.

Extensive evaluations over the\nnuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios,\ndemonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nsubstantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics.

G3 groups span $M_{\\rm\nhalo}=10^{11-14.5}\\,M_\\odot$ with comprehensive HI and AGN information, which\nwe combine with X-ray stacking of ROSAT All-Sky data.

At fixed halo\nmass, $M_{\\rm\\,HI,grp}/M_{\\rm halo}$ transitions to greater spread below\n$t_{\\rm cross}\\sim2$ Gyr.

The\ndevelopment of deep learning provides new opportunities for UATR, but faces\nchallenges brought by the scarcity of reference samples and complex\nenvironmental interference. To address these issues, we proposes a multi-task\nbalanced channel attention convolutional neural network (MT-BCA-CNN). The\nmethod integrates a channel attention mechanism with a multi-task learning\nstrategy, constructing a shared feature extractor and multi-task classifiers to\njointly optimize target classification and feature reconstruction tasks.

Experiments on\nthe Watkins Marine Life Dataset demonstrate that MT-BCA-CNN achieves 97\\%\nclassification accuracy and 95\\% $F1$-score in 27-class few-shot scenarios,\nsignificantly outperforming traditional CNN and ACNN models, as well as popular\nstate-of-the-art UATR methods. Ablation studies confirm the synergistic\nbenefits of multi-task learning and attention mechanisms, while a dynamic\nweighting adjustment strategy effectively balances task contributions.

A custom dataset was developed featuring\nboth single-class (greenfruit) and multi-class (occluded and non-occluded\ngreenfruits) annotations to assess model performance under dynamic real-world\nconditions. RF-DETR object detection model, utilizing a DINOv2 backbone and\ndeformable attention, excelled in global context modeling, effectively\nidentifying partially occluded or ambiguous greenfruits. In contrast, YOLOv12\nleveraged CNN-based attention for enhanced local feature extraction, optimizing\nit for computational efficiency and edge deployment.

For multi-class\ndetection, RF-DETR led with an mAP@50 of 0.8298, showing its capability to\ndifferentiate between occluded and non-occluded fruits, while YOLOv12L scored\nhighest in mAP@50:95 with 0.6622, indicating better classification in detailed\nocclusion contexts. Training dynamics analysis highlighted RF-DETR's swift\nconvergence, particularly in single-class settings where it plateaued within 10\nepochs, demonstrating the efficiency of transformer-based architectures in\nadapting to dynamic visual data.

    "abstract": "Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) faces significant challenges due to\nhardware noise and the presence of barren plateaus and local traps in the\noptimization landscape. To mitigate the detrimental effects of these issues, we\nintroduce a general formalism that optimizes hardware resource utilization and\naccuracy by projecting VQE optimizations on to a reduced-dimensional subspace,\nfollowed by a set of posteriori corrections. Our method partitions the ansatz\ninto a lower dimensional principal subspace and a higher-dimensional auxiliary\nsubspace based on a conjecture of temporal hierarchy present among the\nparameters during optimization. The adiabatic approximation exploits this\nhierarchy, restricting optimization to the lower dimensional principal subspace\nonly. This is followed by an efficient higher dimensional auxiliary space\nreconstruction without the need to perform variational optimization. These\nreconstructed auxiliary parameters are subsequently included in the\ncost-function via a set of auxiliary subspace corrections (ASC) leading to a\n\"plummeting effect\" in the energy landscape toward a more optimal minima\nwithout utilizing any additional quantum hardware resources. Numerical\nsimulations show that, when integrated with any chemistry-inspired ansatz, our\nmethod can provide one to two orders of magnitude better estimation of the\nminima. Additionally, based on the adiabatic approximation, we introduce a\nnovel initialization strategy driven by unitary rotation generators for\naccelerated convergence of gradient-informed dynamic quantum algorithms.

    "abstract": "Video Anomaly Detection~(VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies within videos.\nSupervised methods require an amount of in-domain training data and often\nstruggle to generalize to unseen anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods\nleverage the intrinsic world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to\ndetect anomalies but face challenges in localizing fine-grained visual\ntransitions and diverse events. Therefore, we propose EventVAD, an event-aware\nvideo anomaly detection framework that combines tailored dynamic graph\narchitectures and multimodal LLMs through temporal-event reasoning.\nSpecifically, EventVAD first employs dynamic spatiotemporal graph modeling with\ntime-decay constraints to capture event-aware video features. Then, it performs\nadaptive noise filtering and uses signal ratio thresholding to detect event\nboundaries via unsupervised statistical features. The statistical boundary\ndetection module reduces the complexity of processing long videos for MLLMs and\nimproves their temporal reasoning through event consistency. Finally, it\nutilizes a hierarchical prompting strategy to guide MLLMs in performing\nreasoning before determining final decisions. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets. The results demonstrate\nthat EventVAD with a 7B MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in training-free\nsettings, outperforming strong baselines that use 7B or larger MLLMs.",

Pure\ndata-driven approaches promise robust performance but suffer from low sample\nefficiency, sim-to-real gaps, and reliance on extensive datasets. Hybrid\nmethods combining learning-based and traditional model-based control in an\nend-to-end manner offer a promising alternative. This work presents a\nself-supervised learning framework combining learning-based inertial odometry\n(IO) module and differentiable model predictive control (d-MPC) for Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) attitude control. The IO denoises raw IMU measurements and\npredicts UAV attitudes, which are then optimized by MPC for control actions in\na bi-level optimization (BLO) setup, where the inner MPC optimizes control\nactions and the upper level minimizes discrepancy between real-world and\npredicted performance. The framework is thus end-to-end and can be trained in a\nself-supervised manner. This approach combines the strength of learning-based\nperception with the interpretable model-based control.

We map out the\nin-situ velocity distribution using particle imaging velocimetry. Beyond a\ncertain velocity threshold, we observe large stress fluctuation events with\ngradual stress build-up followed by sudden stress drop indicating the storage\nand release of elastic energy. The length scale constructed from the stress\nbuild-up time scale and the probe's velocity match the length scale of\nextensile deformation in the sample just before the stress drop, further\nconfirming the strong correlation of such storage and release of energy with\nthe unstable motion of the probe. Interestingly, despite their significant\ndifference in magnitudes, the Weissenberg number ($Wi$) for the onset of flow\ninstability obtained from the shear and extensile components remains almost the\nsame. We also find that the turbulent motion of the probe at higher $Wi$\nresults from the complex mixing of the stick-slip events originating from the\npartial release of the stored elastic energy.

We instead consider multiple factors\nsimultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and\nMisinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and\nrealistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including\nambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent\napproach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple\nrounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to\ndisambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby\nhandling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which\nrequires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over\nstrong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires\nsuppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with\nLlama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for\nexisting RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match\nscore). While MADAM-RAG begins to address these conflicting factors, our\nanalysis indicates that a substantial gap remains especially when increasing\nthe level of imbalance in supporting evidence and misinformation.",

PCA induces a signal loss in the estimated power\nspectrum, which can be corrected by a transfer function (TF). By injecting mock\nsignals of HI into the data and performing the PCA cleaning, we can use the\ncleaned mock HI signal to cross-correlate with the original mock, and estimate\nthe signal loss as a TF, ${T}(\\vec{k})$. As expected, a correction of ${T}\n(\\vec{k})^{-1}$ restores the cross-power between the HI and optical galaxies.\nHowever, contrary to intuition, the HI autopower also requires a\n${T}(\\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction, not ${T}(\\vec{k})^{-2}$. The\n${T}(\\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction is only known empirically through simulations.\nIn this Letter, we show that the ${T}(\\vec{k})^{-1}$ correction in autopower is\nuniversal, and can be analytically proven using the quadratic estimator\nformalism through window function normalization. The normalization can also be\nused to determine the TF correction for any type of linear process.

The orbit of $x^{\\lambda}$ under the action of\n$\\mathcal{S}_{N}$ (by permutation of coordinates) spans a module $V_{\\lambda}%\n$, the representation induced from the identity representation of $G_{n}$. The\nspace $V_{\\lambda}$ decomposes into a direct sum of irreducible $\\mathcal{S}%\n_{N}$-modules. The spherical function is defined for each of these, it is the\ncharacter of the module averaged over the group $G_{n}$. This paper concerns\nthe value of certain spherical functions evaluated at a cycle which has no more\nthan one entry in each of the three intervals $I_{j}=\\left\\{\ni:\\lambda_{i}=d_{j}\\right\\} ,1\\leq j\\leq3$.

Echocardiography probe guidance systems,\nwhich provide real-time movement instructions for acquiring standard plane\nimages, offer a promising solution for AI-assisted or fully autonomous\nscanning. However, developing effective machine learning models for this task\nremains challenging, as they must grasp heart anatomy and the intricate\ninterplay between probe motion and visual signals. To address this, we present\nEchoWorld, a motion-aware world modeling framework for probe guidance that\nencodes anatomical knowledge and motion-induced visual dynamics, while\neffectively leveraging past visual-motion sequences to enhance guidance\nprecision. EchoWorld employs a pre-training strategy inspired by world modeling\nprinciples, where the model predicts masked anatomical regions and simulates\nthe visual outcomes of probe adjustments. Built upon this pre-trained model, we\nintroduce a motion-aware attention mechanism in the fine-tuning stage that\neffectively integrates historical visual-motion data, enabling precise and\nadaptive probe guidance. Trained on more than one million ultrasound images\nfrom over 200 routine scans, EchoWorld effectively captures key\nechocardiographic knowledge, as validated by qualitative analysis. Moreover,\nour method significantly reduces guidance errors compared to existing visual\nbackbones and guidance frameworks, excelling in both single-frame and\nsequential evaluation protocols.

While electric buses have already been\nadopted in several cities, regional bus lines may pose additional challenges\ndue to the potentially longer distances they have to travel. In this work, we\nmodel and solve the electric bus scheduling problem, lexicographically\nminimizing the size of the bus fleet, the number of charging stops, and the\ntotal energy consumed, to provide decision support for bus operators planning\nto replace their diesel-powered fleet with zero emission vehicles. We propose a\ngraph representation which allows partial charging without explicitly relying\non time variables and derive 3-index and 2-index mixed-integer linear\nprogramming formulations for the multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling\nproblem. While the 3-index model can be solved by an off-the-shelf solver\ndirectly, the 2-index model relies on an exponential number of constraints to\nensure the correct depot pairing.

On the other hand, this extreme\nlocalization also inevitably amplifies the unwanted noise from the response of\nlocal morphological imperfections, leading to complex spectral variations and\nreduced consistency across the plasmonic nanostructures. Seeking uniform\noptical responses has therefore long been a sought-after goal in\nnanoplasmonics. However, conventional probing techniques by dark-field (DF)\nconfocal microscopy, such as image analysis or spectral measurements, can be\ninaccurate and time-consuming, respectively. Here, we introduce SPARX, a\ndeep-learning-powered paradigm that surpasses conventional imaging and\nspectroscopic capabilities. In particular, SPARX can batch-predict broadband DF\nspectra (e.g., 500-1000 nm) of numerous nanoparticles simultaneously from an\ninformation-limited RGB image (i.e., below 700 nm). It achieves this\nextrapolative inference beyond the camera's capture capabilities by learning\nthe underlying physical relationships among multiple orders of optical\nresonances. The spectral predictions only take milliseconds, achieving a\nspeedup of three to four orders of magnitude compared to traditional spectral\nacquisition, which may take from hours to days. As a proof-of-principle\ndemonstration for screening identical resonances, the selection accuracy\nachieved by SPARX is comparable to that of conventional spectroscopy\ntechniques.

As such, amateur\nusers can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's\nwork and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright\ninfringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually\nimperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles\n(perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in\nthe artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model\nhas been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model\nretraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.\n  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the\ntext-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to\nidentify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of\nspecific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely,\nArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style\nrepresentations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then,\nArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions.\nThe experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that\nArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying\nArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights\ninto the practical implementation.

Supposing that the\nATT is a function of covariates, we estimate it by weighting the inverse of the\npropensity score. In this study, as one way to make the estimation robust to\nthe propensity score modeling, we incorporate covariate balancing. Then, by\nattentively constructing the moment conditions used in the covariate balancing,\nwe show that the proposed estimator is doubly robust. In addition to the\nestimation, we also address model selection. In practice, covariate selection\nis an essential task in statistical analysis, but even in the basic setting of\nthe SDID approach, there are no reasonable information criteria. Here, we\nderive a model selection criterion as an asymptotically bias-corrected\nestimator of risk based on the loss function used in the SDID estimation. We\nshow that a penalty term can be derived that is considerably different from\nalmost twice the number of parameters that often appears in AIC-type\ninformation criteria. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method\nestimates the ATT more robustly compared with the method using propensity\nscores given by maximum likelihood estimation, and that the proposed criterion\nclearly reduces the risk targeted in the SDID approach in comparison with the\nintuitive generalization of the existing information criterion.

To more efficiently adapt to\nground object distributions while extracting image features without introducing\nexcessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes\nEKGNet based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model, consisting of a context-aware\nmapping network and a dynamic kernel generation module. The context-aware\nmapping module translates global contextual information of hyperspectral inputs\ninto instructions for combining base convolutional kernels, while the dynamic\nkernels are composed of K groups of base convolutions, analogous to K different\ntypes of experts specializing in fundamental patterns across various\ndimensions.

This dynamic approach enables the model to focus\nmore flexibly on key spatial structures when processing different regions,\nrather than relying on the fixed receptive field of a single static\nconvolutional kernel. EKGNet enhances model representation capability through a\n3D dynamic expert convolution system without increasing network depth or width.\nThe proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC\ndatasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification\napproaches.",

In interacting bosonic systems, a Bose glass is\nexpected to emerge at low energies as an insulating yet compressible state\nwithout long-range phase coherence. While originally predicted to occur as a\nground-state phase, more recent studies indicate that it exists at finite\ntemperature. A key open challenge has been the direct observation of reduced\nphase coherence in the Bose-glass regime. In this study, we utilize ultracold\nbosonic atoms in a quantum-gas microscope to probe the emergence of the\nBose-glass phase in a two-dimensional square lattice with a site-resolved,\nreproducible disordered potential. We identify the phase through in-situ\ndistribution and particle fluctuations, via a local measurement of the\nEdwards-Anderson parameter. To measure the short-range phase coherence in the\nBose glass, we employ Talbot interferometry in combination with\nsingle-atom-resolved detection. Finally, by driving the system in and out of\nthe Bose-glass phase, we observe signatures for non-ergodic behavior.",

Aims: Here, we reanalyze the published data and\nreproduce previously retrieved molecular abundances based on an independent\ndata reduction and a different retrieval framework. The aim of this study is to\nrefine the understanding of TOI-270 d and highlight considerations for JWST\ndata analysis. Additionally, we test the impact of data resolution on\natmospheric retrieval calculations. Methods: We reduce one JWST NIRSpec G395H\nand one NIRISS SOSS GR700XD transit dataset using the Eureka! pipeline and a\ncustom MCMC-based light curve fitting algorithm at the instruments' native\nresolutions. The atmospheric composition is estimated with the updated BeAR\nretrieval code across a grid of retrieval setups and spectral resolutions.\nResults: Our transit spectrum is consistent with previous studies, except at\nthe red end of the NIRISS data. Our retrievals support a higher mean molecular\nweight atmosphere for TOI-270 d. We provide refined abundance constraints and\nfind statistically favored model extensions indicating either sulfur-rich\nchemistry with species such as CS2, CS, and H2CS, or the possible presence of\nCH3Cl or CH3F. However, Bayesian inference cannot distinguish between these\nscenarios due to similar opacities below 4 microns. Conclusions: Our analysis\nreinforces TOI-270 d as a highly interesting warm sub-Neptune for atmospheric\nstudies, with a complex chemistry in a cloud-free upper atmosphere. However,\nits exact nature remains uncertain and warrants further detailed photochemical\nmodeling and observations.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard for non-invasive\ncardiac assessment, offering rich spatio-temporal views of the cardiac anatomy\nand physiology. Patient-level health factors, such as demographics, metabolic,\nand lifestyle, are known to substantially influence cardiovascular health and\ndisease risk, yet remain uncaptured by CMR alone. To holistically understand\ncardiac health and to enable the best possible interpretation of an\nindividual's disease risk, CMR and patient-level factors must be jointly\nexploited within an integrated framework. Recent multi-modal approaches have\nbegun to bridge this gap, yet they often rely on limited spatio-temporal data\nand focus on isolated clinical tasks, thereby hindering the development of a\ncomprehensive representation for cardiac health evaluation. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce ViTa, a step toward foundation models that delivers a\ncomprehensive representation of the heart and a precise interpretation of\nindividual disease risk. Leveraging data from 42,000 UK Biobank participants,\nViTa integrates 3D+T cine stacks from short-axis and long-axis views, enabling\na complete capture of the cardiac cycle. These imaging data are then fused with\ndetailed tabular patient-level factors, enabling context-aware insights. This\nmulti-modal paradigm supports a wide spectrum of downstream tasks, including\ncardiac phenotype and physiological feature prediction, segmentation, and\nclassification of cardiac and metabolic diseases within a single unified\nframework. By learning a shared latent representation that bridges rich imaging\nfeatures and patient context, ViTa moves beyond traditional, task-specific\nmodels toward a universal, patient-specific understanding of cardiac health,\nhighlighting its potential to advance clinical utility and scalability in\ncardiac analysis.",

This challenge is particularly pronounced\nin partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR), where incorporating more diverse\ncontext representations at varying temporal scales for each video enhances\naccuracy but increases computational and memory costs. To address this\ndichotomy, we propose a prototypical PRVR framework that encodes diverse\ncontexts within a video into a fixed number of prototypes. We then introduce\nseveral strategies to enhance text association and video understanding within\nthe prototypes, along with an orthogonal objective to ensure that the\nprototypes capture a diverse range of content.

The cross-modal\nreconstruction task aligns the prototypes with textual features within a shared\nspace, while the uni-modal reconstruction task preserves all video contexts\nduring encoding. Additionally, we employ a video mixing technique to provide\nweak guidance to further align prototypes and associated textual\nrepresentations.

Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed\ngraph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that\nthe result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little\ndecompression cost.

    "abstract": "This article presents a comprehensive three-dimensional canonical\nquantization to treat quantum plasmonics for finite metallic or dielectric\nmedia of arbitrary shape. We use a microscopic model for the dissipative and\ndispersive medium coupled with the electromagnetic field, which is justified by\nthe fact that if one integrates the degrees of freedom of the medium, one\nobtains the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Its quantization features a\nHamiltonian formulation having the form of two infinite harmonic oscillators\ncharacterized by a double continuum. The diagonalized Hamiltonian is quantized\nby the correspondence principle, introducing creation-annihilation operators in\na bosonic Fock space. The diagonal quantum Hamiltonian is the sum of two terms\ncorresponding to the two continua. The physical observables, like, e.g., the\nelectric field, are also the sum of two terms corresponding to the two\ncontinua, one of which had been omitted in the literature geared for an\ninfinite bulk medium. In a second step, we show that the electric field\noperator can by written as linear combinations of the creation-annihilation\noperators with coefficients that satisfy integral equations of Fredholm type.\nWe show that the solution of these equations can be expressed in terms of the\nclassical Green tensor of the medium satisfying the Sommerfeld radiation\ncondition. Finally, we consider the Purcell effect for the spontaneous emission\nof an atom close to the medium. We show that through an exact compensation of\nsome terms, the Purcell factor for the system with the double continuum is\nproportional to the imaginary part of the Green tensor, which defines the local\ndensity of states. This result has the same form as the one obtained in the\nliterature for bulk systems that involve a single continuum and a small\ndissipative background extending to infinity, and can be seen as a\njustification of this approach.",

    "abstract": "Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution (RSISR) reconstructs high-resolution\n(HR) remote sensing images from low-resolution inputs to support fine-grained\nground object interpretation. Existing methods face three key challenges: (1)\nDifficulty in extracting multi-scale features from spatially heterogeneous RS\nscenes, (2) Limited prior information causing semantic inconsistency in\nreconstructions, and (3) Trade-off imbalance between geometric accuracy and\nvisual quality. To address these issues, we propose the Texture Transfer\nResidual Denoising Dual Diffusion Model (TTRD3) with three innovations: First,\na Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Block (MFAB) employing parallel heterogeneous\nconvolutional kernels for multi-scale feature extraction. Second, a Sparse\nTexture Transfer Guidance (STTG) module that transfers HR texture priors from\nreference images of similar scenes. Third, a Residual Denoising Dual Diffusion\nModel (RDDM) framework combining residual diffusion for deterministic\nreconstruction and noise diffusion for diverse generation. Experiments on\nmulti-source RS datasets demonstrate TTRD3's superiority over state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving 1.43% LPIPS improvement and 3.67% FID enhancement compared\nto best-performing baselines.

    "abstract": "The rise of autonomous AI agents in enterprise and industrial environments\nintroduces a critical challenge: how to securely assign, verify, and manage\ntheir identities across distributed systems. Existing identity frameworks based\non API keys, certificates, or application-layer credentials lack the\ninfrastructure-grade trust, lifecycle control, and interoperability needed to\nmanage agents operating independently in sensitive contexts.\n  In this paper, we propose a conceptual architecture that leverages\ntelecom-grade eSIM infrastructure, specifically hosted by mobile network\noperators (MNOs), to serve as a root of trust for AI agents. Rather than\nembedding SIM credentials in hardware devices, we envision a model where telcos\nhost secure, certified hardware modules (eUICC or HSM) that store and manage\nagent-specific eSIM profiles. Agents authenticate remotely via cryptographic\nAPIs or identity gateways, enabling scalable and auditable access to enterprise\nnetworks and services.\n  We explore use cases such as onboarding enterprise automation agents,\nsecuring AI-driven financial systems, and enabling trust in inter-agent\ncommunications. We identify current limitations in GSMA and 3GPP standards,\nparticularly their device centric assumptions, and propose extensions to\nsupport non-physical, software-based agents within trusted execution\nenvironments. This paper is intended as a conceptual framework to open\ndiscussion around standardization, security architecture, and the role of\ntelecom infrastructure in the evolving agent economy.",

While electron correlation effects in the\nnickelates have been extensively studied, the role of electron-phonon coupling\n(EPC) remains highly controversial. Here, by taking pristine LaNiO$_2$ as an\nexemplar nickelate, we present an in-depth study of EPC for both the\nnon-magnetic (NM) and the $C$-type antiferromagnetic ($C$-AFM) phase using\nadvanced density functional theory methods without invoking $U$ or other free\nparameters. The weak EPC strength $\\lambda$ in the NM phase is found to be\ngreatly enhanced ($\\sim$4$\\times$) due to the presence of magnetism in the\n$C$-AFM phase. This enhancement arises from strong interactions between the\nflat bands associated with the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals and the low-frequency\nphonon modes driven by the vibrations of Ni and La atoms. The resulting phonon\nsoftening is shown to yield a distinctive kink in the electronic structure\naround 15 meV, which would provide an experimentally testable signature of our\npredictions.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have made significant progress in developing large language\nmodels (LLMs) in the medical domain, which can answer expert-level questions\nand demonstrate the potential to assist clinicians in real-world clinical\nscenarios. Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various\nmodalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex\nclinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies\nhave demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer\nquestions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical\ncontext due to the patch-level data with limited information from public\ndatasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the\nscalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we\nintroduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as\nChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using\n10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and\nevaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We\ndemonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using\nChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and\nreports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context\nfrom various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential\nto assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of\nWSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.",

To enable\nfuture photorealistic 3D immersive visual communication applications,\nsignificant compression is essential for transmission over the existing\nInternet infrastructure. Hence, we propose Compressed Gaussian Splatting\n(CompGS++), a novel framework that leverages compact Gaussian primitives to\nachieve accurate 3D modeling with substantial size reduction for both static\nand dynamic scenes. Our design is based on the principle of eliminating\nredundancy both between and within primitives. Specifically, we develop a\ncomprehensive prediction paradigm to address inter-primitive redundancy through\nspatial and temporal primitive prediction modules. The spatial primitive\nprediction module establishes predictive relationships for scene primitives and\nenables most primitives to be encoded as compact residuals, substantially\nreducing the spatial redundancy. We further devise a temporal primitive\nprediction module to handle dynamic scenes, which exploits primitive\ncorrelations across timestamps to effectively reduce temporal redundancy.\nMoreover, we devise a rate-constrained optimization module that jointly\nminimizes reconstruction error and rate consumption. This module effectively\neliminates parameter redundancy within primitives and enhances the overall\ncompactness of scene representations. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that CompGS++ significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, achieving superior compression performance while preserving accurate\nscene modeling.

In the vast\nmajority of cases the main source of information will come from broad-band\nimages and data products thereof. Therefore, there is a pressing need to\nidentify or develop scalable yet reliable methodologies to estimate the\nredshift and physical properties of galaxies using broad-band photometry from\nEuclid, optionally including ground-based optical photometry also. To address\nthis need, we present a novel method to estimate the redshift, stellar mass,\nstar-formation rate, specific star-formation rate, E(B-V), and age of galaxies,\nusing mock Euclid and ground-based photometry. The main novelty of our\nproperty-estimation pipeline is its use of the CatBoost implementation of\ngradient-boosted regression-trees, together with chained regression and an\nintelligent, automatic optimization of the training data. The pipeline also\nincludes a computationally-efficient method to estimate prediction\nuncertainties, and, in the absence of ground-truth labels, provides accurate\npredictions for metrics of model performance up to z~2. We apply our pipeline\nto several datasets consisting of mock Euclid broad-band photometry and mock\nground-based ugriz photometry, to evaluate the performance of our methodology\nfor estimating the redshift and physical properties of galaxies detected in the\nEuclid Wide Survey. The quality of our photometric redshift and physical\nproperty estimates are highly competitive overall, validating our modeling\napproach. We find that the inclusion of ground-based optical photometry\nsignificantly improves the quality of the property estimation, highlighting the\nimportance of combining Euclid data with ancillary ground-based optical data.\n(Abridged)",

    "abstract": "Fetal health monitoring through one-dimensional Doppler ultrasound (DUS)\nsignals offers a cost-effective and accessible approach that is increasingly\ngaining interest. Despite its potential, the development of machine learning\nbased techniques to assess the health condition of mothers and fetuses using\nDUS signals remains limited. This scarcity is primarily due to the lack of\nextensive DUS datasets with a reliable reference for interpretation and data\nimbalance across different gestational ages. In response, we introduce a novel\nautoregressive generative model designed to map fetal electrocardiogram (FECG)\nsignals to corresponding DUS waveforms (Auto-FEDUS). By leveraging a neural\ntemporal network based on dilated causal convolutions that operate directly on\nthe waveform level, the model effectively captures both short and long-range\ndependencies within the signals, preserving the integrity of generated data.\nCross-subject experiments demonstrate that Auto-FEDUS outperforms conventional\ngenerative architectures across both time and frequency domain evaluations,\nproducing DUS signals that closely resemble the morphology of their real\ncounterparts. The realism of these synthesized signals was further gauged using\na quality assessment model, which classified all as good quality, and a heart\nrate estimation model, which produced comparable results for generated and real\ndata, with a Bland-Altman limit of 4.5 beats per minute. This advancement\noffers a promising solution for mitigating limited data availability and\nenhancing the training of DUS-based fetal models, making them more effective\nand generalizable.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a robust high-dimensional sparse canonical correlation\nanalysis (CCA) method for investigating linear relationships between two\nhigh-dimensional random vectors, focusing on elliptical symmetric\ndistributions. Traditional CCA methods, based on sample covariance matrices,\nstruggle in high-dimensional settings, particularly when data exhibit\nheavy-tailed distributions. To address this, we introduce the spatial-sign\ncovariance matrix as a robust estimator, combined with a sparsity-inducing\npenalty to efficiently estimate canonical correlations. Theoretical analysis\nshows that our method is consistent and robust under mild conditions,\nconverging at an optimal rate even in the presence of heavy tails. Simulation\nstudies demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing sparse CCA methods,\nparticularly under heavy-tailed distributions. A real-world application further\nconfirms the method's robustness and efficiency in practice. Our work provides\na novel solution for high-dimensional canonical correlation analysis, offering\nsignificant advantages over traditional methods in terms of both stability and\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an\nindispensable component of general shape analysis. Recently, transformer and\nstate space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud\nlearning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds,\nwhich have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper\npresents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point\ncloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample input into multiple levels\nthrough the farthest point sampling. At each level, we perform a series of\nk-nearest neighbor (KNN) queries to aggregate multi-scale structural\ninformation. To assist SSM in processing point clouds, we introduce\ncoordinate-order and inside-out scanning strategies for efficient serialization\nof irregular points. Point features are calculated progressively from short\nneighbor sequences and long point sequences through vanilla and group Point SSM\nblocks, to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies. To evaluate\nthe proposed method, we build a large-scale medical point cloud dataset named\nMedPointS for anatomy classification, completion, and segmentation. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on MedPointS demonstrate that our method achieves\nsuperior performance across all tasks. The dataset is available at\nhttps://flemme-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/medpoints.html. Code is merged to\na public medical imaging platform: https://github.com/wlsdzyzl/flemme.",

Maternal\nhypoxic event characteristics were analyzed using generalized linear modeling\n(GLM) to assess their associations with different FHR changes.

A longer\nhypoxic duration correlated with more significant FHR accelerations (P < 0.05),\nwhile prolonged hypoxia and greater SpO2 drop were linked to FHR decelerations\n(P < 0.05). Both cohorts showed a transient increase in FHR during maternal\nhypoxia, which returned to baseline after the event resolved. Conclusion:\nMaternal hypoxia significantly affects FHR, suggesting that maternal OSAS may\ncontribute to fetal hypoxia.

Carefully accounting for the\ncombinatorial nature of the complementarity constraints, tractable versions of\nthe Mangasarian Fromovitz Constraint Qualification (MFCQ) have been designed\nand widely studied in the literature. This paper looks closely at two such\nMPCC-MFCQs and their influence on MPCC algorithms. As a key contribution, we\nprove the convergence of the sequential penalisation and Scholtes relaxation\nalgorithms under a relaxed MPCC-MFCQ that is much weaker than the CQs currently\nused in the literature. We then form the problem of tuning hyperparameters of a\nnonlinear Support Vector Machine (SVM), a fundamental machine learning problem\nfor classification, as a MPCC. For this application, we establish that the\naforementioned relaxed MPCC-MFCQ holds under a very mild assumption. Moreover,\nwe program robust implementations and comprehensive numerical experimentation\non real-world data sets, where we show that the sequential penalisation method\napplied to the MPCC formulation for tuning SVM hyperparameters can outperform\nboth the Scholtes relaxation technique and the state-of-the-art derivative-free\nmethods from the machine learning literature.",

This process\ncan be modeled by treating the dark matter as a gravothermal fluid, and solving\nthe fluid equations to predict the density profile evolution. This model is\nincomplete without calibration to N-body simulations, through a constant factor\n$\\beta$ included in the thermal conductivity for the long-mean-free-path limit.\nThe value of $\\beta$ employed in the gravothermal fluid formalism has varied\nbetween studies, with no clear universal value in the literature. In this work,\nwe use the N-body code Arepo to conduct a series of isolated core-collapse\nsimulations across a range of scattering cross-sections, halo concentrations,\nand halo masses to calibrate the heat transfer parameter $\\beta$. We find that\n$\\beta$ is independent of cross-section, halo concentration, and halo mass for\nvelocity independent elastic scattering cross-sections. We present a model for\nan effective $\\beta$ as a function of a dimensionless cross-section, to\ndescribe halo evolution in the long mean free path limit, and show that it\naccurately captures halo evolution as long as the cross section is not too\nlarge. This effective model facilitates comparisons between simulations and the\ngravothermal model, and enables fast predictions of the dark matter density\nprofile at any given time without running N-body simulations.",

    "abstract": "There is a huge difference in techniques and runtimes of distributed\nalgorithms for problems that can be solved by a sequential greedy algorithm and\nthose that cannot. A prime example of this contrast appears in the edge\ncoloring problem: while $(2\\Delta-1)$-edge coloring can be solved in\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{\\ast}(n))$ rounds on constant-degree graphs, the seemingly\nminor reduction to $(2\\Delta-2)$ colors leads to an $\\Omega(\\log n)$ lower\nbound [Chang, He, Li, Pettie & Uitto, SODA'18]. Understanding this sharp divide\nbetween very local problems and inherently more global ones remains a central\nopen question in distributed computing and it is a core focus of this paper.\n  As our main contribution we design a deterministic distributed\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$-round reduction from the $(2\\Delta-2)$-edge coloring\nproblem to the much easier $(2\\Delta-1)$-edge coloring problem. This reduction\nis optimal, as the $(2\\Delta-2)$-edge coloring problem admits an $\\Omega(\\log\nn)$ lower bound, whereas the $2\\Delta-1$-edge coloring problem can be solved in\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{\\ast}n)$ rounds. By plugging in the $(2\\Delta-1)$-edge\ncoloring algorithms from [Balliu, Brandt, Kuhn & Olivetti, PODC'22] running in\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{12}\\Delta + \\log^{\\ast} n)$ rounds, we obtain an optimal\nruntime of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ rounds as long as $\\Delta =\n2^{\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{1/12} n)}$. Furthermore, on general graphs our reduction\nimproves the runtime from $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\log^3 n)$ to\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\log^{5/3} n)$.\n  In addition, we also obtain an optimal $\\mathcal{O}(\\log \\log n)$-round\nrandomized reduction of $(2\\Delta - 2)$-edge coloring to $(2\\Delta - 1)$-edge\ncoloring. Lastly, we obtain an $\\mathcal{O}(\\log_\\Delta n)$-round reduction\nfrom the $(2\\Delta-1)$-edge coloring, albeit to the somewhat harder maximal\nindependent set (MIS) problem.",

In\nNovember 2010, a TDE designated as IGR J12580+0134 occurred in the galaxy NGC\n4845, and it was traced by follow-up XMM-Newton observations in January 2011.\nTo identify a further TDE based on the radio outburst cycle, we requested NICER\nmonitoring observations for nearly a year beginning in March 2023, which we\nstudied here along with the previous XMM-Newton observations. We analyzed X-ray\nbrightness changes using hardness analysis and principal component analysis\n(PCA), and conducted spectral analysis of the source continuum. The NICER\nobservations revealed the presence of some X-ray flares during March-June 2023\nthat were much fainter than the TDE observed using XMM-Newton in 2011. The PCA\ncomponent that mainly contributes to the X-ray outbursts during the TDE is a\nheavily absorbed power-law continuum emission, whereas there is a small\ncontribution from collisionally ionized plasma in the soft excess, likely from\na colliding wind or jet. Similarly, the PCA of the NICER data relates the X-ray\nflares to a power-law spectrum, albeit with a much lower absorbing column, and\npartially to soft collisional plasma. The faint X-ray flares captured by NICER\ncould be associated with extremely weak accretion onto the SMBH resident in\nthis galaxy and thus potentially a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus.",

    "abstract": "In the analysis of any type of system, granting maximum information\nextraction from its data is non-trivial. Confidence in successful information\nextraction typically builds on prior knowledge of the studied system or on the\nuser's experience. However, a robust and objective criterion for ensuring\nmaximum information extraction from data is difficult to define. Here, we\nintroduce a data-driven approach that employs Shannon entropy as a transferable\nmetric to assess and quantify Maximum Information Extraction (MInE) from data\nvia their clustering into statistically-relevant micro-domains. The method is\ngeneral and can be applied virtually to any type of data or system. We\ndemonstrate its efficiency by analyzing, as a first example, time-series data\nextracted from molecular dynamics simulations of water and ice coexisting at\nthe solid/liquid transition temperature. The method allows quantifying the\ninformation contained in the data distributions (time-independent component)\nand the additional information gain attainable by analyzing data as time-series\n(i.e., accounting for the information contained in data time-correlations). The\ndifferent micro-domains that can be effectively resolved and classified in the\nsystem are characterized by own entropy, which are found consistent with\nexperimentally known thermodynamic parameters. A second test case demonstrates\nhow the MInE approach is also effective for high-dimensional datasets and\nclearly shows how including little informative, but noisy, extra\ncomponents/features in high-dimensional analyses may be not only useless, but\neven detrimental to maximum information extraction. This provides a robust\nparameter-free approach and quantitative metrics for data-analysis, and for the\nstudy of any type of system from its data.",

    "abstract": "Calibration is crucial for ensuring the performance of phased array since\namplitude-phase imbalance between elements results in significant performance\ndegradation. While amplitude-only calibration methods offer advantages when\nphase measurements are impractical, conventional approaches face two key\nchallenges: they typically require high-resolution phase shifters and remain\nsusceptible to phase errors inherent in these components. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a Rotating element Harmonic Electric-field Vector\n(RHEV) strategy, which enables precise calibration through time modulation\nprinciples. The proposed technique functions as follows. Two 1-bit phase\nshifters are periodically phase-switched at the same frequency, each generating\ncorresponding harmonics. By adjusting the relative delay between their\nmodulation timings, the phase difference between the $+1$st harmonics produced\nby the two elements can be precisely controlled, utilizing the time-shift\nproperty of the Fourier transform. Furthermore, the +1st harmonic generated by\nsequential modulation of individual elements exhibits a linear relationship\nwith the amplitude of the modulated element, enabling amplitude ambiguity\nresolution. The proposed RHEV-based calibration method generates phase shifts\nthrough relative timing delays rather than physical phase shifter adjustments,\nrendering it less susceptible to phase shift errors. Additionally, since the\ncalibration process exclusively utilizes the $+1$st harmonic, which is produced\nsolely by the modulated unit, the method demonstrates consistent performance\nregardless of array size. Extensive numerical simulations, practical in-channel\nand over-the-air (OTA) calibration experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nand distinct advantages of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework for topological soliton dynamics in trapped spinor\nsuperfluids, decomposing the force acting on the soliton by the surrounding\nfluid into the buoyancy force and spin-corrections arising from the density\ndepletion at soliton core and the coupling between the orbital motion and the\nspin mixing, respectively. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1\nBose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), the spin correction enables mapping the FDS\nmotion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent\nquartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a\nsingle-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a\nlocal minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of\na type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three\nregimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic, followed by single-sided\noscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes symmetry\nbreaking, transitioning from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where\nparticle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing\nbetween two minima via the local maximum, then the motion around one of the two\nminima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a\nharmonic oscillator.",

We show that in the back-to-back limit this\nprocess probes the WW gluon helicity TMD. Furthermore, we derive the small-$x$\nevolution equation for the operator related to the WW gluon helicity\ndistribution. We find that in the double-logarithmic approximation and in the\nlarge-$N_c$ limit, the small-$x$ asymptotics of the WW gluon helicity\ndistribution is governed by exactly the same evolution equation as that for the\ndipole gluon helicity distribution. The longitudinal double-spin asymmetry for\ninclusive dijet production in the longitudinally polarized electron-proton\ncollisions can thus test the small-$x$ helicity evolution equations and\nfacilitate constraining the initial conditions for phenomenology based on these\nequations.",

The ability to image the orientation of anisotropic material\nproperties in three dimensions (3D) is fundamental for the understanding and\nfunctionality-driven development of novel materials. With the development of X\nray linear dichroic orientation tomography (XL DOT), it is now possible to\nnon-destructively map three-dimensional (3D) orientation fields in\nmicrometer-sized samples. In this work, we present the iterative,\ngradient-based reconstruction algorithm behind XL DOT that can be used to map\norientations based on linear dichroism in 3D. As linear dichroism can be\nexhibited by a broad spectrum of materials, XL DOT can be used to map, for\nexample, crystal orientations as well as ferroic alignment, such as\nferroelectric and antiferromagnetic order. We demonstrate the robustness of\nthis technique for orientation fields that exhibit smoothly varying and\ngranular configurations, and subsequently identify and discuss optimal\ngeometries for experimental data acquisition and optimal conditions for the\nreconstruction.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin\nHeidegger's Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende)\nand Being (das Sein). The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively\ncomplete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs\nand an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are\nbridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze\nuser queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT\nspecialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide\nactionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited\nto categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological\nexistential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query\nprocessing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as\nmetaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves\nformalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's\nFundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of\nbeings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way\nfor a universal query analysis tool.

This design integrates the actuators within the hand\nwhile maintaining an anthropomorphic form. Each finger joint features a\nself-locking mechanism that allows the hand to sustain large external forces\nwithout active motor engagement. This approach shifts the payload limitation\nfrom the motor strength to the mechanical strength of the hand, allowing the\nuse of smaller, more cost-effective motors. With 18 DoF and weighing only 790\ngrams, the Krysalis Hand delivers an active squeezing force of 10 N per finger\nand supports a passive payload capacity exceeding 10 lbs. These characteristics\nmake Krysalis Hand one of the lightest, strongest, and most dexterous robotic\nend-effectors of its kind. Experimental evaluations validate its ability to\nperform intricate manipulation tasks and handle heavy payloads, underscoring\nits potential for industrial applications as well as academic research.

Different from image in vision\nspace, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively\nconvey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and\nintuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and\nvision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as\nthe bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the\ncompleteness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic\nrepresentation of the relations between categories through word vector\ndistance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of\nimage features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is\nexplored through low-rank approximation.

The worst correlation is seen with SiO, both with the extended continuum\nemission and with compact sources.

This simultaneously\nrequires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However,\nwhen probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead\nto a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we\nfully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation\nspectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse\nresonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low\nconcentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to\nerbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented\nspectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine\ninteraction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter.\nThe achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for\nextending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of\nsingle dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual\nnuclear spins.

How different network properties\ncontribute to this risk remains unclear. Here, we ask whether systemic risk can\nbe significantly reduced by strategically rewiring supplier-customer links. In\ndoing so, we understand the role of specific endogenously emerged network\nstructures and to what extent the observed systemic risk is a result of\nfundamental properties of the dynamical system. We minimize systemic risk\nthrough rewiring by employing a method from statistical physics that respects\nfirm-level constraints to production. Analyzing six specific subnetworks of the\nnational SCNs of Ecuador and Hungary, we demonstrate that systemic risk can be\nconsiderably mitigated by 16-50% without reducing the production output of\nfirms. A comparison of network properties before and after rewiring reveals\nthat this risk reduction is achieved by changing the connectivity in\nnon-trivial ways.

Thanks to its minimality, our model offers\nvarious definite predictions: the lightest neutrino is massless, the neutrino\nmasses are inverted ordering, the sum of the three light neutrino masses\n($\\sum_i m_i$) is 100 meV, the effective mass for the end point of the beta\ndecay spectrum is 50 meV, the effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decay\n($m_{ee}$) is in the range $38-58$ meV. In particular, the predicted values for\n$\\sum_i m_i$ and $m_{ee}$ from our model are within reach of the next\ngeneration experiments. Our model also predicts radiative lepton flavor\nviolating decays $\\ell\\to\\ell'\\gamma$ which are compatible with experimental\nconstraints.",

    "abstract": "Without any doubt, the relational paradigm has been a huge success. At the\nsame time, we believe that the time is ripe to rethink how database systems\ncould look like if we designed them from scratch. Would we really end up with\nthe same abstractions and techniques that are prevalent today? This paper\nexplores that space. We discuss the various issues with both the relational\nmodel(RM) and the entity-relationship model (ERM). We provide a unified data\nmodel: the relational map type model (RMTM) which can represent both RM and ERM\nas special cases and overcomes all of their problems. We proceed to identify\nseven rules that an RMTM query language (QL) must fulfill and provide a\nfoundation of a language fulfilling all seven rules. Our QL operates on maps\nwhich may represent tuples, relations, databases or sets of databases. Like\nthat we dramatically expand the existing operational abstractions found in SQL\nand relational algebra (RA) which only operate on relations/tables. In fact, RA\nis just a special case of our much more generic approach. This work has\nfar-reaching consequences: we show a path how to come up with a modern QL that\nsolves (almost if not) all problems of SQL. Our QL is much more expressive than\nSQL and integrates smoothly into existing programming languages (PL). We also\nshow results of an initial experiment showcasing that just by switching to our\ndata model, and without changing the underlying query processing algorithms, we\ncan achieve speed-ups of up to a factor 3. We will conclude that, if we build a\ndatabase system from scratch, we could and should do this without SQL, RA, RM,\nERM, and ORMs.",

    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework\nfor solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their performance\nheavily relies on the strategy used to select training points. Conventional\nadaptive sampling methods, such as residual-based refinement, often require\nmulti-round sampling and repeated retraining of PINNs, leading to computational\ninefficiency due to redundant points and costly gradient\ncomputations-particularly in high-dimensional or high-order derivative\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we propose RL-PINNs, a reinforcement\nlearning(RL)-driven adaptive sampling framework that enables efficient training\nwith only a single round of sampling. Our approach formulates adaptive sampling\nas a Markov decision process, where an RL agent dynamically selects optimal\ntraining points by maximizing a long-term utility metric. Critically, we\nreplace gradient-dependent residual metrics with a computationally efficient\nfunction variation as the reward signal, eliminating the overhead of derivative\ncalculations. Furthermore, we employ a delayed reward mechanism to prioritize\nlong-term training stability over short-term gains. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse PDE benchmarks, including low-regular, nonlinear,\nhigh-dimensional, and high-order problems, demonstrate that RL-PINNs\nsignificantly outperforms existing residual-driven adaptive methods in\naccuracy.

Specifically, we consider PBT protocols augmented by\nfree classical processing and/or different forms of quantum pre-processing, and\nwe investigate the maximum achievable teleportation fidelities under such\noperations. Our analysis focuses specifically on the PBT power of isotropic\nstates, bipartite graph states, and symmetrized EPR states, and we compute\ntight bounds on the optimal teleportation fidelities for such states. We\nfinally show that, among this hierarchy of communication models consistent with\nasynchronous quantum information processing, the strongest resource theory is\nequally as powerful as any one-way teleportation protocol for surpassing the\nclassical teleportation threshold.

To reduce the dependency between the model and the game,\nwe combine mean-field game theory with deep learning in the form of neural\nordinary differential equations. The resulting model is data-driven,\nlightweight and can learn extensive strategic interactions that are hard to\ncapture using mean-field theory alone.

We highlight the efficiency and flexibility of our\napproach by solving three mean-field games that vary in their complexity,\nobservability and the presence of noise.

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with non-uniform fully-mixed FEMs for dynamic coupled\nStokes-Darcy model with the well-known Beavers-Joseph-Saffman (BJS) interface\ncondition. In particular, a decoupled algorithm with the lowest-order mixed\nnon-uniform FE approximations (MINI for the Stokes equation and RT0-DG0 for the\nDarcy equation) and the classical Nitsche-type penalty is studied. The method\nwith the combined approximation of different orders is commonly used in\npractical simulations. However, the optimal error analysis of methods with\nnon-uniform approximations for the coupled Stokes-Darcy flow model has remained\nchallenging, although the analysis for uniform approximations has been well\ndone. The key question is how the lower-order approximation to the Darcy flow\ninfluences the accuracy of the Stokes solution through the interface condition.\nIn this paper, we prove that the decoupled algorithm provides a truly optimal\nconvergence rate in L^2-norm in spatial direction: O(h^2) for Stokes velocity\nand O(h) for Darcy flow in the coupled Stokes-Darcy model. This implies that\nthe lower-order approximation to the Darcy flow does not pollute the accuracy\nof numerical velocity for Stokes flow. The analysis presented in this paper is\nbased on a well-designed Stokes-Darcy Ritz projection and given for a dynamic\ncoupled model. The optimal error estimate holds for more general combined\napproximations and more general coupled models, including the corresponding\nmodel of steady-state Stokes-Darcy flows and the model of coupled dynamic\nStokes and steady-state Darcy flows.

We permit the learner to abstain\nfrom making predictions when uncertain. The regret of the learner is measured\nin terms of misclassification and abstention error, where we allow the learner\nto abstain for free on adversarial injected samples. This approach is based on\nthe work of Goel, Hanneke, Moran, and Shetty from arXiv:2306.13119. We explore\nthe methods they present and manage to correct inaccuracies in their\nargumentation.\n  However, this approach is limited to the realizable setting, where labels are\nassigned according to some function $f^*$ from the hypothesis space\n$\\mathcal{F}$. Based on similar arguments, we explore methods to make\nadaptations for the agnostic setting where labels are random. Introducing the\nnotion of a clean-label adversary in the agnostic context, we are the first to\ngive a theoretical analysis of a disagreement-based learner for thresholds,\nsubject to a clean-label adversary with noise.",

Given that object information in\nimages plays a far more crucial role in downstream tasks than background\ninformation, some studies have proposed semantically structuring the bitstream\nto selectively transmit and reconstruct only the information required by these\ntasks. However, such methods structure the bitstream after encoding, meaning\nthat the coding process still relies on the entire image, even though much of\nthe encoded information will not be transmitted. This leads to redundant\ncomputations. Traditional image compression methods require a two-dimensional\nimage as input, and even if the unimportant regions of the image are set to\nzero by applying a semantic mask, these regions still participate in subsequent\ncomputations as part of the image. To address such limitations, we propose an\nimage compression method based on a position-indexed self-attention mechanism\nthat encodes and decodes only the visible parts of the masked image.

This fundamentally discrete\nperspective has shown promise in flat spacetime scenarios, while its\napplication to curved geometries is a current field of study. We address this\nby studying the retarded scalar field propagator on causal sets generated by\nPoisson sprinkling in AdS$_{1+1}$. We first show the solution of the continuum\npropagator using the Klein-Gordon equation, solved in terms of geodesic\ndistance. On the discrete side, we employ Shumans path sum method to derive the\ncorresponding propagator, emphasizing that it is valid even in curved\nmanifolds. By performing numerical simulations, we compare the discrete\npropagator to its continuum counterpart across various curvature scales. Our\nresults show strong agreement and confirm that the causal set propagator\naccurately captures the effects of curvature without requiring modifications to\nthe flat-space jump amplitudes. These findings affirm the robustness of CST in\napproximating field propagation in curved spacetimes and strongly support the\nability of causal sets to fully capture the geometry of Lorentzian manifolds.",

We begin\nby why nations historically cooperate on strategic technologies and analyse\ncurrent US-China cooperation in AI as a case study. We further argue that\nexisting frameworks for managing associated risks can be supplemented with\nconsideration of key risks specific to cooperation on technical AI safety\nresearch. Through our analysis, we find that research into AI verification\nmechanisms and shared protocols may be suitable areas for such cooperation.\nThrough this analysis we aim to help researchers and governments identify and\nmitigate the risks of international cooperation on AI safety research, so that\nthe benefits of cooperation can be fully realised.",

    "abstract": "Instruction tuning has empowered large language models (LLMs) to achieve\nremarkable performance, yet its success heavily depends on the availability of\nlarge-scale, high-quality instruction-response pairs. To meet this demand,\nvarious methods have been developed to synthesize data at scale. However,\ncurrent methods for scaling up data generation often overlook a crucial aspect:\nthe alignment between instructions and responses. We hypothesize that the\nquality of instruction-response pairs is determined not by the individual\nquality of each component, but by the degree of mutual alignment. To address\nthis, we propose a Mutual Alignment Framework (MAIN) which enforces coherence\nbetween instructions and responses through mutual constraints. We demonstrate\nthat MAIN generalizes well across model architectures and sizes, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen models across diverse\nbenchmarks. This work underscores the critical role of instruction-response\nalignment in enabling generalizable and high-quality instruction tuning for\nLLMs.",

    "abstract": "Many works have succeeded in reconstructing Gaussian human avatars from\nmulti-view videos. However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent\nappearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive\nneural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering\nperformance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar\nrepresentation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance\nwith details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is\nempowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on\ndifferent positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are\nobtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their\ndistances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during\ninterpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and\na linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative\nto the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of\ncoefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian\ncoefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian\noffset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying\ncoefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly\ndifferent Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn\nhigh-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the\nGaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be\nirregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize\nbetter when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art\nmethod, our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while\nthe rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses.",

Jitter in the spacecraft's\nline of sight is a source of disturbance when measuring the spectra of\nexoplanet atmospheres. We describe an improved algorithm for de-jittering Ariel\nobservations simulated in the time domain.

The jitter model is based on representative\nsimulations from Airbus Defence and Space, the prime contractor for the Ariel\nservice module. We investigate the precision and biases of the retrieved\natmospheric spectra from the jitter-detrended observations. At long\nwavelengths, the photometric stability of the Ariel spectrometer is already\ndominated by photon noise.

However, 3DGS predominantly\nrelies on first-order optimizers such as Adam, which leads to long training\ntimes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel second-order optimization\nstrategy based on Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Conjugate Gradient (CG), which\nwe specifically tailor towards Gaussian Splatting. Our key insight is that the\nJacobian in 3DGS exhibits significant sparsity since each Gaussian affects only\na limited number of pixels. We exploit this sparsity by proposing a matrix-free\nand GPU-parallelized LM optimization. To further improve its efficiency, we\npropose sampling strategies for both the camera views and loss function and,\nconsequently, the normal equation, significantly reducing the computational\ncomplexity. In addition, we increase the convergence rate of the second-order\napproximation by introducing an effective heuristic to determine the learning\nrate that avoids the expensive computation cost of line search methods. As a\nresult, our method achieves a $3\\times$ speedup over standard LM and\noutperforms Adam by $~6\\times$ when the Gaussian count is low while remaining\ncompetitive for moderate counts.

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress, recent studies indicate that current large\nlanguage models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them during\ninference, leading to the poor generalizability of LLMs. However, due to the\ndiversity of dataset biases and the insufficient nature of bias suppression\nbased on in-context learning, the effectiveness of previous prior\nknowledge-based debiasing methods and in-context learning based automatic\ndebiasing methods is limited. To address these challenges, we explore the\ncombination of causal mechanisms with information theory and propose an\ninformation gain-guided causal intervention debiasing (ICD) framework. To\neliminate biases within the instruction-tuning dataset, it is essential to\nensure that these biases do not provide any additional information to predict\nthe answers, i.e., the information gain of these biases for predicting the\nanswers needs to be 0. Under this guidance, this framework utilizes a causal\nintervention-based data rewriting method to automatically and autonomously\nbalance the distribution of instruction-tuning dataset for reducing the\ninformation gain. Subsequently, it employs a standard supervised fine-tuning\nprocess to train LLMs on the debiased dataset. Experimental results show that\nICD can effectively debias LLM to improve its generalizability across different\ntasks.",

However, while their data ecosystems are rather\nadvanced and permit efficient data interoperability, there are still gaps\nbetween these ecosystems. Semantic artefacts (SAs) -- e.g., ontologies,\nthesauri, vocabularies or metadata schemas -- are a means to bridge that gap as\nthey allow to semantically described the data and map the underlying concepts.\nThe increasing use of SAs in astronomy presents challenges in description,\nselection, evaluation, trust, and mappings. The landscape remains fragmented,\nwith SAs scattered across various registries in diverse formats and structures\n-- not yet fully developed or encoded with rich semantic web standards like OWL\nor SKOS -- and often with overlapping scopes.

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising to demonstrate the\nadvantage of near-term quantum computing over classical computing in practical\napplications, such as the maximum cut (MaxCut) problem. However, current VQAs\nsuch as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) have lower\nperformance guarantees compared to the best-known classical algorithm, and\nsuffer from hard optimization processes due to the barren plateau problem. We\npropose a light-cone VQA by choosing an optimal gate sequence of the standard\nVQAs, which enables a significant improvement in solution accuracy while\navoiding the barren plateau problem. Specifically, we prove that the light-cone\nVQA with one round achieves an approximation ratio of 0.7926 for the MaxCut\nproblem in the worst case of $3$-regular graphs, which is higher than that of\nthe 3-round QAOA, and can be further improved to 0.8333 by an angle-relaxation\nprocedure. Finally, our numerical results indicate an exponential speed-up in\nfinding the exact solution using the light-cone VQA compared with the classical\nalgorithm. Using IBM's quantum devices, we demonstrate that the single-round\nlight-cone VQA exceeds the known classical hardness threshold in both 72- and\n148-qubit demonstrations, whereas $p$-round $\\text{QAOA}$ with $p=1,2,3$ does\nnot in the latter one.

    "abstract": "In 1997, T. H. E. Meuwissen published a groundbreaking article titled\n'Maximizing the response of selection with a predefined rate of inbreeding', in\nwhich he provided an optimized solution for the trade-off between genetic\nresponse and inbreeding avoidance in animal breeding. Evidently, this issue is\nhighly relevant for the honeybee with its small breeding population sizes.\nHowever, the genetic peculiarities of bees have thus far prevented an\napplication of the theory to this species. The present manuscript intends to\nfill this desideratum. It develops the necessary bee-specific theory and\nintroduces a small R script that implements Optimum Contribution Selection\n(OCS) for honeybees. While researching for this manuscript, we found it rather\ncumbersome that even though Meuwissen's theory is 28 years old and has sparked\nresearch in many new directions, to our knowledge, there is still no\ncomprehensive textbook on the topic. Instead, all relevant information had to\nbe extracted from several articles, leading to a steep learning curve. We\nanticipate that many honeybee breeding scientists with a putative interest in\nOCS for honeybees have little to no experience with classical OCS. Thus, we\ndecided to embed our new derivations into a general introduction to OCS that\nthen specializes more and more to the honeybee case. The result are these 121\npages, of which we hope that at least the first sections can also be of use for\nbreeding theorists concerned with other species than honeybees.",

More\nspecifically, we show that there exist UCJ circuits for which classical\nsimulation of sampling cannot be performed in polynomial time, under a\nreasonable complexity-theoretical assumption that the polynomial hierarchy does\nnot collapse. Our main contribution is to show that a class of UCJ circuits can\nbe used to perform arbitrary instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP)\ncomputations, which are already known to be classically hard to simulate under\nthe same complexity assumption. As a side result, we also show that UCJ\nequipped with post-selection can generate the class post-BQP. Our\ndemonstration, worst-case nonsimulatability of UCJ, would potentially imply\nquantum advantage in quantum algorithms for chemistry and physics using unitary\ncoupled cluster type ansatzes, such as the variational quantum eigensolver and\nquantum-selected configuration interaction.",

    "abstract": "The growing influence of video content as a medium for communication and\nmisinformation underscores the urgent need for effective tools to analyze\nclaims in multilingual and multi-topic settings. Existing efforts in\nmisinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant\ngap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We\nintroduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three\nlanguages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the\ntranscripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy,\nfact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to\nfacilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with\nstate-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in\ncross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization\nto unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the\ncomplexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust\nfoundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication,\naddressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.",

    "abstract": "We theoretically study photoinduced magnetic phase transitions and their\ndynamical processes in the Kondo-lattice model on a cubic lattice. It is\ndemonstrated that light irradiation gives rise to magnetic phase transitions\nfrom the ground-state ferromagnetic state to a three-dimensional\nantiferromagnetic state as a nonequilibrium steady state in the photodriven\nsystem. This phase transition occurs as a consequence of the formation of\npseudo half-filling band occupation via the photoexcitation and relaxation of\nelectrons, where all the electron states constituting the lower band separated\nfrom the upper band by an exchange gap are partially but nearly uniformly\noccupied. We also find that several types of antiferromagnetic correlations,\ne.g., A-type and C-type antiferromagnetic correlations, appear in a transient\nstate of the dynamical phase transition. By calculating magnon spectra for the\nphotodriven system, we argue that the instability to the A-type or C-type\nantiferromagnetic state occurs in the ferromagnetic ground state as a softening\nof the magnon band dispersion at corresponding momentum points depending on the\nlight polarization. Our findings provide important insights into the\nunderstanding of photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the\nthree-dimensional Kondo-lattice magnets.",

The uncertainty\nand intermittent nature of RES emphasize the need for flexibility in power\nsystems. Moreover, there are noticeable mismatches between real-time\nelectricity prices and carbon intensity patterns throughout the day. These\ndiscrepancies may lead customers to schedule energy-intensive tasks during the\nearly hours of the day, a period characterized by lower electricity prices but\nhigher carbon intensity. This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive\nframework aimed at encouraging customer participation in electricity markets\nand aligning their flexibility with carbon intensity trends. The proposed\napproach integrates an incentive-based tariff with a tri-level optimization\nmodel, where customers are motivated to submit flexibility bids and, in return,\nreceive financial rewards based on their contributions. The tri-level model\nensures a dynamic interaction between the market operation platform (MOP) and\nend-users.

While FL has shown robustness\nagainst poisoning attacks with basic defenses, our research reveals new\nvulnerabilities stemming from non-independent and identically distributed\n(non-IID) data among clients. These vulnerabilities pose a substantial risk of\nmodel poisoning in real-world FL scenarios.\n  To demonstrate such vulnerabilities, we develop a novel collaborative\nbackdoor poisoning attack called CollaPois. In this attack, we distribute a\nsingle pre-trained model infected with a Trojan to a group of compromised\nclients. These clients then work together to produce malicious gradients,\ncausing the FL model to consistently converge towards a low-loss region\ncentered around the Trojan-infected model. Consequently, the impact of the\nTrojan is amplified, especially when the benign clients have diverse local data\ndistributions and scattered local gradients. CollaPois stands out by achieving\nits goals while involving only a limited number of compromised clients, setting\nit apart from existing attacks. Also, CollaPois effectively avoids noticeable\nshifts or degradation in the FL model's performance on legitimate data samples,\nallowing it to operate stealthily and evade detection by advanced robust FL\nalgorithms.\n  Thorough theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on various benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of CollaPois compared to state-of-the-art\nbackdoor attacks. Notably, CollaPois bypasses existing backdoor defenses,\nespecially in scenarios where clients possess diverse data distributions.\nMoreover, the results show that CollaPois remains effective even when involving\na small number of compromised clients.

    "abstract": "Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound\nexchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech\n(TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling\nthe emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose\nEmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language\nmodels (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion\ncontrol, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme\ntokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by\nchain-of-thought (CoT) and chain-of-modality (CoM) techniques. Besides, we\nintroduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring\nexpressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language\ndescriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English\nEmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese\nSecap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability\nof existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human\nperceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and\nGemini to assess emotional speech.

    "abstract": "Industrial dashboards, commonly deployed by organizations such as enterprises\nand governments, are increasingly crucial in data communication and\ndecision-making support across various domains. Designing an industrial\ndashboard prototype is particularly challenging due to its visual complexity,\nwhich can include data visualization, layout configuration, embellishments, and\nanimations. Additionally, in real-world industrial settings, designers often\nencounter numerous constraints. For instance, when companies negotiate\ncollaborations with clients and determine design plans, they typically need to\ndemo design prototypes and iterate on them based on mock data quickly. Such a\ntask is very common and crucial during the ideation stage, as it not only helps\nsave developmental costs but also avoids data-related issues such as lengthy\ndata handover periods. However, existing authoring tools of dashboards are\nmostly not tailored to such prototyping needs, and motivated by these gaps, we\npropose DashChat, an interactive system that leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to generate industrial dashboard design prototypes from natural\nlanguage. We collaborated closely with designers from the industry and derived\nthe requirements based on their practical experience. First, by analyzing 114\nhigh-quality industrial dashboards, we summarized their common design patterns\nand inject the identified ones into LLMs as reference. Next, we built a\nmulti-agent pipeline powered by LLMs to understand textual requirements from\nusers and generate practical, aesthetic prototypes. Besides, functionally\ndistinct, parallel-operating agents are created to enable efficient generation.\nThen, we developed a user-friendly interface that supports text-based\ninteraction for generating and modifying prototypes. Two user studies\ndemonstrated that our system is both effective and efficient in supporting\ndesign prototyping.",

In\nthis paper, we introduce a method called spacetime noise inversion, revealing\nthat unbiased quantum error mitigation can be achieved with just a single\naccurately measured error parameter and a sampler of Pauli errors. The error\nsampler can be efficiently implemented in conjunction with quantum error\ncorrection.

Moreover, our method is robust to the\nfluctuation of error parameters, a limitation of unbiased quantum error\nmitigation in practice.

We use the semi-analytic model GAEA and the\nhydro-simulation TNG to investigate whether cluster galaxies suffer a strong\nRPS that is sufficient to remove a significant fraction of their gas during the\nfirst pericentric passage. We estimate that a ram pressure of $10^{-10.5}$,\n$10^{-12} $, $10^{-13.5} $ $g cm^{-1} s^{-2}$ can remove at most $90\\%$,\n$50\\%$, and $20\\%$ of the cold gas reservoir from low-mass galaxies with\n$9<\\log M_{\\star}/{\\rm M}_{\\odot} <9.5$, assuming the gas can be stripped\ninstantaneously. We then use this information to divide the phase space diagram\ninto `strong', `moderate', `weak', and `no' RPS zones. By tracing the orbit of\ngalaxies since $2.5R_{vir}$, we find in both GAEA and TNG that about half of\nthe galaxies in Virgo-like halos ($\\log M_h / M_{\\odot} \\sim 14 $) did not\nsuffer strong RPS during the first pericentric passage. In Coma-like halos\n($\\log M_h / M_{\\odot} \\sim 15$), almost all galaxies have suffered strong RPS\nduring the first pericentric passage, which can remove all gas from low-mass\ngalaxies but is insufficient to significantly reduce the gas content of more\nmassive galaxies. In general, results from TNG and GAEA are consistent, with\nthe RPS being only slightly stronger in TNG than in GAEA. Our findings suggest\nthat most cluster galaxies will maintain a notable fraction of their gas and\ncontinue forming stars after the first pericentric passage, except for those\nwith low stellar mass ($\\log M_{\\star}/{\\rm M}_{\\odot} <9.5$) in very massive\nhalos ($\\log M_{h}/{\\rm M}_{\\odot} > 15$).",

Often\nfractal, the resulting topologies feature inherent disorder: a property which\nis never exploited in conventional electronics manufacturing, while necessary\nfor data generation and security in software. In this study, we present how\nsuch properties can be exploited to implement long-term and evolvable synaptic\nplasticity in an electronic hardware. The rich topology of conducting polymer\ndendrites (CPDs) is exploited to program the non-ideality of their\nelectrochemical capacitances containing constant-phase-elements.

Under a\ntrain of voltage spikes, the evolvable current relaxation of the\nelectrochemical systems promotes short-term plasticity with timescales ranging\nfrom milliseconds to seconds. This large window depends on the temporality of\nthe voltage pulses used for reading, but also on the structure of a pair of\nCPDs on two electrodes, grown by voltage pulses.

First,\nwe bring together and revisit decorrelation and regularization by presenting a\nsystematic analysis of out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) for different SNR\nscenarios based on commonly-used data-generating processes. We find that\nvariance reduction tends to increase with the SNR and forests outperform\nbagging when the SNR is low because, in low SNR cases, variance dominates bias\nfor both methods. Second, we show that the effectiveness of randomization is a\nquestion that goes beyond the SNR. We present a simulation study with fixed and\nmoderate SNR, in which we examine the effectiveness of randomization for other\ndata characteristics. In particular, we find that (i) randomization can\nincrease bias in the presence of fat tails in the distribution of covariates;\n(ii) in the presence of irrelevant covariates randomization is ineffective\nbecause bias dominates variance; and (iii) when covariates are mutually\ncorrelated randomization tends to be effective because variance dominates bias.\nBeyond randomization, we find that, for both bagging and random forests, bias\ncan be significantly reduced in the presence of correlated covariates.

The conducted research identified three main types of\nquadratic (square root) voting. Two of them pertain to voting with a split\nstake, and one involves voting without splitting. In split stakes, Type 1 QV\napplies the square root to the total stake before distributing it among\npreferences, while Type 2 QV distributes the stake first and then applies the\nsquare root. In unsplit stakes (Type 3 QV), the square root of the total stake\nis allocated entirely to each preference. The presented formal proofs confirm\nthat Types 2 and 3 QV, along with generalized models, enhance decentralization\nas measured by the Gini and Nakamoto coefficients. A pivotal discovery is the\nexistence of a threshold stakeholder whose relative voting ratio increases\nunder QV compared to linear voting, while smaller stakeholders also gain\ninfluence. The generalized QV model allows flexible adjustment of this\nthreshold, enabling tailored decentralization levels. Maintaining fairness, QV\nensures that stakeholders with higher stakes retain a proportionally greater\nvoting ratio while redistributing influence to prevent excessive concentration.\nIt is shown that to preserve fairness and robustness, QV must be implemented\nalongside privacy-preserving cryptographic voting protocols, as voters casting\ntheir ballots last could otherwise manipulate outcomes. The generalized QV\nmodel, proposed in this paper, enables algorithmic parametrization to achieve\ndesired levels of decentralization for specific use cases. This flexibility\nmakes it applicable across diverse domains, including user interaction with\ncryptocurrency platforms, facilitating community events and educational\ninitiatives, and supporting charitable activities through decentralized\ndecision-making.",

Introducing parallel compliance in\nquadrupedal design is deemed to enhance locomotion performance, which, however,\nmakes the control task even harder. This work aims to address this challenge by\nproposing a general template model and establishing an efficient motion\nplanning and control pipeline. To start, we propose a reduced-order template\nmodel-the dual-legged actuated spring-loaded inverted pendulum with trunk\nrotation-which explicitly models parallel compliance by decoupling spring\neffects from active motor actuation. With this template model, versatile\nacrobatic motions, such as pronking, froggy jumping, and hop-turn, are\ngenerated by a dual-layer trajectory optimization, where the singularity-free\nbody rotation representation is taken into consideration. Integrated with a\nlinear singularity-free tracking controller, enhanced quadrupedal locomotion is\nachieved. Comparisons with the existing template model reveal the improved\naccuracy and generalization of our model. Hardware experiments with a rigid\nquadruped and a newly designed compliant quadruped demonstrate that i) the\ntemplate model enables generating versatile dynamic motion; ii) parallel\nelasticity enhances explosive motion. For example, the maximal pronking\ndistance, hop-turn yaw angle, and froggy jumping distance increase at least by\n25%, 15% and 25%, respectively; iii) parallel elasticity improves the\nrobustness against dynamic uncertainties, including modelling errors and\nexternal disturbances.

While the superconducting rectification\neffect is a consequence of the asymmetric vortex pinning, the mechanisms to\ndevelop its asymmetric potentials have been a subject of ongoing debate, mainly\nfocusing on microscopic breaking of spatial inversion symmetry and macroscopic\nimbalance of the sample structure. Here, we report on comparative study of the\nsuperconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal resistance in a superconducting\nFe(Se,Te)/FeTe heterostructure. In normal state, we observe finite\nnonreciprocal resistance as a hallmark of the spin-orbit interaction with\nstructural inversion asymmetry. In the superconducting state, we find that the\nstrongly enhanced nonreciprocal coefficient in transition regime is directly\ncoupled to the superconducting diode efficiency through a universal scaling\nlaw, indicating the role of spin-momentum-locked state on the asymmetric\npinning potential. Our findings, providing a unified picture of the\nsuperconducting rectification, pave the way for functionalizing superconducting\ndiode devices.",

The axion mass is\nbounded from above to avoid fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle near\nthe hilltop, and from below because too light axions cannot achieve accelerated\nexpansion due to their limited energy budget. As a result, the anthropically\nallowed axion mass range typically lies around $m = \\mathcal{O}(10)\\, H_0$ for\na decay constant close to the Planck scale, where $H_0$ is the observed value\nof the Hubble constant. In this framework, the dark energy equation-of-state\nparameter $w_0$ generically deviates from $-1$ by $\\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, providing\na natural explanation for why $w \\ne -1$ may be expected. We also find that,\nfor a decay constant slightly smaller than the Planck scale, the peak value of\ndark energy density is significantly smaller than the anthropic bound on the\ncosmological constant and can be close to the observed value.

To address this problem, this paper proposes\nFedX, a novel adaptive model decomposition and quantization FL system for IoT.\nTo balance utility with resource constraints on IoT devices, FedX decomposes a\nglobal FL model into different sub-networks with adaptive numbers of quantized\nbits for different devices. The key idea is that a device with fewer resources\nreceives a smaller sub-network for lower overhead but utilizes a larger number\nof quantized bits for higher model utility, and vice versa. The quantization\noperations in FedX are done at the server to reduce the computational load on\ndevices. FedX iteratively minimizes the losses in the devices' local data and\nin the server's public data using quantized sub-networks under a regularization\nterm, and thus it maximizes the benefits of combining FL with model\nquantization through knowledge sharing among the server and devices in a\ncost-effective training process. Extensive experiments show that FedX\nsignificantly improves quantization times by up to 8.43X, on-device computation\ntime by 1.5X, and total end-to-end training time by 1.36X, compared with\nbaseline FL systems. We guarantee the global model convergence theoretically\nand validate local model convergence empirically, highlighting FedX's\noptimization efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Existing multilingual long-context benchmarks, often based on the popular\nneedle-in-a-haystack test, primarily evaluate a model's ability to locate\nspecific information buried within irrelevant texts. However, such a\nretrieval-centric approach is myopic and inherently limited, as successful\nrecall alone does not indicate a model's capacity to reason over extended\ncontexts. Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage,\nshort-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for\nmultilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes\nbeyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop\ninference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages,\nMLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to\narbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large\nlanguage model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource\nlanguages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple\nfacts or predict the absence of information. We also find that, in multilingual\nsettings, LLMs effectively utilize less than 30% of their claimed context\nlength. Although off-the-shelf Retrieval Augmented Generation helps alleviate\nthis to a certain extent, it does not solve the long-context problem. We\nopen-source MLRBench to enable future research in improved evaluation and\ntraining of multilingual LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion have demonstrated excellent\nperformance in image inpainting that aims to restore lost or damaged image\ntexture using its unmasked content. Previous GAN inversion-based methods\nusually utilize well-trained GAN models as effective priors to generate the\nrealistic regions for missing holes. Despite excellence, they ignore a hard\nconstraint that the unmasked regions in the input and the output should be the\nsame, resulting in a gap between GAN inversion and image inpainting and thus\ndegrading the performance. Besides, existing GAN inversion approaches often\nconsider a single modality of the input image, neglecting other auxiliary cues\nin images for improvements. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel GAN\ninversion approach, dubbed MMInvertFill, for image inpainting. MMInvertFill\ncontains primarily a multimodal guided encoder with a pre-modulation and a GAN\ngenerator with F&W+ latent space. Specifically, the multimodal encoder aims to\nenhance the multi-scale structures with additional semantic segmentation edge\ntexture modalities through a gated mask-aware attention module. Afterwards, a\npre-modulation is presented to encode these structures into style vectors. To\nmitigate issues of conspicuous color discrepancy and semantic inconsistency, we\nintroduce the F&W+ latent space to bridge the gap between GAN inversion and\nimage inpainting. Furthermore, in order to reconstruct faithful and\nphotorealistic images, we devise a simple yet effective Soft-update Mean Latent\nmodule to capture more diversified in-domain patterns for generating\nhigh-fidelity textures for massive corruptions. In our extensive experiments on\nsix challenging datasets, we show that our MMInvertFill qualitatively and\nquantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-arts and it supports the\ncompletion of out-of-domain images effectively.",

    "abstract": "Generating multi-subject stylized images remains a significant challenge due\nto the ambiguity in defining style attributes (e.g., color, texture,\natmosphere, and structure) and the difficulty in consistently applying them\nacross multiple subjects. Although recent diffusion-based text-to-image models\nhave achieved remarkable progress, existing methods typically rely on\ncomputationally expensive inversion procedures or large-scale stylized\ndatasets. Moreover, these methods often struggle with maintaining multi-subject\nsemantic fidelity and are limited by high inference costs. To address these\nlimitations, we propose ICAS (IP-Adapter and ControlNet-based Attention\nStructure), a novel framework for efficient and controllable multi-subject\nstyle transfer. Instead of full-model tuning, ICAS adaptively fine-tunes only\nthe content injection branch of a pre-trained diffusion model, thereby\npreserving identity-specific semantics while enhancing style controllability.\nBy combining IP-Adapter for adaptive style injection with ControlNet for\nstructural conditioning, our framework ensures faithful global layout\npreservation alongside accurate local style synthesis. Furthermore, ICAS\nintroduces a cyclic multi-subject content embedding mechanism, which enables\neffective style transfer under limited-data settings without the need for\nextensive stylized corpora. Extensive experiments show that ICAS achieves\nsuperior performance in structure preservation, style consistency, and\ninference efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multi-subject style\ntransfer in real-world applications.",

In this study we analyze the\nphysical processes of an overshoot of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning\nCirculation (AMOC), one of the major tipping elements, using a conceptual box\nmodel. Here either the atmospheric temperature above the North Atlantic, or the\nfreshwater forcing into the North Atlantic overshoot their respective critical\nboundaries. In both cases a higher forcing rate can prevent a collapse of the\nAMOC, since a higher rate of forcing causes initially a fresher North Atlantic,\nwhich in turn results in a higher northward transport by the subtropical gyre\nsupplementing the salinity loss in time. For small exceedance amplitudes the\nAMOC is still resilient as the forcing rates can be low and so other state\nvariables outside of the North Atlantic can adjust. Contrarily, for larger\novershoots the trajectories are dynamically similar and we find a lower limit\nin volume and exceedance time for respectively freshwater and temperature\nforcing in order to prevent a collapse. Moreover, for a large overshoot an\nincreased air-sea temperature coupling has a destabilizing effect, while the\nreverse holds for an overshoot close to the tipping point. The understanding of\nthe physics of the AMOC overshoot behavior is important for interpreting\nresults of Earth System Models and for evaluating the effects of mitigation and\nintervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Simple spiking neural network models, such as those built from interacting\nintegrate-and-fire (IF) units, exhibit rich emergent behaviours but remain\nnotoriously difficult to analyse, particularly in terms of their\npattern-forming properties. In contrast, rate-based models and coupled phase\noscillators offer greater mathematical tractability but fail to capture the\nfull dynamical complexity of spiking networks. To bridge these modelling\nparadigms, Hermann Haken -- the pioneer of Synergetics -- introduced the\nLighthouse model, a framework that provides insights into synchronisation,\ntravelling waves, and pattern formation in neural systems.\n  In this work, we revisit the Lighthouse model and develop new mathematical\nresults that deepen our understanding of self-organisation in spiking neural\nnetworks. Specifically, we derive the linear stability conditions for\nphase-locked spiking states in Lighthouse networks structured on graphs with\nrealistic synaptic interactions ($\\alpha$-function synapses) and axonal\nconduction delays. Extending the analysis on graphs to a spatially continuous\n(non-local) setting, we develop a variant of Turing instability analysis to\nexplore emergent spiking patterns. Finally, we show how localised spiking bump\nsolutions -- which are difficult to mathematically analyse in IF networks --\nare far more tractable in the Lighthouse model and analyse their linear\nstability to wandering states.\n  These results reaffirm the Lighthouse model as a valuable tool for studying\nstructured neural interactions and self-organisation, further advancing the\nsynergetic perspective on spiking neural dynamics.",

We employ modern causal inference methods to estimate\nnot only the local average treatment effect but also its time-varying and\nheterogeneous effects across regions. Utilizing this method, we propose a novel\nframework for evaluating the effectiveness of CF as an EU cohesion policy tool.\nSpecifically, we estimate the time varying distribution of the CF's causal\neffects across EU regions and derive key distribution metrics useful for policy\nevaluation. Our analysis shows that relying solely on average treatment effects\nmasks significant heterogeneity and can lead to misleading conclusions about\nthe effectiveness of the EU's cohesion policy. We find that the impact of the\nCF is frontloaded, peaking within the first seven years after a region's\ninitial inclusion in the program. The distribution of the effects during this\nfirst seven-year cycle of funding is right skewed with relatively thick tails.\nThis indicates positive effects but unevenly distributed across regions.\nMoreover, the magnitude of the CF effect is inversely related to a region's\nrelative position in the initial distribution of output, i.e., relatively\npoorer recipient regions experience higher effects compared to relatively\nricher regions. Finally, we find a non-linear relationship with diminishing\nreturns, whereby the impact of CF declines as the ratio of CF funds received to\na region's gross value added (GVA) increases.",

To address these limitations,\nwe propose SMARTe: a Slot-based Method for Accountable Relational Triple\nextraction. SMARTe introduces intrinsic interpretability through a slot\nattention mechanism and frames the task as a set prediction problem.

While emphasizing\ninterpretability, SMARTe achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art\nmodels. Evaluations on the NYT and WebNLG datasets demonstrate that adding\ninterpretability does not compromise performance.

I particular we have in mind limits of\nthe generalized quantum Langlands kernel, in which case $G$ is the Langland\ndual and $V$ is conjecturally the Feigin-Tipunin vertex algebra and the\nextension $\\tilde{V}$ is conjecturally related to the Kac-DeConcini-Procesi\nquantum group with big center. With the current article, we can give a uniform\nand independent construction of these limits.",

    "abstract": "This study explored how large language models (LLMs) perform in two areas\nrelated to art: writing critiques of artworks and reasoning about mental states\n(Theory of Mind, or ToM) in art-related situations. For the critique generation\npart, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with\na broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first\nwrite a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a\nstep-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared\nwith those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many\ncases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results\nsuggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style\nbut also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the\nsecond part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving\ninterpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of\nart. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex,\nsocially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that\ntheir performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that\ninvolved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer\ndifferences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to\ncomplex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations\nand potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called\nGenerative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output\nwithout genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are\ninstructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin\nto show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might\nassume.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing transparent surfaces is essential for tasks such as robotic\nmanipulation in labs, yet it poses a significant challenge for 3D\nreconstruction techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). These methods\noften encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of\nphotorealistic rendering through standard $\\alpha$-blending undermines\ngeometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for\ntransparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface\nGaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning\nfrom appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on\ngeometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces.\nIn the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular\nmodeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric\naccuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth\nextraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\\alpha$-blending\nweights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust\nweighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task\nunder realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex\ntransparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that\nTSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of\ntransparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework.\nSpecifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a\n37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score\ncompared to the top baseline.

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning has driven innovation across various industries,\nparticularly in the field of music. By enabling more intuitive interaction\nexperiences and enhancing immersion, it not only lowers the entry barriers to\nthe music but also increases its overall appeal. This survey aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of multimodal tasks related to music, outlining how music\ncontributes to multimodal learning and offering insights for researchers\nseeking to expand the boundaries of computational music. Unlike text and\nimages, which are often semantically or visually intuitive, music primarily\ninteracts with humans through auditory perception, making its data\nrepresentation inherently less intuitive. Therefore, this paper first\nintroduces the representations of music and provides an overview of music\ndatasets. Subsequently, we categorize cross-modal interactions between music\nand multimodal data into three types: music-driven cross-modal interactions,\nmusic-oriented cross-modal interactions, and bidirectional music cross-modal\ninteractions. For each category, we systematically trace the development of\nrelevant sub-tasks, analyze existing limitations, and discuss emerging trends.\nFurthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of datasets and evaluation\nmetrics used in multimodal tasks related to music, offering benchmark\nreferences for future research. Finally, we discuss the current challenges in\ncross-modal interactions involving music and propose potential directions for\nfuture research.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the visual-language area have developed natural\nmulti-modal large language models (MLLMs) for spatial reasoning through visual\nprompting. However, due to remote sensing (RS) imagery containing abundant\ngeospatial information that differs from natural images, it is challenging to\neffectively adapt natural spatial models to the RS domain. Moreover, current RS\nMLLMs are limited in overly narrow interpretation levels and interaction\nmanner, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address those\nchallenges, a spatial MLLM named EarthGPT-X is proposed, enabling a\ncomprehensive understanding of multi-source RS imagery, such as optical,\nsynthetic aperture radar (SAR), and infrared. EarthGPT-X offers zoom-in and\nzoom-out insight, and possesses flexible multi-grained interactive abilities.\nMoreover, EarthGPT-X unifies two types of critical spatial tasks (i.e.,\nreferring and grounding) into a visual prompting framework. To achieve these\nversatile capabilities, several key strategies are developed. The first is the\nmulti-modal content integration method, which enhances the interplay between\nimages, visual prompts, and text instructions. Subsequently, a cross-domain\none-stage fusion training strategy is proposed, utilizing the large language\nmodel (LLM) as a unified interface for multi-source multi-task learning.\nFurthermore, by incorporating a pixel perception module, the referring and\ngrounding tasks are seamlessly unified within a single framework. In addition,\nthe experiments conducted demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nEarthGPT-X in multi-grained tasks and its impressive flexibility in multi-modal\ninteraction, revealing significant advancements of MLLM in the RS field.",

However, the diverse flight\nactivities associated with the emerging LAE applications in urban scenarios\nconfront complex physical environments, which urgently necessitates ubiquitous\nand reliable communication to guarantee the operation safety of the\nlow-altitude aircraft. As one of promising technologies for the sixth\ngeneration (6G) mobile networks, channel knowledge map (CKM) enables the\nenvironment-aware communication by constructing a site-specific dataset,\nthereby providing a priori on-site information for the aircraft to obtain the\nchannel state information (CSI) at arbitrary locations with much reduced online\noverhead. Diverse base station (BS) deployments in the three-dimensional (3D)\nurban low-altitude environment require efficient 3D CKM construction to capture\nspatial channel characteristics with less overhead. Towards this end, this\npaper proposes a 3D channel gain map (CGM) inference method based on a 3D\nconditional generative adversarial network (3D-CGAN). Specifically, we first\nanalyze the potential deployment types of BSs in urban low-altitude scenario,\nand investigate the CGM representation with the corresponding 3D channel gain\nmodel. The framework of the proposed 3D-CGAN is then discussed, which is\ntrained by a dataset consisting of existing CGMs. Consequently, the trained\n3D-CGAN is capable of inferring the corresponding CGM only based on the BS\ncoordinate without additional measurement. The simulation results demonstrate\nthat the CGMs inferred by the proposed 3D-CGAN outperform those of the\nbenchmark schemes, which can accurately reflect the radio propagation condition\nin 3D environment.",

This\ndrag operation has been incorporated into numerous methods to facilitate the\nediting of 2D images and 3D meshes in design. However, few studies have\nexplored drag-driven editing for the widely-used 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\nrepresentation, as deforming 3DGS while preserving shape coherence and visual\ncontinuity remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce ARAP-GS, a\ndrag-driven 3DGS editing framework based on As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP)\ndeformation. Unlike previous 3DGS editing methods, we are the first to apply\nARAP deformation directly to 3D Gaussians, enabling flexible, drag-driven\ngeometric transformations. To preserve scene appearance after deformation, we\nincorporate an advanced diffusion prior for image super-resolution within our\niterative optimization process. This approach enhances visual quality while\nmaintaining multi-view consistency in the edited results. Experiments show that\nARAP-GS outperforms current methods across diverse 3D scenes, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and superiority for drag-driven 3DGS editing.

To overcome these\nshortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which\nAutomatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts.

Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both\nsingle and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without\ncompromising the generative fidelity.

This\npaper extends this method to practical implementation by deriving the\nmultipolar expansion of the longitudinal electric field in such RF cavities\nwith beam pipes, as well as the momentum change of ultra-relativistic particles\ntraversing these modes. The derived equations explicitly show the radial\nvariation of the change in longitudinal and transverse momentum follows a\npolynomial rather than Bessel-function relationship. The expression for the\nlongitudinal electric field is then compared to a field map obtained from the\n3D electromagnetic simulation of an azimuthally modulated cavity designed to\nsupport a mode composed of monopole, dipole, and quadrupole components. Beam\ndynamics studies are presented to assess the derived expressions for the change\nin momentum, including the effects of relaxing the ultra-relativistic\nassumption. Finally, two example applications are presented: the first\ndemonstrates the removal of unwanted transverse multipoles to create a\nmultipole-free accelerating structure with a single-port coupler, whereas the\nsecond illustrates the synthesis of desired multipoles to create an RF cavity\nthat transforms the transverse distribution of a beam from Gaussian to uniform.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are\nclassified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and\ntype-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions.\nType-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac\npoint serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In\ncontrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the\ncoexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear\nenergy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a\ntype-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the\n\"narrow-sense\" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic\nand higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along\none direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$)\n-dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is\ncontinuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with\nparticle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential\n($\\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover\nin $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \\propto T^{2}$\nbelow the crossover temperature ($T_{\\rm co}$) to $C \\propto T^{\\frac{1}{2}}$\nabove $T_{\\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent\nstructure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible\napproach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the\nnarrow-sense type-III limit.",

The ACSQ protocol consists of two\nprimary components: the Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocol and a block\nsorting mechanism, with the ACS protocol comprising two stages: broadcast and\nagreement. However, current protocols encounter three critical issues: high\nlatency arising from the execution of the agreement stage, latency instability\ndue to the integral-sorting mechanism, and reduced throughput caused by block\ndiscarding. To address these issues,we propose Falcon, an asynchronous BFT\nprotocol that achieves low latency and enhanced throughput. Falcon introduces a\nnovel broadcast protocol, Graded Broadcast (GBC), which enables a block to be\nincluded in the ACS set directly, bypassing the agreement stage and thereby\nreducing latency. To ensure safety, Falcon incorporates a new binary agreement\nprotocol called Asymmetrical Asynchronous Binary Agreement (AABA), designed to\ncomplement GBC. Additionally, Falcon employs a partial-sorting mechanism,\nallowing continuous rather than simultaneous block committing, enhancing\nlatency stability. Finally, we incorporate an agreement trigger that, before\nits activation, enables nodes to wait for more blocks to be delivered and\ncommitted, thereby boosting throughput. We conduct a series of experiments to\nevaluate Falcon, demonstrating its superior performance.",

    "abstract": "Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft\nX-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under\ndebate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that\nQPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the\naccretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the\nstar-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed\nproperties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\\rm{e}}$, and\nradiation temperatures $T_{\\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically\ninvestigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test\nthe star-disk collision model by using these observables to derive the\nconstraints on the stellar radius $R_*$. We find that, except for two sources\n(eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_*$ to\nsimultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\\rm{e}}$, or the\nrequired $R_*$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the\ntwo exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\\ R_{\\rm{\\odot}}$ is\nnecessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest\nversion of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\\rm{p}} \\sim 10\\ \\rm{eV}$, one\norder of magnitude lower than the observed value.",

The\nconvergence is established through a technically constructed Lyapunov function,\nwhich guarantees sufficient descent and has a well-defined lower bound.\n  With properly chosen parameters, PPG-ADMM converges to an\n$\\epsilon$-approximate stationary point at a sublinear convergence rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$.\n  Furthermore, by appropriately tuning the perturbation parameter $\\beta$, it\nachieves an $\\epsilon$-stationary point, providing stronger optimality\nguarantees.

LiNbO$_3$ is used as a prototypical material system. All\nquantities depend on the SAW propagation direction with respect to the\ncrystalline axis and on the electrical boundary conditions. In contrast to\nnon-piezoelectric isotropic media, we find that all shear strain components can\nbe induced in LiNbO$_3$, with their amplitude and relative phase (with respect\nto the longitudinal strain) dependent on the propagation direction and the\nboundary conditions at the LiNbO$_3$ surface. These results offer a robust\nfoundation for analyzing strain-driven magnon-phonon coupling mechanisms and\ncontribute to designing strain-engineered functional magnonic and phononic\ndevices.",

To\naddress these limitations, we introduce a new task, Reasoning Logical Anomaly\nDetection (RLAD), which extends traditional anomaly detection by incorporating\nlogical reasoning. We propose a new framework, LAD-Reasoner, a customized tiny\nmultimodal language model built on Qwen2.5-VL 3B.

Crucially, reward signals are derived from both the\ndetection accuracy and the structural quality of the outputs, obviating the\nneed for building chain of thought (CoT) reasoning data. Experiments on the\nMVTec LOCO AD dataset show that LAD-Reasoner, though significantly smaller,\nmatches the performance of Qwen2.5-VL-72B in accuracy and F1 score, and further\nexcels in producing concise and interpretable rationales.

To counter these\nthreats, anti-personalization methods have been proposed, which add adversarial\nperturbations to published images to disrupt the training of personalization\nmodels.

On\nthe basis of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om metric, this solution realizes a\nlong-range confinement correction by introducing the NED parameter $\\zeta$,\nproviding a new theoretical perspective for explaining the anomalies in galaxy\nrotation curves. To deeply explore the dynamic properties of this black hole\nsolution, this paper combines two complementary methods, namely, time-domain\nevolution and the WKB approximation, to calculate the quasinormal mode (QNM)\nspectrum of its scalar field perturbations. The research results show that the\noscillation frequencies and decay rates of the low-order QNM modes decrease\nmonotonically with the increase of the NED parameter $\\zeta$, and exhibit an\napproximately linear dependence. The analysis of the greybody factor (GF)\nindicates that as $\\zeta$ increases, the transmittance of the low-frequency\nscalar field also increases. The enhanced long-range confinement effect caused\nby the increase of $\\zeta$ makes low-frequency perturbations more likely to\nsurvive and propagate in space-time on the one hand, and at the same time\nenhances the transmission ability of the low-frequency scalar field.

While LLMs have shown promise in general web search scenarios,\ntheir effectiveness for evaluating domain-specific search results, such as\neducational resources, remains unexplored. To investigate different ways of\nincluding domain-specific criteria in LLM prompts for relevance judgement, we\ncollected and released a dataset of 401 human relevance judgements from a user\nstudy involving teaching professionals performing search tasks related to\nlesson planning. We compared three approaches to structuring these prompts: a\nsimple two-aspect evaluation baseline from prior work on using LLMs as\nrelevance judges, a comprehensive 12-dimensional rubric derived from\neducational literature, and criteria directly informed by the study\nparticipants. Using domain-specific frameworks, LLMs achieved strong agreement\nwith human judgements (Cohen's $\\kappa$ up to 0.650), significantly\noutperforming the baseline approach. The participant-derived framework proved\nparticularly robust, with GPT-3.5 achieving $\\kappa$ scores of 0.639 and 0.613\nfor 10-dimension and 5-dimension versions respectively.

This fact is\nvery important for the application of the spectral theory on the $S$-spectrum.\nIn fact, let $T$ denote a (right) linear Clifford operator, the $S$-spectrum is\nassociated with a second-order polynomial in the operator $T$, specifically the\noperator defined as $ Q_s(T) := T^2 - 2s_0T + |s|^2. $ This allows us to\nassociate to the Dirac operator boundary conditions that can be of Dirichlet\ntype but also of Robin-like type. Moreover, our theory is not limited to\nHilbert modules; it is applicable to Banach modules as well. The spectral\ntheory based on the $S$-spectrum has gained increasing attention in recent\nyears, particularly as it aims to provide quaternionic quantum mechanics with a\nsolid mathematical foundation from the perspective of spectral theory. This\ntheory was extended to Clifford operators, and more recently, the spectral\ntheorem has been adapted to this broader context. The $S$-spectrum is crucial\nfor defining the so-called $S$-functional calculus for quaternionic and\nClifford operators in various forms. This includes bounded as well as unbounded\noperators, where suitable estimates of sectorial and bi-sectorial type for the\n$S$-resolvent operator are essential for the convergence of the Dunford\nintegrals in this setting.",

Despite its computational\nhardness in general, there exist many classes of functions (e.g., probabilistic\nmodels) for which marginalization remains tractable, and they can be commonly\nexpressed by polynomial size arithmetic circuits computing multilinear\npolynomials. This raises the question, can all functions with polynomial time\nmarginalization algorithms be succinctly expressed by such circuits?

To address these issues, we present\na novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology\n(TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to\nidentify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data.

This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow\nwhile ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM\ndataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016.\nAdditionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset,\noutperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a\nJaccard score of 63.35%.

While CLIP demonstrates\nremarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature\nspaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text\nfeature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing\nworks attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or\nfine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or\ndegradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a\npost-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and\nfine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training\non small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To\nthis end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and\nhybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features\nto follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random\nreference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid\nsoft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and\noutputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both\nmaintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features.\nOur extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show\nthat CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the\nzero-shot performance.",

    "abstract": "Local optima networks (LONs) capture fitness landscape information. They are\ntypically constructed in a black-box manner; information about the problem\nstructure is not utilised. This also applies to the analysis of LONs: knowledge\nabout the problem, such as interaction between variables, is not considered. We\nchallenge this status-quo with an alternative approach: we consider how LON\nanalysis can be improved by incorporating subfunction-based information - this\ncan either be known a-priori or learned during search. To this end, LONs are\nconstructed for several benchmark pseudo-boolean problems using three\napproaches: firstly, the standard algorithm; a second algorithm which uses\ndeterministic grey-box crossover; and a third algorithm which selects\nperturbations based on learned information about variable interactions. Metrics\nrelated to subfunction changes in a LON are proposed and compared with metrics\nfrom previous literature which capture other aspects of a LON. Incorporating\nproblem structure in LON construction and analysing it can bring enriched\ninsight into optimisation dynamics. Such information may be crucial to\nunderstanding the difficulty of solving a given problem with state-of-the-art\nlinkage learning optimisers. In light of the results, we suggest incorporation\nof problem structure as an alternative paradigm in landscape analysis for\nproblems with known or suspected subfunction structure.",

Structural changes\ninduced by halides form low-dimensional halobismuthate fragments, confirmed by\ncrystallographic analysis.

Due\nto solubility limitations, only bismuth iodide complexes were explored in\nelectronic devices. Current-voltage scans showed pinched hysteresis loops,\ncharacteristic of memristors. Conductivity versus temperature study indicates\ncombined ionic and electronic contributions to conductivity of the devices.\nGiven that a memristor can function as a single synapse without the need for\nprogramming, aligning with the requirements of neuromorphic computing, the\nstudy investigated long-term depression, potentiation, and spike-time-dependent\nplasticity. As the potentiation-depression plots showed non-linearity with\nfading memory, these materials can be a good candidate for application in\nphysical reservoir computing. To further assess this material, an electronic\ndevice with sixteen gold electrodes was applied, featuring one input and 15\noutput electrodes deposited on silicon substrate and covered with a layer of\nstudied compound.

    "abstract": "Existing 3D human pose estimation methods often suffer in performance, when\napplied to cross-scenario inference, due to domain shifts in characteristics\nsuch as camera viewpoint, position, posture, and body size. Among these\nfactors, camera viewpoints and locations {have been shown} to contribute\nsignificantly to the domain gap by influencing the global positions of human\nposes. To address this, we propose a novel framework that explicitly conducts\nglobal transformations between pose positions in the camera coordinate systems\nof source and target domains. We start with a Pseudo-Label Generation Module\nthat is applied to the 2D poses of the target dataset to generate pseudo-3D\nposes. Then, a Global Transformation Module leverages a human-centered\ncoordinate system as a novel bridging mechanism to seamlessly align the\npositional orientations of poses across disparate domains, ensuring consistent\nspatial referencing. To further enhance generalization, a Pose Augmentor is\nincorporated to address variations in human posture and body size. This process\nis iterative, allowing refined pseudo-labels to progressively improve guidance\nfor domain adaptation. Our method is evaluated on various cross-dataset\nbenchmarks, including Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW. The proposed method\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforms the target-trained\nmodel.",

This paper investigates the feasibility of developing a\nunified model capable of incremental learning across continuously evolving\nmodal sequences. To this end, we introduce a novel paradigm called Modality\nIncremental Learning (MIL), where each learning stage involves data from\ndistinct modalities. To address this task, we propose a novel framework named\nHarmony, designed to achieve modal alignment and knowledge retention, enabling\nthe model to reduce the modal discrepancy and learn from a sequence of distinct\nmodalities, ultimately completing tasks across multiple modalities within a\nunified framework. Our approach introduces the adaptive compatible feature\nmodulation and cumulative modal bridging. Through constructing historical modal\nfeatures and performing modal knowledge accumulation and alignment, the\nproposed components collaboratively bridge modal differences and maintain\nknowledge retention, even with solely unimodal data available at each learning\nphase.These components work in concert to establish effective modality\nconnections and maintain knowledge retention, even when only unimodal data is\navailable at each learning stage. Extensive experiments on the MIL task\ndemonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing\nincremental learning methods, validating its effectiveness in MIL scenarios.",

Graph percolation offers a\ntheoretical explanation for this risk, and a framework for evaluating it using\ninformation available to the operator of a soaring aircraft in flight. The\nutility of graph percolation as a risk measure is examined by analyzing flight\nlogs from human soaring pilots. This analysis indicates that in sport soaring\npilots rarely operate in a condition which does not satisfy graph percolation,\nidentifies an apparent desired minimum node degree, and shows that pilots\naccept reduced climb rates in order to maintain percolation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies [Class. Quant. Grav. 42, 03LT01 (2025); Phys. Rev. D 111,\n045023 (2025)] indicate that in a nested sequence of Rindler wedges, vacuum of\nformer Rindler frame appears to be thermally populated for an observer in\nshifted Rindler frame. Interestingly, this thermality is independent of shift\nparameter as long as it is non-zero and therefore arises even if the shift\nparameter is as small as Planck length. Building on this insight, we propose a\nset-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration. We find\nthat if their Rindler frames (consequently their trajectories) get\ninfinitesimally separated, the atoms become entangled. Remarkably again, this\nentanglement, like the perceived thermality, is independent of the shift\nparameter, provided it is non-vanishing. Further we observe the vanishing of\nmutual information and discord. It implies the absence of both classical and\nnon-classical correlations which are not related to entanglement. We\ninvestigate the dependence of entanglement on acceleration of the detectors.\nThe present study indicates that the entanglement between two detectors, moving\non the same Rindler wedge, is possible. Moreover, small spacetime fluctuations\ncan lead to entanglement between detectors, moving along same classical\ntrajectory. Hence we feel that such theoretical prediction has potential to\nprobe the Planck length nature of spacetime.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on showing some arguments addressed to dismantle the\nextended idea about that social networks completely lacks of privacy\nproperties. We consider the so-called active attacks to the privacy of social\nnetworks and the counterpart $(k,\\ell)$-anonymity measure, which is used to\nquantify the privacy satisfied by a social network against active attacks. To\nthis end, we make use of the graph theoretical concept of $k$-metric\nantidimensional graphs for which the case $k=1$ represents those graphs\nachieving the worst scenario in privacy whilst considering the\n$(k,\\ell)$-anonymity measure.\n  As a product of our investigation, we present a large number of computational\nresults stating that social networks might not be as insecure as one often\nthinks. In particular, we develop a large number of experiments on random\ngraphs which show that the number of $1$-metric antidimensional graphs is\nindeed ridiculously small with respect to the total number of graphs that can\nbe considered. Moreover, we search on several real networks in order to check\nif they are $1$-metric antidimensional, and obtain that none of them are such.\nAlong the way, we show some theoretical studies on the mathematical properties\nof the $k$-metric antidimensional graphs for any suitable $k\\ge 1$. In\naddition, we also describe some operations on graphs that are $1$-metric\nantidimensional so that they get embedded into another larger graphs that are\nnot such, in order to obscure their privacy properties against active attacks.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning, particularly frequency dynamic convolution\n(FDY conv), have significantly improved sound event detection (SED) by enabling\nfrequency-adaptive feature extraction. However, FDY conv relies on temporal\naverage pooling, which treats all temporal frames equally, limiting its ability\nto capture transient sound events such as alarm bells, door knocks, and speech\nplosives. To address this limitation, we propose temporal attention pooling\nfrequency dynamic convolution (TFD conv) to replace temporal average pooling\nwith temporal attention pooling (TAP). TAP adaptively weights temporal features\nthrough three complementary mechanisms: time attention pooling (TA) for\nemphasizing salient features, velocity attention pooling (VA) for capturing\ntransient changes, and conventional average pooling for robustness to\nstationary signals. Ablation studies show that TFD conv improves average PSDS1\nby 3.02% over FDY conv with only a 14.8% increase in parameter count. Classwise\nANOVA and Tukey HSD analysis further demonstrate that TFD conv significantly\nenhances detection performance for transient-heavy events, outperforming\nexisting FDY conv models. Notably, TFD conv achieves a maximum PSDS1 score of\n0.456, surpassing previous state-of-the-art SED systems. We also explore the\ncompatibility of TAP with other FDY conv variants, including dilated FDY conv\n(DFD conv), partial FDY conv (PFD conv), and multi-dilated FDY conv (MDFD\nconv). Among these, the integration of TAP with MDFD conv achieves the best\nresult with a PSDS1 score of 0.459, validating the complementary strengths of\ntemporal attention and multi-scale frequency adaptation. These findings\nestablish TFD conv as a powerful and generalizable framework for enhancing both\ntransient sensitivity and overall feature robustness in SED.",

Calculating the attenuation operator $t^*$\nis typically required in seismic attenuation tomography. Traditional methods\nfor calculating $t^*$ require determining the ray path explicitly. However, ray\ntracing can be computationally intensive when processing large datasets, and\nconventional ray tracing techniques may fail even in mildly heterogeneous\nmedia. In this study, we propose a modified fast sweeping method (MFSM) to\nsolve the governing equation for $t^*$ without explicitly calculating the ray\npath. The approach consists of two main steps. First, the traveltime field is\ncalculated by numerically solving the eikonal equation using the fast sweeping\nmethod. Second, $t^*$ is computed by solving its governing equation with the\nMFSM, based on the discretization of the gradient of $t^*$ using an upwinding\nscheme derived from the traveltime gradient. The MFSM is rigorously validated\nthrough comparisons with analytical solutions and by examining $t^*$ errors\nunder grid refinement in both simple and complex models. Key performance\nmetrics, including convergence, number of iterations, and computation time, are\nevaluated. Two versions of the MFSM are developed for both Cartesian and\nspherical coordinate systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the\ndeveloped MFSM in calculating $t^*$ in North Island, and discuss the method's\nefficiency in estimating earthquake response spectra.",

However, a critical yet\noverlooked fact is that in any driving scenario, multiple high-quality\ntrajectories from other vehicles coexist with a specific ego vehicle's\ntrajectory. Existing methods fail to fully exploit this valuable resource,\nmissing important opportunities to improve the models' performance (including\nlong-tail scenarios) through learning from other experts. Intuitively, Jointly\nlearning from both ego and other vehicles' expert data is beneficial for\nplanning tasks. However, this joint learning faces two critical challenges. (1)\nDifferent scene observation perspectives across vehicles hinder inter-vehicle\nalignment of scene feature representations; (2) The absence of partial modality\nin other vehicles' data (e.g., vehicle states) compared to ego-vehicle data\nintroduces learning bias. To address these challenges, we propose FUMP (Fully\nUnified Motion Planning), a novel two-stage trajectory generation framework.\nBuilding upon probabilistic decomposition, we model the planning task as a\nspecialized subtask of motion prediction. Specifically, our approach decouples\ntrajectory planning into two stages. In Stage 1, a shared decoder jointly\ngenerates initial trajectories for both tasks. In Stage 2, the model performs\nplanning-specific refinement conditioned on an ego-vehicle's state. The\ntransition between the two stages is bridged by a state predictor trained\nexclusively on ego-vehicle data.

    "abstract": "Ergodicity breaking and aging effects are fundamental challenges in\nout-of-equilibrium systems. Various mechanisms have been proposed to understand\nthe non-ergodic and aging phenomena, possibly related to observations in\nsystems ranging from structural glass and Anderson glasses to biological\nsystems and mechanical systems. While anomalous diffusion described by Levy\nstatistics efficiently captures ergodicity breaking, the origin of aging and\nergodicity breaking in systems with ultraslow dynamics remain unclear. Here, we\nreport a novel mechanism of ergodicity breaking in systems exhibiting log-aging\ndiffusion. This mechanism, characterized by increasingly infrequent rare events\nwith aging, yields statistics deviating significantly from Levy distribution,\nbreaking ergodicity as shown by unequal time- and ensemble-averaged mean\nsquared displacements and two distinct asymptotic probability distribution\nfunctions. Notably, although these rare events contribute negligibly to\nstatistical averages, they dramatically change the system's characteristic\ntime. This work lays the groundwork for microscopic understanding of\nout-of-equilibrium systems and provides new perspectives on glasses and\nGriffiths-McCoy singularities.",

    "abstract": "KAGRA is a kilometer-scale cryogenic gravitational-wave (GW) detector in\nJapan. It joined the 4th joint observing run (O4) in May 2023 in collaboration\nwith the Laser Interferometer GW Observatory (LIGO) in the USA, and Virgo in\nItaly. After one month of observations, KAGRA entered a break period to enhance\nits sensitivity to GWs, and it is planned to rejoin O4 before its scheduled end\nin October 2025. To accurately recover the information encoded in the GW\nsignals, it is essential to properly calibrate the observed signals. We employ\na photon calibration (Pcal) system as a reference signal injector to calibrate\nthe output signals obtained from the telescope. In ideal future conditions, the\nuncertainty in Pcal could dominate the uncertainty in the observed data. In\nthis paper, we present the methods used to estimate the uncertainty in the Pcal\nsystems employed during KAGRA O4 and report an estimated system uncertainty of\n0.79%, which is three times lower than the uncertainty achieved in the previous\n3rd joint observing run (O3) in 2020. Additionally, we investigate the\nuncertainty in the Pcal laser power sensors, which had the highest impact on\nthe Pcal uncertainty, and estimate the beam positions on the KAGRA main mirror,\nwhich had the second highest impact. The Pcal systems in KAGRA are the first\nfully functional calibration systems for a cryogenic GW telescope. To avoid\ninterference with the KAGRA cryogenic systems, the Pcal systems incorporate\nunique features regarding their placement and the use of telephoto cameras,\nwhich can capture images of the mirror surface at almost normal incidence. As\nfuture GW telescopes, such as the Einstein Telescope, are expected to adopt\ncryogenic techniques, the performance of the KAGRA Pcal systems can serve as a\nvaluable reference.",

Conventional feature\nselection methods that treat unlabeled data as negative may fail to capture the\nstatistical characteristics of positive data in such scenarios, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel feature selection\nmethod based on the cluster assumption in PU learning, called FSCPU.

Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of FSCPU across various data conditions.

    "abstract": "Distinguishing between enantiomers is crucial in the study of chiral\nmolecules in chemistry and pharmacology. Many optical approaches rely on\nenantiospecific cyclic electric-dipole transitions induced by three microwave\nor laser beams. However, these approaches impose stringent requirements,\nincluding phase locking, three-photon resonance, and precise control over beam\nintensities and operation times, which enhance the complexity and restrict the\napplicability. In this letter, we present a novel optical method that {\\it\neliminates these constraints entirely.} Specifically, we demonstrate that in\nthe presence of a static electric field, there is a selection rule for\ntwo-photon electric-dipole transitions that differs between enantiomers. This\ndistinction arises because the static electric field breaks the symmetry\nassociated with the combined action of a specific rotation and time-reversal\ntransformation. Leveraging the enantiospecific two-photon selection rule, one\ncan selectively excite a desired enantiomer using two beams, without the need\nfor phase locking, resonance condition, and the precise control of their\nintensities and operation times.

    "abstract": "We investigate the collapse kinetics of charged polymers (polyelectrolytes)\ninduced by counterion condensation using coarse-grained molecular dynamics\nsimulations. Under good solvent conditions, polyelectrolytes above the critical\ncharge density ($A > A_c$) exhibit significantly faster collapse dynamics\ncompared to neutral polymers, with dynamic scaling exponents ($\\nu_c \\approx\n0.76-0.84$) distinctly smaller than those observed for neutral polymers ($\\nu_c\n\\approx 1.44$) . This accelerated collapse is driven primarily by three\nmechanisms: (1) local charge neutralization due to counterion condensation,\nwhich facilitates immediate local compaction, (2) screening of long-range\nelectrostatic repulsions, reducing the conformational search space, and (3)\nbridging interactions mediated by multivalent counterions, enhancing efficient\nformation of intra-chain contacts. We systematically explore the effects of\npolymer length, charge density, and counterion valency (monovalent, divalent,\nand trivalent) on collapse dynamics, demonstrating that increased counterion\nvalency significantly lowers the critical charge density required for collapse\nand accelerates the collapse process. Our findings highlight the limitations of\nmodeling charged biopolymers using purely neutral coarse-grained models,\nunderscoring the importance of electrostatic interactions and counterion\ndynamics in determining their kinetic pathways. These insights may aid in\nbetter understanding the folding, organization, and dynamics of inherently\ncharged biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids.",

    "abstract": "Einstein-aether gravity is a theory that breaks the local Lorentz symmetry by\nintroducing a preferred direction via a vector field, which is considered to\nplay the role of an aether. The theory is identified by four coupling constants\nbetween the aether and gravity. Minimal Einstein-aether is the special case in\nwhich only one of the couplings is non-zero. We show that the aether vector\nfield in its minimal version is Hodge dual to a gauge field. The gauge symmetry\nin the dual description has been known for decades and has been used to\nimplement a cosmological constant into the Lagrangian. As a result, solutions\nto the well-established gauge theory can be transferred into the minimal\nEinstein-aether theory straightforwardly. On the other hand, some of the\nproposed solutions to the minimal Einstein-aether theory could be discarded as\npure gauges of the vanishing aether. We prove as a theorem that this holds true\nfor all divergence-less aether fields.",

In M31, we\nconfirm an outer ring at $\\sim 11$ kpc, consistent with previous studies, and\nidentify for the first time an inner ring at $\\sim 7$ kpc, possibly associated\nwith star formation episodes.\n  Comparing age gradients at different angles, we find a consistent general\ntrend of ages increasing monotonically with radius.

Fe and V atoms tend to occupy different\ncrystallographic positions and form quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) Fe-V\nchains along the c-axis. Millimeter-sized single crystal of\nFe$_{2.99}$VTe$_{3.26}$ (FVT) with slender-stick shape could be grown by\nchemical vapor transport method which reflects its quasi-1D crystal structure.\nMagnetization measurements reveal that FVT orders antiferromagnetically below\nT$_N$=93 K with strong easy ab-plane magnetic anisotropy. Although a weak\nglassy-like behavior appears below 10 K, FVT is dominant by long-range\nantiferromagnetic order in contrast to the spin-glass state in previously\nreported isostructural Fe$_{5}$Te$_{4}$. We also synthesize V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$\nwith similar quasi-1D V-chains and find it has weak anomalies at 144 K on both\nresistivity and susceptibility curves. However, no clear evidence is found for\nthe development of magnetic or charge order. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\nand Curie-Weiss fit reveal that the effective moments for Fe$^{2+}$ and\nV$^{4+}$ in both compounds have large deviations from the conventional local\nmoment model, which may possibly result from the formation of Fe/V metal-metal\nbondings. Furthermore the resistivity of both FVT and V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$ exhibits\nsemiconducting-like temperature-dependent behavior but with average values\nclose to typical bad metals, which resembles the transport behavior in the\nnormal state of Fe-based superconductors. These quasi-1D compounds have shown\ninteresting physical properties for future condensed matter physics research.",

However, statistical fluctuations and physical noise degrade the\nsolution quality, so it is difficult to maintain applicability for large-scale\nproblems. In contrast, Sampling-based Quantum Algorithms have recently been\nsuccessfully applied to large-scale quantum chemistry problems. The quantum\ndevice is used only for sampling, and the ground state and its energy are\nestimated on the classical device. In this study, we propose the Sampling-based\nQuantum Optimization Algorithm (SQOA). Two challenges exist in constructing a\nSampling-based Quantum Algorithm for combinatorial optimization. The first\nchallenge is that we need to encode the optimization problem in a non-diagonal\nHamiltonian, even though many VQAs encode it into the Ising Hamiltonian, which\nis diagonal. The second challenge is that we need a method to prepare the input\nstate to be sampled efficiently. We employ the Quantum Relaxation (QR) method\nfor the first challenge, which encodes multiple classical variables in one\nqubit. It reduces required qubits compared to the Ising Hamiltonian approach.\nMoreover, we investigate the parameter transferability in the Quantum\nAlternating Operator Ansatz for QR Hamiltonians for the second challenge. We\nshow that restricting parameters to a linear form exhibits moderate\ntransferability for 3-regular MaxCut problems, similar to transferability\nobserved in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. This property\nallows us to efficiently prepare the input state for a large instance using the\nparameters from a small instance. We leveraged transferability to create input\nstates and applied SQOA with QR to the MaxCut instances. Transferring\nparameters from a 20-node problem demonstrates that SQOA with QR provides\nhigh-quality solutions for 40-node problems without variational parameter\noptimization.",

In this study, we examine how NDAR\nperformance improves by adjusting the balance between these components. We\ncontrol the degree of exploitation by varying the delay time to 0, 50, and\n$100~\\mu\\text{s}$, and investigate exploration strategies using two quantum\ncircuits, QAOA and a random circuit, on IBM's Heron processor.

In single-layer QAOA and random circuits applied to unweighted\nMax-Cut problem with low edge density, both exploration strategies yield\nsimilar objective value trajectories and provide competitive solution quality\nto simulated annealing for the 80-node problem. Their similar performance\nindicates that, in most cases, increasing amplitude damping noise via\nadditional delay time results in information loss. On the other hand, QAOA\noutperforms random circuits in specific cases, such as positive-negative\nweighted Max-Cut on a fully connected graph. This suggests potential advantages\nof QAOA in more complex settings.

To deepen our understanding of their performance in\nreal-world scenarios where the distributions of training and test data may\ndiffer, we conduct a rigorous investigation into the convergence behavior of\nspectral algorithms under covariate shift. In this setting, the marginal\ndistributions of the input data differ between the training and test datasets,\nwhile the conditional distribution of the output given the input remains\nunchanged. Within a non-parametric regression framework over a reproducing\nkernel Hilbert space, we analyze the convergence rates of spectral algorithms\nunder covariate shift and show that they achieve minimax optimality when the\ndensity ratios between the training and test distributions are uniformly\nbounded. However, when these density ratios are unbounded, the spectral\nalgorithms may become suboptimal. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nweighted spectral algorithm with normalized weights that incorporates density\nratio information into the learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat this normalized weighted approach achieves optimal capacity-independent\nconvergence rates, but the rates will suffer from the saturation phenomenon.\nFurthermore, by introducing a weight clipping technique, we demonstrate that\nthe convergence rates of the weighted spectral algorithm with clipped weights\ncan approach the optimal capacity-dependent convergence rates arbitrarily\nclosely.

Since the\nintroduction of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), numerous\nvariants have been proposed to enhance its performance. QAOA was later extended\nto the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA+), which generalizes the\ninitial state, phase-separation operator, and mixer to address constrained\nproblems without relying on the standard Quadratic Unconstrained Binary\nOptimization (QUBO) formulation. However, QAOA+ often requires additional\nancilla qubits and a large number of multi-controlled Toffoli gates to prepare\nthe superposition of feasible states, resulting in deep circuits that are\nchallenging for near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, VQAs are generally\nhindered by issues such as barren plateaus and suboptimal local minima.\nRecently, Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE), a ground-state preparation\nalgorithm, has been explored as an alternative to QAOA and its variants. QITE\nhas demonstrated improved performance in quantum chemistry problems and has\nbeen applied to unconstrained combinatorial problems such as Max-Cut. In this\nwork, we apply the variational form of QITE (VarQITE) to solve the Multiple\nKnapsack Problem (MKP), a constrained problem, using a Max-Cut-tailored ansatz.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address constrained\noptimization using VarQITE.

Compared to the existing SGG setting, the robust scene graph\ngeneration aims to perform inference on a diverse range of corrupted images,\nwith the core challenge being the domain shift between the clean and corrupted\nimages. Existing SGG methods suffer from degraded performance due to\ncompromised visual features e.g., corruption interference or occlusions. To\nobtain robust visual features, we exploit the layout information, which is\ndomain-invariant, to enhance the efficacy of existing SGG methods on corrupted\nimages.

    "abstract": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning\nresearch. Previous convergence analyses of SGD under the vanishing step-size\nsetting typically require Robbins-Monro conditions. However, in practice, a\nwider variety of step-size schemes are frequently employed, yet existing\nconvergence results remain limited and often rely on strong assumptions. This\npaper bridges this gap by introducing a novel analytical framework based on a\nstopping-time method, enabling asymptotic convergence analysis of SGD under\nmore relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions. In the non-convex\nsetting, we prove the almost sure convergence of SGD iterates for step-sizes $\n\\{ \\epsilon_t \\}_{t \\geq 1} $ satisfying $\\sum_{t=1}^{+\\infty} \\epsilon_t =\n+\\infty$ and $\\sum_{t=1}^{+\\infty} \\epsilon_t^p < +\\infty$ for some $p > 2$.\nCompared with previous studies, our analysis eliminates the global Lipschitz\ncontinuity assumption on the loss function and relaxes the boundedness\nrequirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Building upon\nthe almost sure convergence results, we further establish $L_2$ convergence.\nThese significantly relaxed assumptions make our theoretical results more\ngeneral, thereby enhancing their applicability in practical scenarios.",

SSL uses a teacher-student paradigm where teacher generates\nhigh-confidence-filtered pseudo-labels to guide student. However, in the\ncontext of 3D-RES, where each label corresponds to a single mask and labeled\ndata is scarce, existing SSL methods treat high-quality pseudo-labels merely as\nauxiliary supervision, which limits the model's learning potential. The\nreliance on high-confidence thresholds for filtering often results in\npotentially valuable pseudo-labels being discarded, restricting the model's\nability to leverage the abundant unlabeled data. Therefore, we identify two\ncritical challenges in semi-supervised 3D-RES, namely, inefficient utilization\nof high-quality pseudo-labels and wastage of useful information from\nlow-quality pseudo-labels. In this paper, we introduce the first\nsemi-supervised learning framework for 3D-RES, presenting a robust baseline\nmethod named 3DResT. To address these challenges, we propose two novel designs\ncalled Teacher-Student Consistency-Based Sampling (TSCS) and Quality-Driven\nDynamic Weighting (QDW). TSCS aids in the selection of high-quality\npseudo-labels, integrating them into the labeled dataset to strengthen the\nlabeled supervision signals. QDW preserves low-quality pseudo-labels by\ndynamically assigning them lower weights, allowing for the effective extraction\nof useful information rather than discarding them. Extensive experiments\nconducted on the widely used benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod. Notably, with only 1% labeled data, 3DResT achieves an mIoU improvement\nof 8.34 points compared to the fully supervised method.",

We performed $>6,000$ Type-I\nsimulations of multi-planet systems that mimic the observed {\\it Kepler} sample\nin terms of stellar mass, planet size, multiplicity, and intra-system\nuniformity over a parameter space encompassing transitional and truncated\ndisks.

Moreover, the fraction\nof individual resonances in our simulations reproduced that of the observed\nsample (notably, 5:3 is the most common second-order MMR). The formation of\nhigher-order MMRs favors slower disk migration and a smaller outer planet mass.\nHigher-order resonances do not have to form with the help of a Laplace-like\nthree-body resonance as was proposed for TRAPPIST-1. Instead, the formation of\nhigher-order resonance is assisted by breaking a pre-existing first-order\nresonance, which generates small but non-zero initial eccentricities\n($e\\approx10^{-3}$ to 10$^{-2}$).

In this work, we show that, in at least some cases,\nLLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly,\nand we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this\ninformation to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting\nthe language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic\nimprovements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability\ntechniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to\nwhich that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is\npossible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate\nwith the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of\nthese layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high\nperformance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information\nrequired to produce a correct response is contained within the representations\nof the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning\nis significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error\nafter finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest\nthat it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent\nto which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially\nincreasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons\nrelated to the prior probability of token sequences.",

This integrated framework enables a systematic analysis of\nsynergistic spreading mechanisms under practical constraints and facilitates\nthe exploration of effective epidemic containment strategies.

We also explore the influence of subpopulation characteristics,\nrevealing that increasing inter-subpopulation connectivity in a connected\nmetapopulation network leads to lower disease prevalence.

At the same\ntime, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the\nnewly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We\nassessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep\nfeatures distances select the most informative data in this task. Our\nexperiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the\nDNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over\nUnion (mIoU) compared to the same DNNs trained on the full dataset (0.4374\nmIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.",

    "abstract": "In 1978, Wilczek and Weinberg theoretically discovered a new boson-the\nAxion-which is the coherent oscillation of the $\\theta$ field in QCD. Its\nexistence can solve multiple fundamental questions including the strong CP\nproblem of QCD and the dark matter. However, its detection is challenging\nbecause it has almost no interaction with existing particles. Similar $\\theta$\nhas been introduced to condensed matter and so far studied as a static,\nquantized value to characterize topology of materials. But the coherent\noscillation of $\\theta$ in condensed matter is proposed to lead to new physics\ndirectly analogous to the high-energy Axion particle, the dynamical Axion\nquasiparticle (DAQ). In this paper, we present the direct observation of the\nDAQ. By combining 2D electronic device with ultrafast pump-probe optics, we\nmanage to measure the magnetoelectric coupling $\\theta$ ($\\theta\\propto\\alpha$)\nof 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with sub-picosecond time-resolution. This allows us to\ndirectly observe the DAQ by seeing a coherent oscillation of $\\theta$ at ~44\nGHz in real time, which is uniquely induced by the out-of-phase\nantiferromagnetic magnon. Interestingly, in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, the DAQ arises\nfrom the magnon-induced coherent modulation of Berry curvature. Such ultrafast\ncontrol of quantum wavefunction can be generalized to manipulate Berry\ncurvature and quantum metric of other materials in ultrafast time-scale.\nMoreover, the DAQ enables novel quantum physics such as Axion polariton and\nelectric control of ultrafast spin polarization, implying applications in\nunconventional light-matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic\nspintronics. Beyond condensed matter, the DAQ can serve as a detector of the\ndark matter Axion particle. We estimate the detection frequency range and\nsensitivity in the critically-lacking meV regime, contributing to one of the\nmost challenging questions in fundamental physics.",

Up\nto now, all responses to this problem are negative. That is, there exist\nexplicit symplectic integrators only for some special nonseparable Hamiltonian\nsystems, whereas the universal design involving explicit symplectic integrators\nfor general nonseparable Hamiltonian systems has not yet been studied\nsufficiently. In this paper, we present a constructive proof for the existence\nof explicit symplectic integrators for general nonseparable Hamiltonian systems\nvia finding explicit symplectic mappings under which the special submanifold of\nthe extended phase space is invariant. It turns out that the proposed explicit\nintegrators are symplectic in both the extended phase space and the original\nphase space. Moreover, on the basis of the global modified Hamiltonians of the\nproposed integrators, the backward error analysis is made via a parameter\nrelaxation and restriction technique to show the linear growth of global errors\nand the near-preservation of first integrals. In particular, the effective\nestimated time interval is nearly the same as classical implicit symplectic\nintegrators when applied to (near-) integrable Hamiltonian systems. Numerical\nexperiments with a completely integrable nonseparable Hamiltonian and a\nnonintegrable nonseparable Hamiltonian illustrate the good long-term behavior\nand high efficiency of the explicit symplectic integrators proposed and\nanalyzed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Floods are the most common form of natural disaster and accurate flood\nforecasting is essential for early warning systems. Previous work has shown\nthat machine learning (ML) models are a promising way to improve flood\npredictions when trained on large, geographically-diverse datasets. This\nrequirement of global training can result in a loss of ownership for national\nforecasters who cannot easily adapt the models to improve performance in their\nregion, preventing ML models from being operationally deployed. Furthermore,\ntraditional hydrology research with physics-based models suggests that local\ndata -- which in many cases is only accessible to local agencies -- is valuable\nfor improving model performance. To address these concerns, we demonstrate a\nmethodology of pre-training a model on a large, global dataset and then\nfine-tuning that model on data from individual basins. This results in\nperformance increases, validating our hypothesis that there is extra\ninformation to be captured in local data. In particular, we show that\nperformance increases are most significant in watersheds that underperform\nduring global training. We provide a roadmap for national forecasters who wish\nto take ownership of global models using their own data, aiming to lower the\nbarrier to operational deployment of ML-based hydrological forecast systems.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in both academic and\nindustry settings to automate the evaluation of information seeking systems,\nparticularly by generating graded relevance judgments. Previous work on\nLLM-based relevance assessment has primarily focused on replicating graded\nhuman relevance judgments through various prompting strategies. However, there\nhas been limited exploration of alternative assessment methods or comprehensive\ncomparative studies. In this paper, we systematically compare multiple\nLLM-based relevance assessment methods, including binary relevance judgments,\ngraded relevance assessments, pairwise preference-based methods, and two\nnugget-based evaluation methods~--~document-agnostic and document-dependent. In\naddition to a traditional comparison based on system rankings using Kendall\ncorrelations, we also examine how well LLM judgments align with human\npreferences, as inferred from relevance grades. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on datasets from three TREC Deep Learning tracks 2019, 2020 and\n2021 as well as the ANTIQUE dataset, which focuses on non-factoid open-domain\nquestion answering. As part of our data release, we include relevance judgments\ngenerated by both an open-source (Llama3.2b) and a commercial (gpt-4o) model.\nOur goal is to \\textit{reproduce} various LLM-based relevance judgment methods\nto provide a comprehensive comparison.

We therefore address a general\nsetting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from\nsparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety\nmodel that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact\non the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their\ncorresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory\nis safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to\ndemonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep.\nThird, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and\nderive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy.

This paper proposes a new approach to\nintegrate the prior of elliptical shapes into the deep learning-based SAM image\nsegmentation techniques using variational methods. The proposed method\nestablishes a parameterized elliptical contour field, which constrains the\nsegmentation results to align with predefined elliptical contours. Utilizing\nthe dual algorithm, the model seamlessly integrates image features with\nelliptical priors and spatial regularization priors, thereby greatly enhancing\nsegmentation accuracy. By decomposing SAM into four mathematical sub-problems,\nwe integrate the variational ellipse prior to design a new SAM network\nstructure, ensuring that the segmentation output of SAM consists of elliptical\nregions.

In this Letter, we introduce a\ngeneralized form of Neumann's principle and demonstrate that both FQFE and\nconventional ferroelectricity can be consistently described within this unified\ntheoretical framework. We propose a method, based on the generalized Neumann's\nprinciple, for the systematic identification of FQFE materials. This approach\nis straightforward to apply and offers a clear conceptual understanding and\ndeep physical insight for FQFE. Using this method, we determine all\nsymmetry-allowed FQFE cases across the 32 crystallographic point groups. Since\npractical applications rely on the ability to control polarization, we further\nshow that FQFE can be effectively switched via coupling with conventional\npolarization. Using HfZnN$_2$ as an illustrative example, we reveal the\nunderlying mechanism of this coupling and outline a strategy to identify other\nmaterials with similar switching behavior.",

    "abstract": "We introduce KFinEval-Pilot, a benchmark suite specifically designed to\nevaluate large language models (LLMs) in the Korean financial domain.\nAddressing the limitations of existing English-centric benchmarks,\nKFinEval-Pilot comprises over 1,000 curated questions across three critical\nareas: financial knowledge, legal reasoning, and financial toxicity. The\nbenchmark is constructed through a semi-automated pipeline that combines\nGPT-4-generated prompts with expert validation to ensure domain relevance and\nfactual accuracy. We evaluate a range of representative LLMs and observe\nnotable performance differences across models, with trade-offs between task\naccuracy and output safety across different model families. These results\nhighlight persistent challenges in applying LLMs to high-stakes financial\napplications, particularly in reasoning and safety. Grounded in real-world\nfinancial use cases and aligned with the Korean regulatory and linguistic\ncontext, KFinEval-Pilot serves as an early diagnostic tool for developing safer\nand more reliable financial AI systems.",

    "abstract": "We implement in-situ mid-circuit measurement and reset (MCMR) operations on a\ntrapped-ion quantum computing system by using metastable qubit states in\n$^{171}\\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions. We introduce and compare two methods for isolating\ndata qubits from measured qubits: one shelves the data qubit into the\nmetastable state and the other drives the measured qubit to the metastable\nstate without disturbing the other qubits. We experimentally demonstrate both\nmethods on a crystal of two $^{171}\\textrm{Yb}^+$ ions using both the $S_{1/2}$\nground state hyperfine clock qubit and the $S_{1/2}$-$D_{3/2}$ optical qubit.\nThese MCMR methods result in errors on the data qubit of about $2\\%$ without\ndegrading the measurement fidelity. With straightforward reductions in laser\nnoise, these errors can be suppressed to less than $0.1\\%$. The demonstrated\nmethod allows MCMR to be performed in a single-species ion chain without\nshuttling or additional qubit-addressing optics, greatly simplifying the\narchitecture.",

    "abstract": "Timely and accurate detection of hurricane debris is critical for effective\ndisaster response and community resilience. While post-disaster aerial imagery\nis readily available, robust debris segmentation solutions applicable across\nmultiple disaster regions remain limited. Developing a generalized solution is\nchallenging due to varying environmental and imaging conditions that alter\ndebris' visual signatures across different regions, further compounded by the\nscarcity of training data. This study addresses these challenges by fine-tuning\npre-trained foundational vision models, achieving robust performance with a\nrelatively small, high-quality dataset. Specifically, this work introduces an\nopen-source dataset comprising approximately 1,200 manually annotated aerial\nRGB images from Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike. To mitigate human biases and\nenhance data quality, labels from multiple annotators are strategically\naggregated and visual prompt engineering is employed. The resulting fine-tuned\nmodel, named fCLIPSeg, achieves a Dice score of 0.70 on data from Hurricane Ida\n-- a disaster event entirely excluded during training -- with virtually no\nfalse positives in debris-free areas. This work presents the first\nevent-agnostic debris segmentation model requiring only standard RGB imagery\nduring deployment, making it well-suited for rapid, large-scale post-disaster\nimpact assessments and recovery planning.",

    "abstract": "Rocky planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are prime targets for characterizing\nterrestrial atmospheres, yet their long-term evolution under intense stellar\nwinds and high-energy radiation remains poorly understood. The Kepler-1649\nsystem, which hosts two terrestrial exoplanets orbiting an M5V star, presents a\nvaluable opportunity to explore atmospheric evolution in the extreme\nenvironments characteristic of M-dwarf stellar systems. In this Letter we show\nthat both planets could have retained atmospheres over gigayear timescales.\nUsing a multi-species magnetohydrodynamic model, we simulate atmospheric ion\nescape driven by stellar winds and extreme ultraviolet radiation from 0.7 to\n4.8 Gyrs. The results show that total ion escape rates follow a power-law\ndecline ($\\propto \\tau^{-1.6}$ for Kepler-1649 b, $\\propto \\tau^{-1.5}$ for\nKepler-1649 c$\\,$), with O$^{+}$ dominating atmospheric loss (76.8%-98.7%). The\nescape rates at 4.8 Gyrs are two orders of magnitude lower than those during\nthe early epochs ($1.9\\times10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at 0.7 Gyr vs. $3.0\\times10^{25}$\ns$^{-1}$ at 4.8 Gyrs for planet b$\\,$), while planet b consistently exhibits\n1.1-1.9$\\times$ higher O$^{+}$ escape rates than planet c due to its closer\norbit (0.051 AU vs. 0.088 AU). Despite substantial early atmospheric erosion,\nboth planets may still retain significant atmospheres, suggesting the potential\nfor long-term habitability. These findings offer predictive insight into\natmospheric retention in M-dwarf systems and inform future JWST observations\naimed at refining habitability assessments.",

While prior work combines high-level diffusion-based motion planners\nwith low-level physics controllers, these systems suffer from domain gaps that\ndegrade motion quality and require task-specific fine-tuning. To tackle this\nproblem, we introduce UniPhys, a diffusion-based behavior cloning framework\nthat unifies motion planning and control into a single model. UniPhys enables\nflexible, expressive character motion conditioned on multi-modal inputs such as\ntext, trajectories, and goals. To address accumulated prediction errors over\nlong sequences, UniPhys is trained with the Diffusion Forcing paradigm,\nlearning to denoise noisy motion histories and handle discrepancies introduced\nby the physics simulator. This design allows UniPhys to robustly generate\nphysically plausible, long-horizon motions. Through guided sampling, UniPhys\ngeneralizes to a wide range of control signals, including unseen ones, without\nrequiring task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments show that UniPhys outperforms\nprior methods in motion naturalness, generalization, and robustness across\ndiverse control tasks.",
