    "abstract": "It has been argued that the Feynman path integral formalism leads to a\nquantization rule, and that the Born-Jordan rule is the unique quantization\nrule consistent with the correct short-time propagator behavior of the\npropagator for non-relativistic systems. We examine this short-time\napproximation and conclude, contrary to prevailing views, that the asymptotic\nexpansion applies only to Hamiltonian functions that are at most quadratic in\nthe momentum and with constant mass. While the Born-Jordan rule suggests the\nappropriate quantization of functions in this class, there are other rules\nwhich give the same answer, most notably the Weyl quantization scheme.",

We introduce AAS2RTO, an\nastrophysical transient candidate prioritisation tool written in Python.\nAAS2RTO is flexible in that any number of criteria that consider observed\nproperties of transients can be implemented. The visibility of candidates from\na given observing site is also considered. The prioritised list of candidates\nprovided by AAS2RTO is continually updated when new transient data are made\navailable. Therefore, it can be applied to observing campaigns with a wide\nvariety of scientific motivations. AAS2RTO uses a greedy algorithm to\nprioritise candidates. Candidates are represented by a single numerical value,\nor `score'. Scores are computed by constructing simple numerical factors which\nindividually consider the competing facets of a candidate which make it\nsuitable for follow-up observation. AAS2RTO is currently configured to work\nprimarily with photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF),\ndistributed by certified LSST community brokers.

Traditional Vanilla Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNNs) face issues such as vanishing and exploding gradients, whereas\nsophisticated RNNs such as LSTMs have shown considerable success in this\ndomain.

To address\nthese challenges, this paper proposes the Kolmogorov-Arnold Recurrent Network\n(KARN), a novel load forecasting approach that combines the flexibility of\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks with RNN's temporal modeling capabilities. KARN\nutilizes learnable temporal spline functions and edge-based activations to\nbetter model non-linear relationships in load data, making it adaptable across\na diverse range of consumer types. The proposed KARN model was rigorously\nevaluated on a variety of real-world datasets, including student residences,\ndetached homes, a home with electric vehicle charging, a townhouse, and\nindustrial buildings. Across all these consumer categories, KARN consistently\noutperformed traditional Vanilla RNNs, while it surpassed LSTM and Gated\nRecurrent Units (GRUs) in six buildings.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in\nrole-playing scenarios, particularly in simulating domain-specific experts\nusing tailored prompts. This ability enables LLMs to adopt the persona of\nindividuals with specific backgrounds, offering a cost-effective and efficient\nalternative to traditional, resource-intensive user studies. By mimicking human\nbehavior, LLMs can anticipate responses based on concrete demographic or\nprofessional profiles. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in\nsimulating individuals with diverse backgrounds and analyze the consistency of\nthese simulated behaviors compared to real-world outcomes. In particular, we\nexplore the potential of LLMs to interpret and respond to discharge summaries\nprovided to patients leaving the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We evaluate and\ncompare with human responses the comprehensibility of discharge summaries among\nindividuals with varying educational backgrounds, using this analysis to assess\nthe strengths and limitations of LLM-driven simulations. Notably, when LLMs are\nprimed with educational background information, they deliver accurate and\nactionable medical guidance 88% of the time. However, when other information is\nprovided, performance significantly drops, falling below random chance levels.\nThis preliminary study shows the potential benefits and pitfalls of\nautomatically generating patient-specific health information from diverse\npopulations. While LLMs show promise in simulating health personas, our results\nhighlight critical gaps that must be addressed before they can be reliably used\nin clinical settings. Our findings suggest that a straightforward\nquery-response model could outperform a more tailored approach in delivering\nhealth information. This is a crucial first step in understanding how LLMs can\nbe optimized for personalized health communication while maintaining accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offer robust uncertainty quantification in\nmodel predictions, but training them presents a significant computational\nchallenge. This is mainly due to the problem of sampling multimodal posterior\ndistributions using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and variational\ninference algorithms. Moreover, the number of model parameters scales\nexponentially with additional hidden layers, neurons, and features in the\ndataset. Typically, a significant portion of these densely connected parameters\nare redundant and pruning a neural network not only improves portability but\nalso has the potential for better generalisation capabilities. In this study,\nwe address some of the challenges by leveraging MCMC sampling with network\npruning to obtain compact probabilistic models having removed redundant\nparameters. We sample the posterior distribution of model parameters (weights\nand biases) and prune weights with low importance, resulting in a compact\nmodel. We ensure that the compact BNN retains its ability to estimate\nuncertainty via the posterior distribution while retaining the model training\nand generalisation performance accuracy by adapting post-pruning resampling. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of our MCMC pruning strategy on selected benchmark\ndatasets for regression and classification problems through empirical result\nanalysis. We also consider two coral reef drill-core lithology classification\ndatasets to test the robustness of the pruning model in complex real-world\ndatasets. We further investigate if refining compact BNN can retain any loss of\nperformance. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of training and pruning\nBNNs using MCMC whilst retaining generalisation performance with over 75%\nreduction in network size.

However, only limited research\nhas explored whether the choice of mass-mapping algorithm affects the inference\nof cosmological parameters from weak-lensing higher-order statistics. This\nstudy aims to evaluate the impact of different mass-mapping algorithms on the\ninference of cosmological parameters measured with weak-lensing peak counts. We\nemploy Kaiser-Squires, inpainting Kaiser-Squires, and MCALens mass-mapping\nalgorithms to reconstruct the convergence field from simulated weak-lensing\ndata. Using these maps, we compute the peak counts and wavelet peak counts as\ndata vectors and perform Bayesian analysis with MCMC sampling to estimate\nposterior distributions of cosmological parameters. Our results indicate that\nthe choice of mass-mapping algorithm significantly affects the constraints on\ncosmological parameters, with the MCALens method improving constraints by up to\n157$\\%$ compared to the standard Kaiser-Squires method. This improvement arises\nfrom MCALens' ability to better capture small-scale structures. In contrast,\ninpainting Kaiser-Squires yields constraints similar to Kaiser-Squires,\nindicating a limited benefit from inpainting for cosmological parameter\nestimation with peaks. The accuracy of mass-mapping algorithms is thus critical\nfor cosmological inference from weak-lensing data. Advanced algorithms like\nMCALens, which offer superior reconstruction of the convergence field, can\nsubstantially enhance the precision of cosmological parameter estimates.

    "abstract": "Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological\ntissues and engineered materials. From a mechanics perspective, understanding\nthe structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly\ninteresting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a\nsmall subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load.\nSpecifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form\nload paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber\nnetwork geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior\nof random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we\nimplement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically\nexact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network\nmechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical\nbehavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose\nand validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network\nmechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into\nthe critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and\nfiber networks generated from a Voronoi diagram, and a connection between force\nchains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating\nfiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step\ntowards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks\nundergoing large deformations.

For this purpose, a set of five assumptions were proposed: (a)\nthe existence of the interacting membranes; (b) the curvatures of the membranes\noscillate according to the classical wave equation; (c) the spatial period of\nthe wave that arise when the membranes oscillate is given by $\\lambda =\n{\\xi}{\\pi}/k$; (d) the membranes oscillate with wavelength given by de Broglie\nrelation and (e) $x=ct$ holds. The parameter $\\xi$ determines the period of\noscillation of the given membranes. In deriving the Planck units in this work,\n$\\xi$ must take the value 2 and determines a period 2$\\pi$, closely to minimum\nvalue 1 or to fundamental period $\\pi$, respectively. In this context, Planck\nunits must be fundamental. Moreover, the parameter $\\xi$ was reported as a\nunification parameter between the formulas for the Coulomb$^{\\prime}$s law and\nNewton$^{\\prime}$s law of universal gravitation linking the forces of\nmicroworld and macroworld. Depending on the value $\\xi$ takes, one force or\nanother will be had. It is also shown that the potential $V = hc/{\\xi}{\\pi}x$\ndeduced from the above assumptions and which contributes to deduce the Planck\nunits, can be derived from Yukawa$^{\\prime}$s equation. Hence, the present work\nwould be contributing to theoretical physics, since at the Planck scale\npredictions of some theories like Standard Model, quantum field theory and\ngeneral relativity are not expected to be valid.",

Here, we have learned of two physical\nmechanisms that dominate the acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs).\nThe highest energies and intensities are produced in \"gradual\" events at shock\nwaves driven from the Sun by fast, wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Smaller,\nbut more numerous, \"impulsive\" events with unusual particle composition are\nproduced during magnetic reconnection in solar jets and flares. Jets provide\nopen magnetic field lines where SEPs escape; closed magnetic loops contain this\nenergy to produce bright, hot flares, perhaps even contributing to heating the\nlow corona in profuse nanoflares. Streaming protons amplify Alfven waves\nupstream of the shocks. These waves scatter and trap SEPs and, in large events,\nmodify the element abundances and flatten the low-energy spectra upstream.\nShocks also reaccelerate residual ions from earlier impulsive events, when\navailable, that characteristically dominate the energetic heavy-ion abundances.\nThe large CME-driven shock waves develop an extremely wide longitude span,\nfilling much of the inner heliosphere with energetic particles.",

    "abstract": "This thesis investigates three biologically inspired operations:\nprefix-suffix duplication, bounded prefix-suffix duplication, and\nprefix-suffix-square completion. Duplication, a common genetic mutation,\ninvolves repeating DNA sequences and is modeled here as formal operations on\nwords. The prefix-suffix duplication generates non-context-free languages, even\nfrom simple initial words. To better reflect biological processes, we propose a\nbounded variant that limits duplication length, resolving unsolved problems and\naligning with biochemical realities.\n  We also introduce the prefix-suffix-square completion operation, which\ngenerates squares at sequence ends. This operation enables the generation of\ninfinite words such as Fibonacci, Period-doubling, and Thue-Morse, which\ncontain squares but avoid higher exponent repetitions, highlighting unique\nstructural properties. In contrast, prefix-suffix duplication cannot generate\ncertain infinite words, such as Thue-Morse, but can produce cube-free words.\n  Additionally, we address the detection of gapped repeats and\npalindromes-structures important in DNA and RNA analysis. These involve\nrepeating or reversed factors flanking a central gap. Previous studies imposed\nconstraints on gap length or arm-gap relationships; we extend this by solving\nthe problem in three novel settings.

Recent advances in ultra-low-loss silicon\nnitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) photonic integrated circuits, combined with ion\nimplantation, have enabled the realization of high-power on-chip Er amplifiers\nand lasers with performance comparable to fiber-based counterparts, supporting\ncompact photonic systems. Yet, these results are limited by the high (2 MeV)\nimplantation beam energy required for tightly confined Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides\n(700 nm height), preventing volume manufacturing of Er-doped photonic\nintegrated circuits. Here, we overcome these limitations and demonstrate the\nfirst fully wafer-scale, foundry-compatible Er-doped photonic integrated\ncircuit-based tunable lasers. Using 200 nm-thick Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides, we\nreduce the ion beam energy requirement to below 500 keV, enabling efficient\nwafer-scale implantation with an industrial 300 mm ion implanter. We\ndemonstrate a laser wavelength tuning range of 91 nm, covering nearly the\nentire optical C- and L-bands, with fiber-coupled output power reaching 36 mW\nand an intrinsic linewidth of 95 Hz. The temperature-insensitive properties of\nerbium ions allowed stable laser operation up to 125$^{\\circ}$C and lasing with\nless than 15 MHz drift for over 6 hours at room temperature using a remote\nfiber pump. The fully scalable, low-cost fabrication of Er-doped waveguide\nlasers opens the door for widespread adoption in coherent communications,\nLiDAR, microwave photonics, optical frequency synthesis, and free-space\ncommunications.",

Markov\nDecision Processes (MDPs) provide a natural framework for capturing such\nlong-term dynamics through sequences of states, actions, and rewards. Double\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) enables efficient inference on policy values in\nMDPs, but nonparametric implementations require strong intertemporal overlap\nassumptions and often exhibit high variance and instability. We propose a\nsemiparametric extension of DRL for efficient inference on linear functionals\nof the Q-function--such as policy values--in infinite-horizon, time-homogeneous\nMDPs. By imposing structural restrictions on the Q-function, our approach\nrelaxes the strong overlap conditions required by nonparametric methods and\nimproves statistical efficiency. Under model misspecification, our estimators\ntarget the functional of the best-approximating Q-function, with only\nsecond-order bias. We provide conditions for valid inference using sieve\nmethods and data-driven model selection. A central challenge in DRL is the\nestimation of nuisance functions, such as density ratios, which often involve\ndifficult minimax optimization. To address this, we introduce a novel plug-in\nestimator based on isotonic Bellman calibration, which combines fitted\nQ-iteration with an isotonic regression adjustment. The estimator is debiased\nwithout requiring estimation of additional nuisance functions and reduces\nhigh-dimensional overlap assumptions to a one-dimensional condition.

By integrating n-type (W-doped In_2O_3) and p-type (SnO)\namorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors in the BEOL, Si SRAM\nconfiguration bits are substituted with a less leaky equivalent that can be\nprogrammed at logic-compatible voltages. BEOL-compatible AOS transistors are\ncurrently under extensive research and development in the device community,\nwith investment by leading foundries, from which reported data is used to\ndevelop robust physics-based models in TCAD that enable circuit design. The use\nof AOS pass gates reduces the overhead of reconfigurable circuits by mapping\nFPGA switch block (SB) and connection block (CB) matrices above configurable\nlogic blocks (CLBs), thereby increasing the proximity of logic elements and\nreducing latency. By interfacing with the latest Verilog-to-Routing (VTR)\nsuite, an AOS-based M3D FPGA design implemented in 7 nm technology is\ndemonstrated with 3.4x lower area-time squared product (AT^2), 27% lower\ncritical path latency, and 26% lower reconfigurable routing block power on\nbenchmarks including hyperdimensional computing and large language models\n(LLMs).",

Although the impact of aging on\ndriving behavior has been studied, there is limited research on how these\nbehaviors translate into real-world driving scenarios. This study addresses\nthis need by leveraging Naturalistic Driving Data (NDD) to analyze driving\nperformance measures - specifically, speed limit adherence on interstates and\ndeceleration at stop intersections, both of which may be influenced by\nage-related declines. Using NDD, we developed Cumulative Distribution Functions\n(CDFs) to establish benchmarks for key driving behaviors among senior and young\ndrivers. Our analysis, which included anomaly detection, benchmark comparisons,\nand accuracy evaluations, revealed significant differences in driving patterns\nprimarily related to speed limit adherence at 75mph. While our approach shows\npromising potential for enhancing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) by\nproviding tailored interventions based on age-specific adherence to speed limit\ndriving patterns, we recognize the need for additional data to refine and\nvalidate metrics for other driving behaviors. By establishing precise\nbenchmarks for various driving performance metrics, ADAS can effectively\nidentify anomalies, such as abrupt deceleration, which may indicate impaired\ndriving or other safety concerns. This study lays a strong foundation for\nfuture research aimed at improving safety interventions through detailed\ndriving behavior analysis.",

This paper examines transfer learning strategies for retention\nprediction at U.S. two-year community colleges.

Publicly available contextual information can forecast these\nperformance drops and offer early guidance for model portability. For\ndevelopers under privacy regulations, sequential training selecting\ninstitutions based on demographic similarities enhances fairness without\ncompromising performance. For institutions lacking local data to fine-tune\nsource models, customizing evaluation thresholds for sensitive groups\noutperforms standard transfer techniques in improving performance and fairness.\nOur findings suggest the value of transfer learning for more accessible\neducational predictive modeling and call for judicious use of contextual\ninformation in model training, selection, and deployment to achieve reliable\nand equitable model transfer.",

    "abstract": "Counting permutations of $[n]$ by the number of records, i.e. left-to-right\nmaxima, is a classic problem in combinatorial enumeration. In the first volume\nof ``The Art of Computer Programming\", Donald Knuth demonstrated its relevance\nfor analysis of average case complexity of a basic algorithm for determining a\nmaximum in a linear list of numbers. It is well known that the expected, and\nlikely, number of those records in a {\\it uniformly\\/} random permutation is\nasymptotic to $\\log n$. Cyril Banderier, Rene Beier, and Kurt Mehlhorn studied\nthe case of a non-uniform random permutation, which is obtained from a generic\npermutation of $[n]$ by selecting its elements one after another independently\nwith probability $p$, and permuting the selected elements uniformly at random.\nThey proved that $E_n(p)$, the largest expected number of the maxima, is\nbetween $\\text{const}\\sqrt{n/p}$ and $O\\bigl(\\sqrt{(n/p)\\log n}\\bigr)$ if $p$\nis fixed. For $p\\gg 1/n$ and simultaneously $1-p\\ge \\text{const }n^{-1/2}\\log\nn$, we prove that $E_n(p)$ is exactly of order $(1-p)\\sqrt{n/p}$.",

    "abstract": "We present SynShot, a novel method for the few-shot inversion of a drivable\nhead avatar based on a synthetic prior. We tackle three major challenges.\nFirst, training a controllable 3D generative network requires a large number of\ndiverse sequences, for which pairs of images and high-quality tracked meshes\nare not always available. Second, the use of real data is strictly regulated\n(e.g., under the General Data Protection Regulation, which mandates frequent\ndeletion of models and data to accommodate a situation when a participant's\nconsent is withdrawn). Synthetic data, free from these constraints, is an\nappealing alternative. Third, state-of-the-art monocular avatar models struggle\nto generalize to new views and expressions, lacking a strong prior and often\noverfitting to a specific viewpoint distribution. Inspired by machine learning\nmodels trained solely on synthetic data, we propose a method that learns a\nprior model from a large dataset of synthetic heads with diverse identities,\nexpressions, and viewpoints. With few input images, SynShot fine-tunes the\npretrained synthetic prior to bridge the domain gap, modeling a photorealistic\nhead avatar that generalizes to novel expressions and viewpoints. We model the\nhead avatar using 3D Gaussian splatting and a convolutional encoder-decoder\nthat outputs Gaussian parameters in UV texture space. To account for the\ndifferent modeling complexities over parts of the head (e.g., skin vs hair), we\nembed the prior with explicit control for upsampling the number of per-part\nprimitives. Compared to SOTA monocular and GAN-based methods, SynShot\nsignificantly improves novel view and expression synthesis.",

This study\nidentifies gaps and provides essential insights for advancing serious games in\nrehabilitation, aiming to enhance their engagement for clients and\neffectiveness as a therapeutic tool.

    "abstract": "A distinctive feature of ultralight bosonic dark matter is its ability to\nform a Bose-Einstein condensate with a dense, stationary configuration at the\ncenter of galactic halos. In this work, we investigate the internal dynamics of\nsuch cores by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations within a\nfully self-consistent gravitational framework, accounting for both\ngravitational potential perturbations and local self-interactions. We\ndemonstrate that the solitonic core supports a discrete spectrum of\nwell-defined collective modes. These oscillations characterize the linear\nresponse of the core to perturbations and may influence various dynamical\nprocesses. We also discuss potential astrophysical implications of these\nexcitations on galactic scales.",

In skin cancer diagnosis, while\nadvancements in lesion detection and classification have improved accuracy, the\nblack-box nature of these methods poses challenges in understanding their\ndecision processes, leading to trust issues among physicians. This study\nleverages the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model, trained on\ndifferent skin lesion datasets, to capture meaningful relationships between\nvisual features and diagnostic criteria terms. To further enhance transparency,\nwe propose a method called MedGrad E-CLIP, which builds on gradient-based\nE-CLIP by incorporating a weighted entropy mechanism designed for complex\nmedical imaging like skin lesions. This approach highlights critical image\nregions linked to specific diagnostic descriptions. The developed integrated\npipeline not only classifies skin lesions by matching corresponding\ndescriptions but also adds an essential layer of explainability developed\nespecially for medical data.

Most recent works have\npredominantly focused on designing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structures and in\ntegrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently perform multi-task\nlearning. However, their rigid combination hampers both the optimization of MoE\nand the ef fectiveness of reparameterization of LoRA, leading to sub-optimal\nperformance and low inference speed. In this work, we propose a novel approach\ndubbed Efficient Multi-Task Learning (EMTAL) by transforming a pre-trained\nVision Transformer into an efficient multi-task learner during training, and\nreparameterizing the learned structure for efficient inference. Specifically,\nwe firstly develop the MoEfied LoRA structure, which decomposes the pre-trained\nTransformer into a low-rank MoE structure and employ LoRA to fine-tune the\nparameters. Subsequently, we take into account the intrinsic asynchronous\nnature of multi-task learning and devise a learning Quality Retaining (QR)\noptimization mechanism, by leveraging the historical high-quality class logits\nto prevent a well-trained task from performance degradation. Finally, we design\na router fading strategy to integrate the learned parameters into the original\nTransformer, archiving efficient inference. Extensive experiments on public\nbenchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art multi-task learning approaches.",

Resonant cavities for dark matter detection have traditionally\nemployed mechanical tuning, moving parts around to change electromagnetic\nboundary conditions.

Instead, we develop an\nelectronically tunable cavity architecture by coupling a superconducting 3D\nmicrowave cavity with a DC flux tunable SQUID.

A microwave photon\ncounting technique is employed through repeated quantum non-demolition\nmeasurements using a transmon qubit.

Neural-enhanced video transmission\nalgorithms employing super-resolution (SR) for video quality enhancement have\neffectively challenged WAN environments. However, these SR-based methods\nrequire intensive fine-tuning for the whole video, making it infeasible in\ndiverse online cloud gaming. To address this, we introduce River, a cloud\ngaming delivery framework designed based on the observation that video segment\nfeatures in cloud gaming are typically repetitive and redundant. This permits a\nsignificant opportunity to reuse fine-tuned SR models, reducing the fine-tuning\nlatency of minutes to query latency of milliseconds. To enable the idea, we\ndesign a practical system that addresses several challenges, such as model\norganization, online model scheduler, and transfer strategy. River first builds\na content-aware encoder that fine-tunes SR models for diverse video segments\nand stores them in a lookup table. When delivering cloud gaming video streams\nonline, River checks the video features and retrieves the most relevant SR\nmodels to enhance the frame quality. Meanwhile, if no existing SR model\nperforms well enough for some video segments, River will further fine-tune new\nmodels and update the lookup table. Finally, to avoid the overhead of streaming\nmodel weight to the clients, River designs a prefetching strategy that predicts\nthe models with the highest possibility of being retrieved. Our evaluation\nbased on real video game streaming demonstrates River can reduce redundant\ntraining overhead by 44% and improve the Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio by 1.81dB\ncompared to the SOTA solutions.

Based upon the correlated electronic structures, A\nmodified random-phase-approximation (RPA) approach yields a pronounced\n$s^{\\pm}$-wave pairing instability, due to the strong spin fluctuations\noriginated from Fermi surface nesting between bands with predominantly\n$d_{z^{2}}$ characters.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), short, high-energy\nevents from distant galaxies, offer a unique opportunity to impose\nobservational limits on TOF delays and, by extension, on the energy scales of\nquantum gravity. Using the standard Jacob-Piran relation, which assumes a\nlocally-flat spacetime, the analysis of quantum gravity-induced TOF effects\nestablishes a lower limit of approximately $10 E_{\\rm Pl}$ on the energy scale\nof these effects.

We distinguish between general claims and those\ndocumented via causal inference methods (e.g., DiD, IV, RDD, RCTs). We document\na substantial rise in the share of causal claims-from roughly 4% in 1990 to\nnearly 28% in 2020-reflecting the growing influence of the \"credibility\nrevolution.\" We find that causal narrative complexity (e.g., the depth of\ncausal chains) strongly predicts both publication in top-5 journals and higher\ncitation counts, whereas non-causal complexity tends to be uncorrelated or\nnegatively associated with these outcomes. Novelty is also pivotal for top-5\npublication, but only when grounded in credible causal methods: introducing\ngenuinely new causal edges or paths markedly increases both the likelihood of\nacceptance at leading outlets and long-run citations, while non-causal novelty\nexhibits weak or even negative effects. Papers engaging with central, widely\nrecognized concepts tend to attract more citations, highlighting a divergence\nbetween factors driving publication success and long-term academic impact.\nFinally, bridging underexplored concept pairs is rewarded primarily when\ngrounded in causal methods, yet such gap filling exhibits no consistent link\nwith future citations.

Some voting games exhibit a\nhierarchical structure, including the US electoral college and ensemble\nlearning methods; we call such games hierarchical voting games. It is generally\nunderstood that BPI in hierarchical voting games can be computed via a\nrecursive decomposition of the hierarchy, which can substantially reduce the\ncalculation's complexity. We identify a key (previously undocumented)\nassumption on which this decomposition is based, namely balance, meaning one\ngroup of voters has enough votes to win whenever the complementary group of\nvoters does not, and vice versa. We then introduce a generalization of BPI that\nwe call Extended BPI (EBPI) for all voting games, including those that are not\nbalanced, which simplifies to BPI in balanced games. We show that BPI in\nunbalanced hierarchical voting games decomposes in terms of EBPI at each level\nin the hierarchy, which yields computational savings analogous to those\nachieved in the balanced case. As a sample application, we take advantage of\nthe compositionality of language, and model the impact of individual words on a\nsentence's sentiment as a voting game. As the complement of a phrase in a\nsentence does not necessarily have the opposite sentiment, this voting game is\nunbalanced and requires our decomposition of BPI in terms of EBPI. Our results\nsuggest that EBPI is an effective proxy for BPI (because the meaning of a\nsentence is not always 100\\% compositional), and demonstrate a dramatic\nimprovement in run time.",

Under a generalized unconfoundedness assumption, we provide\ncausal identification for this hypothesis. Our approach requires neither the\nno-interference nor the positive overlap assumption, making it a widely\napplicable tool for detecting causal effects. A unique advantage of FRT lies in\nthe separated roles of assignment and outcome models. The former, whether known\nfrom randomized experiments or estimated in observational studies, guarantees\nvalid Type I error control at least asymptotically. The latter, even if\nmisspecified, is used to construct optimal test statistics derived from Bayes\nfactors. The synthesis of two classes of models through FRT yields a calibrated\nBayesian procedure with desired frequentist properties. Recognizing that the\ngeneralized unconfoundedness assumption is untestable in observational studies,\nwe develop a novel sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of causal\nconclusions to unobserved confounding. Through a re-analysis of a panel\ndataset, we show how our methods can be integrated into a pipeline for\nobservational causal inference.",

    "abstract": "Despite the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, deep learning has yet to\nachieve much success with tabular data due to heterogeneous feature space and\nlimited sample sizes without viable transfer learning. The new era of\ngenerative AI, powered by large language models (LLM), brings unprecedented\nlearning opportunities to diverse data and domains. This paper investigates the\neffectiveness of an LLM application programming interface (API) and transfer\nlearning of LLM in tabular data classification. LLM APIs respond to input text\nprompts with tokenized data and instructions, whereas transfer learning\nfinetunes an LLM for a target classification task. This paper proposes an\nend-to-end finetuning of LLM to demonstrate cross-data transfer learning on ten\nbenchmark data sets when large pre-trained tabular data models do not exist to\nfacilitate transfer learning. The proposed LLM finetuning method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art machine and deep learning methods on tabular data with less\nthan ten features - a standard feature size for tabular data sets. The transfer\nlearning approach uses a fraction of the computational cost of other deep\nlearning or API-based solutions while ensuring competitive or superior\nclassification performance.",

    "abstract": "Scaling up the vocabulary of semantic segmentation models is extremely\nchallenging because annotating large-scale mask labels is labour-intensive and\ntime-consuming. Recently, language-guided segmentation models have been\nproposed to address this challenge. However, their performance drops\nsignificantly when applied to out-of-distribution categories. In this paper, we\npropose a new large vocabulary semantic segmentation framework, called LarvSeg.\nDifferent from previous works, LarvSeg leverages image classification data to\nscale the vocabulary of semantic segmentation models as large-vocabulary\nclassification datasets usually contain balanced categories and are much easier\nto obtain. However, for classification tasks, the category is image-level,\nwhile for segmentation we need to predict the label at pixel level. To address\nthis issue, we first propose a general baseline framework to incorporate\nimage-level supervision into the training process of a pixel-level segmentation\nmodel, making the trained network perform semantic segmentation on newly\nintroduced categories in the classification data. We then observe that a model\ntrained on segmentation data can group pixel features of categories beyond the\ntraining vocabulary. Inspired by this finding, we design a category-wise\nattentive classifier to apply supervision to the precise regions of\ncorresponding categories to improve the model performance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that LarvSeg significantly improves the large\nvocabulary semantic segmentation performance, especially in the categories\nwithout mask labels. For the first time, we provide a 21K-category semantic\nsegmentation model with the help of ImageNet21K. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/HaojunYu1998/large_voc_seg.",

In this article, we focus on the important, but often\nneglected, group of integrators within such a sociotechnical system. In complex\nhuman-machine configurations, integrators carry responsibility for linking the\ndisparate groups of developers and users in the political and military system.\nTo act as the mediating group requires a deep understanding of the other\ngroups' activities, perspectives and norms. We thus ask which challenges and\nshortcomings emerge from integrating AI systems into resort-to-force (RTF)\ndecision-making processes, and how to address them. To answer this, we proceed\nin three steps. First, we conceptualise the relationship between different\ngroups of actors and AI systems as a sociotechnical system. Second, we identify\nchallenges within such systems for human-machine teaming in RTF decisions. We\nfocus on challenges that arise a) from the technology itself, b) from the\nintegrators' role in the sociotechnical system, c) from the human-machine\ninteraction.

To accelerate CNN inference,\nprior works proposed to distribute the inference workload across multiple\ndevices. However, they did not address stragglers and device failures in\ndistributed inference, which is challenging due to the devices' time-varying\nand possibly unknown computation/communication capacities. To address this, we\npropose a distributed coded inference system, called CoCoI. It splits the\nconvolutional layers of CNN, considering the data dependency of\nhigh-dimensional inputs and outputs, and then adapts coding schemes to generate\ntask redundancy. With CoCoI, the inference results can be determined once a\nsubset of devices complete their subtasks, improving robustness against\nstragglers and failures. To theoretically analyze the tradeoff between\nredundancy and subtask workload, we formulate an optimal splitting problem to\nminimize the expected inference latency. Despite its non-convexity, we\ndetermine an approximate strategy with minor errors, and prove that CoCoI\noutperforms uncoded benchmarks. For performance evaluation, we build a testbed\nwith Raspberry Pi 4Bs. The experimental results show that the approximate\nstrategy closely matches the optimal solution.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images\nand video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with\nuser-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes\nfine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but\nthese methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In\nthis work, we present Feynman-Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework\nfor steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by\nsampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called\nparticles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores\ncomputed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using\nrewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value\nindicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various\nchoices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK\nsteering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image\nmodels with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B\nparameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt\nfidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion\nmodels with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that\nFK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs\nand enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results\ndemonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models - even\nwith off-the-shelf rewards - can provide significant sample quality gains and\ncontrollability benefits.

We show that these REML implementations with homo- or heterogeneous\nvariances perform similarly or better than the Bayesian models. We also show\nthat the REML implementation comes with a significant increase in computational\nefficiency, being up to 12 times faster than the Bayesian models while using\nless memory.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across\ndiverse tasks, yet their training remains highly resource-intensive and\nsusceptible to critical challenges such as training instability. A predominant\nsource of this instability stems from gradient and loss spikes, which disrupt\nthe learning process, often leading to costly interventions like checkpoint\nrecovery and experiment restarts, further amplifying inefficiencies. This paper\npresents a comprehensive investigation into gradient spikes observed during LLM\ntraining, revealing their prevalence across multiple architectures and\ndatasets. Our analysis shows that these spikes can be up to $1000\\times$ larger\nthan typical gradients, substantially deteriorating model performance. To\naddress this issue, we propose Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset SPAM, a\nnovel optimizer designed to counteract gradient spikes through momentum reset\nand spike-aware gradient clipping. Extensive experiments, including both\npre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrate that SPAM consistently surpasses Adam\nand its variants across various tasks, including (1) LLM pre-training from 60M\nto 1B, (2) 4-bit LLM pre-training,(3) reinforcement learning, and (4) Time\nSeries Forecasting. Additionally, SPAM facilitates memory-efficient training by\nenabling sparse momentum, where only a subset of momentum terms are maintained\nand updated. When operating under memory constraints, SPAM outperforms\nstate-of-the-art memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore and Adam-Mini. Our\nwork underscores the importance of mitigating gradient spikes in LLM training\nand introduces an effective optimization strategy that enhances both training\nstability and resource efficiency at scale.

Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its\nadvantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks,\nwhich motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task.\nHowever, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the\noriginal GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single\nscene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to\ndifferent images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by\ndeveloping two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we\nelaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding\nimage-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward\nmanner. Each Gaussian can fit the shape and direction of an area of complex\ntextures, showing powerful representation capability. Secondly, we implement an\nefficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render\nsuper-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted\ncontinuous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely\nGSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive\nexperiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Despite the impressive performance of recent\nfoundational segmentation models like SAM on natural images, they struggle with\nmedical domain images. Beyond this, recent approaches that perform end-to-end\nfine-tuning of models are simply not computationally tractable. To address\nthis, we propose a novel SAM adapter approach that minimizes the number of\ntrainable parameters while achieving comparable performances to full\nfine-tuning. The proposed SAM adapter is strategically placed in the mask\ndecoder, offering excellent and broad generalization capabilities and improved\nsegmentation across both fully supervised and test-time domain adaptation\ntasks.

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been extensively used to address\nportfolio optimization problems. The DRL agents acquire knowledge and make\ndecisions through unsupervised interactions with their environment without\nrequiring explicit knowledge of the joint dynamics of portfolio assets. Among\nthese DRL algorithms, the combination of actor-critic algorithms and deep\nfunction approximators is the most widely used DRL algorithm. Here, we find\nthat training the DRL agent using the actor-critic algorithm and deep function\napproximators may lead to scenarios where the improvement in the DRL agent's\nrisk-adjusted profitability is not significant. We propose that such situations\nprimarily arise from the following two problems: sparsity in positive reward\nand the curse of dimensionality. These limitations prevent DRL agents from\ncomprehensively learning asset price change patterns in the training\nenvironment. As a result, the DRL agents cannot explore the dynamic portfolio\noptimization policy to improve the risk-adjusted profitability in the training\nprocess. To address these problems, we propose a novel multi-agent Hierarchical\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) algorithmic framework in this research.\nUnder this framework, the agents work together as a learning system for\nportfolio optimization. Specifically, by designing an auxiliary agent that\nworks together with the executive agent for optimal policy exploration, the\nlearning system can focus on exploring the policy with higher risk-adjusted\nreturn in the action space with positive return and low variance. In this way,\nwe can overcome the issue of the curse of dimensionality and improve the\ntraining efficiency in the positive reward sparse environment.",

These\nmeasurements provided the wave amplitudes and speeds as a function of relative\nhumidity, and these data were used to calculate the elastic moduli and\nultrasonic attenuation of the xerogel-water composite. Analysis of the elastic\nmoduli evolution suggested that confined water shows nearly bulk-like\nproperties in mesopores, while in micropores its modulus noticeably differs\nfrom that of bulk water, consistent with theoretical predictions.

    "abstract": "In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect\n(NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order\n(higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at\nlower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these\nmodes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been\nmade in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this\nwork, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect\nin a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a\nsquare lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite\nmany-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of\ninteractions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of\ninteractions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon\nstates (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice,\nwhile the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin\nmodes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states,\nlocalized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along\nthese boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly\nwith the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this\ninteracting system.

However, it suffers from large latency\noverhead especially for long input sequences. While key-value (KV) cache\neviction algorithms have been proposed to reduce the computation and memory\ncost for plaintext inference, they are not designed for MPC and cannot benefit\nprivate inference easily. In this paper, we propose an accurate and\nMPC-friendly KV cache eviction framework, dubbed MPCache.

Hence, MPCache combines a look-once static\neviction algorithm to discard unimportant tokens and a query-aware dynamic\nselection algorithm to further select a small subset of tokens for attention\ncomputation. As existing dynamic selection algorithms incur too much latency,\nwe propose a series of optimizations to drastically reduce the KV cache\nselection overhead, including MPC-friendly similarity approximation,\nhierarchical KV cache clustering, and cross-layer index sharing strategy. With\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that MPCache consistently outperforms\nprior-art KV cache eviction baselines across different LLM generation tasks and\nachieves 1.8~2.01x and 3.39~8.37x decoding latency and communication reduction\non different sequence lengths, respectively.",

This flexibility poses an\nextraordinary challenge for quality assurance, as the enormous number of\npossible configurations makes it impractical to test each of them separately.\nThis is where t-wise interaction sampling can be used to systematically cover\nthe configuration space and detect unknown feature interactions. Over the last\ntwo decades, numerous algorithms for computing small interaction samples have\nbeen studied, providing improvements for a range of heuristic results;\nnevertheless, it has remained unclear how much these results can still be\nimproved.\n  We present a significant breakthrough: a fundamental framework, based on the\nmathematical principle of duality, for combining near-optimal solutions with\nprovable lower bounds on the required sample size. This implies that we no\nlonger need to work on heuristics with marginal or no improvement, but can\ncertify the solution quality by establishing a limit on the remaining gap; in\nmany cases, we can even prove optimality of achieved solutions. This\ntheoretical contribution also provides extensive practical improvements: Our\nalgorithm SampLNS was tested on 47 small and medium-sized configurable systems\nfrom the existing literature. SampLNS can reliably find samples of smaller size\nthan previous methods in 85% of the cases; moreover, we can achieve and prove\noptimality of solutions for 63% of all instances.

Hash\nlearning is one of the most important retrieval technologies which can keep the\ndistance between hash codes consistent with the distance between DVS data. As\nspiking neural networks (SNNs) can encode information through spikes, they\ndemonstrate great potential in promoting energy efficiency. Based on the binary\ncharacteristics of SNNs, we first propose a novel supervised hashing method\nnamed Spikinghash with a hierarchical lightweight structure. Spiking WaveMixer\n(SWM) is deployed in shallow layers, utilizing a multilevel 3D discrete wavelet\ntransform (3D-DWT) to decouple spatiotemporal features into various\nlow-frequency and high frequency components, and then employing efficient\nspectral feature fusion. SWM can effectively capture the temporal dependencies\nand local spatial features. Spiking Self-Attention (SSA) is deployed in deeper\nlayers to further extract global spatiotemporal information. We also design a\nhash layer utilizing binary characteristic of SNNs, which integrates\ninformation over multiple time steps to generate final hash codes. Furthermore,\nwe propose a new dynamic soft similarity loss for SNNs, which utilizes membrane\npotentials to construct a learnable similarity matrix as soft labels to fully\ncapture the similarity differences between classes and compensate information\nloss in SNNs, thereby improving retrieval performance. Experiments on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that Spikinghash can achieve state-of-the-art results with\nlow energy consumption and fewer parameters.",

    "abstract": "Massive stars can end their lives with a successful supernova explosion\n(leaving behind a neutron star or, more rarely, a black hole), or a failed\nexplosion that leaves behind a black hole. The density structure of the\npre-collapse progenitor star already encodes much of the information regarding\nthe outcome and properties of the explosion. However, the complexity of the\ncollapse and subsequent shock expansion phases prevents drawing a\nstraightforward connection between the pre-collapse and post-explosion\nproperties. In order to derive such a connection several explodability studies\nhave been performed in recent years. However, different studies can predict\ndifferent explosion outcomes. In this article, we show how compactness, which\nis related to the average density of the star's core, has an important role in\ndetermining the efficiency of neutrino heating, and therefore the outcome of\nthe explosion. Commonly, high-compactness progenitors are assumed to yield\nfailed explosions, due to their large mass accretion rates, preventing the\nshock from expanding. We show by analyzing $\\sim$ 150 2D FLASH and Fornax\nsimulations and 20 3D Fornax simulations that this is not the case. Instead,\ndue to the rapid increase of neutrino heating with compactness,\nhigh-compactness progenitors lead to successful shock revival. We also show\nthat 1D+ simulations that include $\\nu$-driven convection using a mixing-length\ntheory approach correctly reproduce this trend. Finally, we compare 1D+ models,\nwhich we show can reproduce some aspects of multi-D simulations with reasonable\naccuracy, with other widely used 1D models in the literature.",

The inner boundary of the thin accretion disk extends to the event\nhorizon, and the accretion material in the disk exhibits two different motion\nbehaviors, that is, it moves along the critical plunging orbit inside the\ninnermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and follows the Keplerian orbit outside\nthe ISCO. The shadow image is captured on the imaging plane of a zero angular\nmomentum observer utilizing advanced fisheye camera ray-tracing techniques. The\nresults demonstrate that an image consistently reveals a dark region encircled\nby a narrow photon ring, which is called the inner shadow. At low observation\ninclination angles, the observation intensity is highly concentrated, with the\nlensed image of accretion disk being superimposed on the direct image. As\nobservation inclination angle increases, the direct and lensed images gradually\nseparate, becoming distinctly distinguishable and forming a hat-like structure.\nFurthermore, variations in the parameter space and observation angle will\ninfluence pertinent image characteristics, including image symmetry, the range\nor deformation degree of the inner shadow. We further examined the distinctive\ncharacteristics of images observed in both prograde and retrograde accretion\ndisk scenarios. Subsequently, we also examined the redshift distribution on the\ndisk. The findings indicate that while variations in relevant parameters do\ninfluence the redshift distribution, the primary factor is the change in\nobservational inclination.

We show that neither zero\ncovariance nor whitening is necessary. For any order $h>2$, a simple\ndiagonality condition on the $h$th-order cumulants alone identifies the\nstructural parameter matrix -- up to unknown scaling and permutation -- as the\nsolution to an eigenvector problem; no restrictions on cumulants of other\norders are required.

[\\textit{Laser \\& Photonics Rev.}, 2018, vol. 12, p.\n1800005] presented a grouped nanohole array in silicon slab possessing anapole\nmode in visible range. In this work, it is proved that despite of the existence\nof the anapole mode in the proposed nanostructure the valuable electric field\nconfinement is not reached. Thus most expected uses of the anapole state cannot\nbe gained through this nanostructure. As demonstrated here, the aforementioned\nnanostructure may be replaced by the square nanohole array having the anapole\nstate with different meta-atom and much larger electric field confinement.",

Specifically, given a\npre-trained generator capable of producing a NeRF representation such as\ntri-plane, we first perform volume rendering to obtain a low-resolution image\nwith corresponding depth and normal map.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in smart radio environment technologies aim to enhance\nwireless network performance through the use of low-cost electromagnetic (EM)\ndevices. Among these, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have garnered\nattention for their ability to modify incident waves via programmable\nscattering elements. An RIS is a nearly passive device, in which the tradeoff\nbetween performance, power consumption, and optimization overhead depend on how\noften the RIS needs to be reconfigured. This paper focuses on the metaprism\n(MTP), a static frequency-selective metasurface which relaxes the\nreconfiguration requirements of RISs and allows for the creation of different\nbeams at various frequencies. In particular, we address the design of an ideal\nMTP based on its frequency-dependent reflection coefficients, defining the\ngeneral properties necessary to achieve the desired beam steering function in\nthe angle-frequency domain. We also discuss the limitations of previous studies\nthat employed oversimplified models, which may compromise performance. Key\ncontributions include a detailed exploration of the equivalence of the MTP to\nan ideal S-parameter multiport model and an analysis of its implementation\nusing Foster's circuits. Additionally, we introduce a realistic multiport\nnetwork model that incorporates aspects overlooked by ideal scattering models,\nalong with an ad hoc optimization strategy for this model. The performance of\nthe proposed optimization approach and circuits implementation are validated\nthrough simulations using a commercial full-wave EM simulator, confirming the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

Here, we\nperform a systematic study of electrostatic interactions between 785 nm\nresonant gold nanorods designed to harbor zeta potentials of +29, +16, 0 and -9\nmV spanning positive neutral and negative domains. SERS activity is tested on\nrepresentative Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus\nepidermidis bacteria with zeta potentials of -30 and -23 mV respectively in\nwater.

This paper addresses these\nchallenges by proposing a framework for robust sensor placement to optimize\nanomaly detection in the physical layer and enhance communication resilience in\nthe cyber layer. We model the CPPS as an interdependent network via a graph,\nallowing for simultaneous consideration of both layers.

This study\nintroduces a robust framework for multi-person localization and vital signs\nmonitoring, using multiple-input-multiple-output frequency-modulated continuous\nwave radar, addressing challenges in real-world, cluttered environments. Two\nkey contributions are presented. First, a custom hardware phantom was developed\nto simulate multi-person NCVSM scenarios, utilizing recorded thoracic impedance\nsignals to replicate realistic cardiopulmonary dynamics. The phantom's design\nfacilitates repeatable and rapid validation of radar systems and algorithms\nunder diverse conditions to accelerate deployment in human monitoring. Second,\naided by the phantom, we designed a robust algorithm for multi-person\nlocalization utilizing joint sparsity and cardiopulmonary properties, alongside\nharmonics-resilient dictionary-based vital signs estimation, to mitigate\ninterfering respiration harmonics. Additionally, an adaptive signal refinement\nprocedure is introduced to enhance the accuracy of continuous NCVSM by\nleveraging the continuity of the estimates. Performance was validated and\ncompared to existing techniques through 12 phantom trials and 12 human trials,\nincluding both single- and multi-person scenarios, demonstrating superior\nlocalization and NCVSM performance.

The effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod is validated through experiments conducted on one synthetic and six\nreal-world datasets.

Experimental results demonstrate\nthat optimizing procedural fairness metrics mitigates biases introduced or\namplified by the decision-making process, thereby ensuring fairness in the\ndecision-making process itself, as well as improving distributive fairness. In\ncontrast, optimizing distributive fairness metrics encourages the ML model's\ndecision-making process to favor disadvantaged groups, counterbalancing the\ninherent preferences for advantaged groups present in the dataset and\nultimately achieving distributive fairness.",

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel multi-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (MC-FTN) signaling scheme\nfor OTFS systems. By adopting non-orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency\ndomains, our scheme significantly improves the capacity of OTFS systems.\nSpecifically, we firstly develop the signal models for both single-input\nsingle-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OTFS systems.\nThen, we optimize the delay-Doppler (DD) domain precoding matrix at the\ntransmitter to suppress both the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and\ninter-carrier interference (ICI) introduced by the MC-FTN signaling. For SISO\nsystems, we develop an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) precoding scheme with\noptimal power allocation (PA) for achieving the maximum capacity. For MIMO\nsystems, we develop a successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based\nprecoding scheme via decomposing the capacity maximization problem into\nmultiple sub-capacity maximization problems with largely reduced dimensions of\noptimization variables.

This motivates us to concatenate specimen images into a\n``pseudo-video'' and reframe trait segmentation as a tracking problem.\nSpecifically, SST generates masks for unlabeled images by propagating annotated\nor predicted masks from the ``pseudo-preceding'' images. Built upon recent\nvideo segmentation models, such as Segment Anything Model 2, SST achieves\nhigh-quality trait segmentation with only one labeled image per species,\nmarking a breakthrough in specimen image analysis.

Unlike\nconventional formulations, the resulting system incorporates variable density\nand two additional terms involving its spatial derivative. As a result, the\ncoefficient matrices are no longer constant and depend on the radial\ncoordinate, rendering the common solution methods inapplicable. Thus, we\nintroduce a radial discretization scheme within the framework of the scaled\nboundary finite element method. We employ finite difference approximation, yet\nthe choice underlying our ansatz is made for demonstration purposes and remains\nflexible. Next, we introduce an algorithmic condensation procedure to compute\nthe dynamic stiffness matrices on the fly. Therefore, we maneuver around the\nneed to introduce auxiliary unknowns. As a result, the optimization problem is\nstructured in a two-level hierarchy. We obtain the Fr\\'echet kernel by\ncomputing the zero-lag cross-correlations of the forward and adjoint\nwavefields, and solve the minimization problems iteratively by moving downhill\non the cost function hypersurface through the limited-memory BFGS algorithm.\nThe numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the new\nformulation and show that using the simplified differential equation along with\nthe conventional formulation is highly inferior to applying the complete form\nof the differential equation.

    "abstract": "Temporal sentence grounding in videos (TSGV) faces challenges due to public\nTSGV datasets containing significant temporal biases, which are attributed to\nthe uneven temporal distributions of target moments. Existing methods generate\naugmented videos, where target moments are forced to have varying temporal\nlocations. However, since the video lengths of the given datasets have small\nvariations, only changing the temporal locations results in poor generalization\nability in videos with varying lengths. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntraining framework complemented by diversified data augmentation and a domain\ndiscriminator. The data augmentation generates videos with various lengths and\ntarget moment locations to diversify temporal distributions. However, augmented\nvideos inevitably exhibit distinct feature distributions which may introduce\nnoise. To address this, we design a domain adaptation auxiliary task to\ndiminish feature discrepancies between original and augmented videos. We also\nencourage the model to produce distinct predictions for videos with the same\ntext queries but different moment locations to promote debiased training.\nExperiments on Charades-CD and ActivityNet-CD datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generalization abilities of our method in multiple grounding\nstructures, achieving state-of-the-art results.",

    "abstract": "The paper at hand presents an in-depth investigation into the fatigue\nbehavior of the high-strength aluminum alloy EN AW-7020 T6 using both\nexperimental and numerical approaches. Two types of specimens are investigated:\na dog-bone specimen subjected to cyclic loading in a symmetric\nstrain-controlled regime, and a compact tension specimen subjected to repeated\nloading and unloading, which leads to damage growth from the notch tip.\nExperimental data from these tests are used to identify the different phases of\nfatigue. Subsequently, a plastic-damage model is developed, incorporating J2\nplasticity with Chaboche-type mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening. A detailed\ninvestigation reveals that the Chaboche model must be blended with a suitable\nisotropic hardening and combined with a proper damage growth model to\naccurately describe cyclic fatigue including large plastic strains up to\nfailure. Multiple back-stress components with independent properties are\nsuperimposed, and exponential isotropic hardening with saturation effects is\nintroduced to improve alignment with experimental results. For damage,\ndifferent stress splits are tested, with the deviatoric/volumetric split\nproving successful in reproducing the desired degradation in peak stress and\nstiffness. A nonlinear activation function is introduced to ensure smooth\ntransitions between tension and compression. Two damage indices, one for the\ndeviatoric part and one for the volumetric part, are defined, each of which is\ngoverned by a distinct trilinear damage growth function. The governing\ndifferential equation of the problem is regularized by higher-order gradient\nterms to address the ill-posedness induced by softening. Finally, the\nplasticity model is calibrated using finite element simulations of the dog-bone\ntest and subsequently applied to the cyclic loading of the compact tension\nspecimen.",

We have implemented TWSCardio as an efficient real-time app. Our\nexperiments on 100 subjects verify that TWSCardio can accurately reconstruct\ncardiac signals while showing resilience to motion artifacts, missing data, and\nlow sampling rates.

Specifically, the competition between interfacial anisotropy and\nprocess anisotropy (thermal gradient and growth velocity) during directional\nsolidification leads to rich morphological diversity of the resulting dendritic\nstructures, including tilted dendrites and seaweed patterns. The orientation\nselection mechanisms of such patterns remain unexplored at high velocity in the\nframe of AM.

    "abstract": "Quasar outflows often consist of two clouds with velocity separations\nmatching the doublet spacings of common UV resonance transitions, a phenomenon\nknown as line-locking, which is commonly observed in quasar spectra. Multiple\nclouds can be locked together through multi-ion doublets, forming 'line-locking\nweb'. In the second paper of the TOLL project, we present discovery of one of\nthe largest 'line-locking web' known to date from the VLT/UVES spectra of QSO\nJ151352+085555. We identify 12 associated narrow absorption line systems\nthrough the C IV, N V, Si IV, O VI, and multiple Lyman lines (Ly${\\alpha}$ to\nLy${\\epsilon}$), and find 10 out of the 12 absorbers are line-locked together\nby comparing velocity separations between different absorption systems. By\nconducting photoionization modeling with CLOUDY, we measure the total hydrogen\ncolumn densities, metallicities, and ionization parameters of these absorbers,\nwhich suggests the absorbers likely have sub-solar metallicities. A preliminary\nstatistical analysis demonstrates the shadowed clouds tend to have similar\nionization states comparing to the shadowing ones. Identification of one of the\nlargest line-locking webs implies that radiative acceleration plays an\nimportant role in sorting out cloud velocities in quasar outflows, and\nhighlights the need for more sophisticated theoretical models to explain its\nformation and evolution.",

Unlike existing approaches, KeTS analyzes the\nevolution of each client's updates and effectively segments malicious clients\nusing Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), even in the presence of benign outliers.\nWe thoroughly evaluate KeTS's performance against the six most effective model\npoisoning attacks (i.e., Trim-Attack, Krum-Attack, Min-Max attack, Min-Sum\nattack, and their variants) on four different datasets (i.e., MNIST,\nFashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and KDD-CUP-1999) and compare its performance with\nthree classical robust schemes (i.e., Krum, Trim-Mean, and Median) and a\nstate-of-the-art defense (i.e., FLTrust).

We first investigate centroid orbital\nevolution under the inclined angle perturbation that allows for ultra-sensitive\nangle distinguishment with arc-second resolution. We also show centroid ellipse\nevolution under spatial phase perturbation that enables geometric\ncharacterization of arbitrary OAM superpositions on modal Poincar\\'e spheres.\nFurthermore, based on the angle subdivision of centroid orbiting, we\ndemonstrate the environmentally robust nanoscale displacement measurement with\npolarization synchronous detection, and particularly the high-resolution, fast,\nand large-range linear movement monitoring using commercial four-quadrant\nphotodetectors. This novel centroid orbiting interferometry may open new\nopportunities to advance metrological technologies beyond the conventional\ninterferometers.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic linking is the standard mechanism for using external dependencies\nsince it enables code reuse, streamlines software updates, and reduces\ndisk/network use. Dynamic linking waits until runtime to calculate an\napplication's relocation mapping, i.e., the mapping between each externally\nreferenced symbol in the application to the dependency that provides the\nsymbol. Unfortunately, it comes with two downsides. First, dynamic linking\nlimits the performance of current systems since it can take seconds to\ncalculate a relocation mapping for a large program. Second, dynamic linking\nlimits the dependency management of applications since it prevents a developer\nfrom accurately observing a relocation mapping except at runtime.\n  This paper makes the key insight that the benefits conventionally attributed\nto dynamic linking: code reuse, streamlined software updates, and reduced\ndisk/network use are actually benefits of shared libraries. Thus, we present\nstable linking, a new mechanism for using dependencies that uses shared\nlibraries to retain their benefits but eliminates the downsides of dynamic\nlinking. Stable linking separates a system's state into management times; when\nthe system can be modified, and epochs when it cannot. Stable linking\ncalculates each application's relocation mapping at the beginning of each\nepoch, allows developers to inspect the relocation mapping during the epoch,\nand reuses the mapping for subsequent executions in the epoch. We design and\nbuild MatR, the first stable linker. We use MatR in three workloads and show\nthat it improves upon dynamic linking performance by a factor of 2.19 on\naverage. Additionally, we use the system in three vignettes, or case-studies,\nthat illustrate the system's improvements to dependency management.",

Although\nsome baseline methods are capable of 3D-aware generation, the quality of the\ngenerated images still lags behind state-of-the-art 2D generation approaches,\nwhich excel in producing high-quality, detailed images.

    "abstract": "Multimodal models are trained on large-scale web-crawled datasets, which\noften contain noise, bias, and irrelevant information. This motivates the use\nof data selection techniques, which can be divided into model-free variants,\nrelying on heuristic rules and downstream datasets, and model-based approaches,\nsuch as those using influence functions. The former can be expensive to design\nand risks introducing unwanted dataset dependencies, while the latter are often\ncomputationally prohibitive. In this work, we propose an efficient, model-based\napproach using the Mimic Score, a new data-quality metric that leverages the\nweights of a reference model to assess the usefulness of individual samples for\ntraining a new model. Our method relies on measuring alignments between\ntraining gradients and a target direction induced by this reference model.\nBuilding on the derived mimic scores, we develop Grad-Mimic: a framework that\nprioritizes samples to learn, estimates overall sample utility, and creates\neffective filters. Empirically, using mimic scores to guide training improves\ndata efficiency, accelerates convergence, yields consistent performance gains\nacross six image datasets, and enhances CLIP models with 20.7% fewer training\nsteps. Moreover, mimic score-based filters complement existing filtering\nmethods, e.g., training improved CLIP models with 4.7 million fewer samples\nwhile offering accurate estimation of dataset quality.",

The results demonstrate that a dynamic strategy,\nwhich forms a portfolio based on perfect knowledge of the dependence structure\nand full market information over time, may not grow at a higher rate infinitely\noften than a constant strategy, which remains invariant over time.\nSpecifically, if the market is stationary, implying that the dependence\nstructure is statistically stable, the growth rate of an optimal dynamic\nstrategy, utilizing the maximum capacity of the entire market information,\nalmost surely decays over time into an equilibrium state, asymptotically\nconverging to the growth rate of a constant strategy.\n  Technically, this work reassesses the common belief that a constant strategy\nonly attains the optimal limiting growth rate of dynamic strategies when the\nmarket process is identically and independently distributed. By analyzing the\ndynamic log-optimal portfolio strategy as the optimal benchmark in a stationary\nmarket with side information, we show that a random optimal constant strategy\nalmost surely exists, even when a limiting growth rate for the dynamic strategy\ndoes not. Consequently, two approaches to learning algorithms for portfolio\nconstruction are discussed, demonstrating the safety of removing side\ninformation from the learning process while still guaranteeing an asymptotic\ngrowth rate comparable to that of the optimal dynamic strategy.",

To understand the\nimpact of the hairy parameter on black holes, we have studied the event horizon\nradius $r_{h} $, the photon sphere radius $r_{ph}$ and the radius of the\ninnermost stable circular orbit $r_{isco}$ of this hairy black hole. Then, we\nutilized the backward ray-tracing method to analyze the geodesics of photons\naround this black hole and discussed the influence of the hairy parameter on\nthe photon geodesics. In addition, we also calculated the unique shadow and\nphoton ring of the black hole irradiated by a static thin accretion disk with\nthree toy model emission functions. The research results show that as the hairy\nparameter gradually increases, the event horizon radius $r_{h} $, the photon\nsphere radius $r_{ph}$, the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit\n$r_{isco}$ and the critical impact parameter $b_{ph}$ of the black hole all\nexhibit a decreasing trend. Meanwhile, it also causes the area of the black\nhole shadow and the photon ring to decrease accordingly. Consequently, in the\ncase of the static and spherically symmetric standard Einstein Maxwell\npower-Yang-Mills hairy black hole, there is no degeneracy in the photon ring\nand the shadow.

Prior\nresearch works addressing noisy labels tend to make class-dependent\nassumptions, overlooking the pixel-dependent nature of most noisy labels.\nFurthermore, existing methods typically apply fixed thresholds to filter out\nnoisy labels, risking the removal of minority classes and consequently\ndegrading segmentation performance. To bridge these gaps, our proposed\nframework, Collaborative Learning with Curriculum Selection (CLCS), addresses\npixel-dependent noisy labels with class imbalance. CLCS advances the existing\nworks by i) treating noisy labels as pixel-dependent and addressing them\nthrough a collaborative learning framework, and ii) employing a curriculum\ndynamic thresholding approach adapting to model learning progress to select\nclean data samples to mitigate the class imbalance issue, and iii) applying a\nnoise balance loss to noisy data samples to improve data utilization instead of\ndiscarding them outright. Specifically, our CLCS contains two modules:\nCurriculum Noisy Label Sample Selection (CNS) and Noise Balance Loss (NBL). In\nthe CNS module, we designed a two-branch network with discrepancy loss for\ncollaborative learning so that different feature representations of the same\ninstance could be extracted from distinct views and used to vote the class\nprobabilities of pixels. Besides, a curriculum dynamic threshold is adopted to\nselect clean-label samples through probability voting.

    "abstract": "Unlike neutrinos and photons arriving from extra-galactic sources, ultra-high\nenergy cosmic rays (UHECRs) do not trace back to their origins due to\npropagation effects such as magnetic deflections and energy losses. For ankle\nenergies, UHECRs can propagate for hundreds of megaparsecs with negligible\nenergy losses but the directional information is lost after a few megaparsecs.\nOn the other hand, at the highest energies the directions are kept for larger\ndistances due to the increased rigidity but the interaction rates with the\ncosmic microwave background strongly suppress the cosmic rays within a few to\ntens of megaparsecs. Therefore, UHECRs with energies $E > 10^{20}$ eV\n(extreme-energy cosmic rays (ExECRs)) such as the Amaterasu event recently\nreported by Telescope Array, are of particular interest to identify the sources\nwithin our galactic neighborhood. However, photonuclear interactions are\nstochastic in nature and produce changes in the nuclear species emitted, which\nmakes it difficult the task of estimating the likelihood distribution of its\norigin. This work discusses a novel procedure to estimate the likelihood of the\norigin for extreme-energy cosmic rays based on probability distributions for\nUHECR stochastic interactions. The method is applied to the Amaterasu event and\ncompared to recently published works which employ Monte Carlo codes (e.g.\nCRPropa) in their analysis. The advantages of the method presented here are\ndemonstrated by the increased resolution and the ease of computation unlike\nother approaches employed so far. The results presented indicate that the\nlocalization of the origin of extreme energy cosmic rays could be possible in\nsome cases without knowledge of the original composition.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop an ideal structure theory for the class of left\nreductive regular semigroups and apply it to several subclasses of popular\ninterest. In these classes, we observe that the right ideal structure of the\nsemigroup is `embedded' inside the left ideal one, and so we can construct\nthese semigroups starting with only one object (unlike in other more general\ncases). To this end, we introduce an upgraded version of the Nambooripad's\nnormal category \\cite{cross} as our building block, which we call a\n\\emph{connected category}.\n  The main theorem of the paper describes a category equivalence between the\ncategory of left reductive regular semigroups and the category of {connected\ncategories}. Then, we specialise our result to describe constructions of\n$\\gl$-unipotent semigroups, right regular bands, inverse semigroups and\narbitrary regular monoids. Exploiting the left-right duality of semigroups, we\nalso construct right reductive regular semigroups and use that to describe the\nmore particular subclasses of $\\gr$-unipotent semigroups and left regular\nbands. Finally, we provide concrete (and rather simple) descriptions to the\nconnected categories that arise from finite transformation semigroups, linear\ntransformation semigroups (over a finite dimensional vector space) and\nsymmetric inverse monoids.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the causal impact of being placed on the Dean's List, a\npositive education incentive, on future student performance using a regression\ndiscontinuity design. The results suggest that for students with low prior\nacademic performance and who are native English speakers, there is a positive\nimpact of being on the Dean's List on the probability of getting onto the\nDean's List in the following year. However, being on the Dean's List does not\nappear to have a statistically significant effect on subsequent GPA, total\ncredits taken, dropout rates, or the probability of graduating within four\nyears. These findings suggest that a place on the Dean's List may not be a\nstrong motivator for students to improve their academic performance and achieve\nbetter outcomes.",
